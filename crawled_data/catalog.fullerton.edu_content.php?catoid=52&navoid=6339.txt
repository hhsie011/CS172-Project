Messages and their delivery systems may change with the development of new technologies, but the need for trained communicators to gather, synthesize, verify and disseminate that information remains constant. Training these communication professionals is the mission of the College of Communications. Academic programs in the College cover the full gamut of communications. Four departments deliver a comprehensive curriculum: Cinema and Television Arts; Communication Sciences and Disorders; Communications; and Human Communication Studies. These degree programs prepare students to work in all areas of communications and related fields in business, education, entertainment, government, health care, nonprofit, for profit and more. Co-curricular opportunities offer additional immersive experiences, such as Comm Week, the Latino Communications Institute, the award-winning Daily Titan newspaper and Tusk magazine, Titan TV and Radio, OC News, Al Día, the PRactical ADvantage agency, forensics and debate, the speech and hearing clinic, professional internships, study abroad and a host of clubs and other activities.
