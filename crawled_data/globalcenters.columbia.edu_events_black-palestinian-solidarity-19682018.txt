8:00 PM Wood Auditorium, Avery Hall, 1172 Amsterdam Avenue New York, NY, 10027 United States The late 1960s saw the emergence of a militant Black-Palestinian solidarity, epitomized by the meeting between members of the Black Panthers and members of the Palestinian Liberation Movement at the Pan-African Cultural Festival in Algiers in 1969. Fueled by anti-imperialism, they saw their struggles as revolutionary, militant, and internationalist. Fifty years on, new forms of solidarity and new politics on the ground have emerged. How should we understand these solidarities across different historical moments, sites, and racial formations?
