This change will affect in-state travel for Iowa State University as well as the other Regents institutions. If your lodging provider is not certified, and state funding is being utilized, you will not be reimbursed for your expenses from that provider. Travelers should check with https://stophtiowa.org/certified-locations before booking travel arrangements. If your desired location is not listed on the website, please contact the location and request that they complete the training before your scheduled stay. COVID Response Iowa State University will return to pre-pandemic policies and practices for domestic travel effective January 1st, 2022. Travelers will be encouraged to adhere to CDC guidance for domestic travel. COVID exceptions previously granted would expire, with travel allowances and reimbursements returning to normal ISU travel policy guidelines.
