Thayer's PROFILE number is 3355. PROFILE will process your information and provide us with a Financial Need Analysis Report to determine need-based aid. Financial aid candidates must file as dependent and include parental information, except those who: are married have legal dependents other than a spouse are an orphan or a ward of the state have served in the military are currently serving on active duty in the Armed Forces (for something other than training purposes). Financial aid received for the first year does not necessarily carry over into the second year. Students planning to enroll in the MEng or MEM program, who will be at Thayer for more than one academic year, must re-file the PROFILE application. Application Details When filing the CSS PROFILE: BE applicants should indicate their year in college as "5th or more undergrad." MEng and MEM applicants should indicate their year in college as "1st-year grad/prof." Aid is need-based and partial tuition scholarships are capped. BE/MEM applicants should indicate their year in college as "5th or more undergrad." Candidates from Dartmouth who plan to work simultaneously on BE and MEM requirements should include parental information so that both BE and MEM level aid may be calculated. For the time a student is completing the BE requirements (generally 1 to 3 terms), Thayer will grant whichever aid is higher, BE or MEM.
