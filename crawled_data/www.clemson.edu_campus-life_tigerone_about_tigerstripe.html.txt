Clemson Home Campus Life TigerOne About the TigerOne ID Current: TigerStripe TigerStripe TigerStripe is a convenient, prepaid declining balance account that is applied on your TigerOne ID. Through the utilization of TigerStripe, cardholders can purchase various provisions on and off campus with their TigerOne ID without having to carry cash or other cards. There are no monthly fees or interest charges like a checking or credit card account, and your funds roll over from semester to semester. To make a purchase, simply present your TigerOne ID wherever the TigerOne ID is accepted and the amount of your purchase will be deducted from your account. Opening an Account To open an account, visit the Accounts Portal and select “Open Account” in the TigerStripe section. There is no daily limit on the number of purchases that may be made and debited; however, no debits or charges shall exceed the amount of deposited funds. The cardholder understands and agrees that the account cannot be used as a credit card or to obtain cash advances. The cardholder understands and agrees that the account is nontransferable. Deposits You can make deposits to your TigerStripe account online. Guest deposits can be made on behalf of the cardholder on the Guest Deposits Portal. You will need the cardholder’s CUID and username. Deposits can take up to 15 minutes to apply to the user account. Any TigerStripe funds added to your University bill will be downloaded automatically to your TigerStripe account at the beginning of the semester provided your optional fees are paid in full. Balances, Statements and Transaction History Balances, statements and transaction history can be obtained from the Accounts Portal. Cardholders can also view their balance in real time on their TigerOne Mobile ID in the Apple Wallet on Apple devices and in the Get Mobile app on Android devices. Employee Payroll Deduction For employees wishing to enroll in payroll deduction, please fill out the required documentation and send it to TigerOneCard@clemson.edu. Disputes About Purchases If you have a question about a particular transaction, we first recommend pulling a transaction history statement from the Accounts Portal. If you find that there has been a mistake in the charging of your account, contact the merchant of the charge. For on-campus dining merchants, you can contact Dining Services. Accepted Locations TigerStripe is available for use through all Grubhub locations nationwide, and our off-campus program is continually expanding. From burritos and burgers to produce and pizza, check out all of our TigerStripe supported merchants! Frequently Asked Questions Can I get cash off of my TigerStripe account? No, cash withdrawals from your TigerStripe account are not allowed. How do I close my TigerStripe account? You may receive the remaining funds off of your TigerStripe account only if you withdraw, transfer or graduate from the University. If you have graduated, withdrawn or transferred from the University, you are eligible for a refund of your remaining TigerStripe balance. Graduation refunds occur four to six weeks after graduation. Withdrawals occur once the official withdrawal form has been submitted to Clemson University. If you have a balance due to Clemson University, any refunded TigerStripe will be put against the balance you owe first. Once your account is closed, you will no longer receive the monthly TigerOne services reminder emails. How do I stop receiving the "TigerOne Card Services Monthly Reminder" emails? You are receiving TigerOne emails because you have an open or active TigerStripe account. To stop receiving these emails, send an email to tigeronecard@clemson.edu letting us know you would like to stop receiving notifications. What is the difference between TigerStripe and Paw Points? TigerStripe Paw Points Put it "All In" your TigerOne Card and go cashless. Make purchases at any dining location on campus. Carry funds forward from semester to semester; however, any open account will be closed after 18 months of inactivity. Manage your funds online at clemson.edu/tigerone. Receive a 5% discount on purchases of $100 or more and get an additional 5% discount during promotional periods per semester. Make purchases at participating off-campus locations, including restaurants, grocery stores and various other places. Make purchases at the Clemson University Bookstore to buy textbooks, school supplies and official Clemson University memorabilia. Pay for copies and printing at Clemson libraries through the CCIT PawPrints program. TigerStripe will carry over from semester to semester until the student withdraws, transfers or graduates from the University at which time they can request a refund. For Paw Points policies, please see the Dining Terms and Conditions. Does TigerStripe roll over from semester to semester? For students, TigerStripe accounts will remain open until – the student graduates, the student is no longer enrolled and becomes inactive, or – the student is disaffiliated with the university (i.e. official transfer or withdrawal). Any remaining balance will be applied to the student’s university bill. Any remaining balance in excess of the student's university bill will be refunded per University policy. I added funds to my TigerStripe account. When are they available for use? Any TigerStripe funds added to your University bill will be downloaded automatically to your TigerStripe account at the beginning of the semester provided your optional fees are paid in full. If the funds are not credited to your TigerStripe account by the first day of classes for that semester, then you will need to contact Student Financial Services at 864-656-5592 or studentbillquestions@clemson.edu. Funds added online will be available within 15 minutes of purchase. Why can't my parent acquire my account balance? According to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), we are unable to share information pertaining to accounts, balances and activities related to a cardholder. If the cardholder chooses to share that information with other individuals, (s)he may do so directly.
