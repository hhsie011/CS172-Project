As scholars of Asian societies, cultures, and languages, we are familiar with the long history of anti-Asian racism in the United States and are horrified by the recent sharp rise in violence against Asians, Asian Americans, and Pacific Islanders in this country. We condemn the racism and misogyny that underwrites and incites this violence. We stand in solidarity with our fellow scholars and students—especially those identifying as Asian and Asian American—who are bravely struggling to end racist violence and terror in America.
