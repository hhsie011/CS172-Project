General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR): a European Union (EU) data privacy regulation, effective May 25, 2018, protecting the personal data of EU subjects or others physically located in the EU which is collected by the college. Defamation: Someone may seek civil remedies if they can show that they were clearly identified as the subject of defamatory messages and suffered damages as a consequence. Truth is a defense against charges of defamation. Common law actions for invasion of privacy: Someone may seek civil remedies for invasion of privacy on several grounds. Public disclosure of private facts: the widespread disclosure of facts about a person, even when true, may be deemed harmful enough to justify a lawsuit. False light: a person wrongfully attributes views or characteristics to another person in ways that damage that person's reputation. Wrongful intrusion: the law often protects those areas of a person's life in which they can reasonably expect they will not be intruded upon.
