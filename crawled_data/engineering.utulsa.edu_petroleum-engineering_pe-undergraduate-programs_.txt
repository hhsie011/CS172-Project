Based on the solid fundamentals of math, physics and chemistry, a petroleum engineering degree includes education in geology and a proper blend of fluid and solid mechanics. Petroleum engineers plan and supervise drilling operations and evaluate and manage oil and natural gas reservoirs. They are qualified to work at an oil company, establish a consulting business or become an independent oil producer. Opportunities exist for travel and work overseas. While teaching is the major goal, the McDougall School of Petroleum Engineering is also committed to discovery of new concepts and technologies in drilling, production and reservoir engineering. The program offers B.S., M.S. and Ph.D. degrees. The B.S. degree program in petroleum engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET. The school’s strong research program is supported by industry and government sources. Undergraduate and graduate students work alongside faculty at key research locations on the main campus and TU’s historic North Campus. Program Educational Objectives Bachelor of Science Program Educational Objectives: Our graduates, within a few years of graduation, will: Be competent petroleum engineering professionals in their workplaces Pursue professional development by engaging in advanced studies or other educational activities Degree Options Petroleum Engineering, B.S.P.E. Prepares students for careers in the extraction of oil and gas from the ground, design equipment to harvest oil and gas, develop ways to increase well production and manage those wells and drilling sites. Petroleum Engineering Minor Students from other disciplines may minor in petroleum engineering.
