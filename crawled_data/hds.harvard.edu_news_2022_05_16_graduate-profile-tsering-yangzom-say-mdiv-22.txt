Message of Thanks The list of people who have inspired and carried me through these three years is too long to reproduce here. I can just say I have the deepest gratitude to Dr. Janet Gyatso, Dr. Todne Thomas, Dr. Christian Greer, and Dr. Karen King for their genius, compassion, and genuine interest in helping me and so many other students. I owe so much to my friends at this school, especially those who have been by me for all three years. Learning and growing with them, and witnessing their kindness, wit, endless curiosity, and loving-kindness has been an enormous honor.
