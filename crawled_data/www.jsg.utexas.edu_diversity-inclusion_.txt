Our commitment is rooted in the belief that the geosciences, and all other academic and intellectual pursuits, are stronger when they are inclusive of people with diverse backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. Therefore, we strongly believe that increasing the diversity of the Jackson School’s faculty, workforce, student body and educational programs is critical to meeting and maintaining the high academic and research standards that we hold ourselves to, and that are expected of a world-class geosciences institution. We are committed to being a welcoming place where students, faculty, scientists, and staff of all cultures, races and ethnicities, genders, political and religious beliefs, physical and learning differences, and sexual orientations and identities, can thrive. Building a diverse and welcoming environment is an integral part of achieving our goals of educating the geosciences leaders of tomorrow and conducting impactful research that can help solve many of society’s greatest challenges.

The school’s efforts in justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion are aimed at overcoming a longstanding challenge in the geosciences, which are among the least racially diverse of all the STEM disciplines, according to data on degrees earned at U.S. universities collected by the National Science Foundation. The Jackson School has programs to address the issue at every level. These include programs to introduce and teach the geosciences to minority and underserved high school students; to help those students pursue a college education; and to help undergraduate and graduate students succeed at the Jackson School and beyond A selection of the Jackson School’s many efforts to address these issues (see more at Programs & Opportunities): GeoFORCE Texas A nationally recognized outreach program that introduces students from underserved areas of the state to the geosciences by taking them on field trips each summer throughout high school to visit geologically significant sites across the country. Read More Geoscience Ambassadors An outreach program that seeks to cultivate a larger and more diverse geoscience community by helping geoscience students, especially those from underrepresented backgrounds, reflect on their own path to the geosciences and present their personal stories to young people and others in their home communities. Read More Geoscience Empowerment Network (GEN) A Jackson School-sponsored organization dedicated to increasing diversity among the students, faculty, researchers and staff members at the the Jackson School so that the community more closely resembles the diversity found in Texas. Strategies include: mentorship; community building; professional and personal development; advocating for change; and promoting diverse voices in geosciences.
