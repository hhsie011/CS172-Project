As one of his first orders of business, he dealt decisively with the issue of student unruliness by declaring that instructors must occupy rooms on campus. A strong advocate of broadening the scope of study in higher education, he was the author of Brown’s first “new curriculum” in 1850, which recommended that “every student might study what he chose, all that he chose, and nothing but what he chose.” Brown University Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA Phone: 401-863-1000 Maps & Directions / Contact Us © Brown University X
