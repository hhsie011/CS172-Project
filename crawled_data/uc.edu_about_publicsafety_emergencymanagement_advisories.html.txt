Users can sign up to receive text message and email with safety alert information that may impact UC campuses and nearby areas depending upon the nature of an emergency or event. The department also sends Clery notifications via email to current UC students and employees. Those emails include "UC Aware" messages, which provide advisory information about a non-immediate risk situation, and "UC Safety Alert" messages, which provide timely information about an ongoing situation. When an event is currently occuring and imminently threatening the campus, Public Safety will send out an emergency notification via text message, email, website, electronic signage board, Twitter (@UCPublicSafety) and audio system. When events of significant local interest occur that may be of concern to the UC community, but are not a continuing threat to campus, they will be posted to the Bearcat Notifications page. The page also includes any "UC Aware," "UC Safety Alert" and emergency notifications that are sent out. The university's emergency plans and emergency procedures are available online. UC students, faculty and staff are auto-enrolled in Rave Alert via the Catalyst and UC Directory systems. Those outside of the university, including parents of current students, can sign up per the directions below. In addition, those who use the Bearcat Guardian app can receive safety notifications through the app. Sign up to Receive Advisories: To sign up to receive alerts from Rave, visit Rave's website and click "register."
