About Us About Us Professional Education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE) serves more than 18,000 educators around the world each year through a robust portfolio of 100 programs for early childhood, K-12, and higher education professionals. Who We Are A vital part of the HGSE community, we aspire to provide transformative adult learning experiences by bringing together diverse professionals, connecting them with each other and with HGSE’s leading faculty and research, and engaging them in important problems of practice. Our team of professionals and educators is grounded in our core values and driven by HGSE’s mission: to prepare leaders in education and to improve student opportunity, achievement, and success. What We Believe We believe that through exceptional professional education that is responsive and relevant to the challenges practitioners face, we can equip and empower educators and institutions around the world to improve their practice in service of their students, schools, and communities. Through transformative adult learning, we elevate student learning. What We Do At HGSE, we are committed to three strategic priorities: 1) Cultivating Innovators and Leaders, 2) Collaborating on Questions that Matter, and 3) Communicating with the Field. Chaired by HGSE faculty and grounded in the latest research, our Professional Education programs are designed to make a direct impact on the practice of education professionals, the work of schools and institutions, and the lives and learning of students. We offer on-campus, online, and custom programs for: Higher Education Professionals: The Harvard Institutes for Higher Education offers a vibrant portfolio of leadership development programs designed for higher education administrators-from directors, department heads, and deans, to vice presidents, provosts, and presidents. K-12 Educators: HGSE’s K-12 Professional Education programs are crafted for a broad cross section of stakeholders and include portfolios for district and systems-level leaders, current and aspiring school leaders, and teachers and instructional leaders. Early Childhood Educators: The Zaentz Professional Learning Academy is designed to support the learning and development of early education leaders at all levels and in all settings in the mixed-delivery system—those influencing practice and policy from the schoolhouse to the state house.
