Any member of the Penn community can utilize this service by calling 215-898-HELP(4357). Calls will be answered 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by Division of Public Safety professionals trained in mental health referrals by staff from Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS). The HELP Line is part of the continuing steps that Penn is taking to expand mental health support for students and all members of the Penn community. It provides a single point of entry for information about how to get help with personal problems, whether your own or those of a student, partner, friend, or colleague. It also will enable callers to connect with resources and programs to promote health. Students who are dealing with the complex emotional challenges of university life can use the HELP Line to receive information and referrals to the many health and wellness resources at Penn, including CAPS, Student Health Service, Student Intervention Services, Public Safety, and others. They may also call on behalf of a friend or acquaintance. We encourage faculty and staff to be on alert for students who may be struggling with stress, anxiety, or depression. We hope you will bring the HELP Line to the attention of students, and use the number yourself whenever you need guidance on how best to offer support and assistance to a student in distress. For parents, partners, family members, or close friends, we urge you to remind students of the resources available to them, which are listed at the bottom of this page, and to notify the University (by calling the HELP Line) if you have any concerns about a student’s emotional health. Recommended by the Task Force on Student Psychological Health and Welfare, the HELP Line is one of the initiatives undertaken in recent months as part of our continuing efforts to support the emotional well-being of the Penn community. We will continue to implement further recommendations from the Task Force as they are developed. If you or someone you know needs help, please call the HELP Line at 215-898-HELP.
