Cranmer Associate Professor Office: 305A Daniel Hall Phone: Email: GCRANME@clemson.edu Educational Background Ph.D. Sport and Organizational Communication West Virginia University 2015 M.A. Communication Theory and Research West Virginia University 2012 B.A. Religious Studies West Virginia University 2011 Courses Taught Advanced Sports Communication Interpersonal and Family Communication & Sport Sport, Communication, and Society Survey of Sports Communication Quantitative Research Methods Communication Theory Profile Dr. Cranmer joined the Clemson family in 2016. He is a prolific scholar who is passionate about connecting research and application within the classroom. He seeks to blend Clemson's historical excellence as an undergraduate university with its Research-1 present/future. His notable service positions include: Secretary (2018-2020) and Vice-Chair (2021-2022) of the Communication & Sport Division of the National Communication Association, Chair of the Organizational Communication Interest Group for the Eastern Communication Association (2017), editorial board member for Communication & Sport (2019-Current) and Communication Research Reports (2019-Current), fellow of the Robert H. Brooks Sports science Institute (2017-current), and research fellow with the US Center for Mental Health & Sport. His campus service activities include serving as a faculty senator, on the CBSHS research committee (2018-Current), and as an advisor of the Lambda Pi Eta honor society (2016-2019). He also conducts professional consulting that is focused on fostering effective communication skills and assisting individuals in adjusting to new social groups and roles. In this capacity, he has worked with Clemson's Paw Journey and the Atlantic Coast Conference. Research Interests Dr. Cranmer has three ongoing programs of research. First, he seeks to understand how groups (i.e., sports teams and traditional organizations) can function more efficiently. He is especially concerned with the organizational processes that encompass individuals' socialization (i.e., adjustment to tasks and roles), the exchange of social and organizational resources, and the fostering of human development. Second, he considers the efficacy of concussion interventions and the role of health referents in the reporting of concussion symptoms. Third, he explores how external stakeholders make sense of and respond to the policies and practices of sports organizations and leagues. Research Publications Cranmer, G. A. (In press).
