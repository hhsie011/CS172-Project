May 2010: On the 400th anniversary of Galileo's invention of the telescope, Brian Keating spoke at UCSD's Cal-It2 event: "Galileo Between Science, Science Studies, and Science Fiction," along with authors Kim Stanley Robinson and Mario Biogioli. Keating describes his observations of the early universe made with a version of Galileo's refractor telescope, which is sensitive to radio-waves, instead of visible light. This telescope (BICEP), located in Antarctica, has made ultra-sensitive images of the afterglow of the Big Bang. He showed imsages of the early universe as well as observations of Jupiter made with a new UCSD telescope (POLARBEAR). Link to YouTube video. [Keating starts at 1h6m] 21 March 2010: "It’s not all relative when a nationally recognized physicist discusses two game changing geniuses of the 20th century.
