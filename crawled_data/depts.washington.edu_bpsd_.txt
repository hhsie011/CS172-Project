Our program focuses on the study of how the basic molecular components that provide the building blocks of biological systems work. Experimental techniques are now available that permit the quantitative study of a host of previously inaccessible issues about how proteins, nucleic acids and lipids work. In particular, the ability to manipulate and alter these essential biological components is rapidly advancing our understanding of their structure, the relationship between structure and function, and rules that permit the design of novel macromolecules. Continued progress in these areas demands an interdisciplinary approach, with input from both experiment and theory. Our aim is to train young scientists to work at the interface of physical and biological sciences. Our program offers a diverse set of research programs and promotes interdisciplinary work through strong interactions between labs in these different areas. The faculty are from diverse backgrounds, but all take a physical and quantitative approach to biological questions. Comments are closed.
