Salaries over the hiring range must be reviewed and approved by the department’s Senior Human Resources Business Partner. Salary-range structures are guidelines established to demonstrate the difference in the value to the University of different job levels. Salary ranges provide an orderly method of administering salaries to ensure that jobs of similar responsibility fall within the same grade, that new hires are paid competitively without conflicting with internal salary standards and, that salaries relate to demonstrated levels of performance.
