Established in 1938 by Dartmouth Professor Herbert Falkner West, the Friends of the Library have been a source of enrichment to our resources ever since. Our Friends regularly enjoy lectures and other programming that highlights the research nurtured by the rich holdings of the Dartmouth Library. All Friends events are free and open to the Public. At a time when university libraries everywhere—including at Dartmouth—are rapidly evolving due to emerging technologies, you can help continue a tradition that fosters the stewardship of information and the love of learning in all its forms. The Library's Book Arts Workshop is a particularly enriching program, which offers hands-on learning experiences in a creative environment.
