Postdoctoral scholars comprise a vital and significant part of the academic community. The purpose of the DCPDA is to give each and every postdoc an opportunity to succeed according to their individual wants and needs, whether it is to increase their network, participate in social activities, or benefit from the training/career enhancement seminars the association will plan and/or sponsor. The DCPDA offers a diverse and inclusive organization for postdocs with different perspectives and unique ways of thinking to cultivate a community of connectedness and enable each individual member to thrive. Equipping postdocs with the tools needed to find and obtain satisfying and fulfilling careers within or outside of academia is one of the goals of the DCPDA. The DCPDA advocates for Dartmouth Postdocs by fostering institutional recognition of 1) postdocs as a group associated with the College and 2) of our individual training and professional development needs. We play a critical role in creating a centralized resource for all postdocs to find personal, professional and career resources needed to succeed in their endeavors.
