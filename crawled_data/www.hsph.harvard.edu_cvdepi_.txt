Chan School of Public Health, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Beth lsrael Deaconess Medical Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Framingham Study, and other sites. By means of Forums and other activities, the Program “expands the hallway” for those critical hallway discussions that often result in the most interesting and scientifically promising collaborations, mentorships, grant proposals, and projects. In addition to research synergy and grant successes, the Program facilitates sharing and expansion of mentoring and fellow training, didactic training in cardiovascular epidemiology, and coordination of external collaborations related to cardiovascular epidemiology. Program members’ interests include nutrition, pharmacoepidemiology, aging, women’s health, genetics, basic science, biostatistics, policy and risk analysis, social and environmental epidemiology, international health, pediatrics, and methods. We welcome you to explore the Program’s many and diverse strengths in cardiovascular epidemiology research.
