Long Term Ecological Research Program The Harvard Forest Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) program is part of a national network of long-term ecological research sites. Within this framework we examine ecological dynamics in the New England region resulting from natural disturbances, environmental change, and human impacts. Emphasis is on processes including: Pattern and process in dynamic forest ecosystems Climatic change and variability Invasive forest insects the modern land-use regime interacting global change drivers An interdisciplinary group of PI scientists, post-doctoral fellows, and graduate students from many parts of Harvard and other institutions use three complementary approaches to long-term study: historical studies of past conditions and dynamics intensive measurements of current structure and function measurements of integrated ecosystem response to experimental manipulations under relatively controlled conditions Long-term studies span a broad range of spatial and temporal scales and seek to: develop societally relevant scientific data and information train a diverse next generation of researchers, beginning with K-12 and undergraduate students develop databases with broad relevance to fundamental ecological issues broaden public impacts by engaging the arts and humanities, conservation and policy Learn more by exploring abstracts from our annual LTER symposium or watching a 2020 documentary by Amy Li (Harvard '20) featuring 30 years of the Harvard Forest LTER Program.
