The continent boasts an abundance of both cultural and natural resources and is home to some of the fastest growing economies in the world, making Africa a fascinating place to study. Announcements Professor Leonard Wantchekon is the focus of the Yale Economic Growth Center's podcast Voices in Development. Professor Wantchekon’s career in development economics was shaped in part by his experience as a pro-democracy student activist under a military regime in Benin in the 1970s and 80s. Since then, he has made ground-breaking research contributions on topics as diverse as education and human capital externalities, public deliberation and clientelism, and the slave trade’s impact on trust in West Africa. Media coverage of his research has appeared in Financial Times, New York Times, Los Angeles Times, The Economist and BBC, among others. LISTEN The podcast was inspired by Professor Wantchekon keynote address of the 31st Annual Kuznets Memorial Lecture, “Political Distortions and Economic Development” on March 31 2022.
