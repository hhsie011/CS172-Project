Get Help Report issues or Give Feedback Schedule Training or Consultation Testing for Accessibility Testing for accessibility can happen at any stage of a site or application's lifecycle. Accessibility testing is a combination of automated and manual evaluation. Automated tools can only pick up 40% or less of accessibility errors without human evaluation (source). Manual testing, in conjunction with automated testing, is a must. Penn uses Pope Tech as our accessibility compliance monitoring platform. Pope Tech is built off of the same engine as the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) WAVE evaluation tool. WAVE is a free industry standard tool that can be used to validate the accessibility of a page’s structure, content, and the contrast of colors used in a design. Need Pope Tech access?
