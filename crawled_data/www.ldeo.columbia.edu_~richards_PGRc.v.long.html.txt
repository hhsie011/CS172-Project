Also, there is a mistaken sentence on the first page---about North Korea having a significant amount of weapons grade uranium---which was introduced by an editor after I had checked the page proofs!

PDF (6.3M) RESEARCH SUMMARY In general: Interests in quantitative seismology including development and application of theoretical (“synthetic”) seismograms to the interpretation of observations; and improvements in methods to characterize seismicity (better detections, and better estimation of locations, moment tensors, and fault orientation and slip). Interests in seismic monitoring for nuclear explosions, and in the development of precision methods applied to large waveform archives for broad improvements in bulletins of seismicity. My focus from 1965 to 2000 was largely on “theoretical seismology.” Subsequently it has been on empirical methods of seismogram analysis, especially in efforts to achieve factors of 10- or a 100-fold improvement in the precision with which we can determine the relative locations of earthquakes occurring in the same general region. More specifically: Investigation of micro-earthquakes along the San Andreas; techniques of digital data analysis; theoretical study of diffraction phenomena in model experiments; use of potentials for elastic displacement in heterogeneous media; study of body waves near the Earth's core shadow boundary — their amplitudes, dispersion, and effective shadow shift; study of elastic wave propagation in spherically symmetric media; calculation of reflection coefficients for various heterogeneities, and deductions (from published data on precursors to P'P') for structure in the upper mantle; use of Cagniard-de Hoop methods, for moving sources, to study ocean-bottom earthquakes; representation theorems for the solution of motion due to faulting in a heterogeneous elastic medium; development of elastic wave solutions in media with second-order discontinuities; derivation and evaluation of an exact solution for dynamic effects of a growing elliptical shear crack, for which shear stress is a constant times the normal stress; relations between particle velocity on a fault surface, and stress drop; calculation of frequency-dependent effects in body waves passing through the Earth's core, and deductions for structure in the lowermost mantle; source theory for earthquakes; tunneling of seismic body waves; demonstration, from data on the Blue Mountain Lake swarm of 1971, that the P-wave velocity is fluctuating more than the S-wave velocity, and in a manner suggesting control by dilatancy; analysis of reflection seismograms, with relevance to prospecting; investigation of temperature rise, on a fault surface undergoing earthquake motions; derivation of a closed-form analytic solution for the surface of a half-space subjected to a surface force; determination of the slip function for faulting in a medium with given distribution of initial stress and strength; computation of seismic waves in media composed of inhomogeneous layers, with a correct account of the effects of attenuation; consistency checks, on measurements of Earth strain; analysis of the apparent Q resulting from scattering when a seismic wave propagates many wavelengths through a medium with inhomogeneity on all spatial scales; estimation of station magnitude bias; numerical methods (especially the pseudo-spectral method) for studying elastic and anelastic wave propagation in 3-D; analytical methods for seismic wave propagation in 3-D structures composed of homogeneous layers with randomly-dipping planar interfaces; seismic methods for studying underground nuclear explosions (detection capability and yield estimation); Earth noise at high frequency; study of charge sizes and size distribution of chemical explosions; discrimination between large chemical and small nuclear explosions; tectonic release from underground nuclear explosions; stability of RMS Lg amplitudes, and their use for estimating yields of underground explosions; asymptotic structure of normal modes, using uniform asymptotic theory; earthquakes induced by nuclear explosions, in the context of on-site inspection of a suspicious event under a CTBT; studies of small earthquakes and small explosions at the Semipalatinsk Test Site, Kazakhstan; uses of spectral ratios to discriminate between small earthquakes and small explosions from signals recorded at regional distances; interpretation of far-field and intermediate-field P-waves from deep earthquakes; "near-field" deformation seen in broadband seismograms; discovery of seismological evidence for differential rotation of the Earth's inner core; empirical methods to improve estimates of event location using ground truth data to obtain corrected regional travel times; uses of earthquake and explosion doublets for precision studies of inner core rotation and evaluation of catalog precision. Modern methods of seismic event location applied on a broad area scale, with examples from continental East Asia. Studies of underground nuclear test explosions in North Korea, including analysis of small seismic events in that region which are either naturally-occurring earthquakes, or explosions-induced earthquakes. Studies of efforts needed to preserve, and make usable and thus amenable to analysis with modern methods, the archives of analog seismograms, acquired in the pre-digital era.
