Int-School Freshman Moot Court Freshman Moot Court Competition 2010 Winners: Brigid Welsh and Brooke Stevens The Freshman Moot Court problem asked students to deal with First Amendment issues in the context of student speech at school. A student wrote an article for the school newspaper advocating the legalization of marijuana for medicinal purposes. The school principal pulled this students article from the school paper but allowed the opposing view's article to run in the school paper. The principal suspended the student for wearing a t-shirt advocating the same proposition. The two issues were: (1) Whether the First Amendment allows public schools to regulate student speech in a non-viewpoint neutral manner?, and (2) Whether content and viewpoint neutral regulations of student speech are governed by the standard set forth in Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, 393 U.S. 503 (1969)?
