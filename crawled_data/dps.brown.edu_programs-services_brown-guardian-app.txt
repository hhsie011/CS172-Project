If possible, you should provide detailed location information via text or voice. This will enable public safety personnel to reach you more quickly. To maximize the full benefit of this service, your user profile should contain a current photo and accurate self-description. The more information you provide in your profile, the easier it will be for DPS to locate you if necessary. Any information in your personal profile will only be viewable by DPS if you make an emergency call, send an emergency tip or if your safety timer session expires without being deactivated. Personal profile information will be treated as confidential information. When using the safety timer, it is strongly recommended that you provide detailed information about where you are headed under ‘Status’. You can update this status as you travel with new information. This information will greatly facilitate any necessary response actions coordinated by DPS. If your timer expires, DPS will call you to verify your safety. If you are in duress upon receiving a call back from DPS personnel, simply provide a pin number one number above your actual code when prompted to recite your PIN.
