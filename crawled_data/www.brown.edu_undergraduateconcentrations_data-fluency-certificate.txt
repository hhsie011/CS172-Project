The Certificate in Data Fluency provides a curricular structure to undergraduates in concentrations other than applied math, computer science, math, and statistics who wish to gain fluency and facility with the tools of data analysis and its conceptual framework: the driving intellectual question is how we can infer meaning from data whilst avoiding false predictions. The required experiential learning component provides students with the opportunity to apply their data-science skills in their concentration, engage in research that uses data science, teach data science as an undergraduate teaching assistant, or undertake an internship that has a substantive data-science component.
