Requirements are intentionally broad and flexible to accommodate the focused interests of students in understanding the diverse reality of this region. LACA features a wide selection of courses from departments across the university. For example, a student whose primary interest is the Caribbean might follow a course sequence that looks like this. We also have an engaged option. Concentration requirements include four themes: language, area studies, research, and internship/service work. The degree can also be obtained with honors. The department also allows students to pursue the Engaged Scholars Program. The Engaged Scholars Program (ESP) in Latin American and Caribbean Studies (LACA) is designed for LACA concentrators who are especially interested in making deeper connections between their academic work and local communities in Providence and beyond. Engaged Scholars combine hands-on experiences such as internships, public service, humanitarian, and development work with their academic learning in order to develop a deeper understanding of, and appreciation for, social engagement. For more information, please open the Undergraduate Program Padlet or contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies, Erica Durante, erica_durante@brown.edu. Professor Durante will hold office hours via Zoom during the fall 2021 semester (link). Meet our concentrators!
