That is how we can solve the hardest problems facing Texas, our country and the world. It is also how we can best enable our students to learn, develop and lead while they are on our campus, in their careers and throughout their lives. But it goes even deeper than that. Our university has made great strides in its commitment to diversity and inclusion in recent years, but we have much more progress to make. Our goal is to create an environment on the Forty Acres where all community members — students, faculty and staff — are empowered to be true to themselves, to participate fully in our vibrant university and to thrive as individuals. We won’t rest until we reach that goal.” — Jay Hartzell, President Features Explore More » Celebrating AAPI Heritage Month A Q&A with AAAFSA member Savneet Bains Celebrating Our Spring Graduates Meet Armin Panjvani (Psychology, '22) More Than A Monolith ‘The Blanket Identity’ film project emphasizes passions, individuality among AAPI community Q&A: Celebrating AAPI Heritage Month Meet Justin Samuel, Member of the Asian/Asian American Faculty/Staff Association 110 Inner Campus Drive Austin, Texas, 78712 512-471-3212 Subscribe Sign up for our mailing list to get newsletters and event invitations.
