Sciences, MS Comparative Biomedical Sciences, PhD Veterinary Medicine, DVM Home/ College of Engineering, Architecture and Technology/ Industrial Engineering and Management Industrial Engineering and Management Overview Courses Undergraduate Programs Graduate Programs Minors Faculty Industrial engineering and management focuses on production systems that produce goods or provide services for customers. Industrial engineers define, design, build, operate and improve production processes that convert resources to high quality products or services effectively, efficiently and safely. People are the fundamental component of production systems. People provide the creativity and leadership essential to make things happen. Hence, industrial engineering is the most people-oriented discipline within the engineering family. Industrial engineers are trained to think in both broad and specific terms. Practicing industrial engineers understand business parameters as well as physical and social parameters within production systems. This breadth allows industrial engineers to function effectively in a wide spectrum of activities ranging from strategic business planning to detailed task design. The wide-angle vision of industrial engineering provides career flexibility, leading to high-level leadership or specialized technical responsibilities. Industrial engineers are employed in manufacturing organizations (e.g., automotive, electronics, food, and medical manufacturers), service enterprises (e.g., airlines, banks, consulting groups, hospitals, retail companies, theme parks, transportation companies, warehouses) and governmental organizations (e.g., public service and regulatory organizations). Vision To inspire and empower our students to become leaders in a wide variety of industries, improve the quality of life for humankind, and change the world for the better, by making societal systems diverse, effective, efficient, and sustainable. Mission Continuously and aggressively advance educational and research processes which will attract students who fulfill our vision. Core Values Faculty, students and staff work together to build and maintain a learning/mentoring environment where: Innovative practices are developed, tested and validated. Knowledge and practices are shared. Each individual develops to his/her full potential. Professional ethics are practiced at all times. Educational Objectives and Outcomes Within a few years after graduation, Industrial Engineering program graduates will become professionals, managers or leaders in a wide variety of industries and apply discovery, problem-solving, leadership and management skills for the benefit of their organization and society at large.

The IEM program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, https://www.abet.org. Each IEM student, along with the faculty advisor, develops an individual plan of study that guides the student through the curriculum. Coursework is sequenced and interrelated to provide theoretical and applied knowledge, along with hands-on laboratory and project experience. Students work as individuals and as teams to integrate and apply mathematical, scientific, and engineering knowledge and concepts in order to address both traditional academic questions as well as open-ended design and analysis challenges. Instruction in experimental methods is integrated in the curriculum through the design, execution, analysis and interpretation of experiments. Project work is used to develop both technical and communications skills. Technical skills are used to identify, formulate and address engineering problems, both simple and complex. Communications skills are developed and practiced in written, oral and team interaction formats. The means to define and design detailed solutions to address customer needs from a system-wide perspective is introduced in the sophomore year, and reinforced through the capstone senior design project. Additionally, global perspectives or production systems are introduced and emphasized in the sophomore year so that students understand the nature of global customer bases as well as global competition early in their studies. The curriculum is continually updated to assure that contemporary issues, thinking and tools are integrated in course content as well as instructional delivery. Professional responsibility and ethical behavior are introduced and reinforced throughout the curriculum. Additionally, the need for life-long learning after graduation is stressed. Students are offered opportunities to enhance their classroom and laboratory experiences through student organizations such as the student chapter of APICS, the Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers, the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences, and the American Society for Quality.

The Master of Science degree is characterized by a higher degree of technical specialization in a particular field of study (beyond a BS degree). This degree program is designed to prepare students for professional practice that may include research or consulting components. The Master of Science degree is especially attractive to industrial engineering graduates, engineering graduates from other disciplines, and many science majors. The MS degree includes a strong technical component and an orientation to business and engineering management that is complementary to a technical background. The Doctor of Philosophy degree is designed to position the student on the leading edge of knowledge in the profession of industrial engineering and engineering management. It is intended to prepare students for highly specialized positions, such as research and consulting in industry, government and service organizations, and for teaching or research positions in colleges and universities. The basic consideration in graduate education in industrial engineering and management is effective and efficient utilization of human, physical and economic resources. Instruction in management embraces both qualitative and quantitative concepts, including analytical methodologies and social considerations pertinent to organizations. Advanced degree programs are designed with major emphasis in fields of interest such as engineering management, manufacturing systems, operations research, quality and reliability, facilities and energy-management, and enterprise systems and supply chains. Students may complement industrial engineering and management courses with work in other branches of engineering, as well as economics, business administration, computer science, statistics, mathematics, psychology, and sociology. Admission Requirements Admission to the Graduate College is required of all students pursuing the MS or PhD degree. Graduation from an industrial engineering curriculum with scholastic performance distinctly above average qualifies the student for admission to the School of Industrial Engineering and Management as a candidate for the master’s and doctorate degrees. Graduates from related disciplines may be admitted if an evaluation of their transcripts and other supporting materials by the School of Industrial Engineering and Management indicates that they are prepared to take graduate-level course work in industrial engineering, or can be expected to do so after a reasonable amount of prerequisite work. All applicants must submit GRE scores. In addition, the Graduate College may require certain international applicants to submit TOEFL scores. Degree Requirements The Master of Science degree in industrial engineering and management may be earned by one of two plans as follows: Plan I—coursework with thesis. Minimum 30 credit hours consisting of 24 hours of coursework and 6 hours of research with a grade of "SR." Plan II—coursework without thesis. Minimum of 33 credit hours. May include no more than three hours of independent study project. The Doctor of Philosophy degree requires the completion of at least 90 credit hours beyond the bachelor’s degree or 60 credit hours beyond the master’s degree; including a minimum of 18 credit hours of dissertation research and a minimum of 30 credit hours of course work beyond the master’s degree.
