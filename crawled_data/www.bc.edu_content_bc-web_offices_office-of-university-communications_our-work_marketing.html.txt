Our marketing team oversees priority projects for University partners from conception and planning through production and distribution. Marketing Highlights Core marketing print materials Promoting the Core Partnering with the Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences, OUC designed and implemented a campaign to promote first-year student enrollment in new interdisciplinary Core courses. To pique student interest, we developed info sheets, course brochures, guides for academic advisors, social media outreach initiatives, and videos highlighting the new courses. As a result, enrollments in core courses have grown steadily each year, with many of the courses being fully subscribed. Mindhunter University Communications worked with the Connell School of Nursing to plan an event featuring Professor Ann Burgess and retired FBI Special Agent John Douglas discussing real-life stories behind the hit Netflix drama Mindhunter. OUC launched an integrated marketing effort with e-invites, posters, and a social media campaign, all of which contributed to a sold-out Robsham Theater performance. BC’s Facebook page live-streamed the event and a video was posted on social media. End result? A showcase of a Connell professor’s pioneering work highlighted the school’s uniqueness. STM 10th Anniversary OUC partnered with the School of Theology and Ministry to promote the school's 10th anniversary. Our staff developed a logo to brand celebratory events, designed an Alumni Distinguished Service Award medal, refreshed the alumni newsletter to highlight special events and achievements, published stories and videos promoting the inaugural Daniel J. Harrington, S.J., Alumni Lecture, and live streamed best-selling Jesuit author and alumnus James Martin’s talk. The result was a dynamic multimedia effort that informed and inspired internal and external audiences.
