Despite the challenges of the pandemic, academics, research, and innovation have continued to flourish at Georgia Tech-Lorraine, demonstrating the resilience that has long been a hallmark of the community we have built over more than 30 years. We began in 1990 with an inaugural cohort of 8 intrepid graduate scholars in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Now, over 700 undergraduate and graduate students spend a semester or more on our campus each year. It is not just engineering students who come to Georgia Tech – in addition to STEM-focused coursework, students can participate in programs such as a French immersion program focused on sustainability or gain the confidence to launch their own company through Startup Lab, part one of Georgia Tech’s innovative CREATE-X program. This fall we welcomed an inaugural cohort of 40 first-year undergraduate students who are taking their Georgia Tech studies global with a semester on the Lorraine campus via the First-year Fall Abroad program. Now, master’s students can put their problem-solving skills to the test by working on an industry-sponsored master’s thesis program, mentored by faculty and researchers across eight different areas of expertise, while PhD students continue to work on groundbreaking research. Our academic programs are energized by Georgia Tech-CNRS IRL 2958, an international joint research laboratory between Georgia Tech and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), with a presence in both Metz and Atlanta. This partnership stimulates joint research programs in strategic technological areas, and fuels the exchange of ideas between students, researchers, and faculty. Cutting-edge research in secure networks and innovative materials led to the creation of the Institut Lafayette, which promotes technology transfer from Georgia Tech-Lorraine’s research laboratories, and transatlantic industrial research and development opportunities in the optoelectronics sector. Along with our dedicated staff and faculty who are deeply committed to their mission of building this extraordinary European/US partnership in education, research, and innovation, I invite you to change your campus and change your life by choosing Georgia Tech-Lorraine in France.
