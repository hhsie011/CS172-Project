Nelson Center for Entrepreneurship was launched, supported by a $25 million gift from Jonathan M. Nelson '77. Building on the University's tradition of entrepreneurship, the center aims to make entrepreneurship an essential part of the Brown experience. The Nelson Center currently operates from a third-floor suite in Hillel House but will soon have a dedicated home in a new, four-story, mixed-use building being constructed at 249 Thayer Street, directly across the street from the Brown University Bookstore. The University will lease space from Capstone Properties and the Discovery Group, which co-own and are developing the building, and expects to take occupancy of the building's top three floors. The Nelson Center's new facility will house workspaces and area for faculty and students to collaborate on developing new ventures, as well as the group of Peer Entrepreneurs-in-Residence and a range of student-led activities, supporting diverse, interdisciplinary and cross-collaborative activities in the entrepreneurial process. A developmental approach to engage, inspire, and empower entrepreneurs in the Nelson Center will be fulfilled through the center's curricular, co-curricular, and venture support activities.
