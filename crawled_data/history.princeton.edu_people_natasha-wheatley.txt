Her first book recovers Habsburg Central Europe as a crucible for modern legal theory as well as modern states themselves. The Temporal Life of States: Central Europe and the Transformation of Modern Sovereignty (forthcoming with Princeton University Press, spring 2023) tells the history of attempts to conceptualize sovereignty in this intricately layered, prodigiously diverse corner of the world. It tracks a recurring set of questions about the juridical birth, death, and survival of states through the creative experiments of Austro-Hungarian constitutional order and into the domain of international law following the empire’s collapse in 1918. Tracing the problem of states-in-time from the mid-19th century through to the mid-20th, it presents an unfamiliar pre-history of the international law of decolonization, as well as new ways of understanding Central Europe in the world. Her article, “Spectral Legal Personality in Interwar International Law” received the Surrency Prize from the American Society for Legal History in 2018. Her chapter “Legal Pluralism as Temporal Pluralism” was awarded the 2021 Scholarship Prize from the American Society of International Law’s International Legal Theory Group. Earlier research on the League of Nations’ mandate system has appeared in Past & Present and elsewhere. Wheatley received her Ph.D. with distinction from Columbia University in 2016. Before joining the Princeton faculty, she was an ARC Postdoctoral Fellow in the Laureate Research Program in International History at the University of Sydney. She has held fellowships in Vienna, Berlin, and Cambridge, and her research has been supported by (among others) the Doris G. Quinn Foundation, the Austrian Agency for International Cooperation in Education and Research, the Central European History Society, and the Australian Academy of the Humanities. She was a Fellow at the Wissenschaftskolleg in Berlin for the 2019-20 academic year.
