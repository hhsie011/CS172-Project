Discover the impact of teaching, research and outreach has on our world through an interactive timeline. Timeline President Kayse Shrum Dr. Kayse Shrum was named the 19th president of Oklahoma State University in April of 2021, officially taking office July 1, 2021. She is the first woman to lead a public research institution in the state of Oklahoma. Her commitment to ensuring our status as a modern land-grant institution reflects her passion for research, innovation and industry partnerships.

The OSU Student Union reopened in 2012, following a $63 million dollar renovation project. Several new spaces were created by the renovation, especially on the North Plaza which was transformed from a parking area to a great place to relax, study or participate in any number of activities. In addition to patio style furniture, the plaza includes an amphitheater that makes it a great venue for movie nights under the stars, concerts, sing-alongs and other special events. Inside, there's the totally revamped theater, student study areas, meeting rooms, offices for student organizations, a dozen dining options and expanded seating throughout. Other important safety improvements were made to parts of the union that aren't as visible, including new wiring, plumbing, heating, air conditioning and elevators. Four wood-frame buildings were completed in 1892 using federal funds for the experiment station. Three of the structures are pictured in this photo to the right of Old Central, they included the college barn (first building on campus), the chemistry laboratory, and the experiment station director's home. Of course, Old Central came along a bit later. The Women's Building (now the Bartlett Center) and the Men's Dormitory (later named Crutchfield Hall) opened in the fall 1911. These were the first student housing facilities at a state-supported educational institution in Oklahoma. The Women's Building (pictured) provided residential and recreational facilities for female students, classrooms for domestic science and domestic arts courses, as well as a dining hall for all students. Considering the struggles many students experienced back home on the prairie, the building was a palace with running water, electricity and steam heat. The political "discussion" over a site for the college continued for six more months after Oklahoma A&M College had been established on paper. At long last, Stillwater was designated as the location for the college by a commission appointed by Territorial Governor George W. Steele. The commission reported the 200-acres near Stillwater "...contained the various qualities of soil as we thought would be most suitable for the purposes for which the college is to be established..." While the debate about the soil quality at the site continued for years to come, Stillwater was successful in its bid, beating out the nearby town of Perkins, which was another top contender. The first two photos show early day Stillwater at the time Oklahoma A&M College was established. The third photo (dated 1900) in the series indicates the growth that took place within nine years. The first permanent structure on campus, the College Building or (Old) Central Building, called "Stillwater's Pride," was dedicated in June of 1894 in time for fall classes. The site was chosen because Stillwater residents wanted the school to be located as close to the city limits as possible. By September, the building housed the first permanent chemistry laboratory and the first library, which contained 1,600 volumes. The bell in Old Central signaled class changes until 1908 when a bugle was used. Eventually, an electrical bell system was installed in all the buildings on campus. Stillwater citizens and the city government made major efforts to market $10,000 in bonds for the construction of the College Building, which began in 1893. The bonds were not only the first issued by Stillwater, but also the first by any municipality in Oklahoma successfully paid at maturity without refinancing. The Classroom building opened for classes in 1952. Built at an estimated cost of $850,000, the building included a basement and four stories and was designed to duplicate its companion to the north, the Engineering Building. Three floors were devoted to classrooms, with an estimated capacity of about 1,800. A 50-by78-foot auditorium accommodated 385. The fourth floor provided 15 offices. Staffs of the college architect, physical plant director and university publicity department were initially housed in the basement. A symbol of Oklahoma State University's international programs around the world as well as the brotherhood of nations evident in its students, the International Mall is a tribute to the university's efforts to make the world a better place. Starting in May 1972, the flags of fifty nations have been randomly selected to be flown at various times from 18 of the 19 poles in the mall, with the U.S. and Oklahoma state flags flying together on the remaining pole. Work started in 1911 and by September of 1912 the various departments were able to occupy the new Engineering Building that would later become known as Gundersen Hall, named after mathematics head Carl Gundersen (pictured in series). The final costs, including new equipment, reached $100,000 for the 34,000 square foot building. Laboratories for testing heavy equipment occupied the first floor, along with several classrooms, a ventilation room to help circulate air in the building, and offices for the Division of Engineering. The second floor included a laboratory for the physics department, additional classrooms, an engineering library, and offices for the physics and civil engineering departments. Much of the third floor was designated for use as drafting rooms for the departments of mechanical and architectural engineering. Every engineering graduate for 29 years had been in at least one of Gundersen’s classes by the time he died in 1938.
