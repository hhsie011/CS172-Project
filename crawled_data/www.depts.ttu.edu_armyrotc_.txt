LEADERSHIP THAT LASTS A LIFETIME Army ROTC is an elective curriculum you take along with your required college classes. It gives you the tools, training and experiences that will help you succeed in any competitive environment. Along with great leadership training, Army ROTC can pay for your college tuition. Because Army ROTC is an elective, you can participate your freshman and sophomore years without any obligation to join the Army. You will have a normal college student experience like everyone else on campus, but when you graduate, you will be commissioned as an Officer in the Army. At that point, you will have a wide range of interest areas you can specialize in called branches. WHY BECOME AN OFFICER? Those who succeed in the Army ROTC program are students who excel and want something more out of the college experience. Generally, these students are scholars who keep their grades up, athletes who are physically strong and leaders who have a great desire to learn. YOUR COMMITMENT Army ROTC students who receive an Army ROTC scholarship or enter the Army ROTC Advanced Course must agree to complete a period of service with the Army. You can serve full time in the Army for three years (four years for scholarship winners)Selected Cadets may choose to serve part time in the U.S. Army Reserve or Army National Guard while pursuing a civilian career It's an experience that you can't get anywhere else, and your leadership skills will be challenged every day. Contact your campus Military Science department for more specific details on your Army ROTC service commitment.
