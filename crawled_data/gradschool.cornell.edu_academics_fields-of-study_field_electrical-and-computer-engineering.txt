Entering students are admitted directly to the Ph.D. program; a Master’s Degree is not a requirement for admission. Before doctoral degree candidates begin the second year of study, they must take a Qualifying Examination, consisting of Subject Area Examinations that are administered by the ECE Faculty. The Master of Engineering in Electrical and Computer Engineering is intended for students who hold a baccalaureate (or equivalent) in engineering or science. It is intended primarily for those who intend to go directly into industry to practice engineering. The M.Eng. degree consists of a thirty credit-hour program that is a combination of advanced level coursework and an engineering design project. It is not a research-based degree and does not require the defense of a thesis. Research and study opportunities Ongoing research activities in electrical engineering involve both theory and experiment, and range from the atomic scale at which solid-state devices are studied to the global dimensions of geophysical plasmas. Projects currently underway concern the properties of materials, the fabrication of devices from these materials, the interconnection of devices to form systems, and the properties of systems, including control systems, computer systems, systems for transmitting power and information, and systems for processing signals and data. Signals, systems, learning and control Communications, networks, cyber-physical systems, energy conversion and power systems, biological and medical systems; coding and information theory, machine learning and statistical inference, adaptive control, image and video processing and compression. Computer engineering and robotics Computer architecture, computer systems, parallel and distributed processing, cloud computing, embedded systems, and computer networks; VLSI design, hardware verification, CAD, and simulation; robotics, embodied computation, hardware/software co-design, and micro robotics. Plasma physics, space science and engineering, and electromagnetics Upper atmosphere, ionospheric and magnetospheric science, radar, satellites, and sounding rockets; fusion, solar system, and fundamental plasmas; pulsed power, electron and ion beams, and plasma radiation; plasma fabrication; electromagnetics. Solid-state electronics and optoelectronics Electronic, magnetic and optoelectronic materials and devices; devices, circuits, and system integration; beyond-CMOS devices and circuits; power electronics; photonics; microwave and millimeter-wave devices and systems; sensors and actuators, micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
