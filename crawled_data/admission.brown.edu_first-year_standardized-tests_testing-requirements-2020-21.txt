Students who do not submit test scores should be assured that they will not be disadvantaged in our admission process, and we will look to other aspects of the application, from course grades and curricular rigor to insight from counselors and teachers, to assess academic preparation. The SAT or ACT, when submitted, will continue to be considered in the context of all the other information we have about a candidate. Standardized testing is informative, but has always been one among many components that we consider in our holistic admission process. As with every aspect of the admission process, our test-optional policy will be evaluated again before the 2023-2024 application cycle begins. As we continue to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on academic outcomes, both at the high school and college level, continued research and assessment is needed and will guide policy decisions in the coming years. We anticipate that the data we gather this year will help to provide clarity on these outcomes and inform our longer term testing policies. For students who choose to submit test scores, these may be self-reported or sent officially to Brown. We continue to accept Score Choice and will always consider a student’s highest scores if multiple results are submitted. English proficiency testing recommendations remain available for international applicants and non-native speakers of English. Brown will also adhere to Ivy League policies regarding testing requirements for applicants who plan to participate in varsity athletics. For more detail regarding our current test-optional policy, please see our dedicated FAQ.
