Print Degree Planner (opens a new window) | Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Facebook this Page (opens a new window) Tweet this Page (opens a new window) Return to: Undergraduate Programs (All Programs) Advising guidelines for the Bachelor of Professional Studies (B.P.S.) degree with a concentration in Disability Studies and Rehabilitation Services are designed for students seeking to be academically and professionally grounded in issues faced by individuals seeking disability services. Students will also be exposed to the theme of employment – including vocational adjustment and appropriate job placement – and independent living outcomes as reaffirmed in the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992. Rehabilitation depends heavily upon communication between both the consumer and professional and among various professionals; consequently, communication will be stressed, as well as an understanding of the potential influence of cultural diversity and individual lifestyle choices. Courses will also enable students to understand the methods used in disability services to solve consumer problems and utilize available resources. Finally, a well-supervised field experience component will provide students the opportunity to integrate classroom principles and develop entry-level skills in a work setting. General Education (35-41 hours) See Graduation from the University for the University General Education Program requirements. Students who have completed one year of American History in high school are exempted from the six credit-hour History General Education Program requirement; otherwise, students will have to meet the History requirement.
