This workshop will bring together social scientists, digital humanists, computational scientists, and mathematicians with experience in network theory and network analysis in social systems. This workshop will also showcase how mixed methods research (which combines qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis) with multidisciplinary perspectives leads to deeper insights and more ethical and responsible approaches. Workshop organizers will lead tutorials in the mathematics of network theory, finding and working with network data, and qualitative methods for networks in the social sciences. We will emphasize and showcase the use of a critical lens throughout the process, from model building to data collection and analysis, connecting us to a broader dialogue about algorithmic justice and the potential benefits and pitfalls of mathematical models. Participants will also have the option to engage in virtual interdisciplinary working groups continuing after the workshop, focused on problems in application areas including community organizing, education, social media and information dissemination, and healthcare. Confirmed Speakers & Participants Talks will be presented virtually or in-person as indicated in the schedule below.

But how exactly have mathematicians collaborated with the police? In this talk, I will present a selective overview of predictive policing and predicting police, with a focus on network approaches, ranging from social network analysis of crime to network models of police misconduct, with a view towards a critical mathematical theory of policing. In doing so, I will make the case that there remains much interesting and urgent work to be done in this space. 10:15 - 10:45 am EDT Coffee Break 11th Floor Collaborative Space 10:45 am - 12:00 pm EDT Group Work 11th Floor Break Out Space - TBA 12:00 - 2:00 pm EDT Lunch/Free Time 2:00 - 3:00 pm EDT Data Feminism in Action 11th Floor Lecture Hall Virtual Speaker Lauren Klein, Emory University Abstract 40 minutes for talk & 20 minutes for discussion What is data feminism? How is feminist thinking being incorporated into data-driven work? And how are scholars in the humanities and social sciences, in particular, bringing together data science and feminist theory in their research? Drawing from her recent book, Data Feminism (MIT Press, 2020), coauthored with Catherine D’Ignazio, Klein will present a set of principles for doing data science that are informed by the past several decades of intersectional feminist activism and critical thought. In order to illustrate these principles, she will focus on a recent research project which involves the development of a model of lexical semantic change that, when combined with network analysis, tells a new story about antislavery activism and interracial solidarity (or the difficulties thereof) in the nineteenth-century United States. This example demonstrates how feminist thinking can indeed be operationalized into more ethical, more intentional, and more capacious data practices--particularly with respect to networks--in the digital humanities, computational social science, and beyond. 3:15 - 3:45 pm EDT Coffee Break 11th Floor Collaborative Space 3:45 - 5:00 pm EDT Group Work 11th Floor Break Out Space - TBA Thursday, June 30, 2022 9:00 - 10:00 am EDT TBA 11th Floor Lecture Hall Justin Uhr, Brown University Abstract 40 minutes for talk & 20 minutes for discussion 10:15 - 10:45 am EDT Coffee Break 11th Floor Collaborative Space 10:45 - 11:45 am EDT Supporting Network Analysis at the Center for Digital Scholarship 11th Floor Lecture Hall Speakers Ashley Champagne, Brown University Patrick Rashleigh, Brown University Virtual Speaker Maiah Letsch, Utrecht University Abstract 40 minutes for talk & 20 minutes for discussion The Center for Digital Scholarship at Brown University offers hands-on instruction on a variety of digital scholarship methodologies, including network analysis, and this presentation will offer a snapshot of our services. First, we will share one of the ways we introduce students to network analysis. Next, this presentation will demo how we have used network analysis for one of our projects, Stolen Relations: Recovering Stories of Indigenous Enslavement in the Americas, which is led by Professor Linford Fisher (Department of History, Brown University). The Stolen Relations project is a community-based effort to build a database of enslaved Indigenous people in order to promote greater understanding of the historical circumstances and ongoing trauma of settler colonialism. The team has used the biographical information related to enslaved Indigenous people to chart networks and relations. These are hard realities and difficult histories, but they need to be told fully so we can start to be more honest about the history of this country and think more clearly about how to make amends going forward. Network analysis is one such way we can tell part of this story. 11:45 - 11:50 am EDT Group Photo 11th Floor Lecture Hall 12:00 - 2:00 pm EDT Lunch/Free Time 2:00 - 3:00 pm EDT Group Work 11th Floor Break Out Space - TBA 3:00 - 3:30 pm EDT Coffee Break 11th Floor Collaborative Space 3:30 - 5:00 pm EDT Group Work 11th Floor Break Out Space - TBA Friday, July 1, 2022 9:00 - 10:00 am EDT Promoting effective and enduring collaboration in networks 11th Floor Lecture Hall Speaker Carrie Diaz Eaton, Bates College Virtual Speaker Jason Williams, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Abstract 40 minutes for talk & 20 minutes for discussion We synthesize ideas and experience from research coordination networks to discuss how to foster success for the future of social justice research involving data science and computational methods. Together, we will lead discuss goals for the collaboration network. To achieve those goals, we consider conversations that the community should have as they move towards collaborative teams, introducing tools and techniques for both team communication and computational collaboration. We also ask that individuals reflect on how their personal goals and strengths will help the research team and the network. 10:15 - 10:45 am EDT Coffee Break 11th Floor Collaborative Space 10:45 - 11:45 am EDT Big Challenges and Resources in Interdisciplinary Teams Panel Discussion - 11th Floor Lecture Hall Panelists Manuchehr Aminian, California State Polytechnic University, Pomona Jude Higdon, QSIDE Institute Katherine Kinnaird, Smith College Sarah Shugars, NYU 12:00 - 2:00 pm EDT Lunch/Free Time 2:00 - 2:30 pm EDT Project 1 Presentation Group Presentations - 11th Floor Lecture Hall Project Leader Chad Topaz, Institute for the Quantitative Study of Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity 2:45 - 3:15 pm EDT Project 2 Presentation Group Presentations - 11th Floor Lecture Hall Project Leader Philip Chodrow, University of California, Los Angeles 3:15 - 3:45 pm EDT Coffee Break 11th Floor Collaborative Space 3:45 - 4:15 pm EDT Project 3 Presentation Group Presentations - 11th Floor Lecture Hall Project Leader Michelle Feng, CalTech 4:30 - 5:00 pm EDT Project 4 Presentation Group Presentations - 11th Floor Lecture Hall Project Leader Nathan Alexander, Morehouse College Subscribe to ICERM Calendar (iCal) × ICERM provides an iCalendar (.ics) feeds for all events and talks.

Associated Program Workshops Data Science and Social Justice: Networks, Policy, and Education Jun 13 - Jul 8, 2022 Data Science and Social Justice: Networks, Policy, and Education Jun 13 - Jul 8, 2022 × The Social Justice and Data Science Summer Research Program at ICERM aims to increase interest, research training, and capacity for data science for social justice, and to develop both quantitative and qualitative approaches to those professional practices that call for community engagement, critical inquiry, and interdisciplinary cooperation. In order to advance the mathematics community's understanding of the complexity of computational social justice work, the program will have four emphasis areas (1) networks, (2) policy, (3) education and (4) community-driven research. While the program itself is broadly computational and applied mathematics, researchers with expertise and interests in network science and analysis, open science and data, and computer science are particularly encouraged to apply. As a new field emerges at the face of computational and applied mathematics and social justice, this requires new methods for working across community lines. The organizers are committed...
