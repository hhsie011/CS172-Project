Nearly half of all American college students have been affected by depression, anxiety, drug abuse, suicide, and many other mental health issues-- and because these issues are prevalent on college campuses, there is a need for awareness. The mission of Active Minds is just that: to educate, and to let others know that they are not alone in their struggle. Active Minds at Baylor University is a student organization tailored to the specific needs of the Baylor campus.
