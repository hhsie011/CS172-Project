Cash Professor in Finance: Autore Finance is considered one of the basic functions of our private enterprise system. Finance can be defined as the art and science of managing money. Each of the many firms, businesses, institutions, and governmental agencies in our economic system has the problems of obtaining, administering, and managing its funds efficiently and wisely. Nearly every decision made by an organization has important financial implications. Thus, the finance student is introduced to and studies the theory, concepts, applications, institutional environment, and analytical tools essential for proper decision making. Finance is designed as preparation for a broad variety of careers, since all organizations need individuals knowledgeable about finance. Careers may be in financial management and analysis, banking, financial institutions, financial markets, investments, portfolio analysis and management, financial planning, and multinational finance. Finance is also considered good preparation for graduate study in law or business. The department also offers a combined BS/MSF pathway and a combined BS/MBA pathway that allows highly qualified undergraduate students the opportunity to accelerate their coursework and take up to nine semester hours of graduate coursework, which may be counted toward both the BS and MSF or MBA degrees. Detailed descriptions of the MSF and MBA programs can be found in the Graduate Bulletin.
