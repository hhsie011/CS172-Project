The space within the building is assigned exclusively for multidisciplinary work and features a recital hall, recording studio, multi-media lab, and studios. The design of the building facilitates programs and courses to be developed with collaboration among artists, scientists, and humanists to create new art forms, approaches to collaborative work, and to explore, examine, and extend our understanding of the creative process. The building also features a Public Art space designed by Jan and Tim Edler. The space comprises two 14 x 5 foot light boxes that wash the entrance in a range of colors, from white, to rose, blue, mustard, and red. The project won a design award from The Society of College and University Planners and has been widely featured in the National press. Sustainable features, such as exterior louvered blinds and a green roof helped it achieve a LEED Gold rating.
