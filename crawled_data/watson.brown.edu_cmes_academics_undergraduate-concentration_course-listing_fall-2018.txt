Major topics around which the course centers are: the role of Islam in the development of law and criminal justice in the modern Middle East; the imposition of European colonial rule and the repression of anti-colonial revolts; the rise of police states in the post-colonial Middle East; the production and maintenance of a gendered social order; non-state and informal mechanisms of maintaining “law and order”; and the role of law and security in the Arab uprisings of this decade and its aftermath. WRIT DIAP MES 1243 Understanding Palestine-Israel: Ideologies and Practices Class syllabus T, Th 1:00 p.m. – 2:20 p.m. Professor: Adi Ophir "Palestine-Israel" is a name designating a territory between the east shores of the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River. In addition to the two national movements that fight over this territory, the Jewish (Zionist) and the Palestinian, this land is a matter of ongoing engagement, investment, and entanglement for foreign powers, religious orders, and international organizations. This course will introduce main aspects of this ongoing struggle, its history, and its recurring patterns. Each of these perspectives will be part of what needs to be narrated and explained, not imposed as a framework for the narrative and the explanation at stake.

Meeting with and approval from MES concentration adviser required*** ANTH 1150 Middle East in Anthropological Perspective (Asli Zengin) A seminar focusing on anthropological methods of analyzing and interpreting Middle Eastern cultures and societies. Emphasizes the study of kinship, tribal structure, social organization and gender relations, ethnic groups relations, and urban-rural distinctions. Draws upon insights from these topics as a basis for understanding contemporary social, economic, and political dynamics in the region. COLT 0510K The 1001 Nights (Elias Muhanna) Explores the origins, performance, reception, adaptation, and translation of the 1001 Nights, one of the most beloved and influential story collections in world literature. We will spend the semester in the company of genies, princes, liars, slaves, mass murderers, orientalists, and Walt Disney, and will consider the Nights in the context of its various literary, artistic, and cinematic afterlives. WRIT HIST 0243 Modern Middle East Roots, 1492 to the Present (Faiz Ahmed) The goal of this course is to provide students with a broad overview of Modern Middle Eastern history. Following the expulsion of the Moors and Jews of Iberia, we journey to the opposite end of the Mediterranean with continued Turkic expansions into southeastern Europe, the Arab world, and Iran. Then, the “long” nineteenth century: an era of profound transformation culminating in the Ottoman Empire’s partition, primarily by British and French colonial rule. Finally, we explore forces shaping the twentieth century Middle East, from nationalism to oil, Islamism to “street” politics, and military interventions by the US, USSR, and regional powers. HIST 1202 Formation of the Classical Heritage: Greeks, Romans, Jews, Christians, and Muslims (Kenneth Sacks) Explores essential social, cultural, and religious foundation blocks of Western Civilization, 200 BCE to 800 CE. The main theme is the eternal struggle between universalism and particularism, including: Greek elitism vs. humanism; Roman imperialism vs. inclusion; Jewish assimilation vs. orthodoxy; Christian fellowship vs. exclusion, and Islamic transcendence vs. imminence. We will study how ancient Western individuals and societies confronted oppression and/or dramatic change and developed intellectual and spiritual strategies still in use today. Students should be prepared to examine religious thought from a secular point of view. There is no prerequisite or assumed knowledge of the period.
