Export Control Federal regulations restrict the export of certain technology or technical data overseas and to foreign nationals working in or visiting the United States. Therefore, we work with Georgia Tech’s Office of Legal Affairs to review all international research proposals and contracts for concerns related to national security, foreign policy, anti-terrorism, or non-proliferation.
