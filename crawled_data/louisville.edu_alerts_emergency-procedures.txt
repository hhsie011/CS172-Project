University Emergency Procedure Guidelines Campus Building Emergency Action Plan Procedures Poster Earthquake Fire Hazardous Materials or Chemical Emergency Medical Emergency Natural Gas Leaks Severe Weather Utility Interruption Workplace Violence, Terrorism Active Aggressor Bomb Threat Building Emergency Plans The University of Louisville has Building Emergency Action Plans (BEAP) for each facility on every campus. BEAPs have instructions for building occupants to follow for 12 types of emergencies that pose the greatest risk to the university community. The types of emergencies include; severe weather, fires, earthquakes, power outages, violence on campus, and others. The Building Emergency Action Plans are managed by the building occupants and reviewed by Emergency Management on a regular basis. Each building has a Building Emergency Coordinator (BEC) and an Alternate who manage the BEAP for their building and lead actions during emergencies. The Building Emergency Coordinator (BEC) program was established to coordinate emergency planning and preparedness efforts among UofL Buildings. Typically, a campus building is occupied by multiple departments, making building-wide communications difficult during normal operations, let alone during an emergency. The BEC program serves to assist first responders and Emergency Management by developing a common, building-wide plan of action for emergencies that threaten life safety. The BEC’s will communicate with assigned floor leaders and alternates for each floor for each building. Training for building occupants is provided by the BEC's or upon request, by Emergency Management. For more information regarding BEAPs or BECs, please contact Mindy Christian Hazardous Material Emergencies A hazardous material spill must be reported to the University of Louisville Department of Public Safety (852-6111 or 911) if the clean-up of the spill is beyond the level of knowledge, training or ability of the staff in the immediate area of the spill, and/or the spill creates a situation that is immediately dangerous to the people in the area or the facility. Specific procedures are provided for two types of spills: For a major spill - the University may institute a contingency plan For a minor spill – Please contact UofL’s Department of Environmental Health and Safety (DEHS) Training Emergency Management offers training in many areas. Some of this training is provided through downloadable presentations and others are provided by staff. We can customize training for a department or university building or provide specific training with functional exercises. Training is provided at no cost to the requesting unit.
