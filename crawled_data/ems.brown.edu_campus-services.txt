Non-Emergency Transports for Appointments Back to Top If you are unable to take the shuttle due to illness or injury but need to get to Health Services, BEMS can provide a ride. Call the Brown Department of Public Safety (DPS) non-emergency number at 401-863-3322 to request EMS 30 minutes before your appointment. Be sure to have the name of your Health Services provider available. Transportation from the Hospital Back to Top Students who are COVID-positive or have been evaluated for COVID-19 will be transported back to campus by the BEMS non-medical vehicle. To get a ride home, please call DPS at 401-863-3322 and request BEMS for transport from the given hospital to a location within the campus area. In most situations, students take a taxi home from the hospital, but students with COVID-related conditions should utilize BEMS for this. Cost of EMS Services Back to Top There are no out-of-pocket or insurance billing costs for BEMS non-emergency services such as rides for appointments or COVID support. In a true emergency requiring hospital or other emergency resources, patients will be billed by the hospital for the cost of their hospital care and by any additional non-Brown EMS resources required to manage the emergency. BEMS itself does not bill for patient care or transport. Our specialized campus services are offered at no cost. Please note: A physician group in the local hospital system uses the name Brown Emergency Medicine. They are hospital emergency physicians and have no affiliation with BEMS. If you receive a bill from BEM or Brown Emergency Medicine, that is a hospital bill and not from the BEMS campus ambulance service.
