Students from any university may propose internship projects for the Museum. Past projects have focused on collections management, education, exhibitions, public relations, conservation, and independent research. Interns must work with a faculty advisor from their institution and Museum staff to determine the project’s scope and timeline. Students are expected to work at least one day per week during their internship and can receive course credit or, in some cases, a small stipend. Brown University students usually enroll in ANTH 1970 (for undergraduate students) or ANTH 2980 (for graduate students). Brown University undergraduate students can also partner with the Museum for an UTRA award. American Indian/Alaska Native students at Brown University are eligible to submit proposals for the Rudolf F. Haffenreffer 3rd Internship. Awarded on a competitive basis, this semester-long internship is supported by a stipend. Email Us Email the museum to propose an internship, ask questions about the Rudolf F.
