Each year near the beginning of Semester II, the Graduate Committee of Brown Engineering meets and reviews the academic progress of each of the Division's graduate students. Prior to this Annual Review, the group graduate representatives will solicit input from individual advisors on the status of each continuing student. The result of the Graduate Committee's review will be communicated to each student in writing. The individual research groups may supplement the Annual Review with their own internal procedures (progress seminars, reports, etc.) and students should consult the graduate representative in their group for details. For students with poor performance in coursework or research, the advisor or group graduate representative can at any time request a decision from the graduate committee on whether the student will be allowed to continue. The graduate committee will make a recommendation based on the students transcripts and advisor's report on research progress, if any. Evaluation Procedures Each year during the first weeks of Semester II, the Graduate Committee of Brown Engineering will meet and review the academic progress of each of the School's graduate students. Particular attention will be paid to Sc.M. candidates for May graduation and to students at all levels experiencing academic difficulties. Prior to the Annual Review, the group graduate representatives will solicit input from individual advisors on the status of each continuing student. The result of the Graduate Committee's review will be communicated to each student in writing. For students with poor performance in coursework, teaching assignments, or research, the advisor or group graduate representative can request a decision from the graduate committee on whether the student will be allowed to continue. The graduate committee will reach a decision based on the students transcripts and advisor's report on research progress, if any. For students who have completed the Preliminary Examination, dismissal will require evidence of chronic poor performance as an R.A., or a prolonged period of insufficient progress toward the thesis. Poor R.A. performance or lack of progress toward the thesis should be documented by a memo written by the advisor and given to the student and Graduate Committee as soon as the situation arises. If the student continues to make poor progress for one semester, a decision on continuation may then be requested from the Graduate Committee. The individual research groups may supplement the Annual Review with their own internal procedures (progress seminars, reports, etc.) and students should consult the graduate representative in their group for details.
