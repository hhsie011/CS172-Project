Individuals The Ombuds Office regularly offers one-on-one consultations to Brown University staff, faculty, graduate students, medical students, and postdoctoral scholars. During these meetings, individuals have a safe and confidential space in which to voice, clarify, and discuss sensitive concerns or conflicts. Individuals also have a non-judgmental, informal partner with expertise in conflict management who actively listens and collaboratively talks through strategies, options, and resources to address concerns. For more information, see FAQ. Groups In addition to meeting with individuals, the Ombuds Office also consults with groups. When working with groups, the four principles of confidentiality, informality, neutrality, and independence all still apply. Informal Mediation The Ombuds Office offers informal mediation between two or more parties in a conflict. Informal mediation through the Ombuds Office is confidential and informal, making it a safe space to try to work out disputes before or instead of moving to formal and less confidential processes.
