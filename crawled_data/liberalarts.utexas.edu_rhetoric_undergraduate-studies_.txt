skip to content Menu x Undergraduate Studies Analytical, Communicative, and Persuasive skills are in high demand in almost every profession, including law, education, politics, consulting, business, public relations, professional writing, advertising, and academia. The Rhetoric & Writing major aims to produce sophisticated communicators able to perform the sort of analyses and persuasive presentations that such careers require. It also is an excellent preparation for graduate-level study in law, business, media studies, literary and cultural studies, and other liberal-arts disciplines. Specifically, students in the Rhetoric & Writing major learn to: Critically analyze information, texts, and arguments. Organize and communicate ideas clearly and effectively. Engage thoughtfully in public debates. Advocate a position effectively and ethically. As a Rhetoric & Writing major, you will develop your ability to apply these practical skills in person, in print, and electronically, while studying the rhetorical and philosophical principles in which they are based.
