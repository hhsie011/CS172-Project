Green Buildings on Campus Cornell designs and operates high-performance campus buildings to reduce carbon impact and model sustainable, healthy environments for work and life. Our building and design policies advance sustainable construction and maintenance. Since implementing the policy for LEED Silver buildings in 2008, Cornell has certified 26 green buildings on campus, including 5 Platinum, 18 Gold, 1 Silver and 2 Certified LEED Buildings. Green buildings create healthy, highly efficient and cost-saving spaces for Cornell researchers, staff, and students to perform their best. Far beyond just energy efficiency, our green buildings feature sustainable landscape design, human equality integration, alternative transportation hubs, and more.
