The relevant programs depend upon the level of study. For Undergraduates Offered by the Nelson Center for Entrepreneurship and the School of Engineering, the certificate program in entrepreneurship provides curricular structure for undergraduate students who wish to make entrepreneurship an important part of their intellectual journey at Brown. To earn the certificate, a student must complete two core courses that introduce foundational entrepreneurial concepts, two elective courses that extend the foundation into an area of specific interest, and a practicum that enables students to apply classroom concepts to real-world entrepreneurial projects of their own choosing. For Graduate and Early Career Students The Program in Innovation Management and Entrepreneurship (PRIME) is a choice for students who have recently completed an undergraduate program in a science or technology-oriented field. The PRIME master's degree focuses on developing science and engineering graduates’ skills so as to prepare them to more efficiently participate in a complex and highly competitive technology-driven economy, based on the development of innovative, embryonic ideas. This STEM program is based within the School of Engineering. For Early-Mid Career Leaders The Master's in Technology Leadership (MTL) is a choice for early to mid-career professionals (5-15 years out of school) who are working in a science or technology-oriented field and are looking to complement their technical expertise with communication, leadership, and relational skills. For Senior Executives The IE Brown Executive MBA program combines IE's strength in interdisciplinary management education and Brown’s excellence in the humanities, social, biological and physical sciences, creating a unique new executive MBA degree program whose aim is to develop informed, globally-minded, and innovative leaders.
