The Transfer Admissions team will be available to answer questions by email at adm-tran@fas.harvard.edu Monday through Friday between the hours of 9am and 5pm EST. We will not be available by phone. Email Transfer Admissions Each year, we accept a small group of exceptional students to transfer to Harvard College from other similar liberal arts programs. U.S. Military veterans may be particularly interested in our transfer program if they've completed at least one full academic year, and not more than two, of college coursework. Transfer FAQs Is financial aid available for transfer students? With a goal of bringing the brightest scholars to Harvard, we admit students without any regard for financial need—a policy we call “need-blind admission.” Please fill out your financial aid application by March 1 if possible. Admitted students who have applied for aid are offered a financial aid package to meet full demonstrated need. Throughout our process, our financial aid staff works to understand your family’s financial situation. Use our Net Price Calculator to estimate your family's contribution for one year at Harvard. How are transfer students supported on campus? Enrolling students take part in a fall orientation program and are connected with a dedicated transfer adviser who helps with academic planning and the transition to Harvard life. Transfer students who live on-campus will find strong community in their undergraduate Houses, and students who live off campus will benefit from the Dudley Community. Transfer students are also supported by peer advisers, who were themselves transfer students from prior years. About Our Transfer Program Each fall, we welcome a very small number (12 on average) of transfer students to Harvard College. We seek students whose previous academic experience will prepare them to flourish in our rigorous and rewarding liberal arts program. In our candidates for transfer admission, we look for: A clearly defined academic need to transfer A proven record of achievement at your current institution Strong faculty recommendations Recently, we have received more than 1,500 transfer applications per year. In pools of this size, the number of well-qualified applicants far exceeded the number of students admitted and enrolled each year as transfer students. As admission to transfer to Harvard is competitive, we encourage you to explore a variety of colleges in your transfer search. Eligibility To be eligible to transfer, you must have completed at least one continuous academic year in a full-time degree program at one college and not more than two academic years. You must complete at least two full years of study at Harvard. Once a student has completed more than two years total of college at another institution, regardless of courses taken, that student is no longer eligible for transfer admission. Students are eligible to transfer only from a liberal arts curriculum that is similar to Harvard’s. Candidates whose education has been in a vocational, professional, technical, online, extension, or performance program will not ordinarily qualify for transfer admission. Students who have completed one full-time year of college in a regular degree program in lieu of their senior year of high school (often referred to as dual enrollment) should apply for first-year admission if these courses are taken for credit towards a high school diploma. Students who are enrolled part-time are not eligible unless they have previously completed one full-time, continuous academic year. If you are too advanced in your studies to qualify for transfer, you may be interested in the Visiting Undergraduate Student Program. Tour Take a Virtual Tour Use our Virtual Tour to discover spaces that aren't even available on an in-person campus tour, such as classrooms, laboratories, residence halls, and more. Explore Harvard What We Look For Through our admissions process, we strive to give you ample opportunities to best demonstrate your interests and accomplishments. We welcome candidates who have gone directly from high school into college as well as those who have followed less traditional paths. The Admissions Committee looks for achievement in a rigorous program of study, especially in your expected field of specialization. Beyond strong grades, test scores, and recommendations, the Committee considers other non-academic factors such as significant extracurricular engagements and talents. We also consider an applicant’s personal qualities such as a capacity for leadership, creativity, resiliency, intellectual curiosity, and independent thinking. In addition to our standard application materials, you may submit supplementary materials showcasing exceptional or unusual talents, including musical performance, artistic work, and research material. Learn more about what we look for Timeline Harvard accepts transfer students for fall semester entrance only; we do not admit students for the spring semester. The transfer application becomes available during the fall of the academic year. March 1: Deadline for all transfer application and financial aid materials. The Transfer Admissions Committee begins to review applications after the application deadline. We will notify applicants of admissions decisions by mid-May. Submitting your materials early does not increase your chances of admission, but it does provide more opportunities to track down any missing documents and ensure that your application is full and complete by the time we begin our review. Please note that college transcripts should be sent between January and March in order to reflect your most updated academic credentials.

Harvard College Questions and Writing Supplement for the Common Application $75 fee (or request a fee waiver by sending an email to adm-tran@fas.harvard.edu) Standardized testing: We ordinarily require all transfer applicants to submit ACT or SAT scores. Due to the ongoing pandemic, we will consider 2022-2026 transfer applications without standardized testing.

Transferring Course Credit Harvard will honor comparable coursework you have done prior to your transfer admission, while also giving you time to take advantage of Harvard’s course offerings and delve deeply into your concentration. You will be allowed to transfer in a maximum of 16 semester-long courses—the equivalent of two full years of academic work—providing you the opportunity to take the remaining half of the courses required for your A.B. or S.B. degree at Harvard. The Harvard College Registrar’s Office grants credit for work done at another college or university to each admitted transfer student on an individual basis after careful evaluation. While Harvard does not audit transcripts prior to application to determine eligibility, the descriptions below should be helpful in determining which of your courses may transfer. Our office is unable to make recommendations in regards to coursework at your current institution or advise on anticipated class standing during the application process. Which courses are eligible for credit? You may receive credit for courses taken in a full-time, daytime program of study at an accredited degree-granting institution, provided that you: Took courses comparable to those offered in Harvard’s liberal arts curriculum. Earned grades of “C” (or the equivalent) or better Which courses are not eligible for credit? Unfortunately, we are unable to grant credit for certain accomplishments. Harvard does not typically award credit for: Online or distance education courses Night or extension courses Courses taken on a part-time basis Technical or vocational courses such as accounting, marketing, journalism, law, agriculture, nursing, business, communications or specialized military training coursework Dual-enrollment courses counted for credit toward a high school diploma Work done prior to admission in an isolated term, semester or quarter at another college, unless the college from which you are transferring has granted credit for that work Credit gained by accelerating in an academic year at another college College Level Placement Exam (CLEP), Advanced Placement Exam (AP/IB) results, or any credit earned by examination, even when credited to your degree by the college or university from which you wish to transfer Summer school courses, except for those at your current college/university or courses at Harvard Summer School Related Topics Application Tips Not sure how to fill out the admissions application to Harvard?
