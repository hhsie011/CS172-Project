To begin, simply log into the Housing Portal and return to the Room Selection Application. The Start Room Selection screen will be available to you at your appointment time. The start page provides you with two options to begin: Proceed to Exact Match Selection Options Choosing this option will display only those housing options that exactly fit all the members of your group, or you as an individual. Proceed to Different Combinations Selection Options Choosing this option will present all remaining housing options so that you can consider the best fit for you or your group — whether that is choosing a space that fits everyone, or selecting various options to accommodate all group members. We encourage all Group Leaders and members of groups to familiarize themselves with the Group Selection process prior to their appointment time.
