Whether you need to improve employee engagement, encourage changes in behavior of consumers, coworkers, or clients, or generate improved commercial returns — the ability to effectively, efficiently, and ethically influence people's behavior allows you to better achieve your business objectives and positively impact the bottom line. But as organizations come to realize the impact behavioral science can make, two challenges emerge: Which of the myriad of behavioral science tools and insights will be the most useful? And how can they be used in meaningful and applicable ways to deliver measured returns on investment? The Behavioral Science in Business program equips executives with a deep understanding of behavioral science for business and the tools to implement and measure its impact of behavioral science, using a proprietary Full Cycle Approach to Applying Behavioral Science™. About the Full Cycle Approach to Applying Behavioral Science™ The Full Cycle Approach to Applying Behavioral Science™ is a behavior change model that sets out the specific steps organizations should undertake to benefit from leveraging behavioral science in meaningful and sustainable ways. Organizations who adopt the seven key steps outlined in this model, supported by strong leadership and only modest resources, can quickly profit from what is increasingly becoming known as the ‘behavioral revolution’. The program has been developed in collaboration with world-leading researchers and practitioners in the field. You will be learning from some of the most noted experts, leading scholars, and best-selling authors who are leaders not just in the theory of behavioral science, but also in its practice.

You will be introduced to the Full Cycle Approach to Applying Behavioral Science™ as well as the three essential models that represent the most important engines of behavioral change. You will explore how behaviors frequently come about rather than being thought about and examine the merits of changing minds over changing behaviors.
