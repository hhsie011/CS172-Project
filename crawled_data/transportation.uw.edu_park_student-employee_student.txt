Resident permits are open only to students living in UW residence halls. All student parking permits are issued quarterly and can be purchased and renewed at our online customer portal. If you have not used the portal before, please review the customer portal guide first. You can also visit the Transportation Services office or contact us for more information. Please upload your license plate information in your account on the customer portal prior to your visit in person. Many permits will be linked to vehicle license plates with no need to display a paper permit. Daytime parking for student commuters is only available in E18. Parking lot assignments for other permits are based on availability at time of purchase. Additional lots are available for students with disabilities. If you don’t need to park on campus every day, consider using Pay by phone parking in E18, which combines the convenience of self-serve parking with the value rate available in E18. For additional short-term parking needs, please check out Visitor or Self-serve parking. Prices listed below give the daily rate. Quarterly rates will vary based on the number of days in the quarter.
