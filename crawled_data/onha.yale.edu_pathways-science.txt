The more than 1,800 Pathways to Science Scholars are considered the youngest members of Yale’s scientific community and are invited to Yale’s campus throughout the year for special events, academic lectures, demonstrations, laboratory visits, and research opportunities. Once accepted into the program, students are invited to attend more than 150 different programs and events annually, choosing to participate in the opportunities that interest them most. In the past, students have viewed the cosmos at Yale’s state-of-the-art planetarium, launched rockets, built telescopes, examined brain specimens with Yale neuroscientists, and much more. Please note that while a student must be in 6th-12th grade to be eligible to be a Pathways to Science Scholar, there a numerous open-to-the-public events & programs that any K-12 student can attend!
