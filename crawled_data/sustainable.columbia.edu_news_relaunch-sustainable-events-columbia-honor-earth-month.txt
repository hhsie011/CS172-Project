April 22, 2022 The Sustainable Event Guidelines published in Plan 2030 are available for anyone to use in planning events, activities, or meetings. There are also opportunities to join the sustainable events community where you can connect with others around sustainable practices, commit to applying these guidelines in your operation, and see how Columbia’s key events departments are leading the way. Please review our guide before you plan your activities. Some highlights from the guide include: Minimize food waste by ordering slightly less food than your expected attendance to account for attrition Eliminate beef and choose vegetarian options, foods that have a higher associated greenhouse gas profile Continue to offer hybrid events to minimize required travel-associated emissions Order pitchers of water instead of single use water bottles to minimize plastic waste and avoid an upcharge Make your event “plastic water bottle free” and communicate to guests in advance to bring their own beverage containers Provide no printed copies at events and provide digital documents instead to cut back on paper waste Take action and lead with us!
