Ours is an institution dedicated to innovation in education, to scientific discovery and integrity, to diversity and professional development, and to service to humanity. Since 1906, the HMS campus has formed the nucleus of the Longwood Medical Area, located in the historic Mission Hill neighborhood of Boston. Surrounded by several of its world-renowned affiliated hospitals and research institutions, the iconic HMS Quadrangle is home to the School and its 10 basic and social science departments. A center of teaching, research and learning for nearly 12,000 faculty and more than 11,000 students, residents and postdoctoral fellows, HMS is located on a campus separate from the main Harvard University complex across the Charles River in Cambridge.
