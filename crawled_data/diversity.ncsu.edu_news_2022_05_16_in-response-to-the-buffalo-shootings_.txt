We extend our heartfelt sympathy for all those affected by this horrible shooting – particularly Black and Brown colleagues, students, friends and families, and all those whose personal experiences make this particularly difficult. We are all shaken by this – yet another senseless and hate-fueled crime. As a colleague here at NC State shared, “It feels as if we are just through the mourning of one event, and here comes another.” Let’s be clear in recognizing this heinous act for what it was – racially motivated hate. Let us also be clear in emphatically denouncing and condemning these and all acts of violence, discrimination, and hate, and in reaffirming our solidarity in doing all that we can to combat hate. May we be united in our commitment and in continuing to intentionally work to advance a community that is characterized by respect, inclusion and compassion. NC State has support resources available through our NC State Counseling Center for students (virtual appointments are available), and through the Faculty and Staff Assistance Program for employees. Please do not hesitate to reach out and use these important and helpful resources. This week’s tragedy serves as a disturbing reminder of the continued need to confront hate and injustice. It is the responsibility of each of us to stand firm in condemning and combating inequality, discrimination, hate and racism in all forms.
