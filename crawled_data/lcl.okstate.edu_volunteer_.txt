The SVC fulfills the "Service and Civic Engagement" pillar of the Six Pillars of the OSU Experience, meaning that it is considered a critical component to success in school, careers and life. It is only through the exceptional spirit of volunteerism at Oklahoma State University that the SVC records immense success in its programs and activities.
