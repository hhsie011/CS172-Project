Loves to cuddle. Hates to be ignored. Always up for a Benebone. Introducing Butler Blue IV, our mascot. Request an Appearance Butler Blue Menu Appearance Requests History of the Butler Bulldogs Bulldog Memorial Butler Blue Downloads Good Boy, Blue! Media Requests Sponsors Meet our mascot, Blue IV. Born on October 30, 2019 at Fall Creek Place Animal Clinic, Butler Blue IV represents a whole new era in the Butler Blue Live Mascot program. He was delivered by Dr. Kurt Phillips ’92—by way of breeders Jodi and Cameron Madaj—and goes about his business under the care of handler Evan Krauss ’16, and his wife, Kennedy. For inquiring minds, we’ve been known as the “Bulldogs” since 1919 but didn’t have an official live mascot until 2000. Learn more below about our (relatively) new pup on the block Butler Blue IV, and flip back through the program’s pedigreed past. Our History as Bulldogs Social Animal As a digital native, Blue shines best on social media. Find out what he’s doing now—and where he’s going next—by following along on your favorite channel.

Meet Butler Blue IV: Our 65-pound, apple-loving, AKC registered, 100-percent-loyal English bulldog mascot. Patrolling the sidelines of Hinkle Fieldhouse since January 2020 (and given free leash, er, rein, just about everywhere else on campus), you’re bound to run into Blue on his rounds real soon. See a Day in the Life of Blue Bulldogs at Butler Bulldog Century (In people years) We’ve been known as the Bulldogs long before Butler Blue IV—or III, II, or I, for that matter. We’ve had the name since 1919, when a bulldog named Shimmy wandered into the Butler Collegian’s office during a particularly fruitless football season. A page-one cartoon featuring Shimmy appeared in the next issue, and a mascot was born. The Evolution of Blue Blue Through the Years Three Good Boys + One Good Girl Since 2000, three bulldogs besides Butler Blue IV have worn the collar of Butler’s official mascot—Butler I, II, and III. All three came from breeders Frank and Jeanne King, owners of King Kong Kennel in Lizton, Ind. (Dr. Kurt Phillips ’92 has been the vet for all four of our bulldogs.)
