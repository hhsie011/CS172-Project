For anyone interested in becoming part of that vision, the best starting point is Georgia Tech Human Resources (GTHR), whether the job seeker wants an academic, staff, or research position. In addition to being the front porch to all job openings at Georgia Tech, GTHR also offers information and tips related to the job search, application, and hiring process, information on Georgia Tech benefits, and it maintains a large, easy-to-navigate jobs portal. Meanwhile, the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI), Georgia Tech’s applied research division, maintains its own extensive careers portal and job listings for people interested in using their scientific and engineering expertise for the kind of problem-solving research GTRI is known for. • Job seekers can open a user account to explore job opportunities with GTRI, which posts and regularly updates its listing of research positions (offering prospective employees an opportunity to search by location, position, discipline, etc.) and provides helpful tips and job alerts for interested applicants. • Also, GTRI representatives attend a variety of recruiting events to find new talent for open or future positions, with the goal of creating and maintaining a diverse, inclusive workforce. Some of the events GTRI recruiters attend include: BEYA STEM Conference, the Women in Cybersecurity Conference, and NSBE Annual Convention, among others.
