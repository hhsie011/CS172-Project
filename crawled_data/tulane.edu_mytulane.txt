Canvas easily connects instructors and students and is used to manage active enrollments and assignment submissions, monitor grades, share course documents, and contain course and institutional syllabus information. Canvas provides more modern, mobile, and user-friendly features for collaboration, engagement, and assessment. Canvas also allows us to integrate our digital and academic lives without sacrificing the privacy of either. Visit the Canvas Resource Hub to learn more.
