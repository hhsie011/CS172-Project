Please review external (non-Cornell) postings very carefully and verify employer expectations, job responsibilities, compensation method and employment dates prior to accepting. Beware of phishing attempts (where you are requested to provide personal and confidential information – examples including but not limited to: social security number, date of birth, bank account information, passwords), and/or requests for exchange of monies to occur in order for you to partake in the job. If you are uncertain about the validity of any job, please do not hesitate to contact the Office of Financial Aid and Student Employment. Cornell does not contract with outside vendors to send students information about individual job postings. Be wary of what looks like outside vendors reaching out to you directly about a job opportunity.
