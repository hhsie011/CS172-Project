Educational Spaces Curriculum Parent Handbook Child Development Center All of our lead teachers meet or exceed Kansas licensing standards and regularly participate in continuing education. To ensure the highest quality, class sizes are kept small. Because children are unique and learn in different ways, we tailor lesson plans to each child’s learning style. We also encourage parent involvement through regular parent meetings and information nights. Children of WSU students, faculty, staff and alumni aged 6 weeks to 6 years old are eligible for enrollment based on availability.
