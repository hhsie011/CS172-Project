educational programming to OSU students and alumni through a network of career services offices located throughout campus. Staff members assist students one-on-one in exploring academic majors and careers, offer insight into obtaining part-time jobs through online job listings and other search strategies, host nearly a dozen specialized career fairs each year, and organize Connection Sessions for students to interface with employers. Through campus recruiting, students have access to employment opportunities with thousands of employers annually. Additionally, students receive support with other career-building activities, including campus involvement, job shadowing, leadership, and volunteer experiences to develop the skills necessary for future employment. Career developmental activities, including help in identifying a major well suited to a student’s interests, skills, abilities, and values are facilitated by Career Consultants available in each academic college and the university Career Services office. Career Consultants assist students using various career assessments, followed by one-on-one appointments to offer additional career guidance and information on academic majors. Students can work with a Career Consultant throughout their collegiate career to build professional application materials as they explore internships, full-time employment, or graduate or professional school. In addition to individual consultations, Career Consultants offer mock interviews, career-related workshops, and other professional development programming. All of these services continue as students graduate and become members of the OSU Alumni Association. Job search assistance is available through the Hire System on the departmental website, HireOSUgrads.com. This site allows students and alumni to access the Hire System, where employers interested in hiring OSU students and graduates post opportunities for full-time jobs, internships, co-ops, federal work-study positions, and part-time jobs. Additional job search and preparation tools such as Interview Stream, GoinGlobal, Career Shift and other job search resources and assessments are accessible through HireOSUgrads.com. Career Services offers a number of free and discounted job search supplies to enhance students’ professional image.

Individuals, from both off-campus and on-campus, share their expertise with faculty, students, staff and town's people on a wide variety of topics. Many of the academic units as well as student groups invite speakers to their meetings in order to enhance the educational component of the University. These lectures are generally of interest to specific academic areas, rather than to the general campus. The Student Government Association, through its Speaker’s Board, brings major figures in politics, entertainment, and business to campus. The purpose of the Speaker's Board is to bring speakers of a high caliber to OSU’s campus in order to spark the imagination and interest of the student body. Other student organizations conduct active lecture programs concerning their areas of interest. Allied Arts conducts lecture-demonstrations in conjunction with its performing arts presentations. In this manner, students can gain additional knowledge of the performing arts and its artists. Non-Traditional Student Services The primary goal is to assist nontraditional students, anyone with at least a two-year break in education, by providing support, information and referrals. The coordinator serves as a resource person for the entire campus community and seeks to raise the awareness of faculty, administrators and students with regard to the needs of this special group. All nontraditional students are encouraged to stop by the Department of Leadership and Campus Life Center, 211 Student Union to discuss their concerns or questions. The coordinator also advises students who have rent-related difficulties, such as landlord disputes, or who are looking for housing off-campus.

Working together toward a common goal, the Student Volunteer Center has had an impact on communities worldwide. The focus of the Student Volunteer Center is to provide OSU students with opportunities that reflect academic needs and personal interests. Working with local, state and national non-profit agencies, students at Oklahoma State University are provided with opportunities to grow and excel through meaningful hands-on involvement in service, research and academic activities. Through information sessions and an annual part-time work and service fair, a traditional fall event, the Student Volunteer Center keeps students informed about upcoming events and needs in the local community. Through civic engagement participation, students learn and develop through active participation in thoughtfully organized service experiences that meet actual community needs. Undergraduate students completing 400 hours of service during up to five years at OSU, and graduate students completing 300 hours of service during their academic programs are eligible to wear the Orange Honor CORD at graduation.

Housing and Residential Life Leon McClinton, Jr., PhD—Director of Residential Life Shannon Baughman—Associate Director of Operations: Conferences, Facilities, and Marketing Elizabeth Carver-Cyr, PhD—Assistant Director, Family and Graduate Student Housing LeAnne Hutchins—Interim Assistant Director, Residential Life Tanya Massey—Assistant Director, Residential Life The Department of Housing and Residential Life offers 31 residence halls, six family-first neighborhoods, several special interest housing options and countless leadership activities for residents. Students who live on campus graduate earlier and maintain higher grades than their off-campus counterparts. More than 500 students are involved in planning and leading educational, recreational and social activities within the halls. Freshmen are required to live in campus-approved housing. Students are expected to comply with this University policy. Students who are required to live on campus will automatically be billed and assigned if they fail to submit a housing contract. Subject to verification and authorization by the university, students will be given permission to live off campus provided any one of the exemption categories listed is satisfied: A student is residing and continues to reside in the established primary residence of her/his parents (or legal guardian) if it is within a 30-mile radius of OSU. The parents must have established their primary residency at least six months prior to the request for an exemption. Legal guardianship must have been established by the court of law at least one year prior to a request for an exemption in order to be considered. Click here to download a copy of the Exemption from University Housing form(s); A student is married or has dependent children living with the student; A student is 21 years of age or older on or before the first day of classes of the initial semester of enrollment; A student has successfully completed 28 or more hours of academic credit prior to the student’s enrollment or re-enrollment. Credit earned by exam (Advanced Placement, CLEP, ACT, SAT) and hours received from concurrent high school credit are not considered; A student has served in active military service, as verified by a discharge certificate (DD214); A student presents sufficient evidence of an extreme medical condition, as documented by her/his treating physician for which on-campus accommodations cannot be made. A student presents sufficient evidence of an extreme financial hardship condition based on similar guidelines as for Financial Aid. A student presents sufficient and satisfactory evidence of extreme or unusual hardship that will be intensified by living in the residence halls. All accommodations are rented on a contract date priority basis. While there is no deadline to apply for housing, prospective students are encouraged to return their applications and contracts at least nine months before the desired occupancy. This will improve the chances of receiving the preferred on-campus housing location. Traditional Halls, Suites and Apartments OSU offers four living styles to choose from when picking a place to live: traditional halls, modified traditional halls, suites, and apartments offer a variety of living accommodations. Traditional residence halls include Iba, Parker, Stout and Wentz Halls. University Commons features three modified traditional buildings offering housing for women in University Commons North, and all gender housing in University Commons South and University Commons West. Six suite buildings make up the area referred to as The Village. Suite units are also offered in Bennett, Allen, Booker, Jones, Patchin, Stinchcomb and Zink Halls. Apartments can be found in Bost, Carreker East, Carreker West, Davis, Kamm, Morsani-Smith, Payne-Ellis, Peterson-Friend, Sitlington and Young Halls. All halls are open continuously throughout the academic year. Year round housing (9-month academic contract plus a summer contract) is available as well. Studies show that living on campus can be more affordable than living off campus. Some students save as much as $500 per academic year by living on campus. Just one bill pays for a student's rent, meal plan and all utilities including cable TV and Internet connection. Rates rarely increase during the academic year, even when roommate(s) move out. Students are offered several lifestyle options. University Commons North houses women only. All other halls are co-ed. Residential Life offers numerous Living Learning Programs for students to consider when choosing their housing options. The LLPs are developed as partnerships and provide housing, programming, and faculty interactions based on major or area of interest. A complete list of all Living Learning Communities may be found at reslife.okstate.edu. In every residence hall there is a well-trained, professional staff member to coordinate the day-to-day operations of the building, as well as student staff whose primary function is to see that students benefit educationally from their residential living experience. Each floor or wing has a live-in student staff member, the Community Mentor, who is responsible for assisting and guiding the residents. Student staff members are undergraduate students specially trained in all aspects of residential area living with the experience and knowledge to answer questions and act as an advisor for student governments and programs. Family and Graduate Student Housing Over 450 apartments are available to serve students in the following priority: families, single graduate students, and single, upper-class undergraduate students. Priority is given to those single students who have lived in the residence halls. Apartments are two-bedroom units with optional furnishings. The apartments have sidewalks, off-street parking, play areas and two community laundry facilities. School bus transportation is provided to the Stillwater High, Junior High and Middle schools, and to Westwood and Will Rogers elementary schools. The Family Resource Center, located in the Family and Graduate Student Housing area, offers a variety of programs to meet the needs of the residents. These programs vary depending upon the needs of the clientele. Typical programs include: English as a Second Language class (ESL), after-school programs, children's programs, as well as cultural and social gatherings. Family and Graduate Student Housing provide an on-site staff member, an Apartment Assistant (AA), who is readily available to the residents. Each AA has responsibility for about 90 apartments. The AA's duties include helping residents resolve conflicts, meet neighbors and find appropriate community services. They also provide information about the facilities and the University, and provide referrals to appropriate University offices for residents' needs. The AA can be a very helpful person for all residents.

Disability Accommodations All types of residence halls and many Family and Graduate Student apartments offer housing for students who have impaired mobility. Upon notification, the Department of Housing Residential Life routinely modifies rooms and apartments to meet an individual's special needs. This modification may take several months, so advance notification is critical. Modifications are also available for those with hearing impairments, including bed shakers, strobe lights, and doorbells. Residence Hall Student Organizations Residence halls are popular places to live on the OSU campus. The housing and food service programs have a proud tradition of excellence recognized nationwide. Much of the success of the residence halls is the strong and vital student government system consisting of floor governments, councils for each hall or complex and the Residence Halls Association, which represents all halls on campus. All residence halls on campus combine to form the Residence Halls Association (RHA). The Residence Halls Association acts as the voice of residential area students to the University administration concerning policies and regulations, and coordinates campus-wide activities for the enrichment of residential area living. Each hall has its own elected officers and constitution, and is a part of the RHA system of representative government. There are numerous opportunities for involvement in the halls, such as floor officer, social committees, food committees, and sports and athletic activities. The Prepare to Program Conference is designed to provide incoming students the opportunity to learn about leadership opportunities in the residence halls. To date over 700 students have participated in this leadership development program.

University Dining Services When it comes to food, it's all about choices - and with 30 unique dining options, there's something for every Cowboy. From national franchises to local favorites, healthy meals to indulgent snacks, the possibilities are endless. Whether you want an early-morning coffee or need a late-night snack, we've got it covered. We recognize that our students have varying needs and tastes when it comes to food; that is why we offer some of the most flexible plans in the nation. Being a part of “America’s Healthiest Campus” means there are always well-balanced, nutritious options for our customers. Our Choose Orange food labeling program encourages students to choose healthier options while dining on campus by easily identifying better-for-you choices without having to read a nutrition label. The program is based on the U.S. Dietary Guidelines and qualified items are identified by the Choose Orange icon. All freshmen living on campus are required to have a meal plan at the bronze level or higher. Campus meal plans are available to on- or off-campus students, as well as any staff or faculty member. How our Meal Plans Work One week before the start of each semester, your meal plan amount is automatically loaded on your student ID, which can be swiped at any dining outlet on campus like a debit card. You can immediately spend as much or as little as you want, whenever you want and your balance declines as you make purchases. Your meal plan is valid anywhere you can eat or drink on campus, including on-campus sporting venues. Each item on campus has a dollar value associated with it, and you are only charged that specific amount each time you use your meal plan to dine on campus—no “blocks,” “meals” or limits! Didn’t use your full meal plan this semester? No worries! Each contracted meal plan has a “rollover” amount that will stay with you from semester to semester as long as you maintain a valid meal plan contract for the following term (this does not include the non-contract G plan). To learn more about everything UDS has to offer, please visit dining.okstate.edu. For meal plan questions, call 405-744-4920, email dining@okstate.edu or visit the Meal Plan office at 301 Student Union.

University Health Services Chris Barlow, MHA—Director Oklahoma State University is as interested in the student's physical and emotional well-being as it is in his or her intellectual and cultural development. Good health will not guarantee academic success, but it will help; while poor health, either physical or emotional, can impair both the academic and the extracurricular career. University Health Services maintains a staff of full-time physicians, nurses, laboratory technologists, pharmacists, x-ray technicians, and other necessary support personnel who make a specialty of providing the best possible care at the least possible expense for the student. University Health Services is an ambulatory primary care facility, designed to provide cost-effective, physician-directed health care to students. A list of services provided by University Health Services includes laboratory, x-ray, pharmacy and Nutritional services. A comprehensive list may be found at http://uhs.okstate.edu. In the event a medical condition exists that is beyond the scope of the services offered, referrals can be made to a family physician or a local physician in Stillwater. Emergency services are offered by Stillwater Medical Center 24 hours a day. University Health Services is fully accredited by the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care. Health Requirements All new students are required to complete and submit Immunization records and a health history form. Oklahoma law requires that students report their compliance with certain childhood immunizations: specifically measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), hepatitis B, and meningitis. Students may submit this information electronically by logging into their health portal at https://okstateportal.pointnclick.com and authenticate using their O-key login and password. Additional information about immunization compliance may be found at http://uhs.okstate.edu/. Failure to comply may prevent future enrollment. Tuberculosis Testing International Students All international students are required to be screened for tuberculosis prior to being allowed to complete initial enrollment. This screening must be completed at University Health Services. If screening indicates that TB testing be performed, the student will be responsible for the cost of testing. No tests from outside the US will be accepted. A chest x-ray film from outside the US does NOT satisfy this requirement. Tuberculosis Testing Domestic Students Domestic students who meet any of the following criteria need to be screened for tuberculosis: Students who have resided outside the U.S. for more than eight weeks continuously, or Students with a health/medical condition that suppresses the immune system, or Students with known exposure to someone with active tuberculosis disease. For more information contact: University Health Services 1202 West Farm Road Oklahoma State University Stillwater, Oklahoma, 74078 or download the form from the Internet at uhs.okstate.edu. Mandatory Health Insurance for Non-Immigrant Students The Oklahoma State University Board of Regents requires that non-immigrant students maintain health insurance as a condition of enrollment. The premium for the Student Health Insurance Plan will be included with tuition and fees for all non-immigrant Oklahoma State University Students. Please note that Oklahoma State University Human Resources no longer accepts insurance waivers (even for those who have already purchased their own health insurance). All international students will be enrolled in the university’s insurance. Questions regarding plan details and pricing should be directed towards Oklahoma State University Human Resources. The insurance premium will be waived for students who provide documented evidence of health insurance coverage, including medical evacuation and repatriation, by an employer whose plan meets the standards of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Non-immigrant students employed by OSU and eligible for the OSU employee insurance plan will not be covered by the student plan. Documentation of health insurance through OSU as an employee of OSU must be presented to Oklahoma State University Human Resources. Students employed by OSU as either Graduate Teaching Assistants or Graduate Research Assistants may receive the Student Insurance Plan as part of their assistantship. Please inquire about that with the academic department in which the assistantship is located. If you have an appointment as an OSU Graduate Teaching or Research Assistant, OSU provides the student health insurance policy for you. You will be required to submit a request for waiver. Waivers are required to be submitted by the end of the fifth day of classes. Waiver forms can be found at http://iss.okstate.edu/.
