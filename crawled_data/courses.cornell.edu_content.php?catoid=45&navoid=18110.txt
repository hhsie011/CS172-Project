In cases where the only alternative is to hold evening preliminary examinations, they may be scheduled only on Tuesday and Thursday evenings and only after 7:30 p.m. Large courses (over 30) may schedule evening exams only with prior permission from the Office of the Dean of Faculty. Instructors holding evening examinations are strongly urged to indicate this in syllabi and other course materials, and must notify students of the dates of such examinations as early as possible in the semester. Exceptions to the regulations on evening preliminary examinations require permission from the Office of the Dean of Faculty. For more information see the Rules About Prelims, or contact the office of the dean of the faculty: deanoffaculty@cornell.edu. The prelim exam schedule is made available at registrar.cornell.edu/exams.
