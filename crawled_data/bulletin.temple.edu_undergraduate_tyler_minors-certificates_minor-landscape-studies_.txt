Through this minor, students complete courses that deepen their understanding of the relationship between the natural landscape and the human-made environment, but without the professional focus of the bachelor's degree in Landscape Architecture. The minor prepares students for lifelong contributions as informed, civically engaged, and environmentally conscious citizens. The curriculum for the Minor in Landscape Studies involves 18 credits, with one required course and at least five elective courses. The required course ensures that all students have a solid understanding of the fundamentals of Landscape Studies, including history, theory, and the relationship between the natural and built environments. The electives allow students to explore their own interests in different facets of Landscape Studies. The coursework completed for the minor allows students the opportunity to consider majoring in Landscape Architecture. Requirements Students must earn a minimum grade of C- in courses satisfying minor requirements and must have a minimum 2.0 grade point average in the required 18 credits to earn the minor. A student may not double count any course for the Minor in Landscape Studies toward any other major, minor, or certificate. At least half of the courses for the minor must be taken at Temple University. Courses for the minor must be completed prior to graduation.
