6:00 PM Casa da Liberdade Two hundred years ago, the English poet Percy Shelley wrote that poets are “the unacknowledged legislators of the world.” Twenty years ago, Octavio Paz defined poetry as “the antidote to the marketplace.” What is the role of art, and of the artist, in modern society? Has it really changed over time, or not? Has the interface of digital technology and art changed what it means to be an artist, and if so, have things changed for better or worse? Do writers and artists in the United States and Brazil share the same experience in an increasingly globalized world, or are there significant differences between the two artistic cultures? Please join Daniella Diniz and William Wadsworth at Casa da Liberdade, during the Paraty International Literary Fair (Festa Literária Internacional de Paraty - FLIP), for a conversation about “The Dimensions of Creativity: The Role of Writers and Artists in the Age of the Internet”. Daniella Diniz is Program Manager at the Columbia Global Centers | Rio de Janeiro, managing programs and institutional communication of Columbia University in Brazil. She holds a PhD in Latin American Cultures from Columbia University and has over ten years of academic experience in theory, sociology, history and cultural studies. Her work focus on topics such as public sphere, intellectuals and networks, modernism and Brazilian social thought in the 20th century. She holds a BA in Sociology and two Master degrees: in Brazilian History (from Universidade Federal Fluminense) and in Latin American studies from Columbia University. William Wadsworth is the Columbia University School of the Arts Director of Academic Administration of the Graduate Writing Program and a member of the Adjunct Faculty. His work has appeared in The New Republic, The Paris Review, The Yale Review, Tin House, and the Boston Review, among other magazines, as well as in several anthologies, including The Best American Erotic Poems, edited by David Lehman, and the Library of America Anthology of American Religious Poems, edited by Harold Bloom.
