Baylor faculty members and students have already gained traction in harnessing research and scholarship to address the root causes of migration that hinder thriving communities on a global scale. Baylor in Latin America will provide an interdisciplinary center of gravity for academic engagement that seeks to understand the movement of populations across borders in ways that consider potential for individuals, families, and communities to flourish on a global scale. Baylor researchers also are studying the prevalence and impact of human trafficking on our state and nation. Through force, fraud, and coercion, individuals are being exploited as commodities. Working together, faculty, advocates, researchers, students, and alumni are raising awareness, providing support and changing laws and policies to combat this growing industry.. “The question for most of us is not whether we should stop traffickers, but whether we can. We are now seeing effective strategies that answer that question with a quantifiable and resounding ‘yes.’ Disciplined leadership in identifying and scaling what works could have a transforming impact on the lives of millions of human trafficking victims in the United States and across the globe.” Victor Butros, BA ’98, Co-Founder Human Trafficking Institute Illuminate Five Initiatives Baylor in Latin America Immigration, Migration, and Human Trafficking About Back Baylor's Vision, Pro Futuris Illuminate Overview Progress Report - October 2021 Four Pillars Back Christian Environment Transformational Education Research and Scholarship Arts and Athletics Five Initiatives Back Health Back Environmental Determinants Family and Community Determinants Biomedical Research Health Policy, Law, Leadership and Ethics Undergraduate Health and Medical Education Data Sciences Materials Science Human Flourishing, Leadership, and Ethics Baylor in Latin America Back Health and Disease Prevention Business Development and International Trade Human Capital Formation and Education Immigration, Migration, and Human Trafficking Congregational Development Democratic Governance and Economics Culture and Arts Give Light General Information Academics & Research Administration Admissions Gateways for ...
