The Office for Student Affairs will write a letter of support confirming the graduate’s student status, the date of the graduation ceremony, and requesting that the visa be granted so that your guest(s) can attend your graduation. An electronic PDF will be mailed to your Harvard email address. We try to be as quick as possible but letters can take up to 5 business days to process after the request is received by OSA. We will email you when your letters are ready. Please note that there is a limited number of ceremony tickets available per graduating student. News from the School Congratulations graduates!
