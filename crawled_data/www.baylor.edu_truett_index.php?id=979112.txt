Truett Seminary>Admissions>Apply>Master's Degrees>Admissions FAQ Admissions FAQ General Admissions, Application, and Transcript Questions 1. How do I apply to Truett? The Truett Seminary application is available online and may be accessed here. Admissions requirements, deadlines, and additional information can be found here. 2. I have a BearID but I do not remember my password. What should I do? If you previously received a BearID from Baylor (as a former student or employee), but you do not remember your credentials, you can contact the Baylor HelpDesk at 254-710-4357 to receive assistance recovering your password. 3. I do not have a bachelor's degree. Can I still apply to Truett? Yes, you may apply to Truett without a bachelor's degree. Students who do not have a bachelor's degree are evaluated and admitted by the Admissions Committee on a case-by-case basis. Please note that a bachelor's degree is required for all associated joint degree programs. 4. I am interested in one of the joint degree programs. How do I proceed with my application? Joint degree students must apply to and be accepted to both Truett Seminary and the appropriate joint degree program (MBA, MSW, etc.). Applications for the joint degree programs can be found on the school/college websites where the degrees are housed or through the links below: Master of Social Work Master of Business Administration MSEd or MA in Curriculum and Instruction Juris Doctor Master of Music 5. I am having trouble logging into my application. What should I do? For assistance logging into your application, please contact the Baylor HelpDesk at 254-710-4357 or email helpdesk@baylor.edu. 6. When will I know if I am accepted to Truett? Truett admissions decisions are released on a schedule that may be found on our website here. 7. Is it possible to defer my acceptance? If I decide to defer, will I keep my scholarship? Students accepted for admission will be given one year in which to enroll. Students who fail to enroll within three semesters of receiving notification of acceptance are required to reapply with a new application for reconsideration of admission. A student who chooses to defer enrollment will forfeit any competitive scholarship awarded. In order to be reconsidered for a competitive scholarship, the student will need to submit a new scholarship application for a future term. In addition, tuition, fees, and general scholarship rates vary each semester and are determined by enrollment date, not acceptance date. So, for a student who defers enrollment, the general scholarship amounts awarded upon enrollment may not match those offered with the student's original admittance. 8. I do not meet the stated GPA requirements. Can I still apply to Truett? Yes, you may apply to Truett without meeting the minimum required GPA. Please note that students who do not meet the GPA requirement are evaluated and admitted by the Admissions Committee on a case-by-case basis. 9. Can I change my entry term on the application? If you have not submitted your application, you can change your entry term on your application at any time. If you have already submitted your application, please email truett_admissions@baylor.edu with your new preferred entry term so that our team may assist you in changing it. 10. I applied for the Master of Theological Studies (MTS) but want to change to the Master of Divinity (MDiv), can I change my degree program? If you have not submitted your application, you may update your selected program within your application at any time. If you have already submitted your application, please email truett_admissions@baylor.edu with your new preferred degree program so that our team may assist you in changing it. 11. My application checklist says I am still missing a transcript, but I turned one in. What happened? A missing checklist notation may be caused by one of the following: Truett Seminary has not yet received your transcript. Physical transcripts sometimes take weeks to arrive. While waiting for your official transcript to be delivered, you may upload an unofficial transcript to your application dashboard to expedite review of your application. Truett Seminary has received your transcript, but it has not yet processed. This can take several days once the transcript has been delivered. You sent your transcript to "Baylor Graduate Admissions" rather than "Truett Seminary Admissions." If this is the case, please email truett_admissions@baylor.edu, so we may request that your transcript be transferred to Truett. You submitted an unofficial or incomplete transcript instead of an official/final transcript. A transcript is only considered official and final if it was received by Truett directly from the issuing institution and lists a degree conferred date. Your application can still be reviewed by the Admissions Committee if you have submitted an unofficial or incomplete transcript. However, if you are accepted, you must submit a final transcript to Truett during your first semester of seminary. 12. I am a current Baylor student applying to Truett. Can you just get my transcripts from Baylor? Truett Seminary is unable to request applicant transcripts from Baylor University. You will need to (1) order either a physical or digital copy and send it to the Graduate Admissions Office, and then (2) notify Truett Seminary at truett_admissions@baylor.edu. Baylor students may request a transcript here. 13. Do I need to submit a transcript from my high school? Junior college? From my other master's program? Truett Seminary requires transcripts from all higher education institutions from which you received a degree or earned graduate-level transcripts. To further clarify: You do not need to submit high school transcripts. You do not need to submit community college or junior college transcripts if you did not receive a degree from them. If you did receive a degree - including an associate's degree - you do need to submit the associated transcript. If you earned graduate-level credit of any kind - especially seminary credit - you do need to submit the associated transcript from that institution. 14. Does the pastor recommendation need to be my current pastor? No, the recommendation does not need to come from your current pastor. We suggest selecting the pastor who knows you the best. 15. Does the pastor recommendation need to be a senior pastor? No, the pastor recommendation does not need to come from a senior pastor. Your pastor recommendation may come from another pastor on staff who knows you better than your senior pastor. 16. My recommendations are not coming in. What can I do? You are able to change your recommendations at any time before they have been received. You may also send reminders to your recommenders through your Application Dashboard through the link located at the bottom of the Checklist. 17. Can a recommendation come from someone related to me? No, Truett Seminary does not accept recommendations from persons related to the applicant. 18. I have recommendation letters from my designated recommenders. Can I just submit those? The Recommendation Form is a required part of the Truett application process with standardized questions for each recommender. However, your recommenders are welcome to send an additional recommendation letter to the Truett Admissions Office. The Admissions Committee will take this letter into account when reviewing the student's application. 19. I have been accepted to Truett Seminary! When can I register for classes? After you confirm your intent to enroll at Truett and pay your enrollment deposit, you will receive instructions about registering for classes. Registration for the fall semester opens for incoming students mid-spring. 20. I have paid my deposit. Why can I not register for classes? Deposits can take approximately 48 hours to process. If you are still unable to register for classes after 48 hours, please contact truett_admissions@baylor.edu for additional support. 21. Does Truett Seminary provide assistance locating and securing student housing? Please visit www.baylor.edu/truett/housing for information about Truett Designated Housing, roommate lists, and other available housing. Baylor University also offers a Guide to Off Campus Housing here. 22. Does Truett offer online classes? Truett offers a number of occasional online classes each semester but does not offer any degrees that can be completed 100% online. However, Truett does offer a Certificate Program that can be completed entirely online. Learn more about this program here.
