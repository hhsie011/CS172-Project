This multimedia exhibit includes engaging video and storm simulations, a “check your knowledge” interactive station, and a dramatic inside look at a high-tech Argo float from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, one of more than 4,000 deployed worldwide to monitor global oceans and climate. Developed in collaboration with the Harvard University Center for the Environment and informed by new Harvard research, the exhibit offers visitors the unfettered facts—the knowns and unknowns—about one of the greatest challenges the world faces. This exhibit was made possible with generous financial support from Clark Bernard MBA ’68 and Susana Bernard, together with Jonathan Goldstein MBA ‘90, and Kaia, Annika and Skylar Goldstein in honor of Professor James J.
