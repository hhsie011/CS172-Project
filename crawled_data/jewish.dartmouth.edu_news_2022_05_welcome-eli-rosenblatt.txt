His research focuses on modern Judaism, with a particular emphasis on Ashkenazic and Atlantic Jewish cultures in the 19th and 20th centuries. He is most recently the author of "Sphinx Upon the Dnieper: Black Modernism and the Yiddish Translation of Race," an article in the Slavic Review which examines the Yiddish-language translations of the Harlem Renaissance writers in their political and cultural contexts. He completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the Frankel Institute for Advanced Judaic Studies at the University of Michigan, and has taught at Berkeley, George Washington University, and Georgetown University's Walsh School of Foreign Service. His two current book projects explore the ways in which modern Jewish writers, intellectuals, and activists received and interpreted racial language and politics, both in Eastern Europe and in the Caribbean country of Suriname, home to one of the oldest existing Jewish communities in the Western Hemisphere.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Jewish Studies Program Undergraduate Minor Overview Courses Awards & Prizes Plotnick Prize Winners Resources Alumni Stories Foreign Study Overview Frequently Asked Questions News & Events News & Events Lectures People Faculty & Staff My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
