During the 2006-2007 academic year, a proposal for a five-year dual degree program was developed and after approval by the governing boards and trustees from both Brown and the RISD, President Simmons and President Mandle signed a memorandum and established the Dual Degree Program in September of 2007. The establishment of the Dual Degree Program built upon the institutions' long-standing cooperative relationship and cross-registration agreement. The Program was in part derived by the desire to facilitate and formalize the means to complete both a degree from Brown and a Degree from RISD, something a few students were managing to do by transferring back and forth between the two institutions! The first Brown|RISD Dual Degree cohort, the BRDD Class of 2013, was admitted in the Fall of 2008.
