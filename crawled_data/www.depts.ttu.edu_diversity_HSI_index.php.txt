As a result, because Texas Tech's undergraduate student enrollment is at least 25% Hispanic, Texas Tech University meets the minimum Hispanic student enrollment required for status as an Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI). Achievement of full HSI status will mean many new opportunities for Texas Tech faculty, researchers, and students. In the near term, surpassing the 25 percent threshold of Hispanic undergraduate students will allow TTU faculty and researchers to apply for grants funded by entities such as the National Science Foundation, the Department of Agriculture, the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Once full HSI status is achieved, Texas Tech will be eligible for up to $8 - $10 million in additional grant funding a year, including Title III and Title V grants funded by the U.S. Department of Education. As a result of this added funding, the entire university will benefit from the achievement of HSI status and new opportunities that will be available in research, teaching, outreach, and community engagement.
