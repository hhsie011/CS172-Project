This program invites students to combine engineering coursework that focuses on "green" and sustainable engineering with a fast-track German course (GERM 2–3) that satisfies Dartmouth's foreign language requirement. It is also open to students who already have German language skills beyond the beginner's level. The program takes place in Berlin, Germany's self-proclaimed "capital of sustainability." It takes students to a full-immersion setting and cultural environment in which sustainability is a lived practice. The program structure is flexible, giving students options to customize their course choices in accordance with their D-plans. Click here for details.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of German Studies Undergraduate Overview Why Study German?
