If you are planning to pursue professional licensure or certification in a state other than Texas, it is strongly recommended that you contact the appropriate licensing entity in that state to seek information and guidance regarding licensure or certification requirements before beginning an academic program. For more information on professional licensure requirements in the field, please contact Meera Rajagopalan in the School of Nursing’s Office of Student Services (ss@nursing.utexas.edu; 512-232-4780) or visit UT Austin’s professional licensure disclosure page.
