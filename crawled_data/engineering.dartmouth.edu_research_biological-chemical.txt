Dartmouth facilitates investigations tackling both focused and multidisciplinary problems. Graduate engineering students are expected to actively participate in developing a plan of study that supports their interests, potentially including distinctive intellectual paths unconstrained by disciplinary boundaries and enriched by interdisciplinary synergies. B&CE faculty are committed to building research and educational communities that are high-achieving, impactful, collaborative, and inclusive. On This Page Overview & Faculty Overview & Faculty Our collective research activities can be mapped onto a landscape defined by both impact (health and energy), and scale (molecular, cellular, and systems). Collaborative projects include: synthetic bio-molecular circuits in living cells; immune response profiling, modeling, and modulation; biotherapeutics and vaccine design; plant biomass-derived fuels (biofuels); process design innovations for feedstocks, land use, environmental protection, and economic development.
