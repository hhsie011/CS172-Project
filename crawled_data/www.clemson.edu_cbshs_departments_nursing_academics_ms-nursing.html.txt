(clinical nurse specialist and nurse educator). Students develop critical thinking skills, enhance their knowledge base and hone skills learned in their undergraduate programs through simulation, clinical rotations in primary care facilities and lecture content. Many Students get the opportunity to participate in an international learning experience. The nursing program offers students the opportunity every year in March to participate in a medical trip to central or South America. This international learning experience allows students to provide health care to the indigenous people of remote jungle locations. Students are able to build critical thinking skills by assessing and treating patients without the modern conveniences of laboratory access, x-ray, CT, ultrasound facilities or commonly used medications. Students also get to mentor the undergraduate BSN students during the experience. The Master of Science nursing program is offered exclusively at our satellite office in Greenville, South Carolina on the campus of Greenville Memorial Hospital.
