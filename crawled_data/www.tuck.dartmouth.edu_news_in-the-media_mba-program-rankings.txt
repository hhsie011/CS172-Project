Each ranking evaluates a different set of criteria, surveys different audiences, and measures various aspects of a program. Each tries to provide information that will help prospective students and other businesspeople understand more about a school. While we recognize the importance of business school rankings and welcome the constructive feedback they can provide, Tuck's strategy remains consistent with our values and objectives. We will continue to focus on making the Tuck MBA the best educational experience in the world, with great professors giving unprecedented access to outstanding students. Currently, Tuck participates in six annual or biennial rankings: Bloomberg Businessweek, The Economist, Financial Times, Forbes, Fortune, and U.S. News & World Report. Current Rankings BLOOMBERG BUSINESSWEEK September 2021 Tuck placed #2 in the Bloomberg Businessweek ranking of full-time MBA programs. The ranking methodology for U.S. schools weighs five different indexes: compensation, networking, learning, entrepreneurship, diversity, and is based on surveys of students, alumni and MBA recruiters. THE ECONOMIST October 2019 Tuck was ranked #10 by The Economist among full-time MBA programs in the U.S., and #12 among programs around the world. The annual ranking is based on four factors The Economist identifies as the primary reasons students pursue an MBA: to open new career opportunities (weighted at 35%), for personal development and educational experience (35%), to increase salary (20%), and to build a professional network (10%). Once again, Tuck’s alumni network was ranked #1 for its effectiveness. FINANCIAL TIMES February 2022 Tuck placed #12 among U.S. schools and #18 worldwide in the Financial Times' 2022 ranking of the 100 best full-time MBA programs. The rankings are calculated as an aggregation of 20 distinct measures of a school’s performance. FORBES September 2019 Forbes ranked Tuck #6 in its ranking of the best business schools in the country. Forbes ranks business schools biennially based on the return on investment for its graduates. Forbes surveys alumni and determines return on investment by looking at five-year total compensation after graduation, minus the sum of tuition and forgone compensation. The survey listed 61 U.S. programs in total. FORTUNE July 2021 Tuck was ranked #10 in Fortune’s inaugural ranking of traditional full-time MBA programs. This ranking is based on an outcome score (65 percent), a Fortune-created brand score (25 percent), and a Fortune 1000 score (10 percent). U.S. NEWS & WORLD REPORT March 2022 Tuck was ranked #11 in the annual U.S. News & World Report ranking of full-time MBA programs. This ranking is based on a combination of surveys of deans and recruiters and statistical indicators that measure the quality of a school's students and employment results.
