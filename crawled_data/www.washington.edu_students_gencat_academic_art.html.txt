Bachelor of Design degree with a major in Industrial Design Credential Overview The Industrial Design program at the University of Washington, one of several undergraduate programs in the School of Art, has evolved over the past forty years. It is a professional program aimed primarily at industrial design practice in the corporate and institutional innovation sector where new technologies lead to the development of new forms of products, processes, and service from a human-centered design perspective. The ID course of undergraduate study is an intensive program emphasizing the development of form that is derived from patterns of use, requirements for function, constraints imposed by industrial manufacturing and aesthetics driven by social context. Key aspects in this view on design are understanding the interactions between people and technology. Students are trained to identify design challenges and to envision promising strategies for design responses, communication, documentation, and organizational skills to conduct the design process from project brief to design implementation.

Interaction Designers create compelling relationships between people and the interactive systems they use, from computers to mobile devices to appliances; Interaction Designers lay the groundwork for intangible experiences. The need for interaction designers for the development of new interactive products, systems and services has increased exponentially in recent years in virtually all industries. Interactive systems are present in many areas in everyday life where people coordinate tasks and engage in activities in collaboration with others, facilitated through technology. Examples range from mobile phones to computer software, from GPS systems for cars or navigation in the open ocean, and information systems that support the work of expert practitioners in technology-driven domains such as aviation, medicine, and process control.
