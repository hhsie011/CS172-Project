NOTE: "Need" is what we estimate your cost of attendance to be, minus your expected family contribution. Once we've determined how much money you're going to need, we go to work to create a financial aid package for you. You may be surprised at the amount we estimate your cost of attendance to be. This is because we take into account not only the price of tuition and books, but also the cost of rent, food, clothing, travel and other essentials that you're going to need for the year.
