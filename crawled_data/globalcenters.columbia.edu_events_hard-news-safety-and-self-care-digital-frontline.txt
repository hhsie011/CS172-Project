Mobile technologies, social media platforms and photo- and video-sharing services allow journalists and journalistic organizations to report both intimately and extensively than ever. But these new technologies also bring new risks: being a journalist today often means working with disturbing imagery, messages and materials, while having an online presence can expose journalists to reputation and other online attacks. This panel discussion will address both the ways that journalists' work makes them vulnerable and how they can best protect themselves from the negative aspects of working online, while still successfully creating significant, high-quality journalism.

McGregor is Assistant Director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism & Assistant Professor of Columbia Journalism School, where she helps supervise the dual-degree programs in Journalism and Computer Science. She teaches primarily in areas of data journalism and information visualization, with research interests in digital security, knowledge management, and alternative forms of digital distribution.
