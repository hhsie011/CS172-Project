Each Fall Semester and each Spring Semester normally includes approximately fifteen weeks of instruction plus one week of final examinations. A normal Summer Session includes approximately eleven weeks of instruction plus one week of final examinations. Each Academic Year consists of one sequence of a Fall Semester followed by a Spring Semester. The word "term" may refer to a Fall Semester, a Spring Semester, or a Summer Session. The Office of the Registrar publishes the official Academic Calendar for each term. Due to variations in the yearly calendar and the need to balance the dates of campus events, particularly in the Fall Semester, the Registrar uses discretion, as appropriate, to set dates on the Academic Calendar, such as Fall Recess, the Last Day to Withdraw from Individual Courses without a Penalty, and the Progress Report Grade Due Date.
