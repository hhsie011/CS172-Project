He is also the director of the Texas A&M College of Medicine Institute for Regenerative Medicine at Scott & White in Temple, Texas. He received his AB in philosophy from Haverford College in 1951 and a MA in animal physiology from Brasenose College at Oxford University in 1953. He was awarded his MD from the University of Pennsylvania in 1956 and worked at the National Institutes of Health from 1956-1961 while earning a PhD in biochemistry from George Washington University. He rose to the rank of professor at the School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania from 1961-72. He was chair of biochemistry at University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey from 1972-1986, chair of biochemistry and director of the Jefferson Institute for Molecular Medicine at Jefferson Medical College from 1986-1996, director of the Center for Gene Therapy at Hahnemann/Allegheny/Drexel from 1996-2000 and director of the Center for Gene Therapy at Tulane University Health Science Center from 2000-2008. Prockop has authored or co‐authored more than 600 publications, is a frequent speaker at distinguished international events pertaining to matrix biology and stem cell science, and has been awarded three honorary degrees. Amongst his many accomplishments are appointments to both the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Medicine, and the National Academy of Inventors. Prockop joined the faculty at the Texas A&M University Health Science Center in August 2008. Research Interests Currently we are studying the small vesicles called exosomes produced by adult stem/progenitor cells from bone marrow referred to as mesenchymal stem cells, multipotent stromal cells or MSCs. The cells have the remarkable ability to home to injured tissues and repair them by a variety of mechanisms that include differentiation, immune modulation, suppression of inflammation, stimulation of tissue-endogenous stem/progenitor cells, and perhaps transfer of mitochondria. Recently we and others found that many of the beneficial effects of MSCs are explained by their secretion of exosomes. We are characterizing the properties of exosomes secreted by MSCs and with other members of the IRM examining their therapeutic benefits in models for traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, diabetes and Alzheimer's disease.
