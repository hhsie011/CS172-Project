THIS WAS BEFORE MY TIME AND I’M WRITING THE CAPTION ALSO BEFORE MY TIME, ASSUMING EVERYONE IS HAVING FUN Beyond a competitive campus organization, we are a close-knit group of friends with shared memories of anything from karaoke-ing in car rides to napping between tournament rounds. We host numerous community events throughout the year including trips to Ben & Jerry’s and to the Dartmouth Skiway, and an annual end-of-year banquet. PRACTICES We hold practices every Monday, Thursday, and Sunday. During practice, we hold practice rounds, plan for upcoming tournaments, and do drills to improve our general knowledge and debate skills. We occasionally host guest speakers during practice.
