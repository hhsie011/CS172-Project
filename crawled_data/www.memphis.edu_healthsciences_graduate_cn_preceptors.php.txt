Registered dietitians, certified dietary managers, nutrition and dietetic technicians and registered nurses are examples of experts who qualify to serve as preceptors to our two programs. According the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, "Preceptors make a difference in the lives of students who are learning to become registered dietitian nutritionists or nutrition and dietetics technicians, registered by acting as a mentor and training the dietetic professionals of the future." They provide experiences for you which are crucial in your success in becoming a RD. ACEND® has unveiled a database which allows practitioners to register to potentially become preceptors and join the effort to guide and educate the next generation of dietetic professionals. The Find-a-Preceptor Database allows program directors and students who are members of the Academy to search for a preceptor within a certain geographical or specialty area. The University of Memphis values our preceptors. We continue to provide resources, such as continuing education credits, for our preceptors to strengthen their skills.
