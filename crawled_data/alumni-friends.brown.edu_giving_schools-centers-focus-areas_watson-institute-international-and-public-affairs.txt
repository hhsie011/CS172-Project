Through BrownTogether, we will amplify this impact. “ Through our combination of deep regional expertise, social scientific rigor and extensive collaboration with colleagues across campus, across the country and around the world, we at Watson are working to solve the most pressing challenges of our time. ” Edward Steinfeld Howard R. Swearer Director of the Thomas J. Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs; Dean’s Professor of China Studies; professor of political science By raising targeted investments through BrownTogether, Watson will secure its standing as a consequential and unique contributor of solutions to current social, economic and political challenges, and to the creation of knowledge needed to address the policy issues of the future. The campaign will build the faculty expertise, research capacity, and partnerships necessary for Watson to achieve this vision.
