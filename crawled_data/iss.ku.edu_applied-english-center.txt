There is no minimum English proficiency test score, however, applicants to KU must submit scores to be considered for admission. Students with the following scores are not required to take the English placement test and will be qualified to enroll in full-time degree coursework: 79 or above on the TOEFL iBT (with consistent part scores 18 and above), or 550 or above on the paper-based TOEFL (with consistent part scores), or 6.5 or above on the IELTS (with consistent part scores) If students do not meet the above score criteria, they will be tested for English proficiency by the Applied English Center (AEC) when they arrive at KU. The AEC test will determine whether they enroll in full-time or part-time intensive English coursework or whether they will be eligible to begin full-time academic studies. Alternate measures of English proficiency are explained at http://irua.ku.edu/english-requirements.
