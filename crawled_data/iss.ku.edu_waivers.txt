To receive an insurance waiver, your insurance must meet all the Kansas Board of Regents (KBOR) minimum requirements or your waiver will be denied. Stand-alone travel and/or emergency/urgent care only coverage is not acceptable. Waivers will be accepted and processed by ECI Services for 2021-2022 academic year Fall 2021 7/26/2021 – 8/23/2021 (first day of classes) Spring 2022 11/29/2021 – 1/18/2022 (first day of classes) Summer 2022 4/25/2022 – 6/7/2022 (first day of classes) If your insurance waiver request is submitted during the above insurance waiver processing dates and your insurance plan meets all the KBOR minimum insurance requirements, a waiver will be granted and the insurance fee will be removed from your Enroll & Pay account. Plans which do not meet the KBOR minimum insurance requirements will not be approved for a waiver, the insurance fee will be assessed to your student account and you will automatically be enrolled in the KU UnitedHealthcare StudentResource (UHCSR) student insurance plan for the semester. How to submit a waiver If you do not want the UnitedHealthcare StudentResources (UHCSR) insurance plan, you must do the following: Set up an account with ECI Services. Log into your ECI Services account to go to the waiver portal administered by ECI Services. Enter your insurance information on the Waiver Form and upload a copy of the front and back sides of your insurance card. Waiver requests will be accepted and processed by ECI Services only during the insurance waiver processing dates listed above. If you have questions regarding waivers, please contact ECI Services on behalf of the University of Kansas at 833-249-0574, or via e-mail at ku.waive@eciservices.com. For questions about the removal of the premium charge on your student tuition and fees account, please contact the ISS Insurance Team at issinsurance@ku.edu.
