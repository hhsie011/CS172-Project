By doing this, we hope to improve causal inference, identify at-risk populations, and potentially discover pre-clinical markers of disease related to chemical exposures. We have undertaken targeted studies to show how chemicals affect a single biological pathway and whether that biological pathway affects child health. More recently, we have begun using untargeted ‘-omics’ technologies, like DNA methylation and metabolomics, to understand the relations of a larger number of biological pathways to environmental exposures and human health.
