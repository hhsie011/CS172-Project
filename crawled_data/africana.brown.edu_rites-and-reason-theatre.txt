He Rises in Spirit and Power Rites and Reason Theatre Rites and Reason Theatre is a research and development theatre producing new creative works that analyze and articulate the experiences and expressions of the African Diaspora. 50 Years and Beyond Within Africana cultural traditions, art is a creative manifestation of thought and culture. As such, Rites and Reason is a space for artists, writers, and scholars to explore and engage Africana intellectual and cultural traditions together, translating them into innovative theatrical and expressive forms. Alongside the academic department, Rites and Reason provides a critical, scholarly space to explore the essential creative practices of the Diaspora, while training students and collaborators to utilize and interpret the performing arts rooted in Africana cultural traditions and expressions. Rites and Reason enjoys strong and productive partnerships with Tougaloo College, the National Black Theatre in Harlem, the Brown/Trinity MFA Program, AS220, and many other organizations in the Providence community and beyond. Current Season and Upcoming Projects Due to the ongoing Covid-19 crisis, Rites and Reason has been tasked with translating its work to the digital world. Though our season will look like none we have seen before, we are hard at work finding new and meaningful ways to connect with our community.
