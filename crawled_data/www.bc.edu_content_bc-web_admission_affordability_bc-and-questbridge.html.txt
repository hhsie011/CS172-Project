This partnership will enhance the University’s ability to identify and enroll gifted students from a wide range of communities throughout the country, while lessening the financial burden by providing them with a full four-year scholarship. High school seniors who have shown outstanding academic ability despite financial challenges should consider applying through the QuestBridge National College Match. Seniors who are successful with their application and selected as National College Match Finalists will then have the option to apply to Boston College through Questbridge’s National College Match process, or through traditional Early Decision II or Regular Decision application plans. For those students who do not match, they may still be considered for admission and generous financial aid, as Boston College is committed to meeting the full demonstrated need of all applicants. In addition, the QuestBridge organization also manages a College Prep Scholars Program that provides high school juniors with a variety of opportunities to assist them in their search process, which may include a full scholarship to attend a college summer program, assistance with their college essay, or an invitation to attend a QuestBridge National College Admissions Conference. Applications are typically due in late March. Should any specific questions arise regarding the QuestBridge process at Boston College, please contact Danielle Wells.
