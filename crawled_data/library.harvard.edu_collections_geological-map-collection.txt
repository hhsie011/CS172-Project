Cabot Science Library maintains one of the largest geological map collections in the world, covering all sectors of the earth as well as the planets in our solar system. The 40,000+ paper maps, dating back to the 1700s and through the present day, cover nearly every country in the world. Type of maps include: surface and bedrock topographical tectonic hydrological mineralogical mining and other economic maps (e.g. coal, gas and oil) gravimetric The collection has a very strong focus on New England and includes more specific collections, such as a set of Boston tunnel maps. A significant amount of the collection is derived from the U.S. Geological Survey, as well as similar national surveys in Canada, the United Kingdom, Russia and Australia. Maps are collected in all languages and scales vary from very small to quite large. Accessing These Materials Print indexes are available for many regions, but all maps have been catalogued and are accessible via HOLLIS, where you can search by title, subject or cartographer.
