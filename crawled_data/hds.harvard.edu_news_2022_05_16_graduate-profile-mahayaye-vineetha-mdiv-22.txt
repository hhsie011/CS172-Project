How I've Changed Before coming to HDS, I was not willing to explore and embrace the beauty of diversity. My professors and loving friends at HDS opened my eyes to witness the beauty of diversity. Memorable Moment A moment sitting on the bench against the James Room wall inside Swartz Hall, August 2021. Favorite Class or Professor Buddhist Narratives with Professor Hallisey. I like all of his classes. Message of Thanks I want to thank my family, Professor Hallisey, Professor Gyatso, Professor Berlin, all other professors, the Buddhist Ministry Initiative at HDS, Laura Tuach, and all of my loving friends. What I Hope to Be Remembered By Inexpressible in words. Future Plans No plans for now. I want to fly like a bird one day.
