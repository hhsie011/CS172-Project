Council members work to strengthen the relationship between HGSE and its alumni through engagement and outreach, including event development and support, Admissions recruitment, strengthening volunteer opportunities, and broadening alumni networks. Council members serve as both representatives of the larger alumni body and as sources of information for the Office of Alumni Relations. Each year, the Alumni Council also selects an Alumni Council Award recipient, based on nominations from the HGSE alumni community. Alumni Admissions Ambassadors Program Alumni play a critical role in HGSE recruitment efforts by identifying prospective candidates and sharing their experiences and insights. If you are interested in getting involved in outreach, the Admissions Office invites you to volunteer for the Alumni Admissions Ambassador Program (AAAP). Student-Alumni Mentoring Initiative (SAMI) The Student-Alumni Mentoring Initiative strives to accomplish varying goals related to the establishment of mutually beneficial mentoring relationships among participants. The program pairs current HGSE students with alumni during the academic year and the Alumni Relations office facilitates events and communications for SAMI participants to help make the matches a meaningful experience for both parties. The Alumni Mentor application opens each August. Become an i-Lab Advisor Are you an alum with start-up experience? Industry expertise?
