Boston College policies are of two types, as outlined in the policy entitled "Development of University Policies." A University Policy is an official directive of broad and direct application across schools and other administrative units of the University. As such, University Policies impose binding obligations on faculty, students and/or staff, as applicable. The purpose of University policies is to ensure through uniform procedures and standards, (i) compliance with applicable laws and regulations, (ii) adoption of operational efficiencies and best ethical practices, and (iii) promotion of mission-centered values and objectives. University Policies are formulated under the direction of the Executive Vice President and are approved and promulgated by the President of the University. An Administrative Policy is a statement of the standards, practices and/or procedures of an administrative unit of the University as promulgated by the Vice President or other senior officer having charge of such unit. Accordingly, Administrative Policies pertain to matters within the exclusive function of a particular administrative unit, notwithstanding possibly broad impact across the University. Examples of important Administrative Policies include the Faculty Handbook promulgated by the Office of the Provost and Dean of Faculties, the Student Code of Conduct promulgated by the Office of Student Conduct, and the various policies and procedures of the Office of Human Resources.
