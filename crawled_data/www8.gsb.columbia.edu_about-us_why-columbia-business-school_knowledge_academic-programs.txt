The School's emphasis on active learning and entrepreneurial thinking readies students to successfully lead diverse global organizations. The MBA curriculum also offers 10 dual-degree programs in partnership with other graduate schools at the University. Executive MBA The Executive MBA Program allows business professionals to pursue an MBA degree without interrupting their professional careers and to put what they learn into practice immediately. The School offers four EMBA options that deliver the frameworks and tools to meet challenges and seize opportunity. EMBA-New York Columbia Business School’s flagship EMBA-New York option offers the same curriculum — taught by the same faculty — as the Full-Time MBA Program. Students are highly talented, intellectually curious professionals with a drive to define and refine the skills necessary to advance in today’s rapidly changing business world. Classes meet on the main campus in New York City either every other week on Fridays and Saturdays or every week on Saturdays, depending on your path. EMBA-Americas Designed for executives living throughout the United States, Canada, and Latin America, Columbia EMBA-Americas is the newest addition to Columbia Business School’s Executive MBA Program. EMBA-Americas runs for five terms over 20 months and meets approximately once a month, in a weeklong format, primarily in New York City. During the first year, students will also have one weeklong meeting in California and another in Latin America. EMBA-Global Americas and Europe Columbia Business School’s pioneering EMBA-Global Americas and Europe partner program with London Business School offers monthly classes, alternating between two of the world’s financial capitals, with an option in the second year to also study at HKU Business School in Hong Kong. Students are diverse, sophisticated managers with global responsibilities and aspirations. The faculty is composed of leading global experts selected from each school. Graduates earn two full MBA degrees, one from London Business School and one from Columbia University, and gain access to extensive resources, including a joint alumni network, that span continents. EMBA-Global Asia Columbia Business School, London Business School, and HKU Business School have joined forces to offer the first executive MBA program offered in the three financial capitals that are driving global business: New York, London, and Hong Kong. EMBA-Global Asia is designed for high-potential, globally focused professionals, primarily based in Asia, who seek to deepen their understanding of both Western and Eastern business theory and practice and who are passionate about the opportunities that Asia’s rapid economic development affords. Teaching takes place in Hong Kong, London, and New York, as well as Shanghai. Graduates receive an MBA degree conferred jointly by the three schools as well as access to the unparalleled network of alumni from all three schools. Master of Science Programs Columbia Business School’s Master of Science Programs are for students interested in more analytical and focused study in a particular area than is offered by our MBA offerings, but who also prefer a shorter and more industry-oriented experience than the Doctoral Program. Columbia Business School offers Master of Science degrees in Accounting and Fundamental Analysis, Financial Economics, and Marketing. Doctoral Program Columbia Business School’s Doctoral Program offers students the opportunity to earn their PhD while taking full advantage of the resources of Columbia University, a renowned research institution. Throughout the program, students collaborate with their peers and world-class faculty members, studying groundbreaking ideas from the leading experts who developed them and learning how to design and execute original research. Generous tuition assistance options are available, ranging from fellowships and assistantships to tuition exemptions and support for dissertation research. Executive Education Columbia Business School Executive Education offers executives and organizations a variety of approaches, programs and means to excel. The broad portfolio of nondegree programs for individuals span the topics management, leadership, strategy, finance, marketing and social enterprise. Programs for organizations are designed specifically to meet a corporations’ goals.
