Since Temple University receives funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for rDNA/synthetic nucleic acid research, we are required to establish and register an Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) with the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities (OBA) in assurance with the NIH Guidelines for Research involving rDNA/synthetic nucleic acid and meet other applicable regulations and standards. The OVPR is responsible for ensuring that the policies and directives of the IBC are enforced.
