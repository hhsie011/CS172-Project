It brings together leading scholars and educators within the school and college, as well as from across the university, to address undergraduate and graduate program research needs. CIER promotes, supports, and initiates important regional, national, and international programs as well as conducts and disseminates research addressing educational, cultural, linguistic, and social diversity issues in relation to access to education, social, cultural, and linguistic capital/justice/equity in partnership with other centers and institutions around the globe.
