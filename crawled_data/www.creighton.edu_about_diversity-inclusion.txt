Markoe’s Legacy of Anti-racism LessMore Links Jesuit values have always stood for equity and justice. Inspired by the Catholic and Jesuit tradition, our community believes that each human being is a profound gift from God, deserving of both dignity and opportunity. We thus seek to acknowledge and celebrate diversity at Creighton—building the spaces and relationships required for every person to thrive. But because of the injustice and violence of systemic racism and discrimination in our world today, we are called also to do more than acknowledge and celebrate. Creighton’s Division of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion collaboratively leads the University in developing and deepening our commitment to progress in diversity and inclusion as a strength and asset using an inclusive excellence perspective. The office leads efforts to continually and sustainably foster a welcoming, inclusive and affirming University environment where each individual is cherished and can succeed as their fully authentic self and as a reflection of justice and our Jesuit, Catholic mission. Read more Student Cultural Organizations Creighton University is home to many cultural organizations for students—part of a longstanding tradition on campus to engage with the issues and provide opportunities for all who seek them. Learn more about each of these organizations, explore our Creighton Intercultural Center (CIC), and find out how to get involved below. View Organizations Explore the CIC Get Involved Inclusive Excellence: Diversity & Inclusion Defined Inclusion: Constantly and consistently working towards an environment where individuals feel as if they can be their full selves and succeed. Aiming for a culture where each individual feels valued. Diversity: Aiming to build an environment with a wide variety of perspectives based on a multitude of elements of intersecting identities. Looking for demographic compositions more reflective of our current environment and where we are headed for the future. Inclusive Excellence: At each point of decision making and management seriously considering the benefits and implications of diversity and inclusion. Realizing that progress in diversity and inclusion makes the entire organization stronger, more resilient, and adaptable for current situations and for the future. Creighton University, inspired out of a Catholic and Jesuit tradition, treasures the innate dignity of each member of our community and upholds the sanctity of each human being as a profound gift of God. Finding the resplendence of the divine reflected in the uniqueness of every person, we seek, acknowledge and celebrate diversity at Creighton because our Catholic and Ignatian heritage inspires and impels us to do so. Diversity in principle is the “service of faith in the promotion of justice.” Diversity enhances our social selves and intellectual lives by exposing all of us to methods, styles and frames of reference that challenge our unexamined assumptions helping us unmask personal, cultural, institutionalized, and organizational discrimination and stigmatization, recognizing that ignorance and stereotypes create and sustain privileges and preference for some while creating and sustaining marginalization and oppression for others. In a truly catholic context, diversity at Creighton commends inclusion as a prudential, virtuous, and practical principle. Celebrating diversity at Creighton is an invitation to incarnate our mission to educate lifelong learners who will be agents for change in our local communities and in the world. Diversity at Creighton animates our varied intellectual pursuits and enriches our mission to “seek Truth in all its forms.” To this end, Creighton faculty, staff, students and administrators seek to foster an environment of awareness, inclusion, and compassion for everyone in our community and our guests, regardless of age, culture, faith, ethnicity, immigrant status, race, gender, sexual orientation, language, physical appearance, physical ability, or social class. Our caring, hospitable community, our attention to those who are underserved, our academic and co-curricular offerings, and our admissions, hiring, and promotion policies all give testimony to our desire to make Creighton a welcoming, inclusive community. We do this by constant vigilance and reassessment of our campus climate, reaching out to those who are marginalized and whose voices are muted by the mainstream.
