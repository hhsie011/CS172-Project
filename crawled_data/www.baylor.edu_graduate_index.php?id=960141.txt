Applicants are judged by their completed and /or ongoing research projects, participation in research events and conferences, presentations and publications, future research plans, and a letter of recommendation from a faculty mentor. The award is given in the areas of STEM, Social Sciences, and Humanities, for a total of 3 awards annually. The OGSRA was started in 2019 with the goal of promoting the research productivity of graduate students, and changed in 2021 from a semester award to an annual award. September 1, 2021 - The Graduate School is pleased to open nominations for its Outstanding Graduate Student Research award. This cycle is recognizing research productivity for work done during the Spring 2021 academic session. Three awards will be given, one each in the categories of STEM, Humanities, and Social Science. Each award will consist of public recognition by the Graduate School, an award plaque, and an additional travel award to be used to attend a conference of the student’s choice and/or travel for dissertation research. Our purpose is to encourage students to publish, apply to external grants, present their research at prestigious conferences, and participate in GSA research opportunities.
