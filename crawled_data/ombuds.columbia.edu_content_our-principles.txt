This independence is assured primarily through organizational recognition, reporting structure, and neutrality. The Ombuds Office is directly responsible to the President of the University, who has responsibility for the appointment and removal of the University Ombuds Officer. The Ombuds Office is not authorized to accept notice on behalf of the University. Informal Regardless of permission, the Ombuds Officers do not participate in any formal process; do not make decisions and do not formally investigate, arbitrate, judge, discipline or reward any member of the University community. The Ombuds Officers have no power to make, change, overrule or set aside administrative decisions or University policy. Impartial As designated neutrals, the Ombuds Officers advocate for fair process, do not take sides, and consider the rights and interests of all parties including the University. The Ombuds Officers do not “represent” or advocate for any one party and have no decision-making authority. Confidential The Ombuds Office holds the identity of our visitors and all communications in strict confidence and will not disclose confidential communications unless given permission to do so, except as required by law, or where, in the judgment of the Ombuds Officers, there appears to be imminent risk of serious harm.
