The innovative Global Executive Master of Public Administration (Global EMPA) program allows a select group of global professionals from public, private, and nonprofit organizations to earn a graduate degree while remaining in their jobs. The program is delivered online and on Columbia's New York City campus and at its Global Center in Rio de Janeiro, making the degree accessible to professionals throughout Latin America. The Global EMPA curriculum focuses on the core analytical and management skills shared by all Columbia SIPA master’s programs, on a schedule that is compatible with our students’ demanding professional lives. Delivered in a hybrid online and face-to-face format, the Global EMPA engages students with online video case studies produced by an award-winning team and allows students to participate in lectures, conferences, and seminars during on-campus sessions at one of the world’s leading public policy schools. OVERVIEW The Global EMPA is designed to be completed while students continue to pursue their full-time careers. Instead of relocating to Columbia University’s New York City campus for the entire duration of the program, students are responsible for watching video lectures given by top university faculty and management experts, participating in online discussions with fellow students, and completing weekly exercises. These elements are integrated in a functional and user-friendly way on the award-winning Canvas platform. Online, students have access to a rich selection of customized resources, as well as the diverse expertise of their fellow students. The Global EMPA is an 18-month program delivered over five terms. Three terms consist of weekly online lectures and exercises, enhanced by live discussion, support, and assistance through the Columbia’s Global Center. Students living in Rio meet at the Rio Global Center for interactive weekly workshops, while students elsewhere participate through a virtual classroom platform, supplemented by monthly trips to the Global Center. The other two terms gather all Global EMPA cohorts for intensive summer sessions during the month of July at Columbia University’s New York City campus.
