If you have questions or cannot find what you are looking for, please contact us at graduate@ku.edu or call (785) 864-8040. Building Access in Fall 2020 University of Kansas students, faculty and staff will use the CVKey symptom checker app this fall for entry into campus buildings. If you will be attending classes or working on campus during the fall semester, download the CVKey symptom checker at an Apple App Store or on Google Play. If you choose not to use the CVKey app, you will be required to print off and complete a paper health assessment form each day and carry it with you while on campus. The CVKey app was built with privacy in mind. The self-assessment and health-related information is strictly confined to your mobile device. No personal health data is shared or stored outside the mobile device. The app cannot be used for other functions, such as location tracking or contact tracing. GTA Flex and Online Teaching Program The Center for Teaching Excellence has developed new resources to help GTAs prepare to deliver Fall classes. This is optional training that GTAs can elect to complete over the summer, with no expectation or requirement to do so. The CTE’s GTA Flex and Online Teaching Program is a self-paced and individualized training course that uses online modules and an instructor guidebook. The course includes opportunities for discussion groups and consultations with CTE staff and Graduate Student Fellows. The training is available from July 6 to August 17. KU will provide all participating GTAs with a $500 stipend to support their course design efforts. In order to qualify for the stipend, you must agree to provide CTE with a copy of your course design product upon the completion of your program. Please visit the Center for Teaching Excellence to learn more, or use the button below to go directly to the application.
