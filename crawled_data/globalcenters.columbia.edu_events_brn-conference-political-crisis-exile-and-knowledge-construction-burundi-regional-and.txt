Researchers from different social sciences disciplines are presenting and discussing academic research related to Burundi. The conference covers the themes of political crisis, exile, and knowledge construction in Burundi from a regional perspective. This fourth conference follows earlier meetings in Ghent (2015), Brussels (2017) and Antwerp (2018). It is taking place in Kenya to contribute to the delocalisation of knowledge production and its diffusion within the East African region. Two key themes will be addressed: ● Issues related to exile, refugees’ status and mobility ● Social, political and economic causes and effects of political crises In relation to these themes, the conference will be guided by two overarching approaches: 1. A regional approach that situates the Burundian crises within the geopolitical dimensions of the African Great Lakes region 2. An epistemological approach that engages with decolonisation of research and the closure of academia.
