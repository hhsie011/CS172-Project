To see how some of them are using their training in service to their home countries, we traveled to Uganda, often called the Pearl of Africa. Eve Zalwango Zalwango already employed more than 60 people in her custom-made furniture business, but she wants to expand her market and also help survivors of landmine explosions in western Uganda. Alex Kawooya A trip back to his origins in a Kampala slum reminds Kawooya how far he has traveled. Through ambition and education, he now owns businesses in telecommunications and internet service. Mildred Apenyo Aiming to empower women, Apenyo runs a feminist fitness space where Ugandan ladies can practice yoga, exercise, learn self-defense and discuss their challenges in a patriarchal culture.
