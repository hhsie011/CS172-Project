Build community in thought-provoking book clubs, participate in foundational programs such as the Graduate Teaching Showcase, and explore new offerings such as the Students-as-Partners Colloquium. See Details >> Digital Teaching Resources The UT teaching and learning community developed a wealth of resources during the pandemic in 2020. We revisited those resources, many featured on our CTL Commons site, and extracted some that may be helpful as instructors juggle course modalities to meet health and safety needs. See Resources >> 2020-2021 Impact Report Our first step in curating our annual programming lineup is capturing and reflecting upon what we learned from the past academic year; we invite you to take a glimpse at the CTL 2020-21 Impact Report to see how we adapted and engaged with campus during the pandemic. See Impact Report >> Two-Minute Teaching Tips Sometimes you just need a tip! We continually work with instructors to record small bits of practical advice that may be just what you’ve been thinking about. Explore this collection that covers everything from the first day of class to final student presentations and many topics in between. You may not have time to read an article or attend a workshop, but we hope these can spark new ideas.
