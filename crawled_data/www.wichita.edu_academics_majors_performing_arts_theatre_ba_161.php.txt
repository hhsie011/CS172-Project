Admission requirements Inside the Program Student playwright receives national honors Theatre students at WSU have many opportunities to show off their talents on a big stage. That's the case for Josh Whedon, whose original play, "States of Happiness," won the WSU Playwriting Competition before being chosen for a regional performance in Iowa. The critics were impressed, because "States of Happiness" -- an all-student production -- was then honored as one of only 10 distinguished productions in the nation by the Kennedy Center American College Theatre Festival in Washington, D.C. Curriculum The Bachelor of Arts in theatre consists of 85 credit hours. You'll take courses in all aspects of theatre from acting and directing to script analysis and stage lighting. In addition, you'll learn a foreign language—and explore other studies outside of theatre based on your interests and career goals.
