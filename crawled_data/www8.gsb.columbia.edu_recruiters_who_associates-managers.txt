Who Can I Recruit? Interns Analysts Associates & Managers Senior Managers Why Recruit Columbia Talent? Employment Reports Contact Us Employers who hire our MBA and EMBA graduates consistently praise the analytical skills, decision-making abilities, and entrepreneurial mindset that our students exhibit from the start. These dynamic contributors will help your company seize new opportunities right away. Our Full-Time MBAs are a diverse group that has five years of work experience on average. Some are even more seasoned managers, as often students use the MBA experience to transition to new industries or functions. Alternatively, many are looking to advance in their chosen field. Wherever your firm wants to go, these students are poised to help you get there. Our EMBA Program carries the same academic requirements as the Full-Time MBA Program and results in the same degree. However, EMBA students complete their coursework on a different schedule, taking classes through a number of flexible scheduling options while maintaining full-time work responsibilities. Students graduate in May, August, or December depending on when they enter the program. Through this rigorous schedule, EMBA students can put what they learn in class into practice at their jobs in real time. They also benefit from Columbia’s collaborative learning model, completing projects with diverse and talented students from a wide range of industries and backgrounds. Associates and managers can be recruited through job postings, resume book databases or on-campus recruiting. frameborder=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot; allowfullscreen&gt; Sidebar Content Post a Job Log Into COIN Make a Gift Have a Question?
