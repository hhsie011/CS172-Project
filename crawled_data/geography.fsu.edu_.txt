Florida State Geography is a hub for the spatially inquisitive. Whether it is understanding the roles of climate in shifting species distributions, deconstructing the processes that shape the growth and development of cities, using computational models to study changes in species distribution, unveiling social inequities through trends in municipal bonds, exploring the interactions of people and their dependence on aquatic habitats, or building technical skills through the implementation of remote sensing, programming, and Geographic Information Systems, our faculty and students dive into a myriad of subjects touching numerous corners of our world. These are only a few of the areas our departmentâ€™s talent pursues. Geography is a field built on three pillars â€“ the human, the physical, and the technical. By advancing basic knowledge as a foundation for problem-solving, and exposing students to a wide variety of applications across diverse interests, Geography equips its scholars with skill sets that are increasingly marketable in a world of complex questions. Many of our graduates, researchers, and faculty employ skills in geospatial science, statistics, and critical analysis. The trained geographer has the ability to identify issues or phenomena, ask appropriate questions, and deploy techniques from perspectives unique to the field and for the benefit of society. Are you interested in how human beings interact with their environment? Do you want to understand the roots of environmental injustice? Are you a tech fan looking to leverage the power of GIS, automation, and spatial statistics? Have you ever considered how remote sensing could impact the trajectory of an entire industry? Perhaps you find yourself thinking of how people develop both physical and social constructs. If soâ€¦ Consider Florida State Geography Chris Uejio receives a $1M CDC grant to address climate impact on health.

We, in the Department of Geography at Florida State University, acknowledge that our university is located on land that is the ancestral and traditional territory of the Apalachee Nation, the Muscogee Creek Nation, the Miccosukee Tribe of Florida, and the Seminole Tribe of Florida. We pay our respects to their Elders past and present and extend that respect to their descendants, to the generations yet unborn, and to all Indigenous peoples. In doing so, we support the movement for a Native American and Indigenous Studies Center on campus.Faculty and staff of the Florida State University Department of Geography Contact Us Location BEL 323 Phone 850-644-1706 Mailing Address Geography P.O.
