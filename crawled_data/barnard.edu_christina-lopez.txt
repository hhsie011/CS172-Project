After attending and working at a large co-ed university for several years, I was excited to come to a women’s college. I was eager to be surrounded by other women in administrative positions who were excited to mentor students and each other. I’ve grown personally and professionally because of the relationships I have built over the years at Barnard. It’s an empowering place, not only for the students, but for all who work here as well.
