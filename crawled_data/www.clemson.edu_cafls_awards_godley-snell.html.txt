Godley-Snell (Ag Research) Godley-Snell Award for Excellence in Agricultural Research The Godley-Snell Award is named in honor of W. Cecil Godley, former director of the South Carolina Agricultural Experiment Station, and Absalom W. Snell, former associate director. This is the largest annual agricultural research award given at the university and is allocated from earnings of a fund that was first established upon Dr. Godley’s retirement in 1986, and was increased in 1988 when Dr. Snell retired. The purpose of the fund is to stimulate excellence in agricultural research by making a personal award to faculty members involved in research through the Experiment Station. Awardees are selected each year by a committee appointed by the Experiment Station. A call for nominations is sent to participating faculty each spring and the award is presented at a function in which peers and the college leadership are present.
