Texas Tech University Directory Raiderlink A-Z Index Office of Communications & Marketing Menu Search TTU Office of Communications & Marketing Identity Guidelines Identity Guidelines The Identity Guidelines were established to bring consistency and greater visibility to the marketing and communication efforts of Texas Tech University. Clearly defining who we are and what sets us apart from other institutions of higher education around the state and nation will help us deliver the message that great things are happening at our university. The guidelines do not forbid the use of the Double T. As a symbol of Texas Tech's spirit and tradition, the use of the Double T is encouraged. The guidelines explain how to use the academic signature in conjunction with the Double T. It is important that all sectors of the university understand and use these guidelines.
