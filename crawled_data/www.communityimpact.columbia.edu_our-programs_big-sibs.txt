Your support allows us to bring high-quality services to the Morningside Heights and Washington Heights communities. Learn More Our Programs Community Impact is made up of over 27 different groups servicing the Harlem, Morningside Heights and Washington Heights areas. Our groups partner with service organizations, social service offices, religious institutions, senior centers and schools to serve over 8,000 people each year. Learn more About Big SIBS Big SIBS is one of Community Impact’s founding programs. It provides a unique mentoring opportunity for local youth, called Littles, who would benefit from a positive adult role model. Littles, from the communities of Harlem, Washington Heights, and Morningside Heights, are paired with BIGS from Columbia or Barnard who build a big brother/sister relationship. Growing together, sharing experiences, and developing trust and friendship provides Littles with stable, ongoing companionship. Big SIBS requires a minimum two-year commitment with weekly outings lasting 3-5 hours. Sessions are every Sunday from 10:00am - 2:00pm. If you are a parent or family member and know of a youth that would be interested, please contact the program advisor Cait Hughes at cmh2254@columbia.edu or at 212-854-2610.
