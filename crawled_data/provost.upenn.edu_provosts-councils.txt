The Council meets every other week. Its members include the Provost; the Vice Provosts for Education, Faculty, Global Initiatives, and Research; and the twelve deans. COUNCIL OF UNDERGRADUATE DEANS The Council of Undergraduate Deans consists of the Vice Provost for Education, who chairs the Council; the four undergraduate deans; the Vice Provost for University Life; the Dean of Admissions; the Faculty Director of College Houses and Academic Services; the Vice President for Institutional Research and Analysis; and the Chair of SCUE (the Student Committee on Undergraduate Education). Others are invited to meetings as appropriate. The Council discusses issues of mutual concern to the four schools and establishes unified policies. In the past, it has been concerned with such issues as undergraduate recruitment and retention, grading, financial aid, the development of the university’s College House system and the structure of New Student Orientation. COUNCIL OF GRADUATE DEANS The Council of Graduate Deans is an advisory body to the Provost and Vice Provost for Education. The Council consists of the Vice Provost for Education, who chairs the Council, and the Graduate Deans of the nine schools that offer Ph.D. and research masters degrees. The Graduate Deans provide advice on administrative matters affecting the larger University graduate student community, such as recruitment and retention. 122 College Hall University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia, PA 19104 215-898-5000 provost@upenn.edu ©2022 University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104 Footer Menu University of Pennsylvania Penn Directory Site Credits
