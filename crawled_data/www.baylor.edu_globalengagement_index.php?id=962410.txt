We have many organizations that promote or highlight international cultures, groups, and issues. These organizations are supported through our Office of Multicultural Student Activities. They have advisors who are faculty/staff members on campus and they create opportunities to interact with others from similar backgrounds and interests. Each of the groups have their own social events and cultural celebrations and a few of them sponsor campus-wide programs about their respective cultures. Student organizations are a great way to stay connected with your culture/traditions or experience a new culture/tradition! Below is a sample of organizations that were active in past years: African Student Association Asian Student Association Brazilian Student Association Chinese Students and Scholars Association Filipino Student Association Hispanic Student Association Indian Subcontinent Student Association Japanese Student Association Korean Student Association Vietnamese Student Association For the most current information on student organizations or to contact the leaders of an organization, please click HERE International Student and Scholar Services International Students New Student Information Getting To Waco Living in Waco Banking and Money Baylor Welcome Weekend Food Stores Getting a Cell Phone Getting a Driver's License Health Services Housing Transportation Weather in Waco Working on Campus Global Bears Week F-1 Degree-Seeking Students F-1 Student Guidelines SEVIS Registration for Fall and Spring Terms Suspension and Expulsion Termination of SEVIS Record Document Management Academic Program Completion Insufficient Funds Deferment Post Baccalaureate Study F-1 Visa Renewal Changing to F-1 Status Online Programs and Courses Health Services and Insurance Avoiding Fraud and Scams F1 Students and Summer Enrollment Student Requests Replace or Update I-20 Request Curricular Practical Training (CPT) Post Completion Optional Practical Training (OPT) Pre-Completion Optional Practical Training (OPT) STEM OPT Extension CAP-GAP Extension Leave of Absence Letter Requests On-Campus Employment Reduced Course Load Change of Level Reinstatement of Status Transfer In and Out Travel Authorization Dependents Extend or Shorten Your Program Social Security Number Severe Economic Hardship J-1 Exchange Students Application Process Costs Room and Board Course Selection Health Services and Insurance - Exchange Students Paying Taxes Process Forms and Documents Frequently Asked Questions International Scholars Visiting Faculty & Researchers Health Services and Insurance - Scholars J-1 Scholar Guidelines Maintaining J-1 Status Two Year Residency 12 & 24 Month Bars Travel Procedures Extensions Program Transfer 212e Waiver J-2 Dependents Lecture Requests and Consultations Maintaining Status Programs & Activities Spring 2022 Trips & Special Events Global Friendship Program CGE Ambassadors 2020-2021 CGE Ambassadors 2019-2020 CGE Ambassadors International Organizations International Student & Scholar Workshops Academic and Language Resources International Student Resource Hub Community Support Page Summer Courses in China Faculty and Staff Resource Tool Kit ISSS Programming Framework Center for Global Engagement Hankamer Academic Center, H 160.01 1428 S. 5th St. Waco, TX 76798 One Bear Place #97012 Waco, TX 76798-7012 (254) 710-1461 Global_Baylor@baylor.edu Global_Gateway@baylor.edu ISSS_Support@baylor.edu StudyAbroad@baylor.edu Global BaylorInternational Student and Scholar ServicesRegister Your TravelStudy AbroadGlobal Gateway General Information Colleges, Schools, Libraries & Research Admissions Administration Gateways For...
