Alameda 1058, Santiago. Every year, millions of individuals suffer from acute stroke, the second leading cause of death globally, as well as other neurological emergencies. Stroke, severe traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and spinal cord injury all cause significant morbidity and mortality. Often in resource-limited settings, delays in diagnosis and appropriate management lead to poor outcomes such as death or permanent and significant neurological deficits. Chile has a high burden of neurological emergencies, with cerebrovascular disease being one of the country’s leading causes of mortality. However, there is a deficiency of neurologists in the country, with most concentrated in urban areas and working in private practice. In that context, the Neurological Institute at Columbia University Medical Center is teaming-up with local neurology experts at Universidad de Chile to conduct an educational symposium on September 9-10 on neurological emergencies geared towards generalists and emergency room physicians. A delegation of four faculty members Columbia Medical Center’s Division of Critical Care and Hospitalist Neurology will visit the country to participate in a “Train the Trainer” symposium. They are: Kiran T. Thakur, MD, assistant professor of the Division of Critical Care and Hospitalist Neurology at the Department of Neurology of Columbia University’s Medical Center; Kathryn Rimmer, MD, resident at the Adult Neurology Residency Program at the New York-Presbyterian Hospital; Sachin Agarwal, MD, MPH, assistant professor of Neurology at the New York-Presbyterian Hospital; and Shivani Goshal, MD, assistant professor of the Division of Critical Care and Hospitalist Neurology at the Department of Neurology of Columbia’s Medical Center. Chilean partners include Andrea Slachevsky, associate professor, and Rodrigo Salinas, assistant professor, both from Universidad de Chile’s School of Medicine. In addition, Carlos Romero, President at Chile’s Society of Intensive Medicine (SOCHIMI), will be joining them. Twenty neurologists from throughout the country, many of them practicing medicine in emergency rooms or in acute care hospitals located in rural regions, will participate in this event The symposium will leverage the longstanding expertise and breadth of knowledge in both the Neurological Institute at Columbia University and Universidad de Chile, with up-to-date training on neurological emergencies. It will address the clinical approach and management of major neurological emergencies including acute stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, trauma, etc. The educational program objective is to increase the comfort and improve the examination and management skills of physicians in assessing neurologically critically ill patients.
