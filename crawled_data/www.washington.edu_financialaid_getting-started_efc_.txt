How much you and your family will be expected to contribute depends on your financial situation — and is what is called your Expected Family Contribution (EFC). Your EFC is a measure of your family’s financial strength and is calculated according to a formula established by law. The EFC is used to determine the amount of financial aid that you are eligible for. The information you report on your FAFSA is used to calculate your EFC. Your family’s taxed and untaxed income, assets, and benefits (such as unemployment or Social Security) all are considered in the formula. Also considered are your family size and the number of family members who will attend college during the year. Your EFC is not the amount of money your or your family will have to pay for college nor is it the amount of federal student aid you will receive.
