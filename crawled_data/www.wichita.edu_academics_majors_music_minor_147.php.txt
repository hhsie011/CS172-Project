Piano major Patrick Orr’s interest in the piano began after he watched “Titanic” as a kid and decided to learn how to play the hymn “Nearer My God to Thee.” As just a freshman, Orr won the grand prize in the Kansas City Symphony Young Artist Competition. As the winner of the competition, Orr received the honor of accompanying the Kansas City Symphony in two performances.
