Mathematics concentrators at Brown can explore these concepts through the department's broad course offerings and flexible concentration requirements. The concentration leads to either the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree (the latter is strongly recommended for students interested in pursuing graduate study in mathematics or related fields). Concentrators begin their learning with multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and abstract algebra. Beyond these prerequisites, students take a variety of advanced topics on the 1000 and 2000 level based on their interests. Students also have the option of completing a thesis project.
