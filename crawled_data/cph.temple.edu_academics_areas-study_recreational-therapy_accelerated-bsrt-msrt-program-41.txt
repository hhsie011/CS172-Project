This combined degree program offers exceptional students an opportunity to develop critical skills in recreational therapy and complete graduate work for professional careers in diverse settings, including hospitals, rehabilitation centers, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, schools and community recreation agencies. Students can apply for admission to this accelerated program at the beginning of their junior year. They begin taking graduate-level courses the semester after they are admitted. Students will complete the requirements for the undergraduate degree within two years after entering the +1 program, and the MS requirements will be satisfied by the end of the fifth year of study. For more information on the 4+1, contact: Gena Bell Vargas Graduate Program Director Health and Rehabilitation Sciences Contact View Profile Email gena.vargas@temple.edu Phone 215-204-7010 Office 1700 North Broad St The bachelor of science in recreational therapy is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (CAAHEP)/Committee on Accreditation of Recreational Therapy Education (CARTE).
