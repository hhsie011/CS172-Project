Celebration Conversations: Disability Employment Awareness Wednesday, October 27, 2021 at 12:00pm to 1:00pm Virtual Event The U.S. Congress designated October as National Disability Employment Awareness Month (NDEAM) to educate about disability employment issues and commemorate the value and contributions people with disabilities bring to our diverse workplaces. In this session we will have a conversation with Erin Sember-Chase, a long time Cornell employee and co-chair of the CU Disability Colleague Network, about some of the lived experiences of working at Cornell with a disability identity, and how we can all contribute to a more disability inclusive campus culture and greater sense of belonging for our colleagues with disabilities and chronic health conditions. Celebration Conversations are spaces to celebrate the stories, accomplishments, cultures, and heritages of Cornell staff, centering on historically marginalized voices. These conversations provide opportunities to bring us closer together and create a better understanding of our colleagues at Cornell. We encourage staff to attend to connect with each other, support their colleagues, and deepen everyone's sense of belonging at Cornell.
