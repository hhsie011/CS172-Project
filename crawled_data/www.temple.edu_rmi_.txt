For a claim for non-owned property to be considered, the following must be received: Campus Safety/Police Report or detailed narrative of the event giving rise to the loss A copy of the agreement between the property owner and Temple University Property Loss/Damage Form Claims not reported within 30 days may be denied.

University Banking Relationship Temple University is pleased to announce that over the next several months, the university will be transitioning its business banking relationship from PNC to JP Morgan. This is a long and complex process that will require some overlap in banks until all accounts and services are fully transitioned. Throughout this process, you can expect to see changes and/or requests for updates to existing bank accounts and banking services. As we work through the transition, please be aware that scammers may try to take advantage of this change in banks. Please know that, AT NO TIME will anyone from PNC or JP Morgan contact a university employee directly for any information including login credentials or bank account numbers. Both PNC and JP Morgan are working directly with the Risk Management & Treasury (RM&T) Department. All requests for information will come internally through RM&T. If you receive a request for banking information from anyone outside RM&T please do not respond and contact Lisa Zimmaro (lzimmaro@temple.edu) or Danielle Colon (danielle.colon@temple.edu) immediately. The transition of the business banking services has no effect on employee workplace banking which will remain with PNC. If you have any questions, please contact RM&T at 215-204-7214.
