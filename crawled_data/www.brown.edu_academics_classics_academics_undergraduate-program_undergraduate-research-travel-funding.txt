Lyon, in memory of her husband, Lucius Lyon, of the class of 1844. Classics concentrators may apply for funding for various research-related activities, including travel to support senior thesis research, travel to deliver conference papers, and other similar activities. Awards will be made on a rolling basis; there is no deadline. Students are, however, encouraged to apply for funding at least one month before the date by which funds would need to be disbursed. If you have any questions as to whether your funding need/project is appropriate for the Lucius Lyon Fund, please contact the department's Director of Undergraduate Studies. application (Brown Email account & Banner ID required) Bruce Elliot Donovan Memorial Endowment Established in 2017 through a generous gift on behalf of its namesake, the Bruce Elliot Donovan Memorial Endowment honors its namesake by encouraging student-faculty collaborations in and out of the undergraduate classroom—the sorts of interactions Bruce Donovan privileged in his own teaching and advising over a forty-year career at Brown. The Endowment supports activities under five broad categories: Teaching Research Pedagogy and technology Outreach Advising and mentoring Students and/or faculty involved in any undergraduate activity falling under these rubrics may apply to the Donovan Endowment for support.
