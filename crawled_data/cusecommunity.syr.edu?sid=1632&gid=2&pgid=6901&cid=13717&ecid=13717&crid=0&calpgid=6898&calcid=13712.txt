Open to alumni, parents, students and friends of Syracuse University, we hold game watches (when the time works!), attend local sporting events, offer professional development and networking opportunities, host a new student send-off for students from the area heading to Syracuse University, and organize a local community service project to honor the founding of the University. If you have ideas/suggestions for an activity/event or want to get more involved with the club, please email us. Also be sure to also join us on Facebook, too! GO ORANGE!
