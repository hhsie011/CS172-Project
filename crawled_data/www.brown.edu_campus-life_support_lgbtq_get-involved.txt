One of the easiest ways to get involved is to volunteer for the LGBTQ Center. We often need assistance with program planning, program implementation, putting up posters, making LGBTQ+ buttons and ribbons, and other special projects. The time committment can be as small or large as you'd like it to be. You can also do a class project or an unpaid internship through our Center if approved by the Director (we will assist you with projects as our capacity allows). To find out more or to sign up as an LGBTQ Center volunteer email our Center Director, [email protected]. We have additional information online about getting involved in student groups. If you'd like to speak with someone in person about how to can get involved please the Director to make an appointment.
