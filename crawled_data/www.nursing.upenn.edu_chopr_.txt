Penn Nursing Researchers Co-Edit Special Journal Issue About Social Determinants of Health Dr. J. Margo Brooks Carthon, Co-Associate Director of the Center for Health Outcomes and Policy Research, and Dr. Adriana Perez are guest editors of the April 2022 special edition of the journal Research in Nursing & Health. The Issue “Health Equity and Social Determinants of Health” is the first of its kind published by a nursing research journal. More Successful Medicare Initiative Increases the Supply of Nurse Practitioners to Address Primary Care Shortages A new CHOPR study published in Health Affairs shows that Medicare support for clinical training for nurse practitioners (NPs) would increase their numbers and address the national shortage of primary care. The study shows that universities participating in the $200 million Graduate Nurse Education (GNE) Demonstration significantly increased the number of primary care NPs they graduated. More Illinois Nurse Staffing Legislation Predicted to Reduce Hospital Deaths and Improve Care According to a new study published in the scientific journal BMJ Open, proposed state legislation in Illinois—HB 2604 Safe Staffing Limits Act– would significantly improve nurse staffing in hospitals and likely save thousands of lives. The cost of improving nurse staffing could be offset by cost savings achieved by the impact of better nurse staffing on shorter length of hospital stays. More Hospitals with More Inpatient Nurse Practitioners Linked to Better Outcomes, More Satisfied Patients According to a new study published in the prestigious Medical Care, hospitals that employ more inpatient nurse practitioners have lower surgical mortality, higher patient satisfaction, and lower costs of care. Nurse practitioners are registered nurses with advanced graduate education and expanded legal scope of practice to prescribe treatments including pain medications. More Safe Nurse Staffing Standards in Hospitals Saves Lives and Lowers Costs A new study published in The Lancet Global Health showed that establishing safe nurse staffing standards in hospitals in Chile could save lives, prevent readmissions, shorten hospital stays, and reduce costs.
