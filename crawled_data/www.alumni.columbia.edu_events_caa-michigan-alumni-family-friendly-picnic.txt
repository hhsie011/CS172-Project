We hope to see some new faces— including some of our many alumni based in the Ann Arbor area. It's a great opportunity to make new connections and reconnect with old friends. Our host, past club co-president Colby Cesaro ’11SIPA selected Chela's Restaurant and Taqueria to cater. Maybe you'll even get a bit of exercise: the five-acre park features a walking path, playground, basketball court, and other amenities. We have the Gazebo reserved for our group. You're welcome to bring bikes and scooters. Cost is $10 per person; kids under 12 free.
