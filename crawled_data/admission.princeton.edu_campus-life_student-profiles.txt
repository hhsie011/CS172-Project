Brought together in an environment that encourages academic excellence and that supports a vibrant campus life, Princeton students have much to offer each other, both in and out of the classroom. Central to student life is the four-year residential college system, where students develop friendships, receive academic advising and participate in intellectual, cultural, recreational and social activities. Beyond the classrooms and the residential colleges, students have countless avenues to explore new interests and connect with others. University-sponsored programs and more than 300 student-run organizations offer undergraduates a wealth of opportunities ranging from the arts to civic engagement, from student government to athletics, from religious and cultural groups to journalism and debate. Many students pursue opportunities beyond Princeton's gates, including overseas study, research and internships. We invite you to meet some of Princeton's students.
