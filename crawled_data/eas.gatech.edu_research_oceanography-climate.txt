In addition to research capabilities located on the Georgia Tech campus, faculty and students have the opportunity to conduct research programs at the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography in Savannah, GA, and is a unit of the University System of Georgia. Existing programs include physical and biological modeling, sensor development, field studies, remote sensing and paleoceanography. Research is conducted in both the coastal zone and open ocean, and current regional studies include the California coastal ocean, Indian Ocean, tropical Pacific Ocean, Gulf of Alaska, Labrador Sea, Gulf of Mexico, South China Sea and the Arctic Ocean.
