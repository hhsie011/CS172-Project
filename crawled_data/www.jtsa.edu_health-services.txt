JTS students have access to a variety of health care services provided by Columbia Health (located in John Jay Hall on the campus of Columbia University), including primary care, urgent care, women’s health, mental health counseling, and wellness programs. For List College students in the Joint Program with Columbia, the JTS Office of Human Resources administers the student health insurance program. For List College students in the Double Degree Program with Barnard, the student health insurance program is administered through Barnard College. JTS offers an extensive Student Health Insurance Plan administered through the Columbia Student Health Insurance Plan. The plan is underwritten by Aetna Student Health. For the 2019-2020 academic year, the Plan provides coverage from August 15, 2019 through August 14, 2020. Learn about Columbia Health Learn about Aetna Student Health Learn about Barnard Health Services Health Insurance Requirement All full-time and/or residential JTS students must have health insurance. All full-time and residential students are automatically enrolled and charged for Columbia Health, regardless of whether or not they waive the Columbia Plan. We therefore encourage JTS students to utilize Columbia Health services. Counseling Center The JTS Counseling Center is here to support JTS students. The Center’s staff includes a team of highly trained, licensed psychologists who offer a safe, nonjudgmental, and confidential environment where students can explore any issue of concern.
