Public Safety enters or updates reports within two business days of receiving the information. The Daily Crime Log records virtually all crimes reported to Public Safety. However, there are times when information may be withheld from the log, such as if there is clear and convincing evidence that releasing such information would jeopardize an ongoing criminal investigation or the safety of an individual, cause a suspect to flee or evade detection or result in the destruction of evidence. In such instances, information may be withheld until the adverse effect is no longer likely to occur. In addition, updates are not required after 60 days have passed from the date of the initial entry. Upon request, the most recent 60-day period of the log may be inspected at the security desks of UC's Uptown, Blue Ash and Clermont campuses during normal business hours, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday, unless the university is closed. Any portion of the log older than 60 days may be inspected within two business days of being requested. Logs are kept for seven years. To view to daily crime log, please click on the link below. Daily Crime Log Requests for physical copies of the crime log within the past 60 days can be made to Public Safety during normal business hours at 513-556-4996 or by emailing clery@ucmail.uc.edu.
