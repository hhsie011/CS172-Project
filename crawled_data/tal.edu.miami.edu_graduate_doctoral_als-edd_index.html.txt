The EDD program in the Applied Learning Sciences will provide people across a broad array of fields with the intellectual tools to (re)think about how they interact with subordinates, trainees, mentees, and students as learners and to (re)think their own roles as being that of a designer and teacher where they design, implement, and evaluate the impacts of learning environments for their students. The program’s three specific foci, which students are expected to integrate in a culminating applied project, are: Learning: how people, as individuals, groups, or parts of an organization, learn; Design: the design, implementation, and revision of learning environments that enhance human learning; and Assessment: the assessment of learning and the evaluation of individual, social, technological, and design factors that advance or impede learning.
