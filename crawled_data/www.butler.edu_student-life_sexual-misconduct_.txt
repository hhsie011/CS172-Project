Pursuant to our institutional values and the federal law known as Title IX, the University does not discriminate on the basis of sex or gender in any aspect of its operations, including admissions and employment.

Sexual misconduct includes sex- and gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, sexual exploitation, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking. There are two prongs to the University’s efforts to address sexual misconduct: prevention and response. Learn more about reporting sexual misconduct to the University.
