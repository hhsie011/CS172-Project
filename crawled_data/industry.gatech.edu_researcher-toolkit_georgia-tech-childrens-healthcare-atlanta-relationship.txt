Potential collaborative research efforts can occur in many disciplines—from development of new devices and technologies to medical records informatics to healthcare systems, to name just a few. To facilitate these types of collaborations, the Georgia Tech Research Corporation (GTRC) and Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta have entered into a reciprocal intellectual property (IP) agreement to address ownership and management of intellectual property. This agreement is a companion to the Master Research Agreement and establishes a framework for efficient dissemination of new intellectual property that arises from research involving employees of both Georgia Tech and Children’s or that uses significant resources of both entities.
