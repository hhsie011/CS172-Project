We’ll discuss the experiences of Korean military brides and other ethnic immigrants to Chicago as they sought to balance traditional foodways with demands to make “American food” for their families. We’ll use the concept of foodways to interrogate historical outcomes starting with a history of “Chicago’s Diary District.” The presentation illustrates how Chicago's dairy companies altered the nation’s culinary landscape with the invention of foods such as Velveeta, Miracle Whip, macaroni and cheese dinner, and processed cheese. We’ll also look at the economic and culinary consequences of mergers and acquisitions on Chicago’s dairy corporations.
