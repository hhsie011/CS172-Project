The Master of Divinity/Master of Social Work (M.Div./M.S.W.) prepares students to provide leadership and service through congregations, religiously affiliated organizations, and faith communities. Church agencies, as well as family and children’s agencies, gerontology programs, counseling centers, and community ministries in urban areas and international missions, need professional social workers. In addition, congregations often need the consultation and leadership in family and community ministry which social workers can provide. Many congregational leadership positions and often the chief executive officers of church-related agencies require an M.Div. or other graduate seminary degree as a qualification. This joint degree program, therefore, addresses this need for joint competency.
