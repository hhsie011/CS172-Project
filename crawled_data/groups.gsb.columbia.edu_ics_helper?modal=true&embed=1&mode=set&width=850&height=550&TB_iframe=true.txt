When a group modifies an event, it is automatically updated in your personal calendar. Receive event reminders (right now, this can only be achieved by subscribing from your iPhone/iPad). Why should you star events in CampusGroups? Save time - When you star an event in CampusGroups, it is automatically added to your personal calendar in 1 click. Customize your list of events - As opposed to the Group Calendar Feeds, your Favorite Events feed allows you to select the events you are interested in, and to only have these events added to your calendar. Know when changes happen - We notify you when an event you starred was modified or cancelled. There are 2 types of ICS feeds in CampusGroups: (1) Group calendar feeds: containing all public events of a group (go to the Calendar and click on Subscribe to Calendars to access these feeds) (2) Your personal feed of events: containing all events that you "Starred" in CampusGroups + All the events of the group calendars you starred We recommended that you subscribe to your CampusGroups ICS feeds from your Outlook Desktop. Any change made to an event will be automatically and instantaneously updated on your calendar. Limitation: You will not receive any event reminders unless you manually copy your events from your ICS subscription into you personal calendar. Solution: * If you have an iPhone/iPad, also subscribe to your ICS from your Mobile * If you have a Android, connect CampusGroups to your Google Account and your events will automatically appear in your Google Calendar on the Web and on your phone How to subscribe to an ICS feed into your Outlook Calendar 1) Click on the Copy Link link and copy the ICS URL. 2) In Outlook, on the Tools menu, click Account Settings. 3) On the Internet Calendars tab, click New. 4) Paste the URL you copied in step 3.

How to subscribe to an ICS feed from your Google Calendar: I] First Method 1) Click on the Google Calendar link of the group which calendar you want to export. 2) In the new tab, choose Yes, add this calendar Your Google Calendar should now be updated. But sometimes, depending of the configuration, you are not allowed to add the calendar and you see this screen: This is due to a conflict between Google Calendar and your browser. You can try to update your browser, or even better for this widget, use Google Chrome. Or follow the second method. II] Second Method 1) Copy the link of the "Cannot add" message, then click OK. 2) Go to Google Calendar. Click on the triangle next to Add in the "Other Calendars" section (bottom left of the screen) and select Add by URL. 3) A window will pop up asking for the URL of the calendar. Paste the link you copied on step 2 and click on Add Calendar. 4) The events of the selected group will show up on your calendar and they will get updated just as they are on CampusGroups. We have noticed that after Step #3 some Users may sometimes get the following Error Message If this happens to you, just repeat instantly Steps 4 and 5 and you should be fine. This is a great way to subscribe to any CampusGroups ICS feeds from your iPhone/iPad, and to also get Reminders/Alerts 15mn before the event. Once you have set up your calendar subscription: 1) Adding a "Star" to an event in CampusGroups, will automatically and instantaneously add this event into your mobile calendar and reminder. 2) Modifications to any of your events (i.e. date/time, location, etc), will be automatically replicated on your mobile calendar. 3) You will also be notified in CampusGroups when changes to event occur.
