These sessions will explore non-verbal and experiential healing techniques, self-calming tools, and guide participants in incorporating mindfulness into your daily lives. The Drawing & Language workshop will be focused on creating a Circle of Protection, which beckons a safe sense of one's own boundaries through self-created imagery. Weaving language into one's mandala-like drawing, the workshop emphasis will be on creating a sense of wholeness within the container of one's being. Poetry, music, body awareness and expressive ideas will be brought into the workshop, as points of inspiration and reliable healing properties, which one can call upon for ongoing healing. For this workshop we invite participants to gather paper and anything else they would like to draw with before class (i.e. pens, pencils, markers, crayons, or paint).
