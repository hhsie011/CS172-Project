Seven years ago, blogger and academic Meytal Radzinski took a critical look at the publishing landscape and noticed that the world of translated literature was heavily male-dominated. Reflecting on this gender disparity and wanting to create change, Radzinski started Women in Translation Month, an annual celebration of works in translation by women and other marginalized genders. This August, we are proud to feature our 2021 batch of titles, a selection that stretches across hemispheres. We begin in Russia with The Voice Over, travel to Mongolia with Suncranes and Other Stories, continue east to Japan via In the Shelter of the Pine and An I-Novel, and finally land in the Americas with Literature in Motion. The schedule of the books during the month is as follows: Week 1. The Voice Over: Poems and Essays Week 2. Suncranes and Other Stories: Modern Mongolian Short Fiction Week 3. In the Shelter of the Pine: A Memoir of Yanagisawa Yoshiyasu and Tokugawa Japan Week 4. An I-Novel Week 5. Literature in Motion: Translating Multilingualism Across the Americas Make sure to join, engage, and enjoy!
