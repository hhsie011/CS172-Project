We focus on the following strategic priorities: building inclusive community, health and wellbeing, and operational excellence. Staff provide developmental advising and mentoring helping students identify and understand their resources and options, empowering them to make more informed choices, facilitating opportunities to find a sense of belonging and to build relationships across differences, and in the process fostering leadership and life skills so that they can thrive intellectually and personally at Brown and beyond. A strong commitment to equity and inclusion is imbedded in all our efforts.
