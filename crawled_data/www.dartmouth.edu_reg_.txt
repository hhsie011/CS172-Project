Archive Spring 2022 Newsletter - On Course Archive Statement on Diversity and Inclusion “Dartmouth’s capacity to advance its dual mission of education and research depends upon the full diversity and inclusivity of this community. We must increase diversity, particularly among our faculty and staff. As we do so, we must also create a community in which every individual, regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, socio-economic status, disability, nationality, political or religious views, or position within the institution, is respected. On this close-knit and intimate campus, we must ensure that every person knows that he, she, or they is a valued member of our community. Diversity and inclusivity are necessary partners. Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity—an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized.” - President Philip Hanlon ’77 - Excerpt from May 2016 Letter to the Dartmouth community ___________________________________ Contact Us Top of page | Privacy | Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College Last Updated: 5/26/22
