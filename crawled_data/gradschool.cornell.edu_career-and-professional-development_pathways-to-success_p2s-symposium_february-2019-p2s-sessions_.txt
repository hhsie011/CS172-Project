[Opening Plenary] Keep Moving Forward – Understanding Motivation Travis Winter, LCSW-R Motivation is simply the desire or willingness of someone to do something, but how do you maintain motivation throughout your graduate program? Join us to learn about your own values, how motivation works, and different types of motivation.

The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
