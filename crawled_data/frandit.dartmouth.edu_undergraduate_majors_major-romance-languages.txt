If the primary language is French, the six courses must include French 10 and one course from French 22, 23, 24, 25 (to be completed by the end of junior year). During their senior year, as their culminating activity, Romance Language majors (whose primary language is French) must take either French 78: Senior Major Workshop or, with special permission, an upper-level French course (numbered French 040 or above). Students taking an upper-level French course as their culminating experience are required to supplement the regular reading with extra materials chosen in consultation with the instructor, and to write a research or critical paper of at least twenty pages.

Ital 10 is required for the Romance Languages major with Italian as primary language and may be taken on campus or on the L.S.A.+. With the approval of the Italian Major Advisor, ITAL 10 may be counted toward the Romance Languages major twice, provided the course topics are different. Along with ITAL 10 on the LSA+, ITAL 12 taken on the L.S.A.+ may count toward the Romance Languages major ***If ITAL 9 is taken on campus and Ital 8 is taken on the L.S.A.+, ITAL 8 will count as fulfilling the prerequisite for the Romance Languages major and Ital 9 may count toward the Romance Languages major.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of French and Italian Undergraduate Overview Placement Information & Exams Transfer Credit Areas of Study & Course Descriptions French Language Courses French Upper Level Courses French and Italian in Translation Italian Language Courses Italian Upper Level Courses Course Schedules 2023-2024 French Courses 2022-2023 French Courses 2021-2022 French Courses 2022-2023 Italian Courses 2021-2022 Italian Courses Majors French Italian Romance Languages French Studies Italian Studies French or Italian as a Modifier Minors Honors Thesis Program The Thesis French Timeline Italian Timeline Endowed Research Grant Study Abroad Overview French LSA/LSA+ Toulouse FSP Paris Italian Full Immersion Rome Experience (FIRE) Italian LSA/LSA+ Rome Opportunities Overview Apprentice Teacher Info Co-Curricular Opportunities Affinity Housing/Global Village French Language Program Italian Language Program Job Opportunities Director's Assistant Positions in Rome Student Awards and Prizes Arianna Pagani ’93 Memorial Prize In French And Italian Bruno Tollon Prize In French Studies Cloise Appleton Crane Prize In French And Italian François Denoeu Memorial Prize French Consulate Prize George E.
