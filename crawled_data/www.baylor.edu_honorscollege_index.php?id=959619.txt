For me as a professor, it is pure joy to watch my students reach understanding, and then utilize that understanding to ask questions about the world around them. I want students to know that creating an "honors" course isn't about making the coursework more difficult; it's about maximizing the opportunity to extend basic content to explore human health and the world around us." Dr. Jason Whitlark Religion (Assistant Director of Baylor Interdisciplinary Core Program) "The BIC is an extraordinary program that forms a significant learning community of students and professors through a shared and challenging interdisciplinary curriculum. That shared experience binds BIC participants together, both past and present, into an ever-growing community. The BIC develops skills, knowledge, and ways of thinking that equip all involved in the program to fulfill their varying vocations in Godâs world. I value the BIC most of all because, through this community and our discussions, I have been encouraged to think deeper and to love my neighbor better." Alumni Dr. Jamie Gianoutsos Assistant Professor of History, Mount Saint Mary's University Alumna, Honors Program (Political Science and Great Texts Major, 2006) "I expected the Honors Program to challenge me intellectually and, through its coursework and final project, to deepen my understanding of literature, history, and culture. What I did not fully expect was to find a close community of like-minded students, all seeking to excel in their interests and learn about the world more broadly. I gained my closest friends through the Honors Program. As we have each graduated and entered our respective fields of medicine, bio-informatics, law, history, music, and education, our friendships have continued to flourish over the years." Ms. Jade Connor Alumna, Honors Program (Biology Major, Pre-Med, 2017) "Being in the Honors College was a transformational experience for me. Through taking classes with amazing faculty members like Dr. Junius Johnson and Dr. Bill Neilson, studying abroad in Maastricht with Dr. Abel and Dr. Baker, and diving deep into bioethics through my honors thesis, I was able to develop not only my intellect, but my beliefs and goals as well. When I started at Baylor, I saw my future career as a doctor as a calling, and I thought I knew what that meant. Through my time in the Honors College, I fully appreciate what it means to be called to serve." Mr. Kade Major Alumnus, Baylor Interdisciplinary Core (Electrical Engineering and Mathematics Majors, 2017) "When I talked about being in an interdisciplinary program during my time at Baylor, it usually had to do with combining historical, sociological, religious, political, and economic fields of study in the classroom. Now, working as an electrical engineering consultant, I'm usually referring to initiatives involving architects, mechanical engineers, structural engineers, general contractors, and business representatives. Those unfamiliar with the BIC might wonder if there's any relevance of the former to the latter, but I know I can speak for plenty of alumni in saying that even if the vocabulary has changed, this program equipped us for our professional and personal lives in ways we continue to be grateful for." Students Ms. Olivia Perez Great Texts and Honors Program (Great Texts and Political Science Major, Pre-Law) "I believe one of the most unique experiences I have had as a college student is getting to write an undergraduate honors thesis. I consider myself fortunate to have amazing resources and professors guide me throughout the process of gathering and presenting intense research. This project has really allowed me to focus on a specific topic and achieve something I thought was impossible during my undergraduate career. Having completed so much research, I feel prepared and excited to begin studying legal writing in law school and use investigative research skills as an attorney." Ms. Priya Chandna Baylor Interdisciplinary Core (Neuroscience Major, Child and Family Studies Minor, Pre-Med) "BIC has taught me how to be resourceful, how to make the most of opportunities that I am presented with, and how to ask for help when I need it. The program is incredibly intellectually stimulating in many different fields while also providing students with practical and tangible problem-solving skills for the world after college." Mr. Will Sharkey University Scholars (Concentrations in Mathematics, Great Texts, and Religion) "University Scholars is a wonderful program for students who are interested in taking advanced coursework in multiple subjects. It allows students the freedom to pursue various interests in the classroom across a range of disciplines and provides access to a wide range of classes since professors recognize the major and are often willing to accommodate. I have found a wonderful, godly community of friends among University Scholars as well: they are people concerned not only with academics and the greater questions in life but also with YOU personally. I would - and have - recommended this major very highly to those who are curious about it!"
