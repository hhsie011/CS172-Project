To that end, students have regular studio visits with full-time and adjunct faculty, who offer critical insight into both the form and underlying ideas of students’ work. Students are also encouraged to take electives outside of the Visual Arts Program: in the Writing, Theatre and Film programs of the School of the Arts; and in art history, architecture, philosophy and other areas of study throughout Columbia University. These electives ensure that students develop a broad base of art history and theory upon which they can build a solid and provocative studio practice.
