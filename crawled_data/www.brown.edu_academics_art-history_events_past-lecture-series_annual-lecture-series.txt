Sensory Lecture Series Poster To sense is the body’s access to the world and the meaning ascribed to those perceptions. Art and architecture can play with the senses in both aspects of the term from spaces made to evoke physical sensations to those created for an audience’s attention to touch, noise, music, light, taste, movement, and fragrance imbued with cultural significance. The series is sponsored by the Department of the History of Art and Architecture, the Anita Glass Memorial Fund, the Margerie Cutler Endowment, and the Marshall Woods Lectureship Foundation of Fine Arts. All lectures are free and open to the public. They take place at 5:30pm in List Art Center, 64 College Street, Providence. October 4 at 5:30pm in List 110 Andrew M.

For an attention to the sensory draws in the disciplines of psychology, neurology, ecology, philosophy, and digital humanities to offer alternative ways of writing art and architectural history, and connects to current trends in curatorial practice towards the experiential and immersive. The sensory can both complement and push back against history as a mode of inquiry and integrate the realm of the imagination. The lecturers’ range of fields across Asia and Europe, and from the medieval to the early modern and contemporary, will encourage us to consider approaches beyond the visual in art and architectural history.
