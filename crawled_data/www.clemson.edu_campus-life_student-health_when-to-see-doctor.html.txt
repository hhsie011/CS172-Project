Rushing to classes, studying, taking tests and possibly also working can cause extreme exhaustion and a weakened immune system. Add close contact with other students and you have the perfect conditions for catching an infectious disease such as the flu, the common cold, meningitis, conjunctivitis, mononucleosis, upper respiratory infection and gastroenteritis. Primary Care Generally, if you have a routine problem that does not constitute an emergency, you would see a primary care provider. If you're on Clemson's main campus, you can make an appointment at Redfern Health Center to see a primary care provider. If you have an urgent problem when Redfern is open, you can just walk-in to Redfern and be seen through the Nurse's Clinic without an appointment. After your appointment, you can fill your prescriptions and purchase over-the-counter products in Redfern Health Center's pharmacy. If you're located off Clemson's main campus and you have Clemson University's Student Health Insurance Plan, you can find an in-network Preferred Provider in your area on Blue Cross Blue Shield's website. Deductibles and co-pays apply for any visits outside of Redfern Health Center. Urgent Care If Redfern or the primary care facility in your area is closed, and you feel you canâ€™t wait, consider visiting an urgent care clinic for non-life threatening conditions. No appointment is required, but wait times are variable depending on how many other patients are waiting to be seen. Urgent care clinics fill the gap between primary care providers and the emergency room. You will be responsible for any fees incurred. If you have Clemson University's Student Health Insurance Plan, you can find an in-network Preferred Provider in your area.
