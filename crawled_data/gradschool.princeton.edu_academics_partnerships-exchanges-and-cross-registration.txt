These programs provide graduate students with opportunities to study internationally, to study at one of our Ivy-Plus peer institutions, or to take courses at other regional institutions. Some of the international exchanges are reciprocal and allow for only a balanced number of students to visit Princeton as nondegree students for a semester or a year, and for Princeton students to visit other institutions. The Exchange Scholar Program enables students to take classes or conduct research at other Ivy-Plus institutions for one semester or one year. The cross-registration agreements allow students to take courses that are not normally available at their home institutions.
