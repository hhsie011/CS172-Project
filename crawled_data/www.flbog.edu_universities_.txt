U.S. News & World Report names Florida No. 1 for higher education for the last five years Expand for More Informationadd Did U Know? U.S. News & World Report named Florida the No. 1 state in the country for higher education for the the last five years. The ranking weighs metrics such as graduation rates, the cost of tuition, and the amount of student debt, shining a national spotlight on Florida's combination of high quality and low cost. What does this mean for you? The State University System's four-year graduation rates have soared 12% in the past five years, even as costs have plunged to an average of $3,020 for a four-year degree once financial aid is included. Additionally, U.S. News & World Report lists five State University System institutions as among the top 100 public universities in the country. Florida's momentum is due to support from elected leaders as well as the Board of Governors' performance-based funding model. Bottom line? The State University System is a good return on investment.
