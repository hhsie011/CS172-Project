This commitment is grounded not only in disability law, including Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Sections 504 and 508), the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and the ADA Amendments of 2008, but also in Dartmouth's commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging for all members of the academic community. Dartmouth's ADA/504 Coordinator (ADAC) in the Office of Institutional Diversity and Equity (IDE) serves as the first point of contact for information about Dartmouth's Disability-Based Accommodation Appeals Procedures. ALTERNATIVE RESOLUTION PROCESS Dartmouth encourages an efficient and informal resolution of concerns. In many instances, an informal process can resolve a disability-related accommodation concern in an efficient and expeditious manner. Individuals who have disability-related concerns may initially attempt to resolve matters by contacting the Campus Disability Authority to discuss the nature of the concern, factors to consider as part of the interactive process, and whether an alternative resolution process with the relevant individual or program can be engaged. Individuals who have been denied an accommodation by the Campus Disability Authority may contact Dartmouth's ADA/504 Coordinator (ADAC) in the Office of Institutional Diversity and Equity (IDE). FORMAL APPEAL PROCEDURE Individuals who are not satisfied with the alternative resolution process or who wish to engage in a formal appeal of a decision or action without first seeking an informal resolution should contact Dartmouth's ADA/504 Coordinator who is responsible for responding to allegations of discrimination in the accommodation process. The accommodation appeal procedure is responsive to situations where there is a disagreement with any action, inaction, or decision resulting in a failure to implement an agreed-upon accommodation, the quality of the accommodation provided, the timeliness of the receipt of the accommodation, an accommodation denial, or any other accommodation-based claim. To file a formal Disability Accommodation Appeal, contact Linda Sullivan, ADA/504 Coordinator, (603) 646-3920 | ada.ide@dartmouth.edu Allegations of disability-related discrimination unrelated to the accommodation process are addressed through the Equal Opportunity Grievance Procedures in the Office of Institutional Diversity and Equity (IDE).
