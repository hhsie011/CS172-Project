Morgan Stanley serves as the University’s main brokerage firm. You will need to work directly with your broker to complete a transfer form and initiate a transfer of stock to the University of Pennsylvania. If you hold the certificate, it is best if those certificates remain unendorsed and you complete a separate stock power form authorizing transfer of ownership from the donor to Wharton. ▼ Charitable Gifts Through Your IRA The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015, has extended the IRA Charitable Rollover permanently. The extension allows individuals age 70½ and older to donate up to $100,000 from their IRAs to The Wharton School tax-free. You do not receive an income tax charitable deduction. This provision allows you to transfer money from your IRA directly to Wharton, without having to recognize the transfer as taxable income. You should consult with your tax advisors about your specific situations. The sample letter can be used to send to your IRA plan provider. ▼ Matching Gifts Don’t miss the unique opportunity to increase the impact of your giving through a matching gift program.
