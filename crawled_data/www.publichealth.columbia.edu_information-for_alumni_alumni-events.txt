Public Health: A Critical Foundation for Successful Societies A conversation with Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization and Dr. Linda P. Fried, Dean of the Mailman School of Public Health The Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health is turning 100 this year! This celebration is happening at a critical moment as communities across the globe grapple with an array of public health-related crises and challenges, including COVID-19, health inequities driven by poverty and racism, the health effects of climate change, and longer lives. Significant work lies ahead and governments, the private sector, NGOs, and academia can play a vital role to secure equal access to conditions that ensure the health and well-being of everyone. And in a world, where the challenges require national and global solutions - the role of key global institutions is particularly critical. Please join us for a conversation between Tedros Adhanom, director-general of the WHO, and Linda Fried, the dean of Columbia’s Mailman School, as they discuss lessons from COVID-19 and how we can prepare for the next century of public health threats by translating research into action.
