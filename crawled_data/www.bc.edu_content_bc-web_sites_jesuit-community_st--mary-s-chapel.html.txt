The north end of the building contains St. Mary's Chapel, a "Gothic gem," as one Jesuit described it, with a marble altar, oak pews, a carved oak ceiling, and a choir loft. A southern wing was added to the structure in 1930, providing a covered cloister walk running north and west to enclose a small garden.
