The undergraduate program in biomedical engineering is an independent concentration that is administered both by the School of Engineering and the Division of Biology and Medicine. Students can take courses from and do research with faculty from engineering, the various departments of biology, and the Brown-affiliated hospitals in Rhode Island. The program’s primary emphasis is on the fundamentals of biomedical engineering, while also allowing students to personalize their curriculum. BME students learn to apply the principles of engineering and science, along with problem solving skills and critical thinking to a broad spectrum of engineering problems. Further, BME is a sound foundation for lifelong education with its emphasis on the use of teamwork, effective communication skills and an understanding of broad social, ethical, economic and environmental consequences. Alumni of the Biomedical Engineering (BME) program will achieve one or more of these program educational objectives (PEOs) within 5 years of graduation: : Serve society through work or advanced study in a broad range of fields including, but not limited to, medicine, healthcare, industry, government, and academia Apply their deeply creative and versatile biomedical engineering education to solve a broad spectrum of engineering and societal challenges Contribute as role models, mentors, or leaders in their fields Concentration Requirements Concentration Advisors Accreditation BMES Capstone Submit a Design Proposal Past Projects Concentration Advisors Concentration Requirements Current Requirements Electives Currently Offered FAQs Independent Study Honors in BME Careers Contact Center for Biomedical Engineering Brown University Box A-2 Arnold Lab 91 Waterman Street, Suite 211 Providence, RI 02912 +1-401-863-6778 [email protected] Quicklinks Apply Now Research Faculty Academics Give to CBME Giving to Brown Brown University Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA Phone: 401-863-1000 Maps & Directions / Contact Us © 2016 Brown University Connect: [email protected] Facebook Twitter YouTube Instagram iTunes U Google+ LinkedIn SnapChat
