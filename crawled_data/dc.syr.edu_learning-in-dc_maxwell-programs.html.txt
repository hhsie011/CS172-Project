While the Maxwell School has offered programs in Washington, DC, for many years, in 2013 it launched a far-reaching collaboration with the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) that is providing a host of new opportunities for students and faculty. All Maxwell graduate and undergraduate classes are held at CSIS’s headquarters on Rhode Island Avenue NW. The facility also houses the Maxwell-in-Washington staff and visiting faculty from Syracuse, and provides enhanced opportunities to conduct symposia, workshops, meetings, and expanded executive education programs. Maxwell-in-Washington Maxwell-in-Washington provides a mix of policy relevant professional development courses and faculty-supervised internships that fulfill the Maxwell School's hallmark emphasis on experiential learning. Nearly 200 undergraduate and graduate students participate in the DC programs in a given year. In the past year, students completed a total of 130 internships at 82 different Washington organizations. Maxwell-in-Washington faculty exposed students to over 150 public policy and international affairs experts representing government, NGOs, think tanks, the private sector, media, multilateral organizations, and foreign embassies. The interaction between the spheres of international relations and public administration makes the joint master's degree program in PA/IR an invaluable experience for students seeking a career that values the combination of international expertise and public management skills. The joint program offers excellent preparation for professions in government, global consulting firms, NGOs, and international organizations.
