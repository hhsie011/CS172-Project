View garage locations and rates for Commuter Parking. NOTE: Commuter parkers must pay charges via payroll deduction. If your parking fee is charged to your department, you should submit the Authorization to Charge Employee Parking to a University Account Form. Parking paid by a department is considered additional compensation and will be included in your calendar-year Form W-4 or Form 1099 if you are not on the University payroll. Please note that any such payment is reported to the Office of the Controller for review and determination whether it constitutes a taxable benefit under IRS regulations; please see IRS Publication 15-B for more information.
