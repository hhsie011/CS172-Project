A Talk by Ghada Karmi Events Past Event One Hundred Years of the Balfour Declaration - A Talk by Ghada Karmi Share Add to Calendar: Google Yahoo October 29, 2017 6:30 PM - 8:00 PM Columbia Global Centers | Amman Join us for a talk by Ghada Karmi, Research Fellow at the Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies at the University of Exeter One Hundred Years of the Balfour Declaration: An Ongoing Palestinian Tragedy About the talk This talk is part of a workshop, Where now for the Palestinian Right of Return: theoretical right or concrete objective? November 2017 marks the centenary of the Balfour Declaration, in which a former British government assured the Zionist movement of its help in creating a Jewish national home in Palestine. This commitment initiated a train of consequences for the people of Palestine that continues to impact them today. The talk will discuss this topic in light of a newly re-issued classic work, Palestine: The Reality, by J.M.N. Jeffries, written in 1939 and subsequently lost to public view for many decades. Dr. Ghada Karmi is a Research Fellow at the Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies at the University of Exeter. Her major area of research has centered on the Palestine/Israel conflict. She has also worked on issues of migration and adjustment of minorities to Western culture. Karmi's publications include Jerusalem Today: What Future for the Peace Process? (1996), and The Palestinian Exodus 1948-1998 (1999). Her memoir, In Search of Fatima: a Palestinian Story, published in 2002, won wide critical acclaim. Her book, Married to Another Man: Israel’s Dilemma in Palestine,is a detailed analysis of the peace process and argues for a unitary-state solution to the conflict. Her most recent book, Return: A Palestinian Memoir, was published by Verso in 2015.
