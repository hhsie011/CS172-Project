She was presented with the award on Earth Day, April 22, 2022, during a ceremony the Louis Engel Waterfront Park in Ossining, NY. The award recognizes the observatory’s history-making discoveries in earth and environmental science, as well as its contributions to the local community through the Hudson River Field Station, a hub for scientific research and environmental education. “We are lucky to have a world-class research facility, the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, right here in the Hudson Valley,” said Senator Reichlin-Melnick. “Their Hudson River Field Station hosts hundreds of local students and community members where they learn about our environment and can take action to make our community safer.” “I accept this honor on behalf of all my colleagues at Lamont-Doherty,” Professor Raymo expressed during her remarks at the event. “We hope to deepen our ties with the local community and continue to contribute to the environmental health and education in the region and beyond.” The purpose of the Environmental Champion Award is to recognize and celebrate the work being done to make the Hudson Valley, NY State, and our planet a healthier, cleaner, greener, and more sustainable place to live. Raymo was one of nine recipients of the award this year.
