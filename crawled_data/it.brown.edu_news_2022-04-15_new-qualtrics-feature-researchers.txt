Are you a researcher who collects data using Qualtrics? You may be interested in the new ExpertReview features added to Brown's license in March 2022. These Qualtrics features allow you to collect embedded data along with survey responses; the embedded data marks whether the response is likely a duplicate, fraudulent, or a bot. You can either look at these values when you are cleaning up data or you can use them to branch within the survey, for example, immediately end a survey for someone who has already responded. For instructions, see our help article Prevent Survey Fraud with Qualtrics ExpertReview Features.
