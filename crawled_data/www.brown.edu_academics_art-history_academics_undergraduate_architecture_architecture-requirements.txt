Please refer to the University Bulletin for a full list of requirements. Note: Because of the intensity of the program, we suggest students declare their concentration in Architecture by the beginning of their second year.

It would normally be followed by the Projections or Analysis class, the Intermediate Studio and an Advanced studio. Depending on each student’s trajectory, sequences can vary and should be discussed with the advisor. Locations We currently have three studios, which allows us to have ‘dedicated desks’ in most of our classes – this means that every student keeps their dedicated desk for the entire semester.
