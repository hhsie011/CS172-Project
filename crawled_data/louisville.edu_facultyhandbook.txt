This Handbook is intended for new, current and prospective faculty to acquaint you with the UofL and to inform you about its policies and benefits, and the resources available to you as a faculty member. Hyperlinks are provided to connect you to a wide variety of information about the university and its surroundings. The Handbook is not a complete guide to the academics, research and services of the university. Rather, it is intended as a reference guide for orientation purposes. This is not intended to create nor does it constitute an express or implied contract between the University of Louisville and any of its employees. While efforts are made to keep the Handbook current, it should be remembered that changes in policies, procedures, and other information are effective as of the date of action or issuance by the appropriate University body even though such changes have not been distributed or referenced in the Handbook. We hope you find this Handbook valuable as you learn about the University of Louisville.
