This fellowship supports scholars whose research addresses the politics of the Black experience in the hemispheric Americas using transnational and interdisciplinary frames. We especially invite scholars of Brazil and/or its diaspora to apply. Field specialization is open, but we will give particular consideration to research that focuses on the intersection of race and one or more of the following areas of interest: urban studies, violence and marginalization, environmental studies, gender studies, sociolegal studies, public health, religious studies, ethnomusicology, performance studies, and cultural representations. In addition, the fellowship promotes student and faculty diversity at Dartmouth, and throughout higher education, by supporting underrepresented scholars and others with a demonstrated ability to advance educational diversity and inclusivity. Applicants will be selected on the basis of their academic achievement, promise in both research and teaching, and their demonstrated commitment to addressing underrepresentation in higher education. The successful candidate must have completed the PhD by the start of the fellowship appointment. This is a two-year residential fellowship, with one course taught in the second year. Throughout, fellows are expected to pursue research activities while participating fully in the intellectual life of the department and the college. Fellows receive an annual stipend of approximately $55,200 plus benefits and an allocation for research expenses (exact funding levels will be set at the time of offer). Guarini Dean's Postdoctoral Fellows are part of the Provost's Fellowship Program, a multidisciplinary cohort of approximately ten predoctoral and postdoctoral scholars who share a commitment to increasing diversity and inclusivity in their disciplines. Fellows participate together in mentoring and professional development programming, including guidance in preparing for faculty careers. Application Materials Cover letter, including overview of research areas and teaching interests; please also describe your prior contributions to advancing diversity and inclusivity in higher education and your motivations to join this multidisciplinary fellowship program; CV; Dissertation description (maximum two pages single spaced); Three confidential letters of recommendation, one of which should be from the dissertation advisor.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Latin American, Latino & Caribbean Studies Undergraduate Major Overview Minor Honors and Independent Study Courses Courses in Latin American and Caribbean Studies Alumni Alumni Stories Resources Graduates Foreign Study Overview Casa Cuba FAQs Fellowships César Chávez Fellowship César Chávez Fellowship Past Recipients Guarini Dean's Postdoctoral Fellowship News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
