Event Registration As part of the Universityâ€™s community care efforts, all student groups must register in-person events they would like to host on campus, at an off-campus residence, or at a third-party venue. This includes all events where alcohol will be served as well as dry events. EVENT REGISTRATION Fall 2021 Guidelines for Student Group Activities This guidance governs in-person activity that can be organized and/or funded by your student organization in Fall 2021. Guidance is based on current university and city/state policies and has been communicated to the University community via the August 5 Message from the President and the Public Health Guidance website. If these policies change during the semester, the guidelines for student organizations may also change. In cases where these sets of guidelines are not aligned, deference should be given to the University public health guidance.
