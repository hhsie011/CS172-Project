Parents play an important role in the decision making process of where a student will eventually go to college. Once that often difficult decision has been made, the continued support of a student's parents can often make the difference between a student succeeding and eventually graduating or not. As parents of our students, we welcome you to our "Aggie Family" and look forward to working closely together, parent, student, and University, toward "our" student's success in the classroom and in life. Texas A&M University at Galveston offers educational programs for all ages. Sea Camps, Group Tours for school groups and professional continuing education all illustrate that the Ocean is our Classroom. From Outreach Programs that help educate and inform young children to Employment Opportunities for those seeking a new career, to continuing education for lifetime mariners and teachers, Texas A&M University at Galveston stands as a contributing partner to making the world a better place for the citizens of Galveston, the State of Texas, and beyond.
