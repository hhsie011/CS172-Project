With the support of Mr. Waleed AlBanawi, Founder and Chairman at JISR Venture Partners, the series will honor the incredible work and achievements of Soraya Salti in the field of youth education and entrepreneurship. This initiative aims to create a space for debating, reflecting and understanding the challenges and opportunities faced by youth, as well as for proposing applications to address them. Najla Al-Midfa is the General Manager of Sheraa, an Emirati government entity that aims to inspire the next generation of entrepreneurs and provide them with a launch pad for success. She is also the Founder of Khayarat, a platform that enables young Emiratis to make informed career choices. In her previous role, as Senior Manager at the Khalifa Fund for Enterprise Development, Najla led a team of business counselors through the selection of ventures for financing. Prior to joining Khalifa Fund, she was a Senior Associate at Mckinsey & Company in New York. Najla's experience also includes roles within PwC and Shell. She is a board member of United Arab Bank, and Vice-Chairperson of Young Arab Leaders. She holds an MBA from Stanford University, and is a fellow of the Aspen Institute's Middle East Leadership Initiative. Naser Al Sughaiyer, an empowerment coach and trainer for youth, will be holding a two-hour interactive workshop session aimed at helping youth to discover their passions. By equipping them with 21st century life skills, the training will provide an opportunity for the participants to practically apply their personal interests either into a hobby or in the professional world, in the form of a career or a business. In doing so, high school students, university students, and young professionals will be able to both enjoy and better utilize the prospects available to them in the workforce.
