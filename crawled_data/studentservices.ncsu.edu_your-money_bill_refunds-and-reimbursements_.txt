Federal Regulations – Cash Management Refunds and Reimbursements Refunds for overpayment or other credits are processed monthly after the Census Date. Financial Aid refund checks, made payable to the student, are issued on or after the first day of classes for a semester and are processed automatically as the aid is applied to a student's account. See the Billing and Due Date Calendar to find out when refunds will be issued. Click on the following options for more information on how refunds are applied: Refunds for Reduction in Hours Refunds for Withdrawal Collect your Refund In order to collect refunds, students must sign up online for direct deposit of refunds via MyPack Portal. For students who do not sign up for direct deposit, a check will be mailed to the Home/Mailing Address listed with Registration and Records. If necessary, follow these steps to request a replacement check. PNC banking option NC State University has partnered with PNC Bank, N.A., as an optional added banking convenience with your linked Wolfpack One Card. However, a PNC banking account IS NOT required to receive your refund. Students may choose any personal bank account for refund deposits.
