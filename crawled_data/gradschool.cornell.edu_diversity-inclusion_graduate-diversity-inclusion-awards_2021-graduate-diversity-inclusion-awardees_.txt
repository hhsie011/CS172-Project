She looks forward to continuing to build community and push for institutional change during the final years of her degree program. Excellence in Leadership Award The recipients of the 2021 Excellence in Leadership Award are Casey Ching, Kavya Krishnan, and Tibra Wheeler. Casey Ching Casey Ching is a Ph.D. candidate in the field of civil and environmental engineering. Her dedication to building and growing inclusive communities is evident through her effort to improve the graduate experience on a person-to-person basis, as well as on a departmental and institutional level. She has pushed to improve communication and camaraderie across research groups within her field, including creating a graduate student Slack channel and organizing social hours (virtual social hours during the COVID-19 pandemic). Recently, she designed a map of Hollister Hall’s graduate student lounge on Gather.town for a virtual social hour. She later gifted this map to the department’s Graduate Open House so that incoming graduate students could get a feel of the graduate student-designated space. In addition, she has been involved with the Civil and Environmental Engineering Graduate Student Association for three consecutive years, during which she encouraged more creative ways to engage with the staff, faculty, and student body. One notable event that she co-organized was one regarding imposter syndrome, for which she led an interactive activity that allowed participants to maintain anonymity while challenging themselves to recognize experiences they may have had that could be attributed to imposter syndrome. Outside of her field, she has led the Society for Asian American Graduate Affairs (SAAGA) as co-president during the past year. She led her executive board through rebuilding SAAGA as a community that fulfills the current needs of the graduate AAPI community at Cornell. During the COVID-19 pandemic, and during a time when the east-Asian community is highly affected by anti-Asian hate, her priority when leading the community has been to maintain a place for all members to call “home,” whether it be through discussion of current events, game nights, or check-ins. She co-led two AAPI community processing spaces in the aftermath of the Atlanta shootings to give affected community members a space to share their stories and grieve together. Casey’s unwavering commitment to build, maintain, and grow the communities that she is a part of is a testament to her dedication to fostering inclusion and a sense of belonging for all. Kavya Krishnan Kavya Krishnan is a Ph.D. candidate in the soil and crop sciences field and a Tata-Cornell Institute Scholar.

Outside of academics she’s an outdoor adventurer, quasi-musician, part-time performer, and amateur influencer. The Cornell Institute of Archeology and Material Studies – Anti-Racism Anti-Colonialism Interest Group The Anti-racism and Anti-colonialism (ARCO) Interest Group is an organization geared toward uprooting systemic racism in archaeological practice and pedagogy by facilitating productive discussions and providing anti-racist programming for the CIAMS community, inspired by the calls to #ShutDownAcademia and #ShutDownStem on June 10th, 2020 in an effort to support the Black Lives Matter Movement. This past year they have striven to continue the dialogue through several modes, including the facilitation of follow-up discussions between students and faculty about a seminar series hosted by the Society of Black Archaeologists (SBA), Indigenous Archaeology Collective (IAC), Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research, SAPIENS, and Cornell Institute of Archaeology and Material Studies (CIAMS) seminar series. They have organized two separate reading groups: one for all members of the CIAMS community and one for graduate students and postdoctoral associates that focus on texts that consider the historical and current role of colonialism in archaeology. In doing so, they have been able to discuss issues of importance for the CIAMS community and to create a safe space for the graduate student community to voice their thoughts and concerns. All discussions are oriented toward the overarching goal to be responsibly practicing scholars in the future. Their long-term projects include the curation of an anti-colonial and anti-racist reading list with a focus on publications in archaeology, the development of a fieldwork and laboratory code of conduct, and the improvement of their capacity for shaping pedagogy and field projects that are informed by the varying perspectives. In the coming year, they plan to develop a mentoring program between graduate and undergraduate students. ARCO is a continuing group effort only possible through the participation and support of CIAMS students, postdoctoral associates, faculty, and affiliates. Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity in Earth & Atmospheric Sciences (IDEEAS) Working Group Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, or IDEEAS, formed organically in October 2019 as a grassroots collective within earth and atmospheric sciences (EAS). IDEEAS’ mission is to foster inclusion, belonging, and community in EAS among students, administrative staff, research staff, faculty, professors emeriti, and alumni. We actively promote diversity, equity, inclusion, and access as core values. We promote these values by bringing equity, diversity, and inclusion learning opportunities to the EAS community and create frameworks to ensure equitable access to department educational, research, and professional opportunities. IDEEAS provides a space to have important conversations and then take appropriate, collective action within the context of our department. IDEEAS is a non-hierarchical group within the hierarchical setting of academia. Self-selected from the full cross-section of the EAS department, IDEEAS comprises students, staff, researchers, pre-tenure and tenured faculty, emeriti, and alumni. We formed IDEEAS to educate ourselves on inclusive practices and create a more visible, equity-focused culture in the department, with the experiences and perspectives of our personal and professional communities in mind. The IDEEAS ethos rests on the premise that leadership is a dynamic process a group can enact collectively, rather than an intrinsic quality that an appointed individual exercises over followers. This principle informs how we communicate internally as a department and how we define our priorities as a community. IDEEAS organizes events with dual goals of fostering social connection and community within the department and providing intentional learning opportunities to promote critical reflection and discussion. Past and ongoing events include a well-attended kickoff party with a facilitated conversation, a regular Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI) Journal Discussion, community conversations about implicit bias and structural racism, and social events to foster connection, particularly during the pandemic. Community Outreach Award The recipients of the 2021 Community Outreach Award are Claire Fox, Kimberly Fuqua, and Robert Swanda. Claire Fox Claire Fox, Ph.D. in ecology and evolutionary biology, is recognized for her contributions to community outreach. During her time at Cornell she worked alongside fellow educators and community members to co-found and co-direct two impactful nonprofit organizations in Ithaca dedicated to expanding access to science. With the Physics Bus, Claire helped to bring the joys of physics to people of all ages and all walks of life. Unique physics exhibits made from junk delight everyone from senior living communities and music festivals to Title 1 schools and neighborhood block parties.

She is thankful for AIISP as it has allowed her to work as community support specialist and president of IGSA. Robert Swanda Robert Swanda is a Ph.D. candidate in the biomedical and biological sciences program at Cornell University. His research investigates understanding the movement between mRNA and protein production (a process called translation) and how mRNA can be leveraged as a therapeutic for diseases. Specifically, Rob has worked to create mRNAs that are rich in sulfur amino acids and has targeted these mRNAs to cancer cells to mitigate their growth. During his time at Cornell, Rob has been awarded an NIH Chemical Biology Interface (CBI) predoctoral fellowship and an American Heart Association predoctoral fellowship. As part of the CBI training program, Rob organized and ran the NIH CBI meeting at Cornell by identifying and selecting speakers to give research talks, seeking out professional development workshops, and hosting literature lunches for students. However, Rob’s commitments extend beyond the laboratory and enter the community. Throughout his graduate career Rob has volunteered with Cornell’s Center for Material Research, Cornell SACNAS, and has acted as a Graduate School Ambassador. He also engages in service-learning projects through the SMART program that partners individuals from Cornell in tackling issues in emerging markets. Rob has participated and led these projects in Colombia (January 2018), Kenya (January 2019), and Rwanda (January 2020). During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, misinformation on the COVID-19 vaccines was all over the internet. Backed with his research on mRNA, Rob sought to make short vaccine tutorials, breaking down the science for lay and professionals alike. His videos went viral, educating over 6 million people across the world and counting. Rob partnered with others in various countries to have the information translated into multiple languages to further break down the barriers of this scientific content.

Neil Lewis Jr. Neil Lewis Jr., assistant professor in the field of communication, division of general internal medicine, and graduate field of psychology, is committed to advising, mentoring, and advocating for students who are often on the margins of our university and broader society. He directs the Motivation and Goal Pursuit Lab that supports a diverse community of students through every step of their career and professional development as they study how people’s social contexts and identities influence meaning-making, motivation, and behavior and the implications of those processes for (in)equity in education, health, and environmental outcomes. Lewis supports students in the pursuit of their own goals in any way that he can, including mentoring them through their projects, advocating for them at the university and in the profession, and more generally being a resource they can turn to whenever they need anything. Senior Faculty The recipients of the 2021 Senior Faculty Champion Award are Hector Abruña, Corrie Moreau, and Chelsea Specht. Hector Abruña Hector D. Abruña, Emile M. Chamot Professor in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, is recognized for his indefatigable dedication, throughout his nearly 38-year career at Cornell, to enhancing and promoting diversity, both in recruiting and educating women in the chemical sciences, as well as recruiting, retaining, and mentoring underrepresented minority graduate students, particularly those from his native Puerto Rico. His efforts have had a notable impact on the field of chemistry’s (and more generally Cornell’s) ability to recruit and retain a more diverse student population. Abruña regularly recruits students from colleges and universities in Puerto Rico, including the campuses of the University of Puerto Rico at Rio Piedras (where he was a faculty member from 1982-83 prior to coming to Cornell), Cayey, Humacao, and Mayaguez, as well as to the Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico. Over the last 37 years, he has recruited 25 minority graduate students into the graduate field of chemistry at Cornell University with over a 90% rate of retention and graduation. Of those, 13 have obtained a Ph.D. degree under his direct supervision (from a total of 56 to date) with an additional one currently in his group. To date, 22 women (again, from a total of 56) have obtained a Ph.D. degree under Abruña’s supervision; currently, there are seven female graduate students (in addition to one female undergrad and one female postdoc for a total of nine from a total group of 15) currently in his group. Moreover, 13 of the individuals (including seven women and three minorities) who obtained their Ph.D. degrees under Prof. Abruña’s supervision have gone on to pursue academic careers. Professor Abruña is an internationally recognized figure in the field of electrochemistry. Elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2018, he has published over 525 papers and presented over 650 invited lectures worldwide. He considers his 56 Ph.D. students and 75 postdoctoral associates, to date, as his most important professional achievement. Corrie Moreau Corrie Moreau, professor of entomology and ecology and evolutionary biology and director and head curator of the Cornell University Insect Collection, is recognized for her significant contributions to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion across the campus. She strives to make all spaces to which she belongs more inclusive and equitable, including her own lab group, her departments, the campus more widely, and the scientific societies she is a member of. She serves on the diversity, equity, and inclusion committees in both departments for which she is faculty and recently served on the university-wide Anti-racism Working Group committee tasked with coming up with recommendations for an anti-racism class requirement for all students at Cornell. She has also given invited data-driven presentations on the issues of racism and bias in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), including actionable solutions to make STEM more equitable and inclusive, across campus and around the world. Professor Moreau also designed and implemented a new seminar course in fall 2019 titled “Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion: The Science Behind Bias”, which attracted undergraduates and graduate students from across colleges and campus. In the course readings/media covered the history of bias in STEM in the USA, current research showing continued racism and bias for many groups in STEM, modern misuses of research reinforcing racism and bias, and advances and solutions to overcome bias as an individual and as a department or institution. This course was very well received and was featured in the Cornell Chronicle and The Cornell Daily Sun. Chelsea Specht Dr. Chelsea Specht is the Barbara McClintock Professor of Plant Biology and the Associate Dean for Diversity and Inclusion for the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell University. She is a faculty member in the graduate fields of plant biology and ecology and evolutionary biology and a faculty fellow of the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future. Chelsea’s research and teaching focuses on plant diversity and the evolution of plant form and function. She has an active lab with five current graduate students and four postdocs, all of whom engage in innovative research and demonstrate inclusive excellence through their lived experiences, actions, and commitments to fostering a diverse and inclusive academia. Dr. Specht moved from the University of California, Berkeley to join the Cornell faculty in July 2017. At UC Berkeley she was part of a University of California-wide task force on transforming graduate admissions funded by the Mellon Foundation, and with this group developed best practices for holistic graduate admissions that would support inclusive cultures for graduate programs regardless of the field and engage faculty in the process of contributing to admissions policies and mentoring practices that foster a more diverse future faculty. She also worked to establish funding mechanisms for graduate students from marginalized backgrounds to carry out independent research projects that would help to establish their careers as academic researchers, mentors, and professors. As the inaugural Associate Dean for Diversity and Inclusion for the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell, Professor Specht has focused on graduate initiatives including working with DGSs across the college to develop inclusive admissions policies and support graduate student well-being and retention through encouraging faculty participation in programs designed to improve mentoring and increase inclusivity in research labs. She meets with graduate students one-on-one or as groups to help identify and abolish practices that are limiting their ability to thrive and developed a workshop to support students and postdocs in writing honest and authentic statements of diversity, equity, and inclusion that highlight their contributions to inclusive excellence as they prepare for future faculty positions.
