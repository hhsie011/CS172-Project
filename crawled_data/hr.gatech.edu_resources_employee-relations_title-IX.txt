Title IX is a federal law designed to ensure women and men are provided equal access to programs and activities at educational institutions that receive federal financial assistance. Our policies and practices are anchored in this law, which fosters a culture of inclusivity on campus and provides everyone with a competitive and successful academic or employment experience. Every member of the Tech community -- students, faculty, staff, and administrators -- is expected to comply with Title IX and to practice respectful, ethical, and equitable treatment of others regardless of their sex. Understanding Title IX and the rights it protects is critical to preventing any discriminatory behavior in violation of the federal law. Examples of areas covered under Title IX include, but are not limited to: Academics Admissions Athletics Benefits Employment/compensation Housing Pregnancy/childcare Recruitment Sexual harassment Learn More About GT and Title IX More about Title IX Compliance Need Assistance?
