He earned his B.A. in Psychology at SUNY Albany, an Ed.M. in Prevention Science and Practice at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, and an M.A. in African-American Studies at Columbia University. As a life-long student and adolescent educator, Daniel has designed and facilitated international research expeditions - focused on AfroLatino identities, traditions and communities in Cuba, Peru and Puerto Rico - for high school students of color. Central to this work is disrupting hegemonic narratives that dominate pathways for Afrodiasporic communities to learn about our own histories. His research interests include the contemporary Black DiaspoRican experience, roots/routes of homecoming for Black Puerto Ricans in the mainland United States, and Afrodiasporic community and educational sites of resistance.
