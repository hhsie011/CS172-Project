These programs are designed to extend expertise into interdisciplinary areas and to certify training beyond the home Ph.D. discipline. They promise to advance student careers as well as promote intellectual exchange and community in these academic areas. To pursue a certificate program, a student must have the support of the department in which they are pursuing the doctoral degree and the program offering the certificate. Certificates typically require three to five courses and sometimes require a substantial piece of written work, internship, practicum, or other project. The programs are offered at no charge to eligible doctoral students. Successful completion of the requirements of the certificate program will be recognized on the Brown University transcript with a notation indicating the field of this advanced study. Although approved programs may be informally described as “certificates,” no separate document will be awarded by the Registrar.
