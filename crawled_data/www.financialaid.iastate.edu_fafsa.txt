It is important to remember to file the FAFSA by the annual priority deadline in order to be considered for priority financial aid. Completing the FAFSA Completing the FAFSA for the first time can be confusing, so we’ve compiled a set of instructions to make the process easier. Dependency Learn how the FAFSA determines dependency of a student, and how students should classify themselves. Special Conditions Do you feel that your financial situation is represented incorrectly on the FAFSA? Learn more about extenuating circumstances. Making Corrections Learn about making corrections to the FAFSA application. FAFSA FSA ID Before a FAFSA can be submitted, it must be signed by the student, and, in many cases, a parent. In addition to a paper signature, a FAFSA may also be signed using an electronic Department of Education FSA ID. Student Aid Report (SAR) After the FAFSA has been processed, a Student Aid Report will be sent to both the student and the schools specified in the FAFSA. Verification In accordance with federal regulations (CFR Title 34, Part 668), Iowa State University must complete a process called verification by collecting documentation from a select number of students regarding the information reported on their FAFSA. Federal Student Aid Estimator Use this tool to calculate an estimated Expected Family Contribution (EFC) without completing an actual FAFSA. Need Help with the FAFSA? The US Department of Education offers a detailed online resource in English and Spanish to aid students with completing the FAFSA.
