At this time there are three study rooms available (Rockefeller Library Room 327, 328 and 329) for students who need a quiet space or with reduced distractions. Each room can be used by one person at a time. Each room can be booked for 2 hours per day, with access available during open building hours. SAS students may book a room up to two times per week. Bookings, SAS students only, may be made through the library reservation system via https://libcal.brown.edu/reserve/sas. These rooms may be reserved only by students registered with SAS. For problems or questions about the reservation system, please call the SAS office at 401-863-9588 during weekday business hours M-F 8:30- 5pm. Since these are limited resources, please be respectful of others. Students must currently follow all Brown University current COVID protocols, including using masks when required. Students are expected to wipe down their areas before and after they study for additional safety. SAS students may also access Room A-17 in the Sciences Library on a first-come first-served basis. We ask that students only utilize that room for two hour periods per day, maximum twice per week.
