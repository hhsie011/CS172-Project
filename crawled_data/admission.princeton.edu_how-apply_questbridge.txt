Since 2006, our partnership with QuestBridge allows us to reaffirm that mission and assist students who may have not previously considered Princeton as an option for an affordable education. In the time that we have been a QuestBridge partner, we have "matched" with hundreds of scholars. While this number is not static and can change from year to year, Princeton goes on to accept a larger number of QuestBridge finalists through Regular Decision. Your chances of being admitted to Princeton are not different depending on how you apply. We apply the same rigorous selection criteria in the National College Match process as we do in Regular Decision. The QuestBridge National College Match helps outstanding low-income high school seniors gain admission and full four-year scholarships to some of the nation's most selective colleges. For more information on the QuestBridge program or the National College Match, please visit the QuestBridge website. The QuestBridge Process QuestBridge Finalists Ranking Princeton Beginning with the 2020-2021 admission cycle, Princeton will have a binding decision for students matched with us through the National College Match. If you are matched to Princeton through the National College Match, you must withdraw all applications to other schools. If you are matched to another binding institution through the National College Match, you must withdraw your application for consideration at Princeton. Applicants who ranked Princeton but do not match with Princeton or any other binding partner school will be considered for Regular Decision. If you have ranked Princeton, we will automatically receive your National College Match Application from QuestBridge in late October. We will send you follow-up instructions for accessing your Princeton Applicant Portal and submitting the rest of your application materials. All materials are due by November 1. You will find the additional required materials in order to complete your application below: Princeton QuestBridge Supplement Graded Written Paper QuestBridge Midyear Report and Midyear Transcript due by mid-February (this includes any available senior year grades) Test Scores (For the 2022-2023 cycle, we have paused our standardized testing requirement.) Students may self-report their scores on their application. However, if admitted, we will need to receive official scores from a testing agency in order to matriculate. Financial Aid Documents National College Match applicants will learn if they matched with an institution in early December. You will receive an email directly from QuestBridge. Students who match with Princeton will receive a follow-up email from the Office of Admission. We will not be able to release decisions by phone. Please communicate directly with QuestBridge to find out if you matched with a school. For more information on the National College Match process, please visit the QuestBridge website.

Fee Waiver All QuestBridge Finalists automatically qualify for a fee waiver.

Financial Aid During the National College Match, Princeton will only match with students whose parents or legal guardians have a Parent Contribution of zero as determined by Princeton’s financial aid office. Students whose parents or legal guardians have a Parent Contribution greater than zero will still be considered for admission to Princeton during Regular Decision and will still qualify for aid to meet their full demonstrated need, if admitted.
