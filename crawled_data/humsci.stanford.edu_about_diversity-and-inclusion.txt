Faculty, students, staff, and alumni in the School of Humanities and Sciences encompass many ethnicities, races, nationalities, genders, sexual orientations, and beliefs. We believe that these multiple dimensions enrich the breadth and depth of Stanford’s research, teaching, and scholarship—and create a more vibrant community. H&S works to enable a new generation of scholars who reflect the growing diversity of intellectual perspectives, life experiences, and cultures represented in society today. There are many resources across the university to support an environment in which everyone can thrive and grow academically, professionally, and personally.
