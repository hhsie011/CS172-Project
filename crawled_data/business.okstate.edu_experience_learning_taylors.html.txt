Open from 11 a.m.- 1 p.m. Tuesday through Friday during the spring and fall semesters and located in the Nancy Randolph Davis building, the teaching restaurant provides students, faculty, staff, and OSU guests an option for lunch not found elsewhere on campus. Each week’s menu highlights a new cuisine. We strongly recommend reservations through Phone, OpenTable app, or HTM website. Dine with us Reservations In our “back-to-normal,” we still take extra precautions Taylor’s is back to full-service operation with students serving patrons at the table while maintaining the interactive buffet stations for a more personalized service. We decided to maintain safety guidelines to protect student workers and patrons: Cash will not be accepted this semester. Walk-ins are going to be limited based on daily reservations, so we strongly suggest booking ahead. Kitchen stations will be strictly divided to maintain safe distancing as much as possible. Action stations will eliminate interaction of guests with plateware. Hand sanitizing stations will be located at every entrance. Strict reservation policy will be implemented to maintain adequate restaurant capacity.
