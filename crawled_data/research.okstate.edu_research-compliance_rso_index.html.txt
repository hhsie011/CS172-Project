These licenses are issued by the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ) acting on behalf of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). As a licensee of ODEQ, the Radiation Safety Office is charged with the responsibility to ensure that all radioactive materials and machines capable of producing ionizing radiation are used in accordance with all applicable state and federal regulations, namely Oklahoma Administrative Code (OAC) 252:410 and Code of Federal Regulations 10 CFR Parts 19, 20, and 30-33 among others. To effectively fulfill these responsibilities, The Radiation Safety Office assists other campus clients who are authorized by the office to conduct activities involving radioactive materials and/or use machines which produce ionizing radiation by (among other things): Helping to ensure the safety of our clients, other campus personnel, and the general public Providing guidance to our clients on how to accomplish their research goals while adhering to federal and state regulations While compliance is a necessary part of our job, it is also an overt goal of our office to be a source of help in navigating the sometimes seemingly confusing path for use of radioactive materials and machines capable of producing ionizing radiation.
