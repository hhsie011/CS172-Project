Unlike other systems, Mathematica applies intelligent automation in every part of the system, from algorithm selection to plot layout and user interface design. You get reliable, high-quality results without needing algorithm expertise— even if as an expert, results are faster. What are the Focus Areas of Mathematica Below are listed several possible areas and relevant links for Mathematica use: Humanities - many applications for humanities, psychology and social behavior https://blog.wolfram.com/2018/11/20/computation-literature-in-high-school-doctoral-level-digital-humanities/ https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/1730326 https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/1807736 https://www.wolfram.com/solutions/industry/social-sciences/ https://blog.wolfram.com/2020/02/06/democratic-presidential-debate-analysis-using-the-wolfram-language/ Innovator award winners in humanities - https://www.wolfram.com/events/technology-conference/innovator-award/area/computational-humanities/ Classroom and virtual teaching - used for lectures, research and presentations as well as publishing https://www.wolfram.com/customer-stories/teaching-real-world-problems-with-mathematica.html https://www.wolfram.com/customer-stories/mathematica-in-college-classroom.html https://blog.wolfram.com/2021/01/14/how-we-navigated-a-hybrid-remote-learning-environment-using-wolfram-technology/ https://blog.wolfram.com/2020/11/10/online-enrichment-with-free-daily-study-groups/ Business - with live fianancial data through Wolfram|Alpha, economic analysis is a breeze with Mathematica https://www.wolfram.com/solutions/?source=nav https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/1810873 https://www.wolfram.com/events/technology-conference/innovator-award/area/economics/ https://blog.wolfram.com/2020/01/21/biodiversity-wealth-distribution-mandelbrot-sets-and-more-wolfram-community-highlights/ Machine Learning tools - Mathematica is widely used for AI and NeuralNets https://www.wolfram.com/featureset/machine-learning/ https://www.wolfram.com/language/12/high-level-machine-learning/ Text analytics https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/967299 https://www.wolfram.com/language/11/text-and-language-processing/ https://www.wolfram.com/language/12/natural-language-processing/ https://blog.wolfram.com/2016/04/21/analyzing-shakespeares-texts-on-the-400th-anniversary-of-his-death/ Engineering - used extensively for engineering whether Biological, Electrical/Computer, Civil, etc. https://www.wolfram.com/solutions/?source=nav Mathematica complements MatLab with a way to matriculate from math logic to MatLab logic you can see that here in this short video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ3HBdZ-7TI Wolfram SystemModeler is our modeling and simulation environment you can see more about it here - https://www.wolfram.com/system-modeler/ High Performance Computing - parallel processing is built into Mathematica https://www.wolfram.com/solutions/industry/hpc/ 3D Printing - very easy with Mathematica https://www.wolfram.com/language/11/3d-printing/ built-in functions to show you if you've made a mistake in your object before you waste time and materials "FindMeshDefects" and "RepairMesh" - https://search.wolfram.com/?q=mesh+defect&skip= Using Python? - Mathematica allows you to infuse your Python code directly into your Mathematica notebook https://reference.wolfram.com/language/workflow/ExecuteAPythonFileWithExternalEvaluate.html https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/1045419 Learning and Teaching Mathematica WolframU - https://www.wolfram.com/wolfram-u/?source=nav Hands-On Start to Mathematica - https://www.wolfram.com/wolfram-u/special-event/hands-on-start-to-mathematica/ Video and Screencasts - https://www.wolfram.com/broadcast/?source=nav Fast Intro for Math - https://www.wolfram.com/language/fast-introduction-for-math-students/en/ Fast Intro for Programming - https://www.wolfram.com/language/fast-introduction-for-programmers/en/ 1845 Fairmount St.Wichita, Kansas 67260 USA (316) 978-3456 Request InfoVisitApply Contact Us Virtual Tour Campus Map and Directions Facebook Twitter Instagram YouTube TikTok Wichita State has helped me put marketing strategy in a real-world perspective.
