Learning on Campus Learning on Campus >> Living on Campus Living on Campus >> Working on Campus Working on Campus >> Visiting Campus Visiting Campus >> Vaccines Clemson does not require COVID-19 vaccines but strongly encourages anyone who wants and is able to receive a COVID-19 vaccine to do so. You can read more about the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines from the CDC and DHEC. Clemson students, faculty, and staff across the state of South Carolina can voluntarily upload proof of their COVID-19 vaccination using the Upload Tool and are encouraged to do so. De-identified data submitted through the upload tool will be used to assist University administration in continued health and safety planning. Identifiable data may be used to implement quarantine exceptions in accordance with CDC and DHEC guidelines. Those seeking vaccine availability in South Carolina can use DHEC’s Vax Locator or Vaccine.gov to find a nearby vaccination site. Masks and Face Coverings Face masks are NOT required in University facilities with the exception of in medical facilities and testing sites and on public transportation (CATBus, TigerTransit). Note that individuals exiting isolation and quarantine are still required to mask for five days. While no longer required for all other individuals, masks are encouraged in instructional areas (classrooms, instructional labs) and research labs. Physical Distancing All University facilities, including instructional and research areas, will operate at full capacity. No physical distancing requirements will be in place at this time. Cleaning Cleaning processes have returned to pre-COVID-19 protocols, however cleaning standards are continuously reviewed. Should conditions warrant enhanced cleaning protocols, the University is prepared to quickly reestablish enhanced cleaning to reduce the spread of illness.
