Archived Whole Earth Telescope (WET) webiste - frozen in early 2008 Please go to the University of Delaware DARC(WET) Page for current WET activities WET Announcements Click Here to go to the new WET home page at the University of Delaware. The pages at Iowa State will serve as an archive of the WET activity through 2006 or so. Xcov 15 finallly hits the presses in 2008 - after 11 years! Congratulations to Dennis Sullivan and the many coauthors on publishing the analysis of data on EC 20058 - it is never too late! Xcov 25 ran from 17-31 May 2006, and inaugurated a new phase for the Whole Earth Telescope! This run was the first to be coordinated at the Mt. Cuba Observatory. Mt. Cuba, a participant in several WET runs, is associated with the University of Delaware, home of the Delaware Asteroseismic Research Center (DARC). With Xcov 25, the WET has joined with the DARC to broaden the scope of science that can be done by those of us involved in asteroseismology with networked telescopes. See the above link for details, and go here for details of Xcov25. XCov 24 has concluded. Despite some terrible weather around the globe, our observers managed to produce a fine data set on the primary and secondary targets - thank you very much to all of those who participated. The primary target was PG 0014, and the secondary target was RXJ 2117. Please see the XCov 24 web page for details. Data anlaysis is complete, and the paper is now accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal! Recent WET Publications D.J. Sullivan et al.

See the Publications for more WET papers and for downloads..... The Whole Earth Telescope (WET) is a collaborative effort between astronomers all over the world who are interested in studying the variability of astronomical objects. Objects that vary continuously require constant monitoring in order to unambiguously measure the intrinsic variations, which is impossible from a single site on Earth. The WET was one of the first worldwide collaborations of this type, and continues as an example of international cooperation in astronomy.
