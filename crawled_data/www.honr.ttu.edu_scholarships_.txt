Honors Scholarships Incoming first year and transfer students accepted to the Honors College by the December 1st priority admission deadline will be considered for Honors College Scholarships. Notification of these awards will be made via TechMail. Many students compete for these scholarships, with limited funds available for incoming students. The majority of our scholarship funds are reserved for students once they've completed one semester in the Honors College. Honors Sciences & the Humanities (HSH) majors receive a $1,000 scholarship from the Honors College upon declaring the HSH major. This scholarship is renewable contingent upon the student remaining an HSH major in good standing and on track to fulfill the HSH degree requirements. If at any time the student drops the HSH major, the scholarship is revoked.
