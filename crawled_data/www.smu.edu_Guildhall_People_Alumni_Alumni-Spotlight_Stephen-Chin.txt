Too many to pick just one, but if I had to it would be designing and developing a very popular live event for Firefall. Why did you choose to get your education from the Guildhall? It's a team- and profession-oriented program with a focus on practical application. How did the Guildhall prepare you for your career in gaming, and what impact has it had on your life? It provided immense amounts of prep and training — too much to really talk about in a short statement. Needless to say, it has had a huge impact on my life. What is your favorite Guildhall memory? At the end of the first week of class, realizing that the Guildhall and being a designer were what I wanted out of a profession and career.
