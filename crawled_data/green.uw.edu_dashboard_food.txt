We are one of 45 colleges and universities participating in the Menus of Change initiative, and Housing & Food Services (HFS) works to make dishes based on a plant-forward food philosophy available in all dining locations. There are many other departments and student groups working to improve our food systems and sustainability at UW. The UW Food Pantry is working to combat food insecurity by providing nutritious, wholesome food to anyone in the UW community. The Nutritional Sciences program offers undergraduate and graduate degrees, and regularly hosts a seminar series on issues around food and nutrition. Many student groups also connect UW students with work around food, including the UW Farm and Student Food Cooperative. HFS food informationSee the data What can I do?
