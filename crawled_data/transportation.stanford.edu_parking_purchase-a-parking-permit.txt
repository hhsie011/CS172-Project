Purchase a Parking Permit Stanford Transportation has implemented a virtual permit system. Commuters, residents, and departments can purchase virtual parking permits, enter license plate information for vehicles they plan to park on campus, and link those vehicles to their permit. If you are a visitor, you can use ParkMobile in visitor parking areas. Tour groups must reserve parking spaces in advance. Parking Permit Rates View all parking rates. How to Purchase Whether you are a Stanford affiliate or visitor, check out your purchasing options. Commuters If you are commuting to Stanford, you have a number of options for selecting and paying for parking. Before you decide, consider sustainable commute options and the many incentives Stanford offers. Resident Students If you are a resident student, you can purchase a resident permit, but you cannot purchase a commuter permit. With the many transportation resources on campus, consider going car-free. Visitors Visitors can use Parkmobile to park at the main campus and Stanford Redwood City. Events Our office can work with campus event planners to reserve event parking. When scheduling events, try to avoid peak times (arrivals from 7 a.m. to 8 a.m. and departures from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m.). Tour Groups All campus tours and visits that are not organized by Stanford must reserve a tour access time slot. Departments Departments can find parking and additional resources for their business needs.
