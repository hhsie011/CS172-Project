All students should have F-1 (exchange students should have J-1) written as the visa classification. D/S stands for duration of status, which means the period during which the student is pursuing a full course of study, one year to twenty-nine months for practical training (18 months to three years for J-1 students), and 60 days in which to depart the country (30 days for J-1 students). Passport A passport is a person’s country’s identification of him or her as a citizen. The passport must remain valid at all times and may not expire. It may be renewed by contacting one's home-country Embassy/Consulate within the U.S. Visa: Stamped Page in Passport A visa normally is a stamp placed in one's passport by an official of the U.S. (or the country being entered) that permits entry. Unless someone is visa-exempt, he/she must have a valid visa to enter the U.S.; however, unlike a passport, a visa is allowed to expire once in the U.S. Graduate School at the University of Cincinnati 110 Van Wormer Hall P.O.
