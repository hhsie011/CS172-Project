Close Stronger TUgether: COVID-19 RESOURCES Home /Commission on Racial Equity, Diversity and Inclusion /A Strategy for Tomorrow A Strategy for Tomorrow The Tulane Strategy for Tomorrow is a university-wide strategic planning process to guide our equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) and anti-racism initiatives and track our progress from July 1, 2022 through July 1, 2027. While as a community Tulane University has made significant, tangible progress over the past few years, what matters now is how we will build on this progress for the future. Alongside existing university initiatives included in “A Plan for Now” and those led by the Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion and by our campus units, the Strategy for Tomorrow will set us on a new course, one that engages our full community in a vision for Tulane related to EDI that will help us coordinate our EDI and anti-racism work and progress in measurable, data-informed ways to build a Tulane community.
