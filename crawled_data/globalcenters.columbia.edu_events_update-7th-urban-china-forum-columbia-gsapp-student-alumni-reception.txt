After the forum, there will be a reception for Columbia GSAPP students and alumni on Oct. 11. Please join us to reconnect with friends, make new connections, and share industry insights and experiences with your fellow students and alumni. About the Forum As the world enters a new era caused by the unprecedented and profound impact of COVID-19 that has challenged ways of inhabitation in almost all dimensions, we see a rising awareness given by planners to reflect on the aspects and even principles of planning, and our ways to engage with the built environment. In the meantime, China has drawn the world’s attention since the very beginning of this global public health crisis. Chinese cities have been in the center of the discussion, providing public management cases to learn about and contributing to pioneering research that we could explore on. Various topics are of public interest and deserve discussion and exploration, from large-scale national practice led by the government to small steps taken by the society. Hence, the 7th Urban China Forum entitled “Pandemic Urbanism: China’s Response to COVID-19 and a Post-COVID Future” will revolve around urbanism in the pandemic, discovering multiple aspects of urbanism, from urban design, public space and public health, management, to data and technology, urban resiliency and smart cities. Recognizing the broadness of the planning field, the forum will be joined by scholars and practitioners with various interests to reflect on the past, review the present, and reimagine a post-COVID future. This forum is organized by Urban China Network of Columbia GSAPP and co-sponsored by the M.S. Urban Planning program within Columbia GSAPP, Columbia Global Centers | Beijing, and Weatherhead East Asian Institute.
