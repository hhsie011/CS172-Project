This scholarship takes many forms, from basic discovery that fuels future advances, to applied problem solving that meets the challenges facing our environment, but also to engaged work that involves a reciprocal, collaborative relationship between our scholars and an organization outside Brown. Each type of scholarship — basic, applied and engaged — is important and essential for IBES to meet its goals. IBES students, staff and faculty are involved in a wide variety of engaged scholarship activities, at a local, national and international level. Environmental Health IBES works with the RI Department of Health to investigate how best to increase the state's adaptive capacity to deal with heat waves associated with climate change and how to reduce children's exposure to cancer-linked pollutants, which are a legacy of our state's industrial history. Conservation IBES works with The Nature Conservancy, the US Department of Fish and Game, and other organizations that aim to conserve or restore our state, nation and world's biological heritage. Environmental Governance IBES works with United Nations delegations from many individual countries to develop a framework that can equitably fund adaptation approaches needed in response to climate change. Students at Brown have the opportunity to become essential contributors to engaged scholarship through IBES courses, research and internship opportunities, and our Engaged Scholars Program.
