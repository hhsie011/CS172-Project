Hagopian, Kemper, Owens, Philpott, Rikvold, Robson, Schlottmann, Skofronick Florida State University’s Department of Physics offers exciting programs and opportunities for students interested in learning physics. Our physics curriculum provides a solid foundation for future graduate work or immediate employment. There are many reasons students seek the challenges and rigors that come from making physics a part of their undergraduate studies. Those who choose physics find themselves in a field that both expands their abilities and provides them with an immense feeling of accomplishment. Perhaps the most important benefits gained from physics training are the confidence and the ability to tackle complex technical problems. As a result of this training, physicists are able to contribute in many professions. Physics is the foundation of all sciences and has been the pursuit of some of the greatest minds in history, including Aristotle, Galileo, Newton, Maxwell, Einstein, and Dirac. Their discoveries and quest for knowledge form the foundation of our physics program. This proud tradition and passion for inquiry has produced a modern professional community of physicists whose contributions are continually expanding and changing our society. Whether it is on the end of a space-boom fixing the Hubble space telescope, creating and developing the World Wide Web, searching for the fundamental fabric of our universe, exploring safer and more reliable ways to diagnose and treat illnesses, or finding new and better ways to live, you will always find physicists on the frontier. So if you enjoy mathematics and science and are ready for a challenge, you should make physics a part of your education. The internationally recognized faculty includes many who have earned prestigious awards for their research and teaching. The faculty believe that the quality of teaching, at all levels, is enhanced by a strong research program. Undergraduates, graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows participate in all aspects of research in physics at Florida State University. In fact, most undergraduate physics majors participate in research projects, and many are co-authors on publications. This research includes strong programs in computational physics and both experimental and theoretical studies in astrophysics and high energy, nuclear, condensed matter, and atomic and molecular physics. There are also many opportunities for interdisciplinary research, particularly at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) and the Institute of Molecular Biophysics (IMB). Experimental facilities include: a 9.5 MV Super FN Tandem Van de Graaff accelerator with superconducting post accelerator; the RESOLUT radioactive beam facility; a state-of-the-art gamma spectrometer array; electron spin resonance and electron double nuclear resonance spectrometers; liquid helium refrigerators; thin film preparation facilities including sputtering and laser ablation; ultrahigh vacuum instrumentation including surface analysis (LEED, Auger, optical) and molecular beam epitaxy; synthesis and characterization facilities for novel materials; X-ray diffractometers with various sample stages for high and low temperature studies, multi-sample analysis and small angle studies; scanning electron, tunneling, and optical microscopes with image analysis; SQUID and vibrating sample magnetometers; a helium atom surface scattering facility; and a modern astronomical observatory, including a 17-inch primary science-grade housed in a 10-foot fiberglass dome. The NHMFL provides a modern infrastructure enabling research in magnetic fields, including the highest-powered DC fields in the world, mainly used for materials science research, and facilities providing the highest fields in the world for nuclear, ion cyclotron, and electron magnetic resonance spectrometers as well as magnetic resonance imaging. Experimental work in high energy physics is done at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois and at the CERN laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland. Computers are an integral part of all research programs in the department. The computational infrastructure is upgraded continuously to keep pace with advances in technology. In addition to using computers in research, students are expected to utilize numerical methods for problem solving in their course work. Programs Offered The Department of Physics offers programs leading to the following degrees: Bachelor of Science (BS), Master of Science (MS), and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD). The department offers the following majors: Physics, Physics and Astrophysics, Physics and Materials, Physical Science, and Physical Science with FSU-Teach. The departmental course offerings include courses for non-science majors, for non-physical-science majors, for K–12 educators, and for physical science majors. Honors work is available. Details may be obtained from the chair of the department. Computer Skills Competency All undergraduates at Florida State University must demonstrate basic computer skills competency prior to graduation. As necessary computer competency skills vary from discipline to discipline, each major determines the courses needed to satisfy this requirement. Undergraduate majors in Physics, Physics and Astrophysics, and Physics and Materials satisfy this requirement by earning a grade of “C–” or higher in PHZ 4151C. Undergraduate majors in Physical Science and Physical Science/FSU-Teach satisfy this requirement by earning a grade of “C–” or higher in COP 3014, COP 3363, ISC 3313, or PHZ 4151C.
