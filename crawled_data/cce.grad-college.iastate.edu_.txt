Check out our Spring 2022 flyer! Success Stories Natalia V. Rios Martinez Named 2022 Truman Scholar Natalia V. Rios Martinez, a senior in political science, international studies, and public relations, was named a 2022 Truman Scholar. Natalia is the ninth scholar at Iowa State University and the first Hispanic woman to receive the scholarship at the institution. She is currently a research assistant at the Department of Sociology and a government contracting assistant at the Procurement Technical Assistant Center and is interning at the U.S. Department of Justice. Through the application process, Natalia worked closely with Kristin and Agata, Nationally Competitive Awards Writing Consultants in the CCE: "One of the most useful things I gathered from this experience was that Agata took the time to explain the logic and the reasoning behind her suggestions. Kristin provided a new and different perspective, gave clear directions, and always looked out for my best interest. Their expertise helped me become a better writer, which is important to me as a non-native English speaker. Meeting with them made all the difference in my application, and for that, I am eternally grateful." Read More Nethmi Gewage Selected as Goldwater Scholar Nethmi W.
