Families wrestle with health issues from increased diagnoses of autism to challenges of Alzheimer’s and dementia. Heart disease, cancer, and diabetes are among our nation’s top health concerns, and the toll they take on families is costly socially, relationally, and economically. Baylor is uniquely equipped to address the impact of health- related matters on our families and communities by building on existing strengths across campus, offering meaningful expressions of health-related services, and responding to the immense needs facing families and communities. Our communities are teeming with families battling health issues. Baylor is prepared to make a difference in the coming years in several areas including autism and communication disorders. These and other related developmental disabilities are being addressed in the School of Education and the Robbins College of Health and Human Sciences. Physical and mental needs in gerontology are areas of interest in the Louise Herrington School of Nursing and the Diana R. Garland School of Social Work. To support the academic offerings, Baylor is strengthening its research capacity in these and other health-related areas and increasing the number of students and degree programs.
