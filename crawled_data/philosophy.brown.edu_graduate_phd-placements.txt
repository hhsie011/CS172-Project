listed above. Therefore, students who sought jobs before finishing their degrees but have not yet secured a position and have not yet finished their degrees are not listed above. For privacy reasons, we do not list students who completed their degrees but do not have academic appointments. So that the foregoing should not be misleading however, we list the number of such students in each year here: 2013: 4 students; 2011: 1 student. By the way, no assumptions should be made about the students who have left philosophy. In particular, it should not be assumed that they have not been "successful". They are teachers, doctors, lawyers, and business people, among other things.
