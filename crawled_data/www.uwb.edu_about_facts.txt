The campus houses one of the largest and most complex floodplain restorations in Washington State. The 58-acre wetland is a sustainable, functioning floodplain ecosystem within an urbanizing watershed. The Sarah Simonds Green Conservatory is a greenhouse, classroom and support space for research and public outreach — and houses an herbarium that facilitates studies of conservation, biodiversity and climate change. The UW Bothell campus is free of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers. It has also been designated Salmon-Safe, in part because of work managing to stormwater runoff and the campus wetland.
