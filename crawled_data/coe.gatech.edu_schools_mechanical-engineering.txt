Thanks to their creativity and multidisciplinary skill set, mechanical engineers work in virtually every industry. They are critical to the transportation industry, working on everything from the development of hybrid and electric cars to autonomous cars and underwater vehicles. Mechanical engineers are also leaders in energy systems, working on efficient power generation and developing alternative energy sources to minimize environmental impacts. The mechanical engineering program at Georgia Tech is the largest and one of the most highly rated ME programs in the country, consistently ranked in the top five nationally. Georgia Tech's program is noteworthy in that it combines engineering fundamentals with hands-on design opportunities. George W.
