Contact Us History The Brown University Office of the Registrar dates back to 1828 when the office of the "Register" was created and assumed by Lemuel H. Elliot, who had previously held the title of "Steward." The current University Registrar is Robert F. Fitzgerald, who was appointed to the position in 2010. The management staff of the Office of the Registrar is highly involved with regional and national professional organizations such as AACRAO (American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admission Officers) and accordingly follows many standard guidelines and best practices established by such organizations.
