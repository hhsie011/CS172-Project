Call for a Safewalk escort across campus; there is safety in numbers!

The Safewalk service offers two-person teams who patrol the campus, against the Brown safeRIDE shuttle route, acting as additional "eyes and ears" for community safety. SW also periodically stations a team at the Rockefeller Library, as well as the CIT, to accommodate those who study late. Full service operates during the academic year only, Sunday through Thursday, from 9p.m.-2:15a.m. Call 401-863-1079 to request a safewalk to your destination.
