This includes visitors from community groups and K-12 schools and programs. R.M. Cooper Library For K-12 visitors, the Cooper Library can provide instruction for students in the research process, as well as learning activities that orient students to an academic library (like a tour). These requests require a minimum of two weeks notice. For all visitors, programs and tours are available from 9AM to 3PM Monday-Friday depending upon staff availability. During the school year when classes are in session, and the Libraries are in regular use by students and faculty, we may not be able to accommodate all requests. Programs and tours are not available the week before exams or during exam week.
