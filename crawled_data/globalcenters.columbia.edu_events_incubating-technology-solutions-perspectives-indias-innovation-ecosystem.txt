7:30 PM Columbia Global Centers | Mumbai, 12-13, Maker Chambers VI, First floor, Jamnalal Bajaj Road, Nariman Point, Mumbai 400 021 As part of its Urban Works Innovation Challenge, Columbia Global Centers | Mumbai invites you to a panel discussion on June 25, 2019. The event will discuss the role of incubators in India's innovation ecosystem: what has worked so far, and what more needs to be done to factor in ecosystem-level changes. In India, there are more than 200 incubators, ranging from technology incubators started by the government, corporations, educational institutions, venture capital firms, angel investors, and first-generation entrepreneurs. Incubators perform a key role in the innovation ecosystem – they help startups achieve problem-solution fit, they help academia spin-off companies, they are a pipeline provider for early-stage investors, and they are the hub of startup promotion for governments. The incubation model is thriving and yet, as the ecosystem evolves, many challenges lie ahead. Novel solutions are required to successfully navigate changing social needs of urban India, including deep tech expertise, granular market data, and improved collaboration among various stakeholders. Distinguished panelists including Sunita Singh and Pratap Raju will present their critical understanding and experience in the tech incubator space to address the sector's challenges, cutting-edge tools and models, and opportunities. The session will be moderated by Dr Ravina Aggarwal, Director, Columbia Global Centers | Mumbai.
