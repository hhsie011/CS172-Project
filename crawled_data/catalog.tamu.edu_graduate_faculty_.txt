This section presents university policies and practices which Department Heads, Deans, and intercollegiate faculties should follow in nominating members to the Graduate Committee Faculty of Texas A&M University for participation on graduate student advisory committees. This document also discusses the various roles of Graduate Committee Faculty and describes the credentialing requirements for the Graduate Teaching Faculty. Departments, intercollegiate faculties, and colleges may require additional prerequisites for individuals seeking an appointment to the Graduate Committee Faculty. Additional requirements are subject to review and approval by the Associate Provost and Dean of the Graduate and Professional School. Graduate Committee Faculty nominations are submitted through the Graduate Committee Faculty website. For questions regarding access to the Graduate Committee Faculty nomination site, please contact the Administrative Coordinator at gradcom@tamu.edu. The form must be completed in its entirety and with the appropriate documents uploaded. Once complete, the nomination will be submitted for approval through the workflow. Only those who are authorized to sign and submit graduate documents by their department, interdisciplinary program, or college will be given access to the Graduate Committee Faculty nomination system. Graduate Teaching Faculty According to SACS-COC guidelines, faculty teaching graduate and post-baccalaureate course work should have an earned doctorate or terminal degree in the teaching discipline or a related discipline. Other credentials that may be considered include possession of a master's degree or at least 18 semester credit hours of graduate-level coursework in the same or closely related field; professional licensure or certification in a related field or profession; or significant professional, research, or teaching experience in the same or closely related field. Faculty members meeting these credentialing requirements are automatically granted membership in the Graduate Teaching Faculty. The Office of the Vice President for Faculty Affairs assumes responsibility for verifying the teaching qualifications for faculty. Colleges and departments oversee hiring of graduate assistants who serve as instructors of record for undergraduate courses. The guidelines for all instructional faculty, including graduate teaching assistants, who are instructors of record for graduate and undergraduate courses at Texas A&M University and its two branch campuses – Texas A&M University at Galveston and Texas A&M University at Qatar – are available on the Vice President for Faculty Affairs website. In addition to meeting the credentialing requirements for teaching graduate courses, faculty teaching research courses such as 691 and other designated courses must also be members of the Graduate Committee Faculty. Graduate Committee Faculty Appointees to the Graduate Committee Faculty participate in the graduate degree programs of Texas A&M University by serving on graduate student advisory committees. Members of the Graduate Committee Faculty are selected from qualified individuals of the faculty and professional staff of Texas A&M University; from employees of Texas A&M University System agencies such as Texas A&M AgriLife Research, Texas A&M Forest Service, Texas A&M AgriLife Extension, TEES, and TTI; from employees of affiliated research organizations (such as the USDA) located near Texas A&M campus sites; and from affiliated hospitals and clinical organizations. Nomination for membership on the Graduate Committee Faculty is always initiated by the head of the appropriate academic department, intercollegiate faculty, or dean of college (under special circumstances) at Texas A&M University and is processed as discussed in the following sections. Appointment to membership on the Graduate Committee Faculty, while considered an honor, serves functional purposes as well. Appointment to membership is not for the sole purpose of conferring recognition upon an individual but is designed to assure competence in the directing and advising of graduate students. Such competence is, in part, a function of experience and knowledge of operational procedures; it is also characterized by ability and motivation. Membership on the Graduate Committee Faculty is maintained only by participating in graduate programs, by directing or administering graduate work, by doing research and publishing, or by other direct and substantial contributions to the graduate programs of the University – such as through service on a Graduate Instruction Committee or with administrative assignments in graduate education. A member of the Graduate Committee Faculty may not serve in the Graduate Committee Faculty of an academic program in which the member is pursuing a graduate degree or certificate. Individuals who have not been appointed to the Graduate Committee Faculty may not serve on student advisory committees unless special approval is granted by the Associate Provost and Dean of the Graduate and Professional School. The Graduate and Professional Council expects that all Deans, Department Heads and Chairs of Intercollegiate Faculty will regularly review the Graduate Committee Faculty under their direction and recommend withdrawal of the appointments of any members who no longer merit membership in the Graduate Committee Faculty on the basis of their lack of contribution to graduate education. If the chair of a student’s advisory committee voluntarily leaves the University, and the student is near completion of the degree and wants the chair to continue to serve in this role, the student is responsible for securing a current member of the University Graduate Committee Faculty (from the student’s academic program and located near the Texas A&M University campus site) to serve as the co-chair of the committee. The Department Head or Chair of intercollegiate faculty may request in writing to the Associate Provost and Dean of the Graduate and Professional School that a faculty member who is on an approved leave of absence or has voluntarily separated from the university, be allowed to continue to serve in the role of chair of a student’s advisory committee without a co-chair for up to one year. The student should be near completion of the degree. Extensions beyond the one-year period can be granted with additional approval of the Dean. The Department Head or Chair of intercollegiate faculty shall notify any faculty member who is non-voluntarily removed from the roles of the Graduate Committee Faculty, and the faculty member has the right to appeal his/her removal through University Rule 12.99.99.M2 (Faculty Grievances Procedures). The two categories of membership include: 1) Member and 2) Special Appointment. Roles of Graduate Committee Faculty Member Role Master's Only (MS or MA) Master’s Only (MEd, other Professional Masters) Doctoral (PhD, DrPH) and Master’s Doctoral (EdD, DEng) and Master’s Chair X X X X Co-Chair X X X X Member X X X X Special Appointment Extra member (non-voting) Members of Graduate Committee Faculty A. Tenured and Tenure-Track TAMU Faculty and TAMUQ Academic Professional Track Faculty Tenured and Tenure-Track (T/TT) faculty members of Texas A&M University are eligible to participate as members of the Graduate Committee Faculty under criteria and guidelines established by each college or department. Academic Professional Track (APT) faculty members employed by Texas A&M University at Qatar (TAMUQ), with appropriate professorial rank (Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, or Professor), are also eligible to participate as members of the Graduate Committee Faculty. The aforementioned faculty members may serve as chair, co-chair, or member of advisory committees of master’s and doctoral students. Appointment of a T/TT faculty member to all roles for all graduate programs in the degree granting unit for which the individual is adloc’d is accomplished during the hiring process by the head of a department, chair of an intercollegiate faculty group, or dean of a college. Appointment of a T/TT faculty member to the chair role in another degree granting unit is accomplished by its department head, intercollegiate faculty chair, or dean through use of the Personal Record Form. Nominations of T/TT faculty members who are not adloc’d to a graduate degree-granting unit, to serve as chair or co-chair in a graduate degree-granting unit, must come from the department head or chair of intercollegiate faculty for that graduate degree-granting unit. T/TT faculty may be approved to serve as co-chair on a doctoral or a master’s advisory committee in any degree granting unit by its department head or chair of intercollegiate faculty during the degree plan or change in committee petition approval process. Appointment of an APT faculty member employed by TAMUQ, with appropriate professorial rank (Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, or Professor), is accomplished through use of the Personal Record Form and letter from the TAMUQ Graduate Instruction Committee (the members of which must be members of the Graduate Committee Faculty at TAMU) through the Dean/CEO of the TAMUQ campus and the appropriate administrative chain at TAMU.

Revisions Approved by the Faculty Senate on 14 December 2020. Initial Guidelines Approved by the Faculty Senate on 10 August 2015. Texas A&M University has established the concept of an intercollegiate faculty with expressed goals of fostering development and communication in disciplinary fields represented by faculty members in different departments and colleges, utilizing faculty expertise in specific areas to strengthen emerging disciplinary programs, and overseeing the academic administration of graduate degree programs in a particular discipline. To access an intercollegiate faculty’s degree programs, a graduate student must be admitted to that program and a member of that faculty must serve as chair or co-chair of the student’s advisory committee. Intercollegiate faculties have been formed in agribusiness, biotechnology, ecology and evolutionary biology, energy, genetics and genomics, molecular and environmental plant sciences, neuroscience, toxicology, and water management and hydrological science. Appointment to membership on the Graduate Committee Faculty, while considered an honor, serves functional purposes as well. Appointment to membership is not for the sole purpose of conferring recognition upon an individual, but is designed to assure competence in the directing and advising of graduate students. Such competence is, in part, a function of experience and knowledge of operational procedures; it is also characterized by ability and motivation. Nomination for membership on the Graduate Committee Faculty is always initiated by the head of the appropriate academic department, intercollegiate faculty, or dean of college (under special circumstances) of Texas A&M University and is processed as discussed in the following sections.
