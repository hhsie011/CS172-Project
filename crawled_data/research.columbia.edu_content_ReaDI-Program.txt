Data integrity also means that the data is consistent and accurate between what is collected and reported as well as established procedures for the archiving of data.2,3 Reproducibility - The National Academies defines reproducibility as "achieving consistent results using the same input data, computational steps, methods, code, and conditions of analysis as prior studies." 4 Replicability - The National Academies defines replicability as "obtaining consistent results across studies that are aimed at answering the same scientific question but have obtained independent data." 4 1: http://grants1.nih.gov/grants/research_integrity/whatis.htm 2,3: http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/data-integrity.html, http://ori.hhs.gov/education/products/n_illinois_u/datamanagement/dmotopic.html 4: http://sites.nationalacademies.org/sites/reproducibility-in-science/index.htm Archived eNewsletters Subscribe to the ReaDI Program listserv to receive eNewsletters.
