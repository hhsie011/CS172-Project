Brown does not offer courses in English as a second language for its undergraduates and does not accept on a provisional basis students who are deficient in English. We highly recommend that international applicants take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), the International English Language Testing System (IELTS), or the Duolingo and arrange for Brown to receive the official results. A minimum score of 100 on the TOEFL internet-based exam or 600 on the paper-based exam, a minimum score of 8.0 on the IELTS, or a minimum score of 125 on the Duolingo is expected in most cases. As your safety is our first concern, we do not expect you to sit for any of these examinations in person.We do not currently accept the IELTS Indicator Examination. Note that in addition, students are expected to complete all other test requirements outlined in the Standardized Test Requirements section of this website.
