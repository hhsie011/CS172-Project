Suntex Marinas has donated $135,000 to the college to help it expand its course offerings and trainings. The gift comes as Dedman – FSU’s newest college – continues to grow and work on its strategic plan, which includes exploring new opportunities for the recreation and tourism management program with a focus on coastal and marine ventures. “The team at Suntex could not be more proud to partner with the Dedman College of Hospitality in expanding both marina operational knowledge and awareness of the marina industry to the fine students of Florida State University,” said Richard Carter, chief operating officer for Suntex. “Showcasing the many opportunities that a career in marina management can offer has been a passion of Suntex for many years. We are truly grateful and honored to be a part of this new initiative with FSU.” The class Suntex Intro to Maritime Hospitality is set to start next spring and will be offered as an elective that any FSU student may take. The course will include sections on marina and yacht charter operations, food and beverage management, customer relations and hospitality, marina events, safety and risk management, marina real estate principles, HR and talent development, and revenue management and finance.
