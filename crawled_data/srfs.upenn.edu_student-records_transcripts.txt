Student Records Request a Transcript A transcript is a representation of a student’s academic record while at the University of Pennsylvania. You may need a transcript to apply for graduate school or for employment purposes. Be sure to confirm with whoever is requesting your transcript whether you need an official transcript or if an unofficial transcript will suffice. Penn encourages you to request electronic transcripts whenever possible for the most efficient service, as long as such a transcript is acceptable for your purposes. The Office of the University Registrar can generate official transcripts for a small fee upon request, and most students and alumni from the Class of 1988 onward can view unofficial transcripts for free at any time on Penn InTouch. Below you’ll find transcript request instructions for specific student and alumni populations. Select Your Student/Alumni Population Go Back Current Students and Alumni Class of 1988 to Present Go Back Alumni Prior to 1988, Pre-College Summer Sessions, and Penn Literacy Network (PLN) Go Back Alumni of Veterinary School Prior to 2001 Go Back Alumni of Social Policy and Practice Prior to 1988 Go Back Alumni of Dental School Prior to 2000 Go Back Alumni of Perelman School of Medicine Go Back Current Students and Alumni Class of 1988 to Present Go Back Alumni Prior to 1988, Pre-College Summer Sessions, and Penn Literacy Network (PLN) Go Back Alumni of Veterinary School Prior to 2001 Go Back Alumni of Social Policy and Practice Prior to 1988 Go Back Alumni of Dental School Prior to 2000 Go Back Alumni of Perelman School of Medicine Conferring Degrees and Grade Submission Degrees are conferred (posted) by schools and programs. The degree checkout process can take up to 30 days from the end of the term to complete. Please contact your school or program directly for questions concerning the timing of your degree conferral. Students can view the posting of their degree conferral and grades on their unofficial transcripts via Penn InTouch. Degree conferral can be seen under the Degree Awarded section on unofficial transcripts. Please note that electronic PDF transcripts send immediately after an order is completed via Penn InTouch. Electronic PDF transcripts are not held for grade posting or degree conferral. Information about student grades can be found on the Student Grades page. Removing Holds on a Student Record If you are on a “hold” you may not have access to your transcript or be able to view your grades on Penn InTouch. Assistance with removing a hold on your record is dependent on the type of hold: Type of Hold Contact Office Financial, Graduation, Loans Exit Counseling SRFS Student Service Center, sfsmail@pobox.upenn.edu Collections SRFS Student Accounts: Collections, collecti@pobox.upenn.edu Immunization Student Health Services, vpul-immun@pobox.upenn.edu Advisor Sign-Off Your assigned academic advisor Judicial Office of Student Conduct Transcript SRFS Office of the University Registrar, transcripts@upenn.edu *Grades and GPAs are not disclosed over the phone or via email.
