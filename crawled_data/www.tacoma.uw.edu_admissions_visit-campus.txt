Here you belong to a community, a bustling metropolis that feels more like a neighborhood. The feeling’s the same whether you’re walking Pacific Avenue shops, restaurants and museums or riding the LINK to see a show in the theater district or catching a game at Cheney Stadium. The streets are busy but you’re never far away from adventure. Whether you travel by car or public transportation you’ll find what you’re looking for and more. We’re not big but neither are we small. We are the right size. We have room for more: more entertainment, food, parks, concerts, business, jobs. We have room for you.
