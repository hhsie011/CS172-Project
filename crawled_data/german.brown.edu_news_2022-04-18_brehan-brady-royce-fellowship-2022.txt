A concentrator in German Studies and History at Brown, Brehan is interested in studying the connection between group experience and individual memory, and the multitude of forms used to express those memories. Brehan is a veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom, where he completed two combat tours as an Infantryman in the US Army's 101st Airborne Division. He hopes to use the opportunity created by the Royce Fellowship to explore innovative ways to aid other veterans in successfully navigating the process of transitioning out of the military. For his Royce project, "Found in Translation: Veteran Voices Kleist to Kandahar," Brehan will be examining the work and life of the German Romanticist Heinrich von Kleist, and asking how his collected writings mirror the experiences of contemporary veterans engaged in translating the events of their service into literature. You can read more about Brehan and his project here.
