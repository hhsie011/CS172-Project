The research and programs developed around human flourishing, leadership, and ethics will provide a single venue dedicated to addressing the ethical, social, and technological challenges facing the contemporary world. Equally important to a thriving society and the development of individuals is an appreciation for and expression of the arts in many forms. Through the Departments of Art, Film and Digital Media, Theatre Arts, and the School of Music, Baylor is building on the strong national reputations of these programs to continue enriching the artistic life of our community, region, and nation. The arts develop original thinking by blending liberal arts education and professional training. Programs across schools, colleges, and student life foster collaboration and embody the very essence of Baylor's "worldwide leadership and service" mission. These opportunities equip students for the types of collaborative, cross-sector leadership and service that the future demands.
