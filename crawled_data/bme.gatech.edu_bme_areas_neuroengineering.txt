Whitaker Biomedical Engineering Building Giving Search Search form Search Portfolio Breadcrumb Home > Research > Research Areas > Neuroengineering Neuroengineering Neuroengineering involves the use and development of engineering techniques to understand, interact with, and/or influence neural function. The nervous system is staggeringly complex, using the transmission of electrical impulses through billions of neurons to perform many sophisticated tasks such as sensing the environment, moving our bodies gracefully through it, and making complex decisions. BME researchers at Georgia Tech and Emory are: Advancing our understanding of fundamental neural properties including sensorimotor control, learning, information processing, response to physical trauma, and complex neural dynamics. Engaged in developing novel technologies to measure, manipulate, and interact with the nervous system. These methods are applied with goals ranging from basic science to clinical application to further our understanding of normal neurophysiology and to help repair damaged brain, spinal or peripheral nervous tissue. Potential application areas include: Implantable devices that can effectively alter neural function when it is lost or impaired, including sensory loss. Neurodegeneration such as in Parkinson’s and Alzheimer's disease Neural injury such as concussion.
