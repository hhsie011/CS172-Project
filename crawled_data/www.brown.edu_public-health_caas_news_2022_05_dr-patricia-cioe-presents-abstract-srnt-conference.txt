The 12-week online MindUP study examined the feasibility and acceptability of Unwinding Anxiety, a web-based mindfulness app, to reduce anxiety and stress in smokers with HIV who report stress as a barrier to quitting smoking. Study results indicate that at week 4, anxiety was reduced and readiness to quit was increased, which may suggest that week 4 is a key time point for a cessation attempt.
