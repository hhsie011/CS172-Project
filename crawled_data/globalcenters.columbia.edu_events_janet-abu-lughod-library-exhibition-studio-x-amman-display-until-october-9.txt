5:00 PM Columbia Global Centers | Amman Located at at Studio-X Amman, Columbia Global Centers | Amman (5 Mohammad Al Sa'd Al Batayneh St. Amman, Jordan) Open to the public Sunday to Thursday, 9:00 am - 5:00 pm, until October 9, 2017 The Janet Abu-Lughod Library is a dedicated library collection housed at Studio-X Amman that was donated to Columbia GSAPP and Columbia Global Centers | Amman by Professor of Anthropology and Women’s Studies Lila Abu-Lughod and her family. Professor Abu-Lughod presented the library during her remarks at The Arab City conference held in November 2014 at Columbia University. The library, carefully curated and assembled by Janet Abu-Lughod, includes books and journals from the fields of urban sociology, political theory, race, gender and urban politics, migration, globalization, city planning, Islamic cities, and more. The exhibition displays selected books that speak to Janet Abu-Lughod’s intellectual genealogy. In addition to personal notes and marginalia, the books contain intentionally archived or forgotten traces of her life as a towering scholar, diligent teacher, and engaged citizen. On the inside of covers are dedications by grateful former students and scholars acknowledging her influence on their respective fields. The books are accompanied by numerous requests for reviews, original typed manuscripts of Abu-Lughod’s work, cartoons, newspaper clippings, and flyers for international solidarity events. This installation also celebrates the completion of two successful iterations of the Janet Abu-Lughod Library Seminar in Amman, organized by Studio-X Amman in partnership with Sijal Institute for Arabic Language and Culture. The first was led in 2016 by Zachary Sheldon (University of Chicago), and the second by Khaled Malas (New York University), completed in August 2017. A small celebration and opening took place on September 13, 2017 and was attended by Lila Abu-Lughod and members of her family. View the photos on Facebook or on the GSAPP website.
