Courses in the minor explore the relationship of farmland preservation, food production practices, and supply alternatives that improve local economies, reduce energy consumption, lower environmental impact, and ensure widespread access to affordable and healthy food. This prepares students to contribute to the overall sustainability of the communities in which they live and work and strengthens students' preparation to work as professionals in environmentally-oriented fields or as citizen activists. The Minor in Sustainable Food Systems consists of 18 credits, with two required foundation courses and four elective courses. The required courses ensure that students have a strong foundation for the study of food systems including food crops, planning for food systems, and nutrition. The electives allow students to delve deeper into different facets of food systems planning from the perspective of city planning and/or horticulture. Courses for this minor are offered at Ambler and Main campuses. Requirements Students must earn a minimum grade of C- in courses satisfying minor requirements and must have a minimum 2.0 grade point average in the required 18 credits to earn the minor. A student may not double count any course for the Minor in Sustainable Food Systems toward any other major, minor, or certificate. At least half of the courses for the minor must be taken at Temple University. Courses for the minor must be completed prior to graduation.
