Mentors serve as support to aid your transition to college and your CECAS major. Assistance is available in Engineering and Computer Science fields. Beyond academic encouragement, mentors host social and professional activities throughout the fall and spring semesters. Incoming freshmen who are majoring in engineering and science are paired with upper-class mentors in the same area of study. Mentors are known for giving support and advice about adjusting to life as a Clemson student. Not only can Mentors help you prepare for a test, but they can also be a friend.
