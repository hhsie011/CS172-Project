Topics we will cover – What is the Multicultural Lab; when and why was it started? What benefits and resources does the Multicultural Lab provide? Who and how can one apply for or utilize these resources? Is the Lab specific to one geographic region or area? Who are some of the past start-up participants of the Lab, maybe highlight a few success stories? Are there any ways other companies that support these goals can help and participate in nurturing start-ups at the Lab? In your incredibly accomplished and multifaceted career, what is it about the Multicultural Lab that draws you to taking this on in a leadership role right now? Audience questions will be encouraged in this virtual Fireside Chat with Ms. Harris about both the Multicultural Lab and her multifaced career achievements.
