The Communication and Activism minor is for students who are interested in public advocacy, politics, campaign management, community organizing and community relations, government communication, law and judiciary careers, organizational development, social movement leadership, and political and nonprofit lobbying. The minor complements such majors as sociology, political science, criminal justice, social work, civil engineering, environmental studies, and community development. Upon completing this minor, students should be able to: Identify, analyze, and address important social, cultural, political, and/or economic issues that are in need of remediation. Develop strategies and tactics for improving, solving, and/or intervening into those issues. Develop various messages and use various modes of communication for addressing a diversity of audiences across a variety of contexts. Develop a social justice sensibility that demonstrates concern for communities and populations that are under-served, under-sourced, and/or under-represented. The minor is open to all Temple undergraduate students with a cumulative GPA of 2.5 or better. Students majoring in Communication and Social Influence (CSI) are not eligible for the minor. However, students enrolled in the minor can choose to roll over their minor credits if they want to change their major to CSI. Students with a Communication Studies major (CMST) are eligible for the minor. (This last point is noted to avoid possible confusion in the future since CSI and CMST are closely related but yet separate majors.)
