Policies and procedures from the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE), Principles for Professional Conduct, the U.S Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and the Fair Labor Standards Act, combined with St. John’s University policies, assist in upholding standards of professionalism and in providing structure to the recruitment process. Contents: Rights of Refusal Compensation Internships Hiring International Students Alcoholic Beverages Job Offer Policy Non-Discrimination Confidentiality Job Postings Policies Reporting Offers and Hires Exceptions to Policies and Guidelines Rights of Refusal University Career Services reserves the right to terminate from or refuse the participation of any organization in our recruiting activities.

In addition, the University Career Services staff reserves the right to remove organizations or job postings that do not align with the Vincentian mission, academic programs, and/or provide any risk to a student's personal or financial well-being. ^ Top Compensation Employment opportunities must comply with all federal, state, and local laws and regulations, as well as St. John's University recruiting policies. All employers must adhere to the United States Department of Labor’s Fair Labor Standards Act. Stipends must be at least the equivalent of state's minimum wage (when divided by the number of hours worked) to be considered a paid position. Commission-Based Positions Policy: Positions that are solely commission-based will not be endorsed or promoted by University Career Services and will not be permitted to post in Handshake. Positions that provide a base salary in addition to commission must clearly state and fully disclose compensation structure. A draw against future earnings does not constitute a salary.

If so, what is the employee expenditure reimbursement and repayment costs? ^ Top Internships An internship is a form of experiential learning that integrates knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. Internships give students the opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths and give employers the opportunity to guide and evaluate talent. Paid Internships St. John’s University Career Services strongly encourages paid internships as compensation often attracts a larger, more diverse and more qualified pool of applicants. Unpaid Internships If you are a for-profit organization recruiting for an unpaid internship, it is important that the position comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws, including but not limited to the Fair Labor Standards Act or “FLSA”. Should you have further questions concerning the legality of your unpaid internship positions, it is encouraged that you consult with legal counsel to ensure compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws. Academic Credit Internships Academic Credit internships are done under the guidance and supervision of an appointed faculty member assigned within each particular major. Academic departments have specific guidelines and requirements that vary by major. The designated faculty member for the major determines if the internship opportunity meets the department's requirements in regard to the terms and conditions revolving around hours required to work, compensation, academic based assignments and grading system. The employer will work with the Academic Department in regard to documentation and necessary paperwork required. Hiring Deadlines for Academic Credit Internships: Academic Credit Internships must fit within one of our academic semesters: Fall (September-December) Spring (January-May), Summer (May-August) To allow for students to complete requirements for an academic credit internship employers should adhere to the following hiring deadlines: Fall intern hiring deadline: September 1 Spring intern hiring deadline: January 15 Summer intern hiring deadline: May 1 We do not promote or approve academic credit internship postings after the hiring deadline for the semester. ^ Top Hiring International Students St. John's University attracts highly motivated international students from over 111 countries.
