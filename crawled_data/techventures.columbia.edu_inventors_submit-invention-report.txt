This provides CTV with basic information about the invention, helps us assess the patentability and commercial potential, and supports the patent filing decision. Once your intellectual property has been protected, your CTV Technology Licensing Officer can begin working with you to commercialize your invention via an industry license, a start-up company, or other means.

An Invention Report provides CTV with basic information about the invention, helps us assess the patentability and commercial potential, and supports the patent filing decision. Once your intellectual property has been protected, your CTV Technology Licensing Officer can begin working with you to commercialize your invention via an industry license, a start-up company, or other means. What Happens Next? Within 45 days, you will see an Initial Commercial Assessment on your technology, and begin to discuss the marketing and patenting process with your licensing officer. You can check the status of your invention report submission and patent application(s) by logging into the Faculty Portal with your Columbia UNI (use any browser except for Internet Explorer). Submit Invention Reports Early and Often We strongly encourage inventors to submit an Invention Report before any public disclosures (lecture, posters, presentations, etc.) that may adversely affect the patentability of an invention. However, even if you have already disclosed your idea, it is still possible to receive protection, so weâ€™d still like to hear from you. If you have any questions about this process, please contact a CTV Technology Licensing Officer, or email [email protected].
