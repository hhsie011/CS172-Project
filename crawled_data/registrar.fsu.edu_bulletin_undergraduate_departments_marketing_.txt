Courses are oriented toward: (1) problem solving and management decision making; (2) providing knowledge of the tools, types of organization, and institutions utilized in performing marketing activities; and (3) developing the ability to plan and implement marketing policy, strategy, and procedures. Consistent with their interests and career goals, students may choose to major in either marketing, professional sales, or retail management within the marketing degree program. The curriculum includes qualitative and quantitative elements with an emphasis on the successful deployment of marketing strategies, especially among the service sector enterprises that dominate our state and national economies. The curriculum is designed to impart knowledge and competence in marketing that will enable graduates to (1) progress well in the early stages of their careers; (2) analyze, plan, organize, coordinate, and control marketing activities; (3) think analytically and respond creatively; (4) communicate effectively; and (5) gain broad perspectives essential to the attainment of top management responsibilities. The department also offers a combined BS/MBA pathway that allows highly qualified undergraduate students in the marketing major the opportunity to accelerate their coursework and take up to nine semester hours of graduate coursework, which may be counted toward both the BS and MBA degrees. A detailed description of the MBA program can be found in the Graduate Bulletin.
