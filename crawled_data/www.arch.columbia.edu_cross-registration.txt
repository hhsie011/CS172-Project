Complete information regarding the cross registration process is available on SIPA’s website. Details Business School The Columbia University Business School has an online application system for students interested in cross-registration. Information and policies about CBS cross registration policies can be found here. Application website: https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/xreg Columbia Business School follows a slightly different academic calendar than most of the University. Please review the CBS academic calendar. Details All Other Departments With the exception of Teacher’s College, GSAPP students may cross-register for courses within other schools and departments at Columbia University. Students should consult the Directory of Classes to view eligibility requirements and restrictions. In some cases, students will be allowed to register for these courses directly via Student Services Online (SSOL). In other cases, students will be required to forward email permission from the Department to studentaffairs@arch.columbia.edu and submit the Add/Drop form. For Non-GSAPP Students Students from other schools who wish to take courses within GSAPP will need the approval of the Office of Student Affairs– not the permission of the instructor. Student Affairs will provide a list of courses approved for cross-registration. Cross-registration for GSAPP courses takes place during the Change of Program period (the first and second week of classes) only. Students may request to register for any approved courses on a first-come first-serve basis until the course is full via the online Add/Drop Form. GSAPP does not administer a waitlist for courses. GSAPP will not allow students to cross-register if adding the course would exceed 19 points. Please note that all studios and visual studies courses are not open to non-GSAPP students. For any questions, please email studentaffairs@arch.columbia.edu. The list of approved courses for Spring 2022 cross registration are posted below.
