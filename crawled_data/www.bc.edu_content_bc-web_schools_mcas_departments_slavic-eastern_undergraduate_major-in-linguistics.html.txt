Students majoring in Linguistics build their programs around a specific area of emphasis. In consultation with the faculty, students design a program of study tailored to the individual interests and goals. Typical areas of emphasis include philology (the historical and comparative study of ancient languages), psycholinguistics, and language acquisition. A typical program for this major requires the following (31 credits): LING3101 General Linguistics (3 credits) LING3102 Syntax and Semantics (3 credits) LING3103 Language and Language Types (3 credits) or LING3104 Formalism and Functionalism in Linguistics (3 credits) 3 credits in Philology 3 further credits in Philology or in Structure of a Language 15 additional credits drawn from departmental offerings, of which two must be ‘upper-division’ electives LING4391 AB Comprehensive: Linguistics (1 cr) Linguistics majors should additionally develop proficiency in at least one foreign language and competence in at least one other language at levels appropriate to their career plans (e.g. French, German, Spanish, Latin, Greek, Russian).
