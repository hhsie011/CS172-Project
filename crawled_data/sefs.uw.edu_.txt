Bioresource Science and Engineering (BSE) students apply chemical sciences and engineering to manufacturing fiber product, fuels and chemicals from biomass resources. Special degree focus areas are available for ESRM students and degree minors are available in ecological restoration and ESRM. Bioresource Science and EngineeringEnvironmental Science and Terrestrial Resource Management Major Graduate Degrees Our graduate degrees offer a number of different paths that prepare students for careers from academia to public agencies, the private sector to nonprofit organizations. There are two traditional degrees and two non-thesis degrees. We also partner with other programs within the university to offer two concurrent degrees. Graduate Degrees Faculty and Research Our faculty use engineering and natural, wildlife and social science in their work, which is aimed at developing renewable forest products and stewarding forest and landscape ecosystems for a range of functions and services, and understanding the social, economic and environmental consequences of stewardship and production choices.
