Rather than creating a brand new request, HOLLIS Special Request will allow you to clone (make a copy) of a request. First, find a request with the same call number. If it is a new request, it can be found in your Outstanding Requests (visible when you first login). To find older requests, go to the Order History drop-down menu and select All Requests. Once you have located the correct request, click on the title. On the next screen, click Clone Request. This will take you to a New Reading Room Request. The new request will retain all of the bibliographic and reproduction information from the previous request. You need only to edit the Volume/Box/Folder/Item field to reflect the new item number. Once you have updated the new request, you are done. Simply click Submit Request. Managing Requests You can track requests that you have submitted by clicking on the Home link in the main menu of your account or Outstanding Requests under the Request History drop-down.
