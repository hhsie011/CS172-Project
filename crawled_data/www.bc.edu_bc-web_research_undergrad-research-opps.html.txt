Undergraduate Fellowship Opportunities Undergraduate Journals View More View Less Research Highlights Environmental Sciences Geological Studies major Anne Haws ’18 spent a week conducting field research in Italy as part of a collaborative NSF project focused on understanding ancient subduction zone processes. Haws visited a variety of sites in the Western Alps and Apennines, where she collected rock samples for her upcoming senior thesis on rodingites. “I knew that being able to see these rocks in person would be an unparalleled experience,” said Haws. “As my senior thesis advisor, Professor Ethan Baxter, often says, ‘Every rock tells a story.’” Chemistry Undergraduate researchers Christopher Latour ’18, and Chester J.J. Wrobel ’17 co-authored a report with Assistant Professor of Chemistry Abhishek Chatterjee on their lab’s efforts to create a new method to engineer and monitor protein functions as a way of expanding the scientific understanding of the processes that guide protein functions in our cells. The report appeared in the journal Chemical Biology.
