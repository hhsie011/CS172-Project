Here are two alternatives to owning a car that still allow access to one when you need it. Low Rates with Hertz Car Rental Company Columbia has pre-negotiated low rates with Hertz for the hiring of vehicles by the day. Columbia affiliates can take advantage of this this benefit by visiting the Columbia Visitors and Personal Travel portal and creating a profile on World Travel. Hertz has car rental locations in many locations around NYC, with the closest to Columbia being on the Upper West Side and in Fort Lee, New Jersey.
