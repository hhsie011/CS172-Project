Student/Postdoc Mentoring Postdoctoral Mentoring Plans NSF requires proposers who request postdoc support in their budgets to include a one-page Postdoctoral Mentoring Plan with their grant applications. Refer to the NSF Grant and Proposal Guide (Chapter II.C.2.j) to see the requirements for an NSF Postdoctoral Mentoring Plan. We recommend creating a postdoc mentoring plan by referring to the National Postdoctoral Association’s six Core Competencies that postdocs should seek to develop in their training: discipline-specific conceptual knowledge research skill development communication skills professionalism leadership and management skills responsible conduct of research A good postdoc mentoring plan outlines activities and resources that will provided to a postdoc during their training to allow them to develop their competency in each of these six areas. Consider what your department or research centers offer (seminars, travel opportunities, collaborations with external researchers, industry interactions, etc.) that could serve as a resource to provide a postdoc with skill development opportunities. The National Postdoctoral Association also provides some additional guidance for developing postdoctoral mentoring plans. Individualized Development Plans (IDPs) NIH has announced that in annual progress reports received on or after October 1, 2014, grantees must describe how or whether they are using IDPs to help manage the training and career development of NIH-supported graduate students or postdocs. Read the August 4, 2014, Guide notice for details on this policy. If you have questions about utilizing IDPs to help your students or postdocs (NIH-funded or otherwise) outline their career development goals, and to track their progress toward achieving those goals, email UT Support Services International Student & Scholar Services (ISSS) Facilitates visa paperwork for faculty and scholars and provides advice, programs, information and service to the international community. The Office of the Faculty Ombuds Is an independent, neutral and informal problem-solving resource for both faculty and postdoctoral scholars. The office can assist postdocs with work-related difficulties, such as interpersonal conflicts or misunderstandings, and academic or administrative concerns. The Employee Assistance Program Provides personal consulting services to promote emotional health and wellness for UT-Austin employees. The Behavioral Concerns Advice Line Is a campus-wide service that allows any member of the university community the opportunity to report or discuss their concerns about another individual’s behavior.
