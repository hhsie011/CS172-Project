Each project should include a detailed description of the project, as well as a projected timeline for completion. Please be sure to upload all supporting materials. The Theory to Action Project development should not begin until all three (3) Core Courses have been successfully completed. Participants track their own progress using the D&I Certificate Completion Form. Once you submit your Theory to Action Project, please scan and email the completion form to training@fsu.edu.

Examples of a Theory to Action Project might be: A program for students An update in curriculum (design or readings) Submission of an article for publication or conference presentation proposal or presentation Presentation for faculty, staff, departmental colleagues or students in one's area of work. Note: Redelivering a D&I Certificate Training course to one's own department does not count as a Theory to Action Project.
