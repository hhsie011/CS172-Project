We educate undergraduate and graduate students who plan to take the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) examination and typically begin their careers with one of the prominent public accounting firms. Many of our graduates achieve promotion to partner, and many others leverage their work in public accounting to launch successful careers in other fields ranging from corporate finance and investor relations positions to numerous and varied roles such as consulting, public service, banking, and many others. We also train students who will not be accountants but will benefit immensely from understanding financial statements and the overall financial reporting environment. We offer three different concentrations (Accounting for CPAs, Accounting for Finance and Consulting, and Accounting & Information Systems) and two minors. Our objective is to prepare all students at every level to excel by focusing on the fundamentals of informed and ethical decision-making in the accounting profession. Accessibility to expert faculty teaching in addition to our collaborative environment is a crucial element of the success of students who take our courses.
