COVID-19 Spiritual Resources Retreats and Quiet Spaces Spiritual Gatherings at HDS Grief and Student Support Resources Local Faith & Non-Religious Communities "Resilient" | Noon Service, October 21, 2020 Noon Service at HDS Noon Service is hosted on Wednesday each week by a different religious community at Harvard Divinity. This service allows all in the HDS community to pray, meditate, and/or engage in rituals with our companions across the boundaries of our many respective traditions. Throughout life, each person moves along the great continuum between Ultimacy and Intimacy. To live consciously and conscientiously along that journey is the very definition of spirituality; and authentic spirituality—regardless of religious tradition or lack thereof—issues in a zeal for justice, the habit of compassion, and a character firmly rooted in humility and love. At HDS, we strive to inflect all our research, study, activism, and interactions—within our walls and beyond them—with that kind of authentic spirituality. - Kerry Maloney, Chaplain and Director of Religious and Spiritual Life HDS Religious Services Calendar View Public Religious Services Multifaith Calendar View Religious Holidays Contact Religious and Spiritual Life Location: 45 Francis Avenue, Swartz Hall, room 110 Mailing address Office of Religious and Spiritual Life 45 Francis Avenue Cambridge, MA 02138 Hours (academic year) Monday–Friday, 9 am–5 pm Phone 617.495.1778 Email rsl@hds.harvard.edu Resources ConSpiracies: Breathing Together the Breath of Life, is a collection of student, faculty, staff, and alumni writings at the intersection of the spiritual and intellectual life.
