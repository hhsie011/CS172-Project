Since the inaugural gala in 2014, the Gala has become a transformational fundraising event providing critical resources for the nursing school and its students. The evening’s festivities were memorable. The Gala began at 6:00 p.m. with the National Anthem performed by Hebron Road and a warm welcome from Mary Ann Hill, current Gala Taskforce Chair, joined by Donna Dee Floyd and Angela Bowman, past Gala Taskforce Chairs. Looking back over the last 10 years, guests enjoyed watching a nostalgic gala video. Remarks were then shared by Linda A. Livingstone, Ph.D., President of Baylor University followed by an invocation by Steven R. Newton, Baylor Scott & White Health, Chief Growth Officer. After dinner, Hebron Road performed “You Say” and Dr. Linda Plank, Dean of the LHSON, gave an overview of the nursing school. Serving as the moderator for the panel discussion of speakers was Pat Nunley, Baylor Radio Color Analyst who introduced to the stage, Clyde Hart, Darold Williamson, Jeremy Wariner and Michael Johnson (via Zoom). The evening continued with Janis Kovar, Senior Director of Development of the LHSON and a student testimonial from Taylor Reynolds, LHSON BSN ’17. Soon after the Live Auction began and Fund-the-Need. Closing out the evening was Mary Ann Hill and a final performance by Hebron Road singing “Under God.” Support from sponsors, underwriters and volunteers remains crucial every year.
