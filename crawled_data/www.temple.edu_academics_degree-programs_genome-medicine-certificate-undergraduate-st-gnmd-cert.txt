Graduates can use this undergraduate certificate as a steppingstone for careers in medicine, public health, science and technology. Genomic medicine is a growing discipline within the medical and science communities that evaluates a patient’s complete set of DNA when making clinical care decisions. As a more individualized healthcare option, the emerging field needs both public health professionals to resolve its many policy issues and specialized practitioners to provide comprehensive care. In this four-course certificate you will study computational biology and the latest advances in genetic coding and discovery. In addition to academic knowledge, you will also gain communicative and collaborative skills to work more efficiently with other practitioners and researchers. Who might be interested? Available to all undergraduate students and professional non-degree-seeking students, the Genomic Medicine Undergraduate Certificate can help focus your interests for continuing study in related fields or enhance your existing knowledge of genomic medicine. The certificate is designed for students interested in developing expertise in data science, with specialization in genomics. Data science employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the broad areas of computer and information sciences, mathematics and statistics, and applies them to a wide range of data-rich domains such as biomedical science, business, education, engineering, geoscience, physical science and social science. You will gain a strong background in mathematics, computational thinking and biological data analysis. Learn to analyze large quantities of data to glean insight and facilitate clinical decision-making. As part of the broader data science program, genomics is a critical track to include as a subarea of focus for students interested in biology, ecology, evolution, human health and disease, and precision medicine. Credit Requirements To earn this certificate, you must complete 12 to 14 credit hours, including required and elective courses.
