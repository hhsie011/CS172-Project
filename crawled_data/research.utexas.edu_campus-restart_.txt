Researchers are strongly advised to follow current CDC guidelines for masking and vaccinations. Masks are available in the STEM stockroom. UT Research Restart Plan and Levels (PDF) We are currently in Research Level 0, which began on July 5, 2021. Human Subjects Research Restart Beginning May 17, 2021, all tiers (A-D) of Human Subjects Research are permitted with ADR and IRB approval. Undergraduate Research Restart Beginning October 14, 2020, undergraduates may return to campus labs and research spaces with PI approval. PI Research Restart Toolkit Policies, best practices, and a checklist for resuming on-campus research. Research FAQs Print-Ready Building Signage Colleges and schools are accepting PI requests to resume Research Level 0 activity. Refer to the UT Research Restart Plan and Levels PDF to learn more about what kinds of research activities are permitted in this research level. Approvals for individual PIs to resume research operations are managed at the college level. The college or school that controls the research space (labs, offices, or both) that are assigned to you is the unit that will review and approve your request to resume research operations. You may submit your request to resume research for Research Level 0 by following the link for the appropriate college or school below. (If the link for your college or school opens an email window, then send your inquiry to that email address. Some CSUs are still working on their websites.) If your unit does not report to any of these colleges or schools, please contact vp-research-sr@austin.utexas.edu to determine where to send your request.
