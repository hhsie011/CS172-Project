The stacked logo is reserved for use on merchandise or on the web when space is limited. The logo is available in two colorways: blue and white. Although we strongly advise using only the approved colorways, there are creative contexts in which alternative colorations may be appropriate. If you require a color variant not shown here, please contact DSI Communications. Sub-brands are customized marks that identify DSI members, affiliates, initiatives, programs, events, or publications and are available by request. Please contact DSI Communications to discuss any proposed sub-brands. The logo and Data for Good tagline lock-up form a single unit. The elements may not be rearranged or the relationship altered in any way. This lock-up is only intended for use by the DSI community. To ensure the logo’s integrity, do not crowd it with typography, imagery, or any other elements within 20 pixels on the web.
