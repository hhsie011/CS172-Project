Three differentiated career advising and counseling services offered at the Career Center are self-help, brief staff-assisted career advising, and career counseling, which provide varying limits to privacy and confidentiality as outlined below. Self-help and brief staff-assisted career advising are provided by Computer Assisted Career Guidance Systems and trained Career Services Practitioners, which follow the privacy guidelines set forth by the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE), the National Career Development Association (NCDA), and the Federal Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Career Counseling, a specialty area within the field of counseling, is provided by Nationally Certified Counselors, Licensed Counselors and Psychologists, Registered Counselor Interns, and future Counselors and Psychologists in Training who are completing a practicum or internship for academic credit in a Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP) or American Psychological Association (APA) accredited program. Career Counseling is protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which provides client confidentiality within the limits stated below, and abides by the ethical and legal standards set forth by the American Counseling Association (ACA), American Psychological Association (APA), the Florida Board of Clinical Social Work, Marriage & Family Therapy, and Mental Health Counseling, and the Florida Board of Psychology. Privacy Career advising is not protected by informed consent, and all Career Center staff acting in a non-counseling role or provision of service are mandated reporters. The Career Center strives to keep information disclosed private, however, in rare and specific circumstances, The Career Center may be required to break that privacy to protect you or identified others from harm. The exceptions to maintaining privacy include: Compliance with the Vulnerable Persons Act is a law that states "every individual in the state is required to immediately report known or suspected child abuse and child sexual abuse to the Florida Department of Children and Family Services' Abuse Hotline, with the definition of 'child' including any person under the age of eighteen." Compliance with Title IX which states "all FSU faculty and staff shall report every incident of sexual battery to the Title IX Director (850) 644-6271 and FSU Police (644-1234)." If a court order is received that orders release of information. To protect you or a third party from any immediate or imminent threat to harm. Confidentiality The Career Center provides Career Counseling services and provides clinical practicum and internship experience for future counselors and psychologists in CACREP and APA accredited masters and doctoral programs. Career Counseling is clinical in nature and falls under the same ethical and legal guidelines as mental health or psychological services and is protected under HIPAA. At The Career Center, Career Counseling records are confidential with exceptions or limits to confidentiality, as disclosed and agreed upon through informed consent. Clients and client information may be discussed by staff within Career Counseling clinical supervision for treatment, administrative, supervisory, and training purposes. Release of Career Counseling information to outside entities requires your written permission for a two-way exchange of information with the following exceptions or limits: When there is clear and present danger to you or to others–includes potential suicide or homicide, as well as abuse of children, elderly, or disabled persons. When a client is a minor or an incapacitated adult, information may be released to a parent or guardian. When release of information is received via a court order. When current abuse, abandonment, neglect, or exploitation of a child or vulnerable adult is a concern we are required by law to report all cases. In addition, past abuse must be reported when there is any possibility of current danger to any child, elderly, or disabled person (e.g., a child lives with the abuser). When authorized federal officials are conducting national security and intelligence activities or providing protective services to the President or other important officials, we may be required to disclose your health information. By law we cannot reveal when we have disclosed such information to the government (e.g., Patriot Act). Please contact the Career Center (850) 644-6431 with questions regarding this policy.
