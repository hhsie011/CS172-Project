It complements disciplinary efforts ranging from engineering (infrastructure safety, decision theory, waste management) to life sciences (toxicology, food and water safety, resource conservation, invasive species/pest management). Quantitative and qualitative methods from the sciences are used not only in assessing risks but also in communicating them between affected parties and in the development of stewardship and public policies. Students must be admitted into a major field (not restricted by the minor), select one of the field members as a minor member for their committee, and then complete basic courses in risk analysis (requires some background in calculus and statistics) or ecological risk assessment, risk communication, public policy, and a seminar in risk issues. The foregoing applicable courses may come from the student's major or other minors, to expedite and focus this effort in some area of thesis research.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
