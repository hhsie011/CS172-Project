Along with strong mathematical and computational skills and a solid grounding in each of the component disciplines, the program is designed to enhance leadership ability and communications skills. The program is also flexible enough to provide background for graduate or professional study in many areas beyond actuarial science, e.g., business, economics, finance, law, and statistics. The program is classified by the professional actuarial societies as advanced undergraduate and graduate education and research. All three of the actuarial professional societies’ Validation by Educational Experience credit areas are approved; this provides FSU students an opportunity to directly advance their careers through their regular classes. Students in the program are also assisted in moving forward professionally through seminars and tutorials in preparation for national actuarial examinations and by guest lecturers who are actuaries discussing the varied available employment. Computer Skills Competency All undergraduates at Florida State University must demonstrate basic computer skills competency prior to graduation. As necessary computer competency skills vary from discipline to discipline, each major determines the courses needed to satisfy this requirement. Undergraduate majors in actuarial science satisfy this requirement by earning a grade of “C–” or higher in COP 3014 or ISC 3313.
