The Program provides cutting-edge, interdisciplinary, graduate-level education at the interface of engineering, biology, and medicine appropriate for careers in academia, government, or industry. Students engage in broad opportunities across the Brown University community from the engineering/physical sciences through the life sciences on campus to Brown's Warren Alpert Medical School and associated teaching hospitals nearby. Why choose Brown for your master’s? Our biomedical engineering master's program is ranked #3 by College Choice and ranked #4 by Grad Reports. Students customize their curriculum. Students choose the framework for their master’s program from 3 tracks: Master of Science Research Track [ScM - Thesis (Research)] Independent, hands-on research experience with world renowned faculty Students can choose projects from basic science to translational research with biology, engineering, or clinical faculty Written thesis and oral defense required Master of Science Design Track [ScM - Thesis (Design)] Team-based design toward an unmet clinical or commercial need in collaboration with faculty, clinical, and/or industry advisors Team written thesis and oral critique required Master of Science Non-Thesis Track [ScM - Non-thesis] Coursework-based degree Flexibility to explore areas of interest Best suited for those pursuing careers in industry In all 3 programs: Students customize their course selection based on their research needs and career goals. Students can opt to engage in stimulating co-ops at companies commercializing biomedical technologies. Students can pursue their degree on a part-time or full-time schedule. A wide variety of independent, cutting-edge research projects. Our advisors are passionate, supportive, and committed to strong mentorship. ScM- Thesis (Research) students have advisor flexibility and can choose between hospital based labs or department based labs. Meet our core faculty and affiliated faculty. Flexible course work allows for focus on research. Our students publish in top scientific journals e.g. Recent publications by our master's students: Sampath, S.G., Telfeian, A.E., Sullivan, R., Lu, A. and Srivastava, V., 2022.

Our tuition scale is competitive with other masters's program Students pay per course credit and are required to take 8 courses over 4 semesters. Learn more about tuition and fees. Important Notes: The Grad School's tuition rates are based on a 4-course per semester schedule, but our program averages a 2-course per semester schedule. The BME Master's Program does not follow the pay scale for the Engineering Master's program (it's cheaper!). Students report high satisfaction with their degree and their experience and continue to great PhD programs and companies.
