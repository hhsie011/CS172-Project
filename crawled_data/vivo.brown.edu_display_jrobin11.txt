Full Text PubMed Research Research Overview Rare earth metals (REM’s) are used as key components in a number of diverse technologies including renewable energy, chemical synthesis, electronics, data storage, and biomedicine. Structural control of the ligand environment is critical to enabling the applications of these materials; however, remains a significant challenge due to the high coordination numbers and lability of the ionic REM-ligand bonds. Research in the Robinson Group will focus on developing novel methods for controlling and characterizing ligand-metal lability to specifically enable applications in energy science, green chemistry, catalysis, and materials design. Researchers in the group will have the opportunity to pursue interdisciplinary research in a collaborative, stimulating, and supportive environment. Students will become proficient in organic and inorganic syntheses, the handling of air- and moisture-sensitive materials, and state-of-the-art characterization methods.
