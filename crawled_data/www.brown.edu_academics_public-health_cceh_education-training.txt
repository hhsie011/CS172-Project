Brown undergraduate students interested in additional training in environment health typically choose public health as their concentration and work closely with a faculty member conducting relevant research. Students in other concentrations, including Environmental Studies/Sciences or Health & Human Biology, are also welcome. Prospective students interested in pursuing masters level training with a focus on environmental health are encouraged to apply to the MPH program (Epidemiology concentration). Prospective students interested in pursuing doctoral level training with a focus on environmental health are encouraged to apply to the PhD program in Epidemiology. Students in other relevant PhD programs, such as Biostatistics, Sociology, or Earth Environmental and Planetary Sciences (DEEPS) are also encouraged to contact us to obtain additional training in environmental health. Prospective post-doctoral fellows and visiting scholars should identify and directly contact a primary mentor. Want to learn more?
