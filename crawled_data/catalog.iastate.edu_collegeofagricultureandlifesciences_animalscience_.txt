Overview Degree Requirements Four Year Plan Undergraduate Minor Undergraduate Certificates Graduate Programs Catalog Home > Undergraduate Majors, Certificates, Minors, Pre-Professional Study > Agriculture and Life Sciences > Animal Science The Department of Animal Science Undergraduate Program intends for its graduates to be able to explain the symbiotic relationship of animals and humans, to contribute to the solution of complex problems of animal enterprise management, and to apply their knowledge and skills in a technically demanding global community. Graduates of our program will be knowledgeable about sustainable animal production practices that also ensure animal health and well-being and stewardship of natural resources. To enable learners to pursue a wide array of career interests, the department offers learning experiences ranging from the basic to the applied sciences. Learner outcomes for these goals, for each of our courses, and other information defining the program can be found at our web site: https://www.ans.iastate.edu/undergraduate-students. Our program is designed to provide career skills appropriate to job market needs. Our faculty goals include providing superior academic advising to enable students to fulfill their objectives. Student Learning Outcomes Learning outcomes for the Animal and Dairy Science majors dictate that, upon completion of the program, graduates will: Demonstrate a comprehensive knowledge of animal science, animal management, and agribusiness Exhibit effective communication skills Integrate information to solve problems Effectively employ skills as a self –learner Participate as team leaders and team builders Demonstrate awareness of contemporary issues that drive change in animal industries The department offers the degrees bachelor of science in animal science and bachelor of science in dairy science. A double major in animal and dairy science is not permitted. However, combining either the animal science or dairy science majors with other curricula is permitted. A limit of 6 credits each in Intercollegiate Judging (Animal Science 475), or any independent study course (490 courses) can be applied toward a degree. A limit of 4 credits of Undergraduate Teaching Experience (Animal Science 497) can be applied toward a degree. The department offers a minor in Animal Science and a minor in Meat Science. Certificates in Beef Cattle Production Management, Swine Production Management, Poultry Production Management, and Equine Management are also offered. Both the animal science curricula and dairy science curricula allow complementary work toward admission to veterinary medical school and other professional schools, which may be done while satisfying requirements for the bachelor of science degree. A program that combines bachelor of science and master of science in animal science is offered. In addition, a program that combines a bachelor of science and master of business administration is offered. The Department facilitates student participation in the Midwest Poultry Consortium and the Swine Science Online program to offer additional training in poultry and swine production, respectively.

Minor work is offered in these areas to students taking major work in other departments. A strong undergraduate program is required for students interested in graduate study. Fundamental training in biology, chemistry, mathematics, and statistics is requisite to a satisfactory graduate program. Graduate programs in animal science include supporting work in areas such as agricultural engineering, agronomy; anatomy; biochemistry; chemistry; economics; environmental science; food science and human nutrition; genetics; microbiology; physics; physiology; and statistics. Students may choose graduate programs involving a co-major with one of these areas. Graduate work in meat science is offered as a co-major in animal science and food science and human nutrition. The department also cooperates in the interdepartmental program in professional agriculture and interdepartmental majors in genetics, immunobiology, microbiology, MCDB (molecular, cellular, and developmental biology), neuroscience, nutritional sciences, and toxicology (see Index). The foreign language requirement, if any, is established on an individual basis by the program-of-study committee appointed to guide the work of the student.
