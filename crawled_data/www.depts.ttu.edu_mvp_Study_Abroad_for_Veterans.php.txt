Studying abroad is about more than just travel. By participating in international education, U.S. Military Veterans and ROTC Cadets have a lot to gain academically, professionally, and personally. Taking classes on an international campus allows students to earn credit toward their TTU degrees while meeting renowned faculty across disciplines. For students interested in less traditional experiences, internships, field-specific research projects, and service-learning programs offer opportunities for vets and cadets to experience the world in new ways outside of military service. Continue building your already impressive resume with more examples of adaptability, critical thinking skills, and the desire to build relationships within an increasingly global society. WHO DOES IT? Students who wish to increase their marketability post-graduation participate in study abroad. As a Veteran or Cadet, you already bring unique assets to international education, including but not limited to: • Leadership experience (often under pressure) • Independence and maturity • Proven work ethic • Previous international experience Any TTU student with a 2.5 GPA (2.75 required for Rawls College of Business students) can participate, and Vets in particular are a diverse, well-funded population of study abroad students. • 62% first generation students • 85% non-traditional ages (24+) • 73% men • Most popular degrees: health science, engineering, business, public service HOW WILL I PAY? Federal Educational Benefits Info Students eligible for Federal Educational Benefits may contact the Military & Veterans Program department to access this federal funding. Students must be enrolled in courses that apply to their degree (can be major/minor courses or courses that complete core requirements), the study abroad program must have TTU approval and the program at the 'host' school must be approved by VA. The amount of funding depends on whether study abroad is required by a student's academic department. o If study abroad is required (e.g., TTU Engineering), eligible tuition and fees are paid regardless of program choice o If study abroad is not required, eligible tuition and fees are paid, but student pays administrative fees, airfare, etc. (note: federal stipends can offset these costs). VA determines ultimate approval of benefit payments to students. VA will not pay for fees which include: • Meals • Travel • Lodging • Books and supplies (only certain chapters are eligible) Post 9/11 GI Bill Chapter 33 Factsheet Hazlewood Benefits Info Students eligible for the State of Texas' Hazlewood Act may use this benefit for study abroad courses registered through Texas Tech University.
