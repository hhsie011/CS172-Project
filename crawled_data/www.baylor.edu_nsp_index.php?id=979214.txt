However, we recognize that special circumstances might make it especially difficult for some students to travel to Baylor's campus in the summer. There will be a Virtual Orientation option for students who are unable to attend an in-person Orientation. Virtual Orientation will launch mid-summer and will feature video content that you can access at your convenience. This content will help you learn more about life as a Baylor student and the academic areas through which you will pursue your degree. You will hear about opportunities to become involved on campus and more.
