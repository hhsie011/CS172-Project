Further, the university seeks to promote campus diversity by enrolling and employing a larger number of minorities and women where these groups have historically been and continue to be under-represented within the university in relation to availability and may extend preference in initial employment to such individuals among substantially equally qualified candidates, as well as to veterans. This affirmation is published in accordance with 41 CFR 60 and is in keeping with Title VII & Title IX of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended; Executive Order 11246; the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974; the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1988 and Kentucky Statutes. The university aims to achieve, within all areas of the university community, a diverse student body, faculty, and staff capable of providing for excellence in the education of its students and for the enrichment of the university community. President's Affirmative Action and EEO Policy Statement Statement on Diversity in the University Community The University of Louisville strives to foster and sustain an environment of inclusiveness that empowers us all to achieve our highest potential without fear of prejudice or bias. We commit ourselves to building an exemplary educational community that offers a nurturing and challenging intellectual climate, a respect for the spectrum of human diversity, and a genuine understanding of the many differences-including race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, socioeconomic status, disability, religion, national origin or military status-that enrich a vibrant metropolitan research university. We expect every member of our academic family to embrace the underlying values of this vision and to demonstrate a strong commitment to attracting, retaining and supporting students, faculty and staff who reflect the diversity of our larger society. Unlawful Harassment, Personal Discrimination, and Retaliation The University of Louisville's Discriminatory Harassment Policy reflects the commitment to maintain a community that is free from harassment of any kind. Harassment of any kind is not acceptable at the university. It is inconsistent with the university's commitment to excellence and respect for all individuals. The university is also committed to protecting the academic freedom and freedom of expression of all members of the university community. Academic freedom and freedom of expression includes, but is not limited to, the expression of ideas, however controversial, in the classroom, residence hall, and in keeping with different responsibilities, in work places elsewhere in the university community. The University of Louisville strives to provide equal employment opportunity on the basis of merit and without unlawful discrimination in terms of race, sex, age, color, national origin, ethnicity, creed, religion, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or expression, marital status, pregnancy, or disability of an otherwise qualified individual. In addition, the university prohibits job discrimination of Vietnam era veterans, qualified special disabled veterans, recently separated veterans, and other protected veterans. The university shall make every reasonable effort to select all staff from applicant pools which are representative of the labor market in terms of sex, disability, minority, and veteran status. Furthermore, the university shall not subject employees to unlawful discrimination in terms of compensation, benefits, and/or working conditions. For more information concerning ways in which our multicultural learning community may be nurtured and protected or complaint resolution procedures, contact the Dean of Student Affairs, the Vice Provost of Diversity and International Programs, or the Vice President for Human Resources and EEO Officer.
