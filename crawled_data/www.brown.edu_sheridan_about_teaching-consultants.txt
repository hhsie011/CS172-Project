Through the Center’s Teaching Consultant Program, TCs receive professional training in the development and application of peer observation and feedback skills, and in the development of leadership and discussion facilitation skills. TCs are selected from members of the Brown teaching community who have earned The Sheridan Teaching Seminar--Reflective Teaching Certificate and have a demonstrated commitment to teaching and constructive pedagogical exchange. Some TCs may have also completed other Certificate Programs. See the Teaching Consultant Program page of our website for more information or to register. Through the Teaching Consultants Invited Speaker Program, each year the Teaching Consultants have an opportunity to invite an inspiring professor to Brown to give a lecture and share insights from his or her own pedagogical practice. Experienced Teaching Consultants Teaching Consultants who have completed Certificate IV may choose to continue serving as an Experienced Teaching Consultant (ETC). In this capacity, they will have the opportunity to continue their professional development by participating in the TC community. Experienced Teaching Consultants are expected to attend Session 1 and are encouraged to attend all sessions. Experienced Teaching Consultants are required to complete a minimum of 8 Teaching Observations for the academic year. Head Teaching Consultants Two experienced Teaching Consultants act as the Center's Head Teaching Consultants: one from the Humanities and Social Sciences, and one from the Life and Physical Sciences, and both usually serve in this role for two years. The Head Teaching Consultants work with the Director of the Certificate IV Program to co-facilitate training sessions, mentor peers, and facilitate communication and feedback between the Sheridan Center and the Teaching Consultant community.
