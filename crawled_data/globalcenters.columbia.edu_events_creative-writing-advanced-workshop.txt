The workshop will be hosted by Joshua Furst, Adjunct Assistant Professor of Writing at the School of the Arts. Joshua is the author of the novel, The Sabotage Café, and the story collection, Short People. His work has appeared in The Chicago Tribune, Salon, Nerve, Conjunctions, and Esquire, among other publications. In this workshop, the participants will read and analyze the works of fiction of each other, in order to identify how the text is constructed and what effects are produced in the reader. Through teacher-led discussions and close reading, focusing on narrative, structural, and stylistic choices, students learn to identify literary goals and what is needed to achieve them. The participants need to send a short story and a cover letter explaining why they want to attend the workshop. Registration until June 30. To RSVP, click here.
