Such bequests are extremely valuable, as they allow the University to flexibly and imaginatively meet future needs. Restricted Bequests These support ongoing specific University needs such as undergraduate scholarships, graduate fellowships, faculty, or maintaining our facilities. Because each restricted bequest is unique, Harvard encourages donors considering this type of gift to speak with a member of the Planned Giving staff. Endowed Funds Endowment gifts provide income every year in perpetuity to carry out the designated purpose of the gift, with the goal of preserving the real value of the gift. Expendable Funds The entire gift may be spent, generally within a relatively short time frame.
