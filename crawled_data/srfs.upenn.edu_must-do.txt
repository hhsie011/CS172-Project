Take care of these important tasks early to make sure your student account is set up with your preferred privacy settings and that you are receiving any expected funds quickly and securely. 1 Provide Proof of COVID-19 Vaccination All students are required to be vaccinated against COVID-19 for the 2021-2022 academic year. Your vaccination information must be reported to Immunization Compliance before coming to campus. Those who are not vaccinated must undergo twice-weekly Penn Cares Screening Testing until they are fully vaccinated. Upload your vaccination documentation now by visiting the Immunization Compliance page. Vaccine submission instructions: Submission instructions (new students) Submission instructions (existing students) Failure to meet these requirements will result in denial of student registration privileges. 2 Review Your Personal Profile Visit Path@Penn to view and update your biographic and demographic information that is on file with the University. 3 Update Your Directory Listing Use the Penn Directory to update your primary email address for Penn communications and decide what information is available about you to other members of the Penn community. 4 Give Permission to Share Academic/Financial Information The University generally cannot, by federal student privacy law (FERPA), discuss your academic or financial records with a third party, including parents. To authorize Penn to share your information with a parent, guardian, sponsor, or another party, you must designate them explicitly. From Path@Penn, click on "Share academic/financial info" under "My Profile." 5 Provide Your Emergency Contact Information Please provide personal emergency contact information for use with the UPennAlert Emergency Notification System & Penn Guardian. Partner with Penn by providing a phone number (preferably a cell phone) where you can best be reached. You can also register parents or guardians, so University officials can communicate with them as well. Register for UPennAlert: From Path@Penn, click on "Update my emergency contacts" under "My Profile." Register for Penn Guardian at: http://www.publicsafety.upenn.edu/pennguardian/ 6 Set Up Penn.Pay Users and Payment Accounts Penn.Pay is Penn’s electronic billing and payment system. As a student, you can access Penn.Pay with your PennKey. To enable others (such as your parents) to also receive and/or pay your bill, and view new activity on a daily basis, you must invite them as an Authorized User. From Path@Penn, click on "Penn.Pay" under "Financial Services." 7 Sign Up for Direct Deposit of Student Account Refund(s) and Payroll We encourage you to enroll in direct deposit, as you may receive wages from a Work-Study job, other campus employment, or receive a student account refund. Direct deposit ensures your funds will be deposited to your personal US bank account. Enroll as soon as possible, using a bank local to Penn, or one of your own choosing. Please note that Penn has two separate direct deposit systems, and you may need to enroll in both. For Student Account Refunds From Path@Penn, click on "Penn.Pay" under "Financial Services." For Student Employment From Path@Penn, click on "Enroll in Direct Deposit (payroll)" under "Financial Services." 8 Other Privacy Issues Visit PennPrivacy to read more about FERPA and visit the PennPortal and follow the Privacy Must Do List to make other privacy choices. Note: Revealing passwords or allowing other organizations or individuals to use your personal accounts to access Penn systems is a violation of University policy. Additionally, you compromise your privacy and become vulnerable to identity theft. Questions About Terminology? Go To Glossary Need Help?
