Program Information The Program in Hellenic Studies, under the general direction of the Council of the Humanities and with the support of the Stanley J. Seeger '52 Center for Hellenic Studies is designed for students interested in the interdisciplinary study of the Greek world during one or more periods (ancient, late antique, Byzantine, Renaissance, early modern (Ottoman), modern, or contemporary), as well as for students focusing on the reception of the classical tradition across cultures, time, or space. The program offers language courses in modern Greek and postclassical Greek (Hellenistic koine to Byzantine Greek); freshman seminars in Hellenic studies; introductory courses in Byzantine and modern Greek studies; upperclass seminars in classical, Byzantine, and modern Greek studies; global seminars and a senior thesis colloquium for concentrators in the program. These are complemented by cognate courses offered in several cooperating University departments. Additional information about the program can be found at the program's website. Admission to the Program The program is open to undergraduates concentrating in any department. Admission is by application normally during the sophomore or junior year. Students will be accepted into the program on the basis of interest and a coherent academic plan. The formal requirements for admission are: Satisfactory completion of one of the following: HLS 107, HLS 206, HLS 210, HLS 240, HLS 251, HLS 316, HLS 335, HLS 337, HLS 345, HLS 358, HLS 361, HUM 216-217; ART 304, or COM 205; a freshman seminar or global seminar on a Hellenic studies topic approved by the program executive director. Program of Study Program students may elect to follow one of three plans of study: Plan A Allows a specialization in Modern Greek language and literature. Students in this plan must satisfy a language requirement (HLS 107 or its equivalent). Plan B Provides for a broad-based interdisciplinary study of modern Greece, including modern and contemporary history, politics, international relations, economics, or anthropology. Plan C Emphasizes the chronological breadth of Hellenism through one or more humanistic disciplines (e.g., literature, history, art, religion, music) and/or the reception of the classical tradition in texts, visual culture, or thought across historical periods or cultures. Plan C students will be expected to complete coursework in one or more post-Classical periods: Late Antique, Byzantine, Renaissance, or Modern. Each student works out an individual program of study in consultation with the program executive director. Students in all three plans of study must complete the following requirements: Completion of at least one of the following: HLS 107, HLS 206, HLS 210, HLS 240, HLS 251, HLS 316, HLS 335, HLS 345, HLS 358, HLS 361, HUM 216-217; ART 304, or COM 205. Plan A students must also complete HLS 107 or its equivalent. Two upper-level HLS seminars. Students with a compelling curricular reason may petition the director of the Program in Hellenic Studies for acceptance of an upper division cognate. A list of cognate courses is available from the Program office. A senior thesis with a Hellenic studies focus that falls within one of the plans outlined above, to be approved by the Program executive director. Science and engineering majors must submit during their senior year a substantial project (research paper or creative work) on a Hellenic topic, approved by the Program executive director. In special cases, for humanities or social science majors whose senior thesis work will not facilitate a Hellenic focus, a junior paper or a substantial project (research paper or creative work) on a Hellenic topic may be substituted at the approval of the Program executive director. The Seeger Center also sponsors Hellenic Studies Workshops, a lecture series, and occasional colloquia that provide a forum for discussion of research in progress on all aspects of Greek civilization by faculty members, students, members of the Institute for Advanced Study, and visiting scholars. Languages Plan A students must complete HLS 107 or its equivalent. Students choosing Plan B or Plan C are encouraged to take at least two years of ancient, medieval, or modern Greek. Study Abroad Program students are encouraged to pursue further study and research in Greece during the summer months and, on occasion, during the academic year. Interested students may apply for Stanley J. Seeger study/travel fellowships through the Seeger Center. Under the auspices of the Office of International Programs, students may complement their academic work in Hellenic studies by enrolling for one or two terms at selected institutions in Greece or England. Certificate of Proficiency A student who completes the requirements of the program with satisfactory standing receives a certificate of proficiency in Hellenic studies. Additional Information Cognate Courses. A list of complete cognate courses may be found on the program's website. Any of these courses may provide an appropriate supplement to the program's core courses. Other courses may be added to this list with the approval of the appropriate department and the director of the program.
