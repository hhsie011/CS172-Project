Annual, and completed applications will cover terms for maintaining eligibility. Failure to reapply for financial aid each year will result in a loss of financial aid for that year and possibly subsequent years. If you completed the Georgia Tech Application for Scholarships and Financial Aid (GT App) and the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) when applying for financial aid for the previous academic year, you should receive an email from the U.S. Department of Education with instructions about how to once again submit the application electronically. The same two-part application process (GT App and FAFSA) is required for Georgia residents applying for ONLY the HOPE/Zell Miller Scholarship, administered by the Georgia Student Finance Commission (GSFC). Returning Undergraduates Review the required application process and steps to re-apply for federal and Institutional financial aid.
