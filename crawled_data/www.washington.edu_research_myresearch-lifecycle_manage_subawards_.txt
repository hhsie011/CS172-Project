Managing outgoing subawards includes monitoring activities and coordinating changes during the life of the project. Subrecipient Monitoring Subrecipient monitoring means verifying that our subrecipient is following technical, financial, and compliance requirements. PIs and departments can manage monitoring in different ways for different projects, but must make sure: Subrecipient performance matches their scope of work To receive and review deliverables (i.e., reports, data) in a timely manner Invoices are representative of the scope of work & adhere to costing policies Subrecipient is adhering to the terms and conditions of the subaward To maintain ongoing communications with subrecipients, as the project demands. Remember to: Retain documentation of monitoring activities Alert the Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP) Subawards team via ospsubs@uw.edu of problems such as inability to obtain a satisfactory invoice, non-performance, etc. Subaward Changes You may need to request a modification or changes to an outgoing subaward. Modification requests must be submitted via SAGE for any of these changes: Funding (SAGE entry must reflect amount being added/subtracted) Period of Performance Scope of Work Principal Investigator Terms and Conditions Don’t forget to submit an Ariba CR/BPO version (required) after you receive notice of the signed subaward modification for changes to: Funding Ariba needs to reflect cumulative total for entire BPO, reflecting the amount available for invoicing Period of performance To request a modification or otherwise edit your subaward you must either be: Listed as a contact on that subaward (Preparer, PI or Financial Contact); or Have a Subaward Preparer ASTRA role.

After we have a modification signed by both parties, OSP: uploads a copy of the modification to SAGE, notifies the subrecipient and department requester. Review the SAGE: Subaward Quick Guide for instructions and guidance. Carryforward and New Blanket Purchase Orders When approving a Subaward BPO in Ariba, UW Procurement confirms the totals in Ariba match the subaward total in SAGE. If you request a new BPO for a subsequent budget period that includes carryforward from the previous year’s BPO, include an explanation in the comments of the new BPO. Frequently Asked Questions Once the Subaward is fully executed, how will the subrecipient entity get paid for the work they are doing? Subrecipients will invoice your department via the Ariba network. Your department is responsible for receiving and approving the work for which you are being billed. Finally, your department will release the invoice for payment via the Ariba network. UW Accounts Payable will receive the approved invoice and pay the subrecipient via the method set up in the Ariba network. Why should I request a subaward modification?
