Our researchers perform open systems and software engineering to develop architectures, requirements, algorithms and designs, application frameworks, components, automated decision support aids, models and simulations, data interface transport methods/schemas, and test tools for Army, Joint, and International individual defense systems, families-of-systems, and system-of-systems architectures. Over the past forty years, ASL researchers have developed subject matter expertise covering all aspects and phases of development, integration, test and evaluation, acquisition, and effective operational fielding strategies and post-deployment sustainment support for new and modernized C4I systems including foreign military sales. Examples of ASL research involving Integrated Air & Missile Defense C4I & Decision Support include: Development of pre-Milestone B foundational open software architecture precepts, reference architectures, open standards, acquisition strategy, and source selection documents for the Army’s Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Battle Command System (IBCS) Providing subject matter expertise in joint track management, combat identification, engagement operations, requirements development, algorithms, prototypes, test tools, and software development kits to enable rapid integration of weapon and sensor components into the IBCS Have a question?
