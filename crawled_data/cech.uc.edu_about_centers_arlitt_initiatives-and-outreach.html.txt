For more information, please contact Leslie Kochanowski. Sustainability Arlitt is committed to fostering a sustainable worldview among our children, families, and staff to “build the kind of world—economically, environmentally and socially—that we want to live in, and one that we want our children and grandchildren to inherit” (UC Office of Sustainability). We embrace families and the community at the Arlitt Center and believe our pedagogy is embedded within a sustainable worldview. Leave No Child Inside- Greater Cincinnati (LNCI-GC): Leave No Child Inside envisions a world where all children play, learn, and grow with nature in their everyday lives, with the aim of increasing access to nature for children in Greater Cincinnati. LNCI-GC is Co-Chaired by Dr. Victoria Carr of the Arlitt Center and Connie O’Connor from The Cincinnati Nature Center. Education for Environmental Sustainability (ESS) Certificate: This certificate program focuses on the exploration of environmental issues, problem solving, critical thinking, and taking action to improve the environment. The certificate prepares individuals to be leaders in the movement toward creating sustainable communities. Educative Environments Education for Environmental Sustainability (ESS) Certificate: This certificate program focuses on the exploration of environmental issues, problem solving, critical thinking, and taking action to improve the environment. The certificate prepares individuals to be leaders in the movement toward creating sustainable communities. Arlitt Nature Playscape: the Arlitt Nature Playscape is one of the first two such venues built in Cincinnati. In collaboration with Cincinnati Nature Center, we aimed to demonstrate best practice in the design of innovative children’s nature play environments. Playscapes are intended to be an alternative to traditional playgrounds; they provide a nature-based space for children to engage in child-directed play while immersed in nature. The playscapes serve as research sites for the NSF funded grant STEM in the Playscape: Building Knowledge for Educational Practice . Arlitt Children’s Studio: Inspired by the ateliers of the schools in Reggio Emilia, the Arlitt Children’s Studio is designed to give children the space, time, and materials to explore their interests through in-depth project work. The studio has been a part of Arlitt for over eight years, but with a generous grant from PNC Charitable Trusts we have been able to build out a permanent studio space in the atrium of the Arlitt Child Development Center. Children, Youth and Environments Network: The Children, Youth and Environments network disseminates knowledge and stimulates discussion to support inclusive, sustainable and healthy environments for children and youth everywhere. The CYE network connects a global community and provides an online forum for active discussion, resource sharing, and the publication of a peer-reviewed online journal. Professional Learning, Advocacy, & Outreach Arlitt is dedicated to elevating the field of early childhood education and provides high quality training opportunities for professionals in the community and actively participates in local and national advocacy efforts. Arlitt values professional and cross-disciplinary partnerships. Arlitt Professional Educator Learning Series (APELS): Arlitt offers a range of professional learning opportunities including on-site trainings and mentoring, as well as training tours of the Arlitt Child Development Center and the Arlitt Nature Playscape. Power to the Profession: Power to the Profession is a national movement led by the National Association for the Education of Young Children. Arlitt staff have been actively involved in providing local information sessions and providing feedback on national documents. Southwest Ohio Association for the Education of Young Children (SWOAEYC): Members of the Arlitt community hold positions on the SWOAEYC board and lead efforts for the Public Policy Committee. Professional and Community Collaborations: Arlitt has collaborated across a variety of professional and cross-disciplinary community projects, and consults on program development and environment design for young children.
