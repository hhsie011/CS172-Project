Texas Tech University Directory Raiderlink A-Z Index Financial Aid Menu Search TTU Financial Aid Home Dependency Change Generally, undergraduate students are considered dependents of their legal (biological, adoptive, or otherwise determined by the state) parent(s) for the purposes of calculating financial aid eligibility (federal, state, and institutional) and parental information must be provided on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). An undergraduate student's dependency status for tax filing purposes is not necessarily reflective of their dependency status for financial aid. Under very limited circumstances, undergraduate students may qualify to have a change made to their dependency status for the purpose of determining financial aid eligibility. Documented cases of abuse, neglect, incarceration, abandonment by the parents, etc. will be considered. Students should submit the Dependency Change Request along with supporting documentation to Student Financial Aid & Scholarships. 2022-2023 Dependency Change Request The following will NOT be considered valid reasons for a dependency change: Parent's refusal to pay for college Parent's refusal to provide information for the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) Parent's inability to claim student as a dependent for income tax purposes Student's ability to demonstrate self-sufficiency In addition, students who can answer "yes" to any of the following questions are considered independent of their parents for the purposes of calculating financial aid: 24 years of age (or older) Married Pursuing a master's or doctorate degree Active duty military Veteran Support dependent children Support dependents (other than children or spouse) who live with you In foster care, orphan (both parents deceased), or dependent or ward of the court prior to age 13 Emancipated minor (as determined by court in state of legal residence) In legal guardianship (as determined by court in state of legal residence) In the last year, determined to be unaccompanied youth who is homeless or self-supporting and at risk of becoming homeless Financial Aid Like Financial Aid on FacebookLike Financial Aid on Facebook Follow Financial Aid on twitterFollow Financial Aid on twitter Subscribe to Financial Aid on YouTubeSubscribe to Financial Aid on YouTube Follow Financial Aid on InstagramFollow Financial Aid on Instagram Address Texas Tech University | Student Financial Aid & Scholarships | West Hall 301 | P.O.
