Immunization Submittal Process To submit your immunization records, be sure to have an electronic copy and then use your BlueKey information to log in to the Student Homepage in Campus Connect » Student Resources » Immunization Status. You may also find it under Admitted Student Homepage » Next Steps » Immunization Status. Here, you will also be able to view your immunization status grid. If you do not have a copy of your records, you may use the DePaul University Immunization Form. Your physician or health care provider will need to indicate the month, day, and year of each vaccination that you have received and must sign the form. Scan or take a photo of the completed form, log in to Campus Connect and submit the form through the navigation path above. View this step-by-step video detailing the immunization submission process. Please note: By law, DePaul University must prevent you from registering in subsequent terms if you’ve failed to submit documentation verifying that you meet the immunization requirements. Documents from childhood, records from schools previously attended, clinical/hospital records, or International Certificates of Vaccinations are all acceptable immunization records. All records must be in English or be accompanied by a certified translation. DePaul does not re-release immunization information.
