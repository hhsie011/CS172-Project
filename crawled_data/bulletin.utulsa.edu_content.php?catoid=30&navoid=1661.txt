A graduate certificate program is a related cluster of graduate courses that comprise a well-structured body of study within a discipline or set of related disciplines. Courses completed during a certificate program may be applied toward degree requirements or electives upon approval of the graduate program advisor and the Graduate School. A certificate may be earned in conjunction with a graduate degree or separately by individuals who already possess a bachelor’s degree.
