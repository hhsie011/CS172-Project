These workshops tap into the collective knowledge within Columbia University and the larger entrepreneurial and social impact community (they are free and open to the public). Each workshop is hosted by a social entrepreneur and begins with an overview of their venture. The majority of the workshop is then spent discussing and brainstorming around specific questions or areas that the entrepreneur has identified will help their venture.
