Open to all undergraduates enrolled at Temple, this certificate program enhances students' self-confidence and presentation skills, improving their classroom presence and marketability. This five-course, 15-credit certificate program is taught on Temple's Main Campus and equips students with a foundational understanding of theater and the tools needed to share that knowledge, whether in a traditional classroom setting or as a teaching artist in a professional theater company. The Theater Education Undergraduate Certificate is an opportunity for students interested in teaching to improve their presence in front of a class. It also prepares them to add theater and drama to the range of subjects they can teach. The certificate includes the four courses that comprise the Pennsylvania Department of Education-approved Theater Endorsement. For students pursuing areas of study outside of theater, this certificate provides a chance to develop an interest in arts education; gain theater experience; and further valuable professional skills such as collaboration, confidence in public speaking and creativity. Students must be concurrently enrolled in a baccalaureate degree to earn this certificate. Classes & Curriculum Required courses include Acting 1, Methods of Teaching, Stage Management, Welcome Backstage and World of the Play.
