In 1998, the law was amended and renamed the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Statistics Act, commonly called the Clery Act. This law mandates that institutions that receive Title IV federal funds disclose crime statistics for certain serious offenses that occurred on campus and in adjacent areas for the current and two previous calendar years. The purpose of this report is to provide current and prospective students, staff and faculty with campus safety information including crime statistics and procedures to follow to report a crime. This document was prepared within the Division of Student Services and is available for download here. A paper copy of the report can be obtained upon request from the Department of Public Safety at the Public Safety Building, located next to the Ward Gate.
