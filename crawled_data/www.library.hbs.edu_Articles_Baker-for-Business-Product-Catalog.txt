Frei, Harvard Business School Felix Oberholzer-Gee, Harvard Business School Strategy, at its core, describes how a company attains superior performance. In industry after industry, there is a wide range in company performance resulting from the various strategies adopted by individual firms. Underneath all of this variation, however, are principles that are straightforward and consistent across industries. This pamphlet outlines these principles to help you set and evolve your company’s strategy. Here we offer a simple and succinct way to think about the sources of competitive advantage. We hope that our way of thinking about why some companies do far better than others is both illuminating and inspiring.
