Learn political leadership The Institute of Politics (IOP) at the Harvard Kennedy School connects students with political leaders and seasoned civil servants. Harvard undergraduates have access to the Institute's John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum, one of the world’s premier arenas for political speech, discussion, and debate. The IOP also offers: Paid summer internships A nonpartisan quarterly journal written and run entirely by undergraduates A women’s leadership initiative A unique nationwide survey of youth attitudes toward politics and public service, every aspect of which involves Harvard students Give back through community service Join the many students who give back to Harvard and the surrounding communities through a variety of public service programs. The Phillips Brooks House Association and the College Public Service Network coordinate many programs, and students direct more than 120 service initiatives in Greater Boston—from mentoring local youth and providing literacy tutoring to local adults, to promoting environmental sustainability and running a homeless shelter. Become a Presidential Public Service Fellow For those dedicated to community initiatives, Harvard offers a Presidential Public Service Fellowship, which supports students who choose to spend a summer doing government, community service, non-governmental organization, or non-profit work, or who develop their own innovative projects that serve the common good.
