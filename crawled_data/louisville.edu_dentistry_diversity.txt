We commit ourselves to building an exemplary educational community that offers a nurturing and challenging intellectual climate, a respect for the spectrum of human diversity, and a genuine understanding of the many differences (including race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, socioeconomic status, disability, religion, national origin, or military status) that enrich a vibrant metropolitan research university. The School of Dentistry strives to ensure that the diversity of our school reflects the diversity of the community it serves. The School of Dentistry will educate competent dentists and allied health professionals who will be leaders in our diverse world. We believe that diversity enhances patient-centered care and strengthens our mission of preparing students to be innovators in the dental field. As leaders in healthcare, it is our shared responsibility to provide an intellectual community that promotes an unparalleled educational experience - one that includes innovative research, equal opportunity, and an enriching experience that consists of diverse methodologies and perspectives. The underlying values of our vision and keys to continued success are demonstrated in our strong commitment to attracting, retaining, and supporting students, faculty, and staff who reflect the diversity of our larger society. Using principles of inclusiveness, mutual respect, fairness, and social justice encourages everyone to cultivate his/her fullest potential by embracing our many differences and aptitudes. This will help us to nurture the climate that we enjoy at ULSD. Our administration, faculty, staff and students are committed to promoting diversity as a core value. ULSD unites with the University and community partners to promote equality and diversity. The Health Science Campus Office of Diversity and Inclusion serves a liaison for all schools on the HSC Campus, including ULSD. ULSD Diversity Committee The ULSD’s Diversity Committee was begun in 2003. This committee is comprised of representatives from the various departments within the dental school. Appointed by the ULSD Dean, the ULSD Diversity Chair oversees the committee and creates the ULSD Diversity Plan and Activities list with information gathered from ULSD Departments and Offices. The Diversity Plan is reviewed by ULSD Administration and the Diversity Committee prior to being sent to the Office of the Vice Provost for Diversity and International Affairs and submitted to the Council on Post-Secondary Education. The Committee serves as an Standing Committee, meeting to review, discuss and provide suggestions to enhance ULSD on matters of diversity and inclusion. Audra French Assistant Director of Student Affairs, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Audra's position serves as a strategic leader for student affairs, student support and advocacy with emphasis on the development and implementation of proactive student diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.
