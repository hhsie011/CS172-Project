Research Research Overview Richard Meckel's research is centered in the intersections between the history of public health and medicine, and the history of child social and medical welfare. He is especially interested in the role of the state in promoting the survival and health of America’s young and has sought to reveal and explain the origins of US infant and child health policy and practice during the critical late nineteenth and early twentieth century period when the nation formatively negotiated the boundaries between public health and private practice and parental and state responsibility for child welfare. Research Statement Professor Meckel's current research project is a reconstruction and analysis of the determinants, character, and policy consequences of the 20th and 21st century US discourse on the relationship between poverty, poor nutrition and poor health in childhood.
