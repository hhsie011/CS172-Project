Academic Progress Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy Appeal Process Satisfactory Academic Progress FAQ Additional Information for Deferred SAP Appeal Additional Information for Deferred SAP Appeal (PDF) SAP Appeal Form AStudentGuidetoSAP.pdf Satisfactory Academic Progress Plan MTF 2020.pdf The Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) policy exists as a method to ensure students are able to complete their academic program in a timely manner while achieving minimum academic standards. In an age of increasing accountability of the use of federal student aid funds (and other federal, state, and institutional funds), institutions and students must demonstrate financial aid funds are being used to assist students in completing their academic goals in the most efficient way. The Student Financial Aid Office understands the interruptions and unusual circumstances caused by the novel Coronavirus, COVID-19, may have negatively impacted your ability as a student. If COVID-19 was the primary reason you were unable to meet a component(s) of SAP, our office encourages you to file an appeal outlining how you were unable to meet SAP standard requirements as a result of a COVID-19 related circumstance. We understand documenting the impact of COVID-19 may be difficult. If documentation of a COVID-19 related circumstance is unavailable, we ask you simply do your best to provide a clear explanation of your circumstance. For example, providing an attestation you or a family member became ill, you needed to become a caregiver or a first responder, you encountered an economic hardship, you had additional work hours, you encountered issues due to loss of childcare, you had an inability to successfully continue with classes via distance education, etc. Federal regulations mandate all students are required to maintain SAP toward a degree in order to receive financial assistance through Title IV federal financial aid (including, but not limited to, the Pell Grant, Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loan, Parent PLUS, Graduate/Professional PLUS, Federal Work-study, Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant and TEACH Grant) and need-based state aid (such as the Kentucky CAP Grant) programs. Students must meet the academic standards as outlined in the SAP policy. These standards are for financial aid purposes only and neither replaces nor overrides academic policies outlined by the University of Louisville. A current academic year FAFSA must be on file in order for SAP to be evaluated. Therefore, before an appeal is submitted please ensure your FAFSA is complete. Complete your fafsa here at www.Studentaid.gov. The SAP policy applies to all undergraduate, graduate, and professional students as described below. Policy The University of Louisville has followed federal regulations and requirements to develop a policy to ensure that students are meeting minimum Satisfactory Academic Progress.
