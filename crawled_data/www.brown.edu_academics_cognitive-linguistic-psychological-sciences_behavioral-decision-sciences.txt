By virtue of its broad interdisciplinary nature, the study of decision making covers work found in a variety of more traditional disciplines including psychology, cognitive science, economics, philosophy, computer science, and neuroscience. The concentration is designed so that students develop a foundation in the science of human decision making, acquire expertise in at least two of the core areas of decision making (psychology, economics, computer science, and philosophy), and learn about applications of the science of decision making. In the process, students will learn how to apply quantitative and other research methods and will produce a piece of integrative research. The Behavioral Decision Sciences concentration offers an A.B. degree. AP and Transfer Credits: Please refer to our departmental policy on applying AP and transfer credits. Requirements & Additional Information All requirements for the Standard Program for the A.B. Degree (13 credits plus prerequisites) are listed in detail in the Brown Course Bulletin.
