Here are our expectations to promote safe and healthy spaces: We expect everyone to wear a face covering or mask at all times when inside any FSU Libraries building, even if you are vaccinated. We expect you to stay home when sick, self-quarantine and get tested for COVID-19 no sooner than 24 hours after your symptoms begin. Maintain social distancing of at least three feet (six feet recommended). Clean study areas before and after use. Cleaning supplies are located throughout the building. Wash hands frequently for at least 20 seconds with soap and water. Properly dispose of any wipes or cleaning supplies after cleaning and disinfection.
