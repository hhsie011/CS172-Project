The campus is divided among eight supervisors to allow for a reasonable response time to customers needs. Custodial service responds to the needs of its customers via work orders, special and emergency requests. Campus–wide trash and recycling collection and office cleaning is performed by custodial services as follows: Tuesday and Friday: desk side trash Friday: recycling Office cleaning: weekly Food waste should not be disposed of in the trash bin at your desk, use the trash and recycling containers in your buildings kitchens or designated common areas. For questions or suggestions contact Donna Butler, Director of Custodial Services at 863-7626 or by email to [email protected]. Moves Moves and event set-ups are also part of custodial functions. Employees respond to large and small moves and set-ups through the use of the work order system. Some services require special licenses and certificates, such as pest control, water and mold remediation, and window washing. These requests are handled by only approved vendors that are under contract with the purchasing department. All requests for custodial services should be placed through the work order system to ensure a fast and efficient response.
