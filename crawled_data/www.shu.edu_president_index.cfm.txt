Nyre, Ph.D., a nationally recognized leader in higher education, was named the 21st president of Seton Hall, effective August 1. "The Board is overwhelmingly enthusiastic in its selection of Dr. Nyre as Seton Hall's next president. He is an experienced leader, a bold visionary and possesses an unwavering commitment to our Catholic mission," said Patrick Murray, Chair of the University's Board of Regents. Immediately prior to his appointment, President Nyre served for eight years as the leader of Iona College, a Roman Catholic institution in New Rochelle, New York. Mindful of the changing higher education landscape, President Nyre has substantial experience in reducing tuition dependency, strengthening institutional fiscal health and fundraising for key institutional initiatives. Collectively, his teams achieved record levels of fundraising (tripling Iona's endowment in less than eight years), established an abundance of student scholarships and expanded Iona's main campus by more than 30 percent by constructing and renovating numerous buildings. In addition, he has practiced as a psychologist in academic, clinical and private practice settings while serving at several prominent institutions, including Baylor University, the University of Illinois-Chicago College of Medicine and Harvard Medical School. "It is a great honor and my distinct privilege to be selected to serve as Seton Hall's 21st president," President Nyre said. "I look forward to working with the entire Seton Hall community to build on its distinguished legacy of academic excellence in Catholic higher education." His Eminence Cardinal Joseph W. Tobin, C.Ss.R., Archbishop of Newark, in his role as chair of the Board of Trustees and president of the Board of Regents said, "Dr. Nyre is an excellent choice to guide Seton Hall as it continues its important role as one of our nation's leading Catholic universities." A devout Catholic, President Nyre and his wife, the former Kelli McIntyre, have four children: Evelyn (7), Charlie (11), Henry (15) and Hadley (18).
