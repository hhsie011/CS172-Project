Clemson Home Campus Life TigerOne Building Access BSC Support Current: Door Schedules Door Schedules Schedule Change Policy Schedule change requests must be submitted to TigerOne at TigerOneCard@clemson.edu at least one week before the requested change effect date. If this time window is not provided, TigerOne cannot guarantee that the request will be completed. Please ensure schedule requests originate in the form of an email to TigerOneCard@clemson.edu. Schedule changes requested over the phone are not considered secure and thus will not be enacted. No Schedule Overrides should be applied to exterior doors without approval from Public Safety. Please contact CUPD at 864-656-2222 in the case of emergencies in which your building cannot be secured. Campus Access Protocols Definitions The below definitions define the types of access that are supported on campus. You will hear this language in communication from TigerOne. General Access The business hours of a building as defined by the Building Security Coordinator. All cardholders in the Employee, Student, Affiliates, Mail and Graduate groups will automatically inherit General Access. General Access should always include hours in which classes are in session to accommodate student access. Manually Assigned Access Access that has been assigned manually by the Building Security Coordinator through the Genetec Access Control software. Automated Access Access that has been assigned automatically by the system. Automated groups are setup by TigerOne from details provided by the BSC. Automation can be built for course majors and department codes. Public Access Certain spaces on Campus have unlocked exterior doors for the purpose of allowing the public to access the space. Access for these areas is managed by the BSC. All buildings that wish to unlock doors to the public must be approved through Public Safety and Emergency Management. Special Operations During certain periods, the above access definitions change to accommodate different operations based on campus presence and emergency events. Holidays On University observed holidays, all General Access will be turned off. Manually assigned access will continue to operate as normal. Public Access will be determined by the relevant BSC. Student Breaks TigerOne does not turn off General Access during student breaks unless specified by the BSC. During student breaks, general access and manually assigned access will operate as normal. Public Access will be determined by the relevant BSC. Exams TigerOne does not adjust General Access during exams unless specified by the BSC. During exams, general access and manually assigned access will operate as normal. Public Access will be determined by the relevant BSC. Weather Closures In the event of inclement weather, TigerOne will adjust General Access to accommodate county closures as defined by SCEMD. Access will only be removed by relevant county. For example, if there is a closure due to snow in Oconee County, but not in Charleston County, only facilities within Oconee County will have General Access removed. Manually assigned access and automation will work as normal. Public Access will be determined by the relevant BSC.
