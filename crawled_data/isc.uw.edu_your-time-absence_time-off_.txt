Time Off vs. Leave of Absence Some absences, including those that may qualify for the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), Disability Leave, or Parental Leave require both a Leave of Absence (LOA) request and an accompanying request for Time Off. Learn more about Time Off vs. Leave of Absence. Time Off Usage Hierarchy Workday uses the below sets of validation rules to enforce a hierarchy for time off usage, per UW time off policies. Time Off Usage hierarchies do not apply to employees on an approved Sick/Injured or Becoming a Parent Leave of Absence. These employees may use their Time Offs in any order. For Professional Staff: A Prostaff employee’s time off balance, based on already approved time off requests, is assessed in this order: Use up all Holiday Credit Time Off before using Compensatory, Discretionary and Vacation Time Off – to improve user experience this is not enforced in Workday; however, employees should still be aware that exhausting this Time Off first is UW policy Use up all Compensatory Time Off before using Discretionary and Vacation Time Off Use up all Discretionary Time Off before using Vacation Time Off Use up all Holiday Credit, Compensatory, Discretionary and Vacation Time Off before using Unpaid Time Off For Classified Staff: A Classified staff employee’s time off balance, based on already approved time off requests, is assessed in this order: Use up all Compensatory Time Off before using Vacation Time Off Use up all Holiday Credit, Compensatory and Vacation Time Off before using Unpaid Time Off More Information Refer to UWHR’s website for details about time off policies.
