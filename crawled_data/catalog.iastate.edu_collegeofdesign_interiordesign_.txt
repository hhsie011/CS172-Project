BFA Interior Design Emphasis is on the student's application of design processes to creatively solve problems of the interior environment based on knowledge of human safety, functional utility, and physical, psychological, and contextual fit. Graduates in interior design are competent in visual communication (sketching, drafting, and computer-aided design), design problem solving, space planning, lighting and color specification for interiors, finish and furniture selection, detailing interior construction, and application of human factors. The curriculum is accredited by the Council for Interior Design Accreditation (CIDA) as providing professional-level education. Transfer students with studio credits from other colleges and universities must present a portfolio of work done in those courses to determine if these credits can be applied toward specific studio requirements. Students are required to present their portfolio upon admission and prior to registration for classes. Arrangements for this process must be made with department advisors. Graduate Study A 34-graduate-credit program is offered leading to the Master of Arts, for students planning to undertake professional or design research-oriented pursuits. (NOTE: Applicants without a previous undergraduate degree in interior design may be required to complete up to 40 additional credits of deficiency work). A 60-graduate-credit post-professional graduate program is also offered leading to the degree Master of Fine Arts. Degree Requirements The curriculum in Interior Design leads to a 129-credit undergraduate Bachelor of Fine Arts in Interior Design including completion of the Core Design Program. Admission into the professional program follows completion of the Core Design Program and depends upon available resources. Information on admission criteria to each professional degree is posted each year on the College admissions website. Total Degree Requirement: 129 cr.

If accepted, students will be allowed to register for six graduate credits and apply the credits to an MA degree. Graduate Study The Department of Interior Design offers two graduate degrees in interior design: a five-semester Master of Fine Arts (MFA) and a three-semester Master of Arts (MA), each of which requires a thesis. The degree programs encourage interdisciplinary work within the College of Design and across related fields within the university. We currently offer double-degree programs and an interdisciplinary PhD program in Human Computer Interaction (HCI) with a home department in Interior Design. Financial support in the form of teaching and research assistantships is available on a competitive basis. Master of Fine Arts in Interior Design (MFA) The MFA is a terminal degree in Interior Design with a required thesis and a creative component. It is designed for students with undergraduate degrees in Interior Design or closely related disciplines and for students from other disciplines who complete required prerequisites in the Department of Interior Design. The MFA in Interior Design Program prepares students to become professionals in practice, teaching, and research. The MFA program encourages students to research and engage diverse contemporary issues within design specializations across the field of Interior Design. Faculty in the program provide students with opportunities to engage and address social, cultural, environmental, historical, practical, and other concerns within regional, national, and international contexts. They amalgamate traditional methods and contemporary technologies, and encourage students to develop new processes as needed. Faculty members promote inclusive designs that accommodate current and future needs across distinct cultures and populations. The Interior Design Graduate Programs expect graduates to approach research and interdisciplinary coursework with dedication and commitment. The MFA curriculum has an intensive five-semester course sequence that emphasizes foundations of interior design including methods, theory, process, humanics (human factors in design), and studio. Design seminars offer training in varied interior design specializations including preservation and cultural heritage, inclusive design, lighting, color theory, research methods, and human factors design. The program offers study abroad opportunities, studios with specialized faculty, and independent study projects. Interdisciplinary option studios apply and integrate core-course content with technical proficiency in areas of preservation and cultural heritage, healthcare, design for elderly populations, and hospitality, among others. During the last two semesters students explore interior design through focused research and a written thesis. The MFA program concludes with a public defense of the thesis that includes a thesis exhibition with graphic representations of the research. Students admitted to the program hold undergraduate degrees in a broad range of fields. A student without an undergraduate degree in interior design or interior architecture must complete the curriculum’s prerequisites listed in curriculum sheets posted on the Graduate Programs in Interior Design’s website. Students with undergraduate degrees in closely related to design fields may be eligible to waive part of the prerequisites in the program.

Total: 60 credits Master of Arts in Interior Design (MA) The post-professional Master of Arts (MA) in Interior Design is a 34-credit research degree with required a graduate thesis. The MA degree is open to applicants who hold a professional degree in Interior Design or Interior Architecture from an accredited program. The MA in Interior Design degree prepares students to become competent professionals in Interior Design practice, while the written research thesis contributes to the body of knowledge in the field. MA candidates are required to develop a thesis proposal with a statement of purpose, research questions, literature review, methods summary, and outline of proposed chapters. A first professional degree is also open for applicants with non-professional degrees in various fields with the completion of required prerequisites in the Department of Interior Design. A first professional MA for graduates in closely related design fields may allow some prerequisite courses to be waived.
