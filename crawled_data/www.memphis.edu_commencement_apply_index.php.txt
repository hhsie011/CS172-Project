How to check your Graduation Status: Go to your myMemphis portal Click on Student Pages Click on My Degree. Find Graduation Status Sharing Information with Family and Friends While Commencement is a family event and we look forward to you participating with family and friends, we do not share participation details with family/friends for any of our participants. It is your responsibility to share your participation with the individuals you want to know. We do not and cannot provide academic details with family and friends either. Please be sure family and friends are aware of this. We can provide general ceremonial details only. Caps and Gowns We are NOT able to loan out caps and gowns for photos. Please check with your photographer who should have caps available for props, etc. Our caps and gowns are ONLY available to participants and these participants can only pick them up during Cap and Gown Distribution (1-2) days prior to commencement. In addition, gowns and hoods are rentals only and not available for non-participants. Gowns and hoods are used for the ceremony (participants only). Commencement Vs. Graduation It is important to understand that commencement and graduation are related, but they are not exactly the same thing. Commencement is the optional celebration of your accomplishment. Graduation is the process of completing your academic work, successfully, and obtaining an actual degree in your studies (diploma). For academic related questions, please contact your college/advisor. For all questions related to commencement and surrounding activities and diplomas, please contact commencement@memphis.edu. While we believe everyone should celebrate this incredible accomplishment, it is not required. It is a personal preference to attend the actual ceremony or not. However, if you choose not to participate, we do not provide gowns, etc. Only participants receive regalia to be worn at the ceremony and returned after use at the ceremony. In order for us to include you in any commencement, you must register for it (Step 4) or respond to the email with a yes. Whether, online or in-person, graduates must inform us by the deadline we provide (typically 6 weeks or more prior to any event) if they plan to attend. It is the graduates responsibility to follow all deadlines. Failure to respond by deadlines will result in exclusion in ceremonies. We work with vendors and processes that must be completed several weeks prior to commencement ceremonies. So, make sure you respond to emails sent to your University of Memphis email. We try our best to accommodate everyone, but we need your help to ensure your commencement and graduation process runs as smoothly as possible. We must work together. Do not wait until days before or even weeks before a ceremony to be included. While we want you to have the best experience, we cannot add you after deadlines have passed. Please meet all deadlines and respond to all emails timely. If you do not understand something or you do not receive confirmation, ask us! Continue to read how to Apply for Graduation (Required at the University of Memphis). All deadlines must be met.

It is your responsibility to ensure you are checking your Memphis email account regularly for messages from the Commencement Office, advisors and academic officers. It is a good practice to check it daily. All students approved to graduate are automatically added the Commencement Program each graduating semester.

The name is automatically printed unless we hear from the student via email in a timely fashion. Student records are checked by the College Graduation Analyst.

All students must be approved for the current term in order to participate in the commencement ceremony. Students receiving the Graduate Certificate do NOT participate in any commencement ceremony. The event is reserved for those obtaining degrees only and your certificate will be mailed 2-3 months after the ceremony. Second Majors do NOT participate in the commencement ceremony and do NOT receive a second diploma. Step 4 will be sent to graduates who are approved for the current term via their Memphis email address. This will be sent in the final semester. It is REQUIRED by ALL approved graduating students and failure to complete this form will result in the canceling of your graduation application. Diplomas are mailed 2-3 months after commencement. No exceptions. If you have a hold on your account, you will not receive your diploma until the hold is cleared. It is your responsibility to ensure all requirements are met at least one month prior to commencement. Failure to do so could cause issues such as: no name listed in the program, no permission to participate in the commencement ceremony, ineligibility to graduate, disqualification from the term's graduation, etc. Deadlines are strictly enforced. This statement does not override any deadlines that need to be met for other requirements such as graduate applications and Step 4. Any student at the University has to be approved for graduation in order to participate. The University does not allow early participation. This means, the student participates in the term/semester that he/she is approved for graduation. If you become Ineligible, Disqualified or your Approval status changes from Approved to Not Approved at any point in the semester, your name will be removed from the program and as a result, your participation in the Commencement ceremony will be cancelled.
