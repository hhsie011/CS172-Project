Our Entrepreneurial Greenhouse Program prepares future founders to get their ventures off the ground by providing funding, access to expert mentors, and the chance to present to professional investors. On average, nearly half of these businesses are launched soon after graduation. Through our Nonprofit Board Leadership Program, students with an interest in making a difference are embedded with the decision makers at a nonprofit, not just to glimpse the issues these organizations face, but to gain immediate, hands-on experience helping overcome those challenges. Ultimately, it's not only our location in New York City that enables us to train our students this way, but our long-established place at the heart of the business world.
