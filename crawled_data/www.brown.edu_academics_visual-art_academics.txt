When asked what they like the best about the Department of Visual Art, Concentrators mention instructors, facilities, and equipment, but at the top of their list is what they express as "freedom." By this, they mean not only 24-hour building access, but opportunities to do interdisciplinary projects and the openness of assignments. "It is what you make of it. You can go as far as you want," says a student in Painting II. Brown does not promote a particular "style." Instead, we encourage and aid students in learning whatever makes effective and challenging work. Assignments are often accompanied by readings selected to generate thought and discussion. Class critique is not done in the classic master/pupil style; instead, students are encouraged to critique themselves and each other. Department Undergraduate Group (DUG) Leaders The DUG program is sponsored by the Dean of the College. Department Undergraduate Students or DUGs are chosen by Visual Art Concentrators and faculty. VA DUGs are chosen each year to help students connect with one another, with faculty, and with alumni. VA DUGs participate in concentration fairs, give guided tours of our facilities to prospective students, organize the annual open studio event, and assist with the Annual Juried Student Exhibition.
