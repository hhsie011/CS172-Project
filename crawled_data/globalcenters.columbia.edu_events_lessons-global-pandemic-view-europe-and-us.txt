8:00 PM Online Live virtual event | December 3, 2020 |1pm (New York) | 7pm (Paris) With COVID-19 cases surging again around the world, the Alliance Program, Columbia Global Centers | Paris, and École des Hautes Études en Santé Publique are joining forces to organize a virtual panel on lessons from the pandemic, seen from the perspective of Europe and the US. The discussion will explore what the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed in a time of crisis: What are the latest trends in the coronavirus outbreak in Europe and the US? What can we learn from varied responses and from countries and communities that have managed to mitigate the health and economic impact of the virus? What has contributed to a nationalistic response rather than an inclusive approach that brings together nations in pursuit of global solutions? How does the rest of the world view the European and US responses? EVENT PARTICIPANTS Opening remarks: Safwan M. Masri, Executive Vice President for Global Centers and Global Development, Columbia University Daniel Benamouzig, Professor of sociology, Science Po (Head of "Chaire Santé") and Member of the COVID19 Scientific Council advising President Macron Pascal Crépey, Professor of Public Health, Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Santé Publique Craig Spencer, Director of Global Health in Emergency Medicine at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center Aleksandra Torbica, Director of the Center for Research on Health and Social Care Management at Bocconi University Student perspective: Soraya Limare, PhD Candidate, Department of French and Romance Philology, Columbia University Moderator: Julie Kornfeld, Vice Provost for Academic Programs and Associate Professor of Epidemiology, Columbia University This discussion is the second in a multi-part regional series that will focus on the unique aspects of the pandemic on regions across the globe including Asia, Europe, Latin America, Africa, India and the United States.
