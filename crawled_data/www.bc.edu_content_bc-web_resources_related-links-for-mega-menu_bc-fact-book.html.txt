This does not indicate a gap in the sequence of books. We changed the scheme we use to assign cover dates to the books. Our old cover dating scheme referenced the academic year on which the majority of the statistics were based. We decided to change the cover dates so that they reflect the year during which the Fact Book is published and primarily used. In order to do this we skipped a year in the numbering sequence. 1980s 1988–1989 Fact Book 1987–1988 Fact Book 1986–1987 Fact Book 1985–1986 Fact Book 1984–1985 Fact Book 1983–1984 Fact Book 1982–1983 Fact Book 1980–1981 Fact Book 1981–1982 Fact Book 1979–1980 Fact Book 1970s 1978–1979 Fact Book 1978 Fact Book 1977 Fact Book 1976 Fact Book 1975 Fact Book 1973 Fact Book 1972 Fact Book 1971 Fact Book *Indicates that the PDF of the Fact Book has been updated since its original publication.
