She will be joined by alumni in a broad discussion including China's urbanization. In the meantime, Professor Wu will engage with incoming students of the program to help them prepare their new journey at Columbia. The Columbia University Master of Science in Urban Planning is an accredited two-year program of professional education. Actively engaged in practice, the curriculum connects the study of the urban built environment with grounded analysis of socioeconomic and political conditions. The program explores the tensions between market forces, civil society, and the goals of planning, paying special attention to the role of urban analytics and the quest for social justice. Students learn to evaluate and shape efforts to develop and enhance cities and their communities in ways that foster healthy and sustainable living. In the Ph.D. in Urban Planning program, students are immersed in the theoretical and methodological tools of the social sciences in order to contribute to the advancement of knowledge in the field of planning. The program consists of two years of coursework, qualifying examinations in history and theory of planning, as well as in a substantive area (called the sector), and the writing and defense of a dissertation proposal followed by the dissertation and its defense. Speakers Professor Weiping Wu Trained in architecture and urban planning, Professor Weiping Wu is an internationally acclaimed planning scholar working on global urbanization with expertise in the issues of migration, housing, and infrastructure of Chinese cities. Her published work has gained an increasing public presence, particularly her recent book The Chinese City. It offers a critical understanding of China’s urbanization, exploring how the complexity of Chinese cities both conforms to and defies conventional urban theories as well as the experiences of cities elsewhere around the world. She is the President of the Association of Collegiate Schools of Planning and a member of the International Advisory Board for the Urban China Research Network, as well as serving on the editorial board of four journals. In addition, she has provided consultation to the Ford Foundation, Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, and World Bank.
