The goal of the Tinker Visiting Professor program is to bring to the campus pre-eminent scholars and professionals (journalists, writers, artists, public officials, etc.) who are citizens of Latin America or the Iberian Peninsula, and reside in the region, as a means of encouraging contact and collaboration. Please note that citizens of Canada may apply as long as they are considered Latin Americanists. Since the inception of the Tinker program in 1971, Columbia has hosted many distinguished visitors for one-semester periods of residence. These guests have strengthened our curriculum offerings on Latin America, complemented departmental strengths, and contributed to understanding of Latin American issues. A Tinker Visiting Professor offers to teach (or co-teach) one course - a mixed graduate/undergraduate class in his/her field of expertise. The visitor is asked to also give two public lectures. The Tinker Professor will be supported by a stipend, office space at the Institute of Latin American Studies, assistance in arranging Columbia housing, roundtrip airfare from home country, and part-time research assistance. Funding can also be made available to support conferences or other events at the University related to the visitor’s fields of interest during or following their semester of residence. The Institute of Latin American Studies (ILAS) administers the Tinker Professor Program on behalf of Columbia University. For more information, contact Esteban Andrade ([email protected]). APPLICATION PROCESS Applicants are invited to submit a brief statement of interest. The statement should explain the qualifications of the candidate, his or her research concentration and the specific goals of the visit to Columbia University (1-2 pages in total), as well as a current and summarized curriculum vita. The Executive Committee of the Institute of Latin American Studies will review these proposals by May 1 and invite a limited number of candidates to submit a full application. This application will include a personal statement describing their research and proposed teaching areas, with the description of one course, a complete vita and the names of two references.
