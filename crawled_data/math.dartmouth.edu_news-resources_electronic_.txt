Combinatorics Through Guided Discovery An introduction to combinatorial mathematics by Kenneth P. Bogart. Before his death in 2005, Ken Bogart was in the final stages of completing an NSF-sponsored project about the teaching of combinatorics through Guided Discovery. The textbook which grew out of this project is available via the link above. The Financial Literacy Initiative at Dartmouth College The Financial Literacy Initiative at Dartmouth College advocates a quantitative approach to financial literacy for college students, K-12 students, future teachers and adult learners. The initiative supports this approach through contextually rich curriculum modules for classroom use, short video presentations for faculty development or classroom discussion, and case studies. All materials are freely available through online publication. Links to these are found on the site. Mathematics and Quantitative Education at Dartmouth The Center for Mathematics and Quantitative Education supports the teaching and learning of quantitative subjects across a variety of contexts. Collaborating with national and international projects, the Center provides resources that address a range of pedagogical concerns. Music and Computers An introduction to music and computers for upper division secondary and college students. Introduction to Probability A text designed for an introductory probability course taken by sophomores, juniors, and seniors in mathematics, the physical and social sciences, engineering, and computer science, by Charles M. Grinstead and J. Laurie Snell. Calcsite A textbook, case studies, practice problems and more that provide an introduction to calculus--its methods, techniques, and modeling capabilities. By C. Dwight Lahr. Open Calculus Open Calculus is an exportable distance-learning/self-study environment for learning calculus. Embodied in this open source project is a calculus text, online homework problems, videotapes of worked examples, and more, which have been organized and linked together in a flexible fashion. Chance This is perhaps one of the oldest, and most complete educational resources on the web. It is supported by NSF and based at Dartmouth. Laurie Snell is the main person for its existence and continued excellence. It provides up-to-date resources of chance-related topics, including the Chance News, a searchable Chance database, and various versions of the Chance course taught at different colleges and universities. It's a perfect resource for an introductory statistics class, or something similar. Mathematics Across the Curriculum This is a five-year project based at Dartmouth, funded by the NSF which involves almost all academic departments at Dartmouth College. The main purpose of the project is to develop modules for interdisciplinary courses where mathematics is a tool. There are already a number of courses offered under this project. WeBWorK This is an implementation of the University of Rochester's WeBWorK, which allows each student to get their own unique set of homework problems and receive immediate feedback on the correctness of answers via a web interface. The above link is to the courses where WeBWorK has been implemented. Last modified on March 03, 2021 Powered by GNU / Linux Mathematics at Dartmouth 27 N.
