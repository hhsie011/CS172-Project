On This Page At its heart is Kroon Hall, the most energy-efficient building on campus. With its high barrel-vaulted gable ends, simple lines and curved rooftop, Kroon is a modernish blend of cathedral nave and Connecticut barn. Half of its red oak paneling came from Yale-Myers Forest in northeastern Connecticut and its two courtyards are home to 25 native species. Nearby are Sage Hall, the Kline Biology Tower, Greeley Memorial Lab, Osborn Memorial Laboratories, the Sloan Physics Laboratory, and Marsh Hall, located in Marsh Botanical Garden, which houses facilities for research and instruction in silviculture, natural resources, forest policy, and biometry. Originally the residence of Professor Othniel C. Marsh, a Yale graduate in 1860 and distinguished paleontologist and Western explorer. Marsh Hall was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965. YSE’s campus also includes Yale Forests, which comprise 10,852 acres of forestland in Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Vermont.
