Students, faculty and staff can purchase one automobile and one motorcycle/moped permit per year. Instead of a window sticker, parking permits are registered to a vehicle license plate. Faculty and staff can register two license plates if they own more than one car, but only one vehicle can be parked on campus at a time. Students may only have one vehicle registered on their account. Annual permits are valid August 1-July 31. Ownership and use of parking permits are not transferable to any other person, and permits are not to be resold. Review the Permit section of the KU Parking Rules & Regulations.
