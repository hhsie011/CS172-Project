The goal of the Master's in Clinical and Translational Research Program is to train clinicians and basic scientists to extend basic scientific research into the clinical arena, ultimately leading to improvements in individual and population health. By translating basic research into improved clinical outcomes, researchers and clinicians are able to provide new treatments to patients more efficiently and quickly. Students in the Master of Science in Clinical and Translational Research program complete nine courses, including research methods, advanced research methods, scientific writing, biostatistics and applied data analysis, two electives, and a series of seminars, workshops, and mentoring sessions. Given the applied nature of the program, students work closely with advisors to develop a portfolio composed of a grant proposal, first author abstract submitted to a regional, national, or international conference, and first author research manuscript. Core Courses Students are required to successfully complete nine credit-bearing courses, attend mandatory seminar sessions throughout the program, and complete a thesis. Students are also required to complete the online, not for credit course, Public Health 1001. In addition to the Master’s in CTR core course requirements and the online course, students will choose two electives, and work with their academic advisor to design an educational plan that reflects their interests and career goals. Students are required to develop an academic portfolio, in which they should explore a topic of interest in clinical and translational research. Full-time students generally take 4.5 courses per year over two years. Coursework done for credit as a non-degree student may be counted toward the Masters in CTR degree with the approval of the CTR Masters Program Director. Master's in CTR Core Requirements Students in the Masters in Clinical and Translational Research program are required to complete the following core course requirements: Students must take one of the following two courses: Introduction to Methods in Epidemiologic Research (PHP2120) Foundations in Epidemiologic Research Methods (PHP 2150) Biostatistics and Applied Data Analysis Students must complete a year-long, two-course sequence in biostatistics/applied data analysis; this requirement can be fulfilled by taking one of two different course sequences:: Biostatistics and Data Analysis I (PHP 2507) Biostatistics and Data Analysis II (PHP 2508) Or: Principles of Biostatistics and Data Analysis (PHP 2510) Applied Regression Analysis (PHP 2511) Advanced Research Methods Students must take two of the following advanced methods courses: Statistical Programming in R (PHP 1560/2560) Clinical Trials Methodology (PHP 2030) Survey Research Methods (PHP 2040) Qualitative Methods in Health Research (PHP 2060) Interpretation and Application of Epidemiology (PHP 2180) Intermediate Methods in Epidemiologic Research (PHP 2200) Medicare: A Data-Based Policy Examination (PHP 2410E) Introduction to Evidence-Based Medicine (PHP 2415) Introduction to Health Decision Analysis (PHP 2465A) Methods in Informatics and Data Science for Health (PHP2561/BIOL1555) Scientific Writing Research Grant Writing for Public Health (PHP 2090) Topics in Clinical, Translational and Health Services Research Students must enroll in this half-credit course two times to fulfill the one-credit requirement: Topics in Clinical, Translational and Health Services Research (PHP 2470) (half credit) Electives Students are expected to work closely with their academic advisor to determine the most appropriate electives for their individual educational plan and career goals. The following electives may be of interest for students in the M.S. in Clinical and Translational Research. All of these electives must be approved by each student’s academic advisor to ensure that the elective is appropriate for the individual student. • PHP 1100 - Comparative Health Care Systems • PHP 2019 - Measurement Issues in Health Care • PHP 2060 - Qualitative Methods in Health Research • PHP 2180 - Interpretation and Application of Epidemiology • PHP 2200 -Intermediate Methods in Epidemiologic Research • PHP 2220B - Nutritional Epidemiology • PHP 2340 - Behavioral and Social Science Theory for Health Promotion • PHP 2400 -The US Health Care System • PHP 2440 - Pharmacoepidemiology • PHP 2450 - Measuring and Improving the Quality of Health Care • PHP2465A - Intro to Health Decision Analysis • PHP2561/BIOL1555 - Informatics and Data Science for Health • PHP 2980 - Graduate Independent Study and Thesis Research • ENGN 2910G - Topics in Translational Research and Technology Thesis Given the applied nature of the ScM Program, students will develop a portfolio to meet the following thesis requirements. These requirements are developmental in nature and should be completed throughout the student’s studies. Students will be encouraged to engage in interdisciplinary work. The thesis requirements will help to move students forward in their career in clinical and translational research. Each student should work with his/her advisor and reader to determine the best timing for completion of the following requirements. All thesis plans must be approved prior to beginning the project. All ScM students are required to complete a thesis, which will be composed of the following parts: First author submitted abstract to regional, national or international meeting First author publishable quality paper Submittable grant proposal OR First author submitted abstract to regional, national or international meeting Two First author publishable quality papers Certificate Program People 2021-2022 Student Handbook Admissions Tuition & Funding Clinical and Translational Research Clinical and Translational Research Brown University Box G-S121-4 Providence, RI 02912 Email [email protected] Brown University Giving to Brown 121 South Main Street, Providence, Rhode Island 02903, USA 401-863-3375 Contact Us Newsletter Maps Directions Career Opportunities Campus Safety Accessibility Brown Social Media © 2022 Brown University | Back to top
