About Leadership Character Development History Awards Traditions Educational Innovation More Virtual Tour Radio Parents Graduates Visitors Prep School Graduation Newsletter Apply Today Awards Institutional Awards Institutional Awards recognize individuals or groups who set themselves apart through outstanding contributions in military operations or philanthropy. These graduates and members of the United States Air Force Academy family show amazing dedication to their craft and to the Academy as an institution. Each award recognizes a unique aspect of service, integrity and excellence: Distinguished Service Award The United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) established the Air Force Academy Distinguished Service Award (DSA) in February 1999. Each year, the USAFA DSA is presented by the Superintendent to a military person, civilian, or group, whose contributions have had a distinct impact on the morale or well-being of the Air Force Academy. Any individual or group who has contributed significantly and directly to the morale or well-being of the Academy through the generous donation of time, resources, or influence is eligible. Selection Criteria Award selection is based on an individual’s or group’s accomplishments, which can be described as having had a long-term, positive effect on the morale or well-being of the Academy. Former military and civilian employees are eligible upon termination of employment from the Air Force Academy. However, the USAFA DSA is intended to recognize those individuals who contribute not as part of their official duty but through their personal generosity and dedication to the institution. Personnel currently assigned to the Academy can be considered for the award so long as their contributions were performed outside of their official duties.
