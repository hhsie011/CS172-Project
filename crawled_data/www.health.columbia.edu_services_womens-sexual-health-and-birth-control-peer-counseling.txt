Both projects operate out of the same office, and all advocates are cross-trained to provide clients with the benefit of accessing the services of both projects in one session. The Women’s Health Advocacy Project welcomes everyone at Columbia, regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation. Women’s Health Advocacy advocates are available during drop-in hours to listen, offer support, and connect students to additional resources. No appointment is necessary. Students come to discuss: Birth control options Emergency contraception (“morning after pill”) Pregnancy testing Abortion Gynecologic health Sexually transmitted infections Anatomy and physiology (menstrual cycle, conception) Pleasure and communication Gay Health Advocacy Project services, including HIV testing and treatment Anything else on students’ minds Our advocates are undergraduate, graduate, and professional school students at Columbia who undergo an intensive training and are supervised regularly by professional staff. Advocates are HIPAA-certified and required to uphold the strictest levels of confidentiality. In the rare case that a student recognizes an advocate, a different advocate will be made available.
