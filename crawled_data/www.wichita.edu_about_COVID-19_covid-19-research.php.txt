Wichita State University COVID-19 Research Bringing the power of research to bear Wichita State University researchers from multiple disciplines are hard at work addressing the COVID-19 outbreak. Here's an ongoing look at COVID-19 research efforts underway. Fairmount College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Institute for Interdisciplinary Innovation College of Applied Studies College of Health Professions College of Engineering Center for Economic Development and Business Research Fairmount College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Antiviral Drug Research Bill Groutas, WSU Foundation Distinguished Professor of Chemistry (email • faculty page) Groutas, along with K-State researchers Yungeong Kim and Kyeong-Ok Chang and Stanley Perlman at the University of Iowa, have been working to develop antiviral drugs to treat Middle East Respiratory Syndrome caused by MERS-CoV. That work extends to other human viruses that are similar to COVID-19. Their study was published in the Aug. 3 issue of the prestigious medical journal Science Translational Medicine. WSU News article Wichita State chemist identifies potential COVID-19 treatment August 5, 2020 Dr. Bill Groutas, Wichita State University medical chemist, is part of a team that has published a study showing a possible therapeutic treatment for COVID-19. Pathogenic coronaviruses are a major threat to global public health, as shown by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or SARS-CoV; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, known as MERS-CoV; and the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 infection. Groutas — along with Kansas State University virologists Yunjeong Kim and Kyeong-Ok "KC" Chang — published the study — titled “3C-like protease inhibitors block SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro and increase survival in MERS-CoV-infected mice”— which appears in the Aug. 3 issue of the prestigious medical journal Science Translational Medicine. It reveals how small molecule protease inhibitors show potency against human coronaviruses. These coronavirus 3C-like proteases, known as 3CLpro, are strong therapeutic targets because they play vital roles in coronavirus replication. "Vaccine developments and treatments are the biggest targets in COVID-19 research, and treatment is really key," said Chang, professor of diagnostic medicine and pathobiology. "This paper describes a protease inhibitor targeted by a viral protease, which is a well-known therapeutic target." Chang and Kim have been using National Institutes of Health grants to develop antiviral drugs to treat MERS and human norovirus infections. Their work extends to other human viruses, such as rhinoviruses and SARS-CoV-2. The study demonstrates that this series of optimized coronavirus 3CLpro inhibitors blocked replication of the human coronaviruses MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in cultured cells and in a mouse model for MERS. These findings suggest that this series of compounds should be investigated further as a potential therapeutic for human coronavirus infection. Co-collaborators on the research include teams lead by Bill Groutas at Wichita State University and Stanley Perlman at the University of Iowa, and Scott Lovell at the University of Kansas. "Drs. Groutas, Perlman and Lovell brought decades of experience to our research team," Chang said. "We would not have been able to come this far without important collaborations with our colleagues at other institutions." “Our studies have demonstrated proof-of-concept, and we are excited about our partnership with CoCrystal Pharma to explore the development of this series of compounds as COVID-19 therapeutics,” Groutas said. The new compounds in the publication are exclusively licensed and being developed Cocrystal Pharma for COVID-19. Wichita State University medical chemist Bill Groutas is working with peers on a possible treatment for COVID-19. Time-series Map of the spread of COVID-19 in Kansas Zelalem Demissie, Assistant Professor, Geology (email • faculty page) Zelalem Demissie and his geology students have created a dashboard of data visualizations that chart the spread of COVID-19 in the state of Kansas. Unique among maps of this type, Demissie's dashboard includes a time-series map animation. The dashboard provides information about the spread but also allows any WSU-related department to add charts of different kinds. Zelalem’s students are working on a full story map that would accompany the dashboard with video and other resources.

Protein and Lipid study Alexandre Shvartsburg, Professor, Chemistry (email) Shvartsburg is developing mass spectrometer techniques to characterize proteins and lipids that are broadly useful for the microbiology and virology studies relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic. Antiviral compound research Dennis Burns, Professor, Chemistry (email) Burns is involved with developing compounds that may have broad antiviral properties, possibly including treatment of COVID-19. History of Pandemics George Dehner, Associate Professor, History (email) Dehner is folding the events surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic into his ongoing study of the history of influenza and pandemics. See more Wichita State historian compares COVID-19 with past pandemics April 30, 2020 George Dehner might take exception to those who say the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented. “This pattern of the appearance of a novel infection that spreads pandemics is as old as a human story. Once we began to settle in the towns and be connected to larger groups of populations that can sustain this sort of rapid infection element like a virus or some other thing, you have pandemics,” said Dehner, associate professor of history at Wichita State University. Nor would Dehner say that the pandemic was entirely unexpected. “COVID-19 itself was not predicted, but something like COVID-19 has been predicted for 25 years. COVID-19 is not a surprise to people who have been doing this sort of modeling” he said. “You can't pick which one it will be, but the fact that some sort of animal disease leapt into the human population and spread globally would not come as a surprise to anybody who does that sort of research.” Dehner, a world environmental historian who examines the intersection of humans and disease in the modern era, presented “Influenza pandemics since Russian Flu: Do they provide insight to COVID-19?” on April 22 as part of a Fairmount College of Liberal Arts and Sciences series, Perspectives on the Pandemic. See the Perspectives on the Pandemic During his presentation, Dehner focused on the Russian flu of 1889, Spanish flu of 1918, Asian flu of 1957, Hong Kong flu in 1968, and the H1N1 virus of 2009 as compared to today’s COVID-19. He spoke about the role of transportation and centralized federal responses. Lessons from Spanish flu “Spanish flu is probably the best one to compare because COVID-19 and Spanish flu share some similar attributes.” However, he cautions that “all of this discussion with COVID-19 has to be taken with a grain of salt because a lot of the information is still coming in.” During the discussion, Dehner shows graphs of the social distancing responses employed by particular cities during the 1918 pandemic. “Spanish flu has been used as an example for examining what we call social distancing. You have an example of a successful early case in St. Louis,” Dehner said. “You can also see in St. Louis that while they flatten the curve on the front half, they remove those restrictions, and then we had a second peak. Here’s when social distancing worked, and here's what happened when you removed it.” Though the terms social distancing, social bubbles and the 6-foot rule have become ubiquitous in our daily conversations, there’s historical precedence to their efficacy. “What we're doing at the moment in terms of social distancing — because it's really the tool we have at hand that's most effective — that's certainly based upon the experience of events before. We also have lessons that exist in the past, particularly Spanish flu, when social distancing ends. There’s an enormous amount of pressure for ending social distancing because of the economic impacts, but that's also comparable to Spanish flu that was the same issue,” Dehner said. Knowledge is power But there are also key differences between COVID-19 and the Spanish flu of 1918. “Number one, they’re completely different organisms, so we have to be cautious about saying ‘Let's plug in COVID-19 for Spanish flu,’ because they are completely different organisms,” Dehner said. “We have differences today where we know a lot more about COVID-19 than they ever knew about Spanish flu in 1918. With that is the possibility of creating either medical intervention treatments that will be effective and ultimately a vaccine. These are things that exist today that are different that didn't exist for Spanish flu. In Spanish flu, they didn't really understand that it was a virus. They were looking for a bacterial cause.” Historical perspective on the pandemic Dehner said that the mortality rate for COVID-19 is settling in at about 1%, which means that 99% of people recover from it. However, because it’s so infectious, Dehner said, there are a lot of people who are going to contract it. “This is something that in a couple of years, we will probably have a protective vaccine, and we’ll be much better able to handle it,” he said. “I don't have the same fear that I would have or something that has a 2.5% mortality rate like Spanish flu does or when you start talking about SARS, which had somewhere around 17%, or you look at MERS that had about a 30% rate. You look at avian becoming human transmissible, you were looking at 40 to 50% mortality based upon a very small number of cases because you're only seeing people in the hospital. Those numbers I found much more frightening, but I don't want to a soft petal COVID-19 because 1% is still a very high mortality rate.” As a historian, Dehner sees almost an instructional manual on how to deal with pandemic crises. “We have a record of dealing with pandemics. Understanding how we have responded in the past, both at the local level in terms of the university and the town but also at the federal level, one thing I think future historians are going to look at very minutely is why our particular response during this time has taken the path it has,” he said. “It hasn't followed what had been templates before. As a historian, I would like to argue that understanding the impact of pandemics in the past is something that we can usefully consider as we examine what to do today.” Method of predicting COVID-19 cases in limited-testing areas Adam Jaeger, Assistant Professor, Math and Statistics (email) Jaeger is working with models that incorporate both spatial and temporal correlation simultaneously and rely less on distributional assumptions. The goal is to reduce error caused by incorrect specification of generating process and allow for known information from surrounding counties and previous numbers of reported cases to better predict future outcomes and better estimate numbers for area where testing is extremely limited.
