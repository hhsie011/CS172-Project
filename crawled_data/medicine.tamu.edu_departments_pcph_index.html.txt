The Department of Primary Care and Population Health is committed to full-scope family medicine and community care. Through our keen focus on rural populations and innovative care delivery, we’re eliminating health disparities throughout Texas and bringing health care where it’s needed most. We utilize our own clinical sites and a select group of clinical affiliates to provide excellent educational settings for our faculty, students and residents for a community-based approach to preventive health care. Our faculty consists of academic clinicians whose areas of practice focus on behavioral health, family medicine, geriatrics, gynecology, internal medicine, obstetrics, palliative care, sports medicine, and who care for patients while also teaching medical students, residents, and fellows in training. Our faculty works closely with CHI St. Joseph Health, strengthening a partnership to establish a co-branded primary care network focused on improving access to healthcare for the Brazos Valley community while also training future clinicians. Our affiliates help us provide excellent experiences for students and allow them to practice the Aggie core values and also expose students to a wide range of patient populations and leading faculty practitioners. We offer a wide variety of clinical services such as pregnancy and delivery, dermatologic surgery, fracture care, Osteopathic therapy, vasectomy, physical exams, endoscopy, imaging and lab services, steroid injections, and more. The Texas A&M Physicians has locations in Bryan and Navasota and co-sponsor clinical teachings for other rural areas like Victoria. VISION Our vision is to develop the innovators and leaders in medicine who will transform American medicine in the 21st century. VALUES Loyalty, Integrity, Excellence, Leadership, Respect, and Selfless Service MISSION Our mission is to conduct comprehensive family medicine training, preparing physicians for rural practices with an emphasis on complete care by providing compassionate, high-quality patient care through the service of our local communities. PURPOSE To Promote the focus of the Texas A&M College of Medicine by improving the health and well-being of Texans through excellence in education, research, and health care delivery.
