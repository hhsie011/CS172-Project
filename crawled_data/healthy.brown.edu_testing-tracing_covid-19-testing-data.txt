From Aug. 24, 2020, through Friday, Jan. 14, 2022, Brown maintained a routine asymptomatic testing program using PCR tests. With respect for individual privacy, the dashboard reports aggregate data for that period. In January 2022, Brown began a transition away from widespread asymptomatic PCR to self-administered rapid antigen testing, which answer the most important question in the Omicron variant era: “Am I infectious now?” After the final day of PCR testing Friday, Jan. 14, 2022, the dashboard below will no longer be updated. Because of the decreased efficacy of the dashboard as a measure of COVID-19 prevalence on campus with shifts in testing and infections, Brown will instead collect information on self-reported positive test results, and will share that and other campus public health conditions information through weekly messages to the community. Each of these messages will be posted below, under the heading “Campus COVID-19 Testing Updates.” Routine Asymptomatic Test Results: 08/24/20 through 01/14/22 *The data in the dashboard is based on processed test results at any given time, and thus daily numbers may change. Campus Vaccination Rate Brown is tracking and reporting vaccination rates for students, faculty and staff to ensure community health before transitioning to more in-person operations. Campus COVID-19 Testing Updates From September 2020 through October 2021, weekly messages to the Brown community provided additional information and context on the results of Brown’s testing program for COVID-19, as a complement to the data shared via the dashboard above. The University paused these updates in November 2022 given low positivity and high vaccination rates on campus. Given the impact of the Omicron variant and shifts in testing strategy on campus, Brown will resume weekly updates in January 2022. Future updates will be added as they are sent.
