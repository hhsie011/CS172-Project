Council members are appointed by the President for the purpose of providing the President with advice on contemporary issues, challenges, and opportunities facing America’s colleges and universities. The Council provides an opportunity for its members and the President to address these matters in a frank, confidential, and collegial format. Input from Council members is especially important in providing the President with an off-campus perspective of Dallas and other communities as well as perceptions about SMU held by constituencies and individuals important to the future of SMU. 2021-22 21st Century Council Directory Christopher Crum, Chair Council Members Rob Bennett Senior Managing Director Thackeray Fund Series Michael Boone Managing Partner WestFront Capital Group Wood Brookshire CEO Vendera Resources Courtney Caldwell Cofounder & CEO ShearShare Brad E.
