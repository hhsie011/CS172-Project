Click for the 2021-22 Season Events! Overview At Perkins School of Theology, the gifts and fruits and labor of theological study and teaching are available not only to those enrolled in regular courses but also to others throughout the church and wider community. Public Programs Each year more than 1,500 persons benefit from Perkins’ public programs such as Perkins Fall Convocation, which offers lectures and workshops to practicing church professionals; Perkins Summit for Faith and Learning (formerly Perkins Theological School for the Laity), which brings together seminary professors who are leaders in their fields with committed laity to study Bible and theology; and Perkins School of Youth Ministry, which brings comprehensive training to youth leaders. Centers Perkins houses several centers for theological research and education in service to the church, including the Center for Preaching Excellence, the Center for Religious Leadership, and Bridwell Library's Center for Methodist Studies. In response to Perkins' geographical and cultural setting in the southwestern United States, the Hispanic/Latin@ Ministries Program, the Center for the Study of Latino/a Christianity and Religions, and the Curso de Estudio provide educational services for Hispanic ministries. Certificate Programs The Certificate in Practical Ministry is a continuing education track designed for non-credit students looking for specialized training in relevant, applicable, practical knowledge that informs and empowers their life-long spiritual journey and ministry. This program consists of five, two-hour graduate-level courses that will equip students for specialized practical ministry in their church or community context. Courses will be held during January and May Terms.
