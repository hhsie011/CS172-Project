He spent two years at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory as an Alvin M. Weinberg Distinguished Fellow in the Computational Sciences and Engineering Division before joining the Fluids and Thermal Sciences Group in the School of Engineering at Brown University in 2019. Jesse's research interests are at the intersection of applied mathematics, high-performance computing, and coupled fluid/particle/solute transport phenomena. His recent research has emphasized the manipulation of such coupled transport dynamics to manipulate suspended colloidal particles and biomaterials.

Full Text PubMed Research Research Overview Jesse's research spans classical fluid dynamics theory and experimental microfluidics involving multi-physics heat and mass transfer, with an emphasis on numerical simulations. The applications of his research range from the measurement and manipulation of particles and biomaterials for applications such as separations, detection, sorting, and filtration, to classical fluid dynamics theory for flow in bends and branching junctions. Some other projects that Jesse has studied include modeling and predicting biophysical flow conditions, designing novel devices for measuring the electrokinetic potentials of particles and surfaces, and engineering new systems for efficient evaporative cooling and/or water purification.
