Register today! 1. Complete the Application Complete and submit the Common Application. Upon submitting, you will be asked to pay a $70 nonrefundable application fee. Be sure you use the same email address for every part of the application process. If applying for Fall 2022, Spring 2023, or Fall 2023 with fewer than 30 postsecondary college credits, you will be required to submit a supplemental essay of 250 words or less in response to the following prompt. The University of Miami's official mascot is the ibis. Folklore maintains that the native marsh bird is the last to take shelter before a hurricane hits and the first to emerge once the storm passes, making it an apt symbol of courage and resilience. Considering your ability to control your own motivation and behavior, how have past experiences helped build your courage and resilience to persist in the face of academic and life challenges so that, once these storms pass, you can emerge in continued pursuit of your goals? In addition, you will be asked to respond to a prompt in the Common Application addressing your reasons for transferring to the University, using 650 words or less. This essay portion of the application gives you the opportunity to demonstrate your ability to develop your thoughts, to communicate them clearly, and to write them concisely conveying your unique voice. We also ask that you list your involvement in extracurricular activities, outside of school involvements and/or commitments; these will be evaluated as another factor in the admission process.
