Visit HILS for additional application instructions. The Biological Sciences in Dental Medicine program offers advanced study in the molecular, supramolecular, cellular, and supracellular processes that provide the intellectual basis for dental medicine. The program trains research scientists in neurobiology, bone biology, tooth development, stem cell biology, oral microbiology, autoimmunity, genetics related to craniofacial development, tumor biology, pain research, inflammation, and developmental biology. BSDM students work with faculty from the Department of Developmental Biology and other departments at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine (HSDM) as well as with faculty from basic science departments at Harvard Medical School in Boston and from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences in Cambridge. The flexible, individualized program of courses offered is ideal in light of the multi- and interdisciplinary training goal of the program. Students are required to take courses that are also taken by PhD students from other students in HILS and by dental specialty residents who are doing research in fulfillment of requirements for MMSc and DMSc degrees, which increases contacts and exchange of information among students working in a broad range of research areas. Students in the BSDM program are enrolled in and receive a PhD from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, even though they may work primarily with HSDM faculty. Admissions Requirements Applicants should be interested in pursuing a career in basic or patient-oriented science in the areas of skeletal biology, cell/developmental biology, immunology, or microbiology leading to a PhD degree. Eligible applicants will be individuals with a doctoral degree in dentistry (DMD, DDS), a medical doctoral degree (MD), or a student already accepted into the DMD program at HSDM. Applicants for admission should have an undergraduate record of introductory courses in calculus, physics, biology, and chemistry, both physical and organic, and significant laboratory research experience. Strong consideration is given to letters of recommendation, particularly from individuals who have firsthand knowledge of the applicant’s research experience. The GRE General Test and the GRE subject test, in the subject of your choice, are optional. Applicants whose native language is not English and who have not received an undergraduate degree from an English language institution must score at least 100 on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or at least 7.5 on the International English Language Testing System (IELTS). The BSDM Admissions Committee bases decisions regarding admission on a balanced discussion of undergraduate performance/GPA, GRE scores, professional school transcripts (if applicable), TOEFL or IELTS scores, letters of recommendation and essay/career goals. Additional information about admissions requirements are available from the Biological Sciences in Dental Medicine Program and GSAS Policies details program requirements.
