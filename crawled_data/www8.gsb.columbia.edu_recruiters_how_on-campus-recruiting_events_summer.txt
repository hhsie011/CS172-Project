Why Recruit Columbia Talent? Employment Reports Contact Us Your company may offer a reception during the summer at an off-campus location for any students who will participate in full-time recruiting in the following fall. At the School, we have roughly 220 students who enter in January ("J-Term"). These students take classes during the summer term and do not hold summer internships before participating in full-time recruiting. You can host summer presentations or events, on- or off-campus, specifically for them. It’s a great way to get to know this exciting group. All summer recruiting events for January-entry students should be coordinated through the CMC. Student clubs should not plan recruiting presentations during the summer. Your account manager or [email protected] to plan or promote a summer reception or plan a summer event for January entrants. Sidebar Content Post a Job Log Into COIN Make a Gift Have a Question?
