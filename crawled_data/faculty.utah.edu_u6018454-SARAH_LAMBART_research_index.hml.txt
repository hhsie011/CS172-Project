I use experimental devices such as piston cylinder and one atmosphere furncaces for simulating high pressure-temperature conditions relevant for planetary interiors and various analytical techniques (EMPA, SEM, LA-ICP-MS, FTIR, TIMS) to characterize synthesized and natural samples. Because one limiting aspect of solid-media apparatus is that all experiments are performed in closed-systems, I also use innovative experimental strategies to investigate new topics: simulation of magma circulation, magma-rock interaction or melt segregation, and I use thermodynamic modelling to extrapolate my data and/or as support for semi-empirical models.

Open positions For future prospective graduate students: I hope to hear from prospective masters or doctoral students who have strong academic records, research experience and are interested in pursuing experimental petrology or geochemistry/modeling research. Please contact me (email is a good way!) to tell me about your background and what types of projects would interest you for research. That way, I can also update you about the upcoming year funding status for graduate students in my lab (i.e., RA-ship, fellowship, TA-ship). You should then apply directly to the degree program at university of Utah. More information about graduate applications can be found here :https://www.earth.utah.edu/future-students/future_graduate.php. Undergraduate Research Opportunities: Students interested in proposing new UROP projects should contact me not later than three months before the deadline.
