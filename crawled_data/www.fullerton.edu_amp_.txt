Skip Navigation California State University, Fullerton Site Menu Division of Academic Affairs Academic Master Plan Main Navigation AMP & Drafts Progress Reports News Archive Committees DOCUMENTS Resources FAQ Academic Master Plan Adopted in December 2016 after an 18-month, campus-wide effort, Cal State Fullerton’s first-ever Academic Master Plan (AMP) provides overarching guidelines to help us answer questions, allocate budgets and resources, and keep the University on track to achieve its long-term academic vision. The document serves as a framework for ongoing conversation about the University’s direction, including our programs, degrees and desired outcomes; student success; faculty support; infrastructure and resources. Most important, the AMP clarifies our core values and provides guiding principles for our University’s decision-making bodies as we rise to meet the challenges that will continue to face higher education in the years to come. We invite you to explore the materials on this site, including information about the development of the AMP, as well as documentation of the meetings held and work accomplished by the AMP Steering Committee and subcommittees.
