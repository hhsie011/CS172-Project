We prepare undergraduate students for careers in the private sector, broadcasting, government service, and for continued study in graduate school. We train graduate students and young scientists to be leaders in the atmospheric sciences and related fields. Through our distinct strengths in climate dynamics, tropical meteorology, and cloud and aerosol processes, we strive to achieve excellence in research and education that will better inform the public and policy makers on how to prepare for hazards and changes in the weather-climate system.
