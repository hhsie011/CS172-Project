Brock News Events Yale Engineering Magazine Dean, Yale School of Engineering & Applied Science Dean of Science, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Zhao and Ji Professor of Mathematics Jeffrey F. Brock is the Dean of the School of Engineering & Applied Science, FAS Dean of Science, and Zhao and Ji Professor of Mathematics at Yale University. His research focuses on low dimensional geometry and topology, particularly hyperbolic geometry. His work on William Thurston’s program to understand hyperbolic 3-manifolds led to their geometric classification in joint work with R. Canary and Y. Minsky. More recently, he has worked to advance geometric and topological methods in analysis of large, complex data sets. He was an undergraduate at Yale, and obtained his PhD at UC Berkeley, after which he held positions at Stanford University and the University of Chicago, before moving to the Brown University Math Department, which he chaired from 2013 to 2017. In 2016 he served as founding director of Brown’s Data Science Initiative. He moved to Yale in 2018, where he is now Professor of Mathematics and the inaugural Dean of Science. He was appointed Dean of the School of Engineering & Applied Science in August 2019. He was a Guggenheim Fellow in 2008 and was recently elected Fellow of the American Mathematical Society.
