Solving Complex Problems Data science harnesses advanced algorithms for analyzing massive troves of information to derive breakthrough insights. New computational tools are crucial to solving problems in biology, the environment, materials science, communications, security, social sciences and many other areas. “Data science is really transforming everything that we do. That’s possible by bringing together foundational work in methods for extracting wisdom out of data and also having a sensibility to understand the societal implications of the work that we’re doing.” — Jen Rexford ’91, Gordon Y.S.
