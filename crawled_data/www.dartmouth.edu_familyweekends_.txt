As you may remember, there was a special Fall 2021 Family Weekend for the '23s and '24s. While there is no formal weekend planned for summer, we certainly hope you find the chance to come to campus, spend time with your student, and explore all the Upper Valley has to offer. Visit this list of things to do at and around Dartmouth in the summer to help get you started. For families and supporters of the Class of 2026, please check back in the late Spring when we will announce the dates for our next family weekend. Family Weekends are organized by students in partnership with the Collis Center for Student Involvement and with support from Family Giving and Engagement. Please use the contact information on the left if you have any questions, comments or concerns. Contact Us Top of page | Privacy | Copyright Â© 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College Last Updated: 5/3/22
