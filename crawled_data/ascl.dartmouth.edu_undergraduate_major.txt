Students wishing to pursue a Modified Major must submit a proposal to the ASCL Steering Committee that includes: 1) Your list of the courses comprising your modified major. Your list must include: ASCL 1 an ASCL 80-level course (i.e. a culminating experience) a selection of the remaining five ASCL courses that represent an equitable mix of DS (discipline specific) and IITD (interdisciplinary, interregional, transnational, and diaspora) courses four courses from the modifying department or program Include the ORC descriptions of all the courses you plan to use for your modified major 2) A rationale for your modified major. The rationale must demonstrate the intellectual coherence of the courses comprising your major. In other words, the courses you use to modify your major must compliment your ASCL courses. For example, if your ASCL courses focus on China (or East Asia more broadly), then so should the four courses you are using to modify the major. Post-Dartmouth career plans are not an acceptable rationale for the modified major. Students should meet the ASCL Chair to discuss your course selection and rationale before you submit your proposal for review by the ASCL Steering Committee.
