This membership and associated usage fees are separate from Texas A&M University and Transportation Services and in addition to fees charged for parking (visitor and contract). To sign up for a charging station network please download the apps from their respective app stores: LAT Hydra ChargePoint EVgo Level 1 chargers have a typical 110V outlet for users to plug in their 110V cords for their vehicles. Level 2 chargers have SAE J1772 connectors for 240V charging. This connector is found on most mainstream EVs including, but not limited to, the Nissan Leaf, Chevy Volt, Plug-in Prius, and Tesla Model S. Due to the vehicle charge port location, the Tesla Model S requires a station with a 25’ cord. University Center (UCG) and Northside (NSG) Garages contract parking permit holders actively charging their vehicles in their permitted garage are allowed to park in the non-contract parking area to access the EV charging stations. In any garage or surface lot station, when charging is complete, your EV needs to be moved to a parking space in the applicable contract/visitor parking area to allow for other EV owners to use the EV charging station. Faculty and staff that own plug-in EVs and would like to have contract parking in NSG or UCG may submit requests online via the wait list by logging in to My Account. Contract parking permit holders in UCG or NSG with plug-in EVs need to submit the Electric Vehicle Registration Form. If you have questions, please contact Transportation Services at 979-862-PARK.
