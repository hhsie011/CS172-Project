University Assessment The University of Tulsa demonstrates, through its ongoing assessment initiatives, a commitment to educational achievement and improvement of student learning. Institutional level methods focus on student attainment of The University of Tulsa mission. Institutional learning outcomes are measured at the college, program, and course level. The annual program review process is a faculty-driven initiative that measures attainment of program learning objectives for undergraduate, graduate, and professional programs. The Annual Program Assessment Report provides evidence that The University of Tulsa is satisfying its mission using information gained each academic year to evaluate the effectiveness of its academic programs, evolve and improve student learning. The review process also provides faculty with an opportunity to make programmatic and curriculum changes. Graduate program reviews provide mechanisms and a system for TU faculty and administration to assess the alignment of the program with The University of Tulsa’s mission and institutional learning outcomes; to evaluate the effectiveness, progress, and status of TU’s academic programs on a continuing basis; and, through the feedback loop, to continuously improve programs to benefit students. The University of Tulsa graduate academic reviews have four aspects: a comprehensive program review (ten-year cycle), a follow-up review (five years after the comprehensive program review), an annual assessment, and an annual review of student progress. Students are also provided opportunities to give direct feedback to faculty about learning experiences at the course level through end-of-semester course evaluations. Results of these activities are analyzed for trends and evidence of student learning and proficiency. Results are compared to national cohorts. Student confidentiality is maintained by removing identifiers from artifacts prior to analyzing data and presenting results to stakeholders. Collectively, these assessment activities provide faculty with a comprehensive picture of what is working well for students and faculty and areas where opportunities for improvement exist.
