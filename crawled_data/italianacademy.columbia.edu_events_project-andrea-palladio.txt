This one-day conference at Columbia University's Italian Academy, a unique event in America, promises to open important new avenues in Palladian scholarship. The landmark exhibitions of 1975 in London and 1980 in the Veneto brought a dramatic evolution to the nature of scholarship on Andrea Palladio. Thanks to archival research and detailed architectural surveys, studies of the architect from the Veneto have made substantial progress in the last three decades. New methodologies and advances in visual and digital technology have also revealed further aspects of Palladio and his architecture. For the 500th anniversary of Palladio's birth, American and European scholars will present their most recent research on the architect's life, architecture, theory and legacy.
