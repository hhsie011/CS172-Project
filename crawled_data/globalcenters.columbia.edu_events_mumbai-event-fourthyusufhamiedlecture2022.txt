Building upon the WHO statement that, “the promotion and protection of health is of value to all, and essential to peace and security and dependent on the fullest cooperation of individuals and states; unequal promotion of health in different countries is a common danger,” the lecture by Dean Fried will advocate for a framework that must now be combined with the evidence about 21st century threats to population’s health, and the need to invest in public health for our now longer lives. About the Speaker: A world-renowned geriatrician and epidemiologist, Dr. Fried is Dean of Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. Under her leadership, the School has developed new dimensions of public health science, from the University-wide Robert N. Butler Columbia Aging Center to the health impacts of pollution and climate change, and has become a key leader in innovation in public health education. Throughout her career, Dr. Fried has led ongoing innovation toward the goals of healthy longevity and successful societies of longer lives. Named one of the 1% most influential scientific minds of the past decade in 2014 by Thomson Reuters, she is an elected member of the US National Academy of Medicine, and of its executive Council, and past President of the Association of American Physicians. She serves as co-chair of the U.S. National Academy of Medicine’s 2019-2022 Global Commission on a Global Roadmap for Healthy Longevity, an initiative that will make strategic recommendations from the realms of public health, medicine, science, and technology towards these goals. She is the recipient of numerous honors and awards, including the French National INSERM International Prize in Medical Research in 2017, AFAR’s Silver Innovator and Silver Scholar Awards, was named a Living Legend in Medicine by the US Congress, and is to receive the 2022 Kober Medal from the Association of American Physicians.
