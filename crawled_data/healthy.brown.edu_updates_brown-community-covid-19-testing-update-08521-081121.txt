Carey, Executive Vice President for Planning and Policy Tags Undergraduates Grad and Medical Students Faculty and Staff To the Brown Community: COVID-19 Testing Update: 08/5/21 - 08/11/21 Updates Dear Brown Community Members, Below, please find our weekly update on Brown’s testing program for COVID-19, with additional information and context to complement the data shared via our public dashboard: https://healthy.brown.edu/testing-tracing/dashboard This week’s testing results -- 5 asymptomatic positives -- are similar to last week’s -- 4 asymptomatic positives. Vaccination against COVID-19 remains highly effective, including against the Delta variant, and the most important thing we can do for our own health and the health of others is to get vaccinated. If you have not already done so, please upload your vaccination card. Detailed instructions are available on the Verify Your Vaccination page on the Healthy Brown website: https://healthy.brown.edu/vaccinations/verify The percentage of total employees (faculty and staff) who have uploaded their vaccination cards is 95.2% (up from 94.8% last week). The percentage of the total student population is 94.3% (up from 93.8% last week). At Brown, since launching our routine testing program for the fall term on Aug. 24, we have conducted 448,262 asymptomatic tests to date. A total of 12,585 individuals have been tested in that timeframe, and the total number of positive test results is 584 (up 5 this week from a total of 579 last week) -- a prevalence rate of 4.6%. Here are highlights of the testing program over the last seven days, Thursday, Aug. 5, through Wednesday, Aug. 11: -- There have been 5 positive asymptomatic test results: 2 from employees and 3 from students. As a reminder, our student testing program includes undergraduate, graduate and medical students. -- Over the past week, the employee asymptomatic positivity rate was 0.25%, and the student asymptomatic positivity rate was 0.27%. The Rhode Island positivity rate during this same time period was 3.83%. -- The average turnaround time for asymptomatic test results during this period was approximately 15 hours. -- University Health Services (UHS) conducted 31 symptomatic tests of students. Of these, less than 5 were positive for COVID-19. Exact results for symptomatic students who are tested by UHS are not reported (and do not appear on the public dashboard) to protect the confidentiality of the small numbers of students who are tested. We will report on ranges and any concerns regarding trends in these weekly summaries. -- The University does not directly test symptomatic employees, as they receive health care from their individual providers. We do monitor employee absences due to COVID-19 -- which can be for a range of reasons, including care of a child or family member or quarantine due to a known exposure -- and the number of such absences for the most recent full work week was 9. -- It is important to note that with regard to all positive cases, we have taken action consistent with our contact tracing protocols, COVID-19 Campus Safety Policy, isolation and quarantine procedures, and other measures outlined in Brown’s Plan for a Healthy and Safe 2020-21. Please feel free to contact us with any questions or concerns. For questions or support regarding the testing program, students can contact the student testing support team (studenttesting@brown.edu), and faculty and staff can contact the employee testing support team (employeetestinguhr@brown.edu).
