Entrepreneurship Co-concentration Entrepreneurship Co-concentration Are you interested in an entrepreneurial career where you start or join a firm that revolutionizes markets through innovation? The entrepreneurship co‐concentration provides a strong background for launching and managing high‐growth ventures in nascent or high‐velocity industries, for starting projects with a focus on the social good, or simply for those who want to develop an entrepreneurial mindset for innovating within large companies. It is an interdisciplinary program that will help engender entrepreneurial thinking and problem-solving approaches. The course of study includes a mix of theory and real-world application with an emphasis on teamwork. The curriculum introduces a set of tools and a way of thinking that will help students to navigate the uncertain, ambiguous contexts that often characterize new initiatives in established firms as well as start‐ups. The Entrepreneurship co-concentration is designed to be a second concentration for Carroll School of Management students. Up to one class from the co-concentration course list can be counted towards another concentration.
