Ashley Doolittle, associate director, Dartmouth Center for Social Impact “ Share Student Consultants Win Award for Helping Nonprofits Posted on April 27, 2021 by Charlotte Albright "Campus Compact of New Hampshire" recognizes outstanding community service. Photo by Eli Burakian ’00 PreviousNext Dartmouth's first undergraduate consulting group dedicated to making a positive impact in the Upper Valley has received an award from the Campus Compact for New Hampshire, which, according to its website, "promotes citizenship education by expanding higher education's role in educating students not only for careers and jobs but also for their roles as active and engaged community members." The Student Group Leadership Award was given in a virtual ceremony last month to Social Impact Nonprofit Consulting (SINC), a new organization. "SINC consultants regularly tackle such varied and transformative projects as developing a curriculum for a comprehensive training on systemic poverty for staff at LISTEN, a community service agency in Lebanon, N.H.; providing a cost-benefit analysis of the work done by the Vermont-based COVER Home Repair; and developing education materials for childhood lead screenings for the Public Health Council of the Upper Valley," says Ashley Doolittle, associate director of the Dartmouth Center for Social Impact. "We are so proud of our students for applying their knowledge to helping local social-sector organizations serve our community," says Doolittle. Campus Compact also gave a Good Steward Award to Svetlana Grushina, senior lecturer in speech at the Institute for Writing and Rhetoric. 20190826_grushina_eb_005_2-crop.jpg Svetlana Grushina (Photo by Eli Burakian '00) "Professor Grushina teaches public speaking in a compelling way that explores how new media shape our lives and livelihoods," says Doolittle. "She has partnered closely with the center to integrate community-driven experiential learning projects into her courses." Doolittle says students have praised Grushina for helping them stay engaged in their education throughout the pandemic. "She is a leader in her field, and both the Upper Valley and the College are lucky to have such an accomplished, inspiring, and dedicated faculty member," Doolittle says. In addition to the Dartmouth awardees, Campus Compact recognized, with a Community Partner Award, the Windsor Central Supervisory Union, a Vermont school district with close ties to Dartmouth faculty. "WCSU collaborates with the Dartmouth Center for Social Impact in several ways, all of which help students learn about becoming effective change makers in the world across diverse disciplines," says Doolittle. "They ignited student passion for learning and assessment in Associate Professor of Education David Kraemer's educational testing course, and they supported human-centered design students in Assistant Professor of Engineering Eugene Korsunskiy's senior design challenge course. They are currently partnering with Simone Oppen, visiting lecturer in classics, to co-produce a virtual staged reading of Aeschylus, and Emily Walton, an associate professor of sociology, to identify racial injustices."

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Institute for Writing and Rhetoric Philosophy & Aims About Writing at Dartmouth Speech at Dartmouth Our Stories The Story of Writing Instruction at Dartmouth The Story of Speech at Dartmouth The Story of Writing Support at Dartmouth Curriculum Overview Writing Courses Writing 2-3 WRIT 5 First-Year Seminars Humanities 1-2 Speech Courses Speech 20 Speech 25 Speech 26 Speech 27 Speech 30 Speech 31 Speech 33 Speech 34 Speech 36 Speech 37 Speech 40 Placement and Enrollment Policies First-Year Writing & First-Year Seminar Requirements Differences Among First-Year Writing Courses FAQ Directed Self-Placement Process for Writing Registration for Writing 5 or Writing 2-3 Registration for First Year Seminars FAQ First-year Writing Registration First-year Writing Choices Prizes Writing Prize Winners Speech Contest Winners Speech Contest Call for Entries Learning Overview Writing Center Make an Appointment Materials Sources and Citations at Dartmouth Teaching Overview Guidelines Teaching Writing in the First Year Expectations for Writing 2-3 Expectations for Writing 5 Teaching the First-Year Seminar First-Year Writing: Pedagogies, Methods, & Design Active Learning in the First-Year Writing Classroom Syllabus and Assignment Design Teaching Writing as Process Integrating Reading and Writing Diagnosing and Responding to Student Writing Conducting Writing Workshops Collaborative Learning/Learning with Peers Teaching Argument Teaching Research Addressing Grammar Useful links Support The Writing Assistant Program Research Past Research Activities Research Overview Multilingual Overview Support for Undergraduate Students Support for Graduate Students Faculty Support News & People People News Employment Upcoming Events Past Events My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
