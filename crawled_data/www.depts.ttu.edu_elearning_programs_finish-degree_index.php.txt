Alana Schaeper ‘17, B.A., University Studies I graduated with my Bachelor of Arts in University Studies with concentrations in Human Development and Family Studies, Communication Studies and Sociology. My favorite part was the connections that I have made. I have had the opportunity to really get to know my professors, and I do not think that is something I would have been able to do in a large campus setting. I started working for Texas Tech University at Waco as the Administrative Assistant. I knew I wanted to work for TTU at Waco soon after I started the program because I saw the potential that it has and believe it will continue to grow, which will help people in achieving their academic goals. Being a non-traditional student, I know how hard it can be to start something new, especially when you have other commitments. I went back to school and finished for my daughter.
