Students may satisfy some requirements with equivalent coursework taken at other institutions. Courses toward the major must be passed with a “C” (2.0) or better. Students are encouraged to take additional geography courses beyond the minimum required for the major. Credential Information The bachelor’s degree in geography may be effectively combined with subject matter studies necessary for either the multiple subject teaching credential (K-8) or single subject credential (7-12) in social studies. Undergraduates are encouraged to work with the Center for Careers in Teaching (657-278-7130) as early as possible in their academic careers to plan efficient course selections for general education, the major and electives. With careful planning, it may be possible to enter the credential program in the senior year of the bachelor’s degree. Postgraduate students should contact the Admission to Teacher Education office in the College of Education (657-278-3352) to obtain information on attending an overview presentation.
