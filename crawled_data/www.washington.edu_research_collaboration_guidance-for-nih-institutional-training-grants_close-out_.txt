Use the provided Training Grant Closeout Checklist to assist you in tracking items. For the duration of the grant funding, trainees are added and removed through the appointment and termination process. Special treatment of stipend and tuition reconciliation and outstanding obligations is necessary. Incorrect payment of stipends can delay closing of the budget. Use the closeout calculator provided in the Training Grant Budget Tracker and Training Grant Outstanding Trainee Obligations Worksheet to help you facilitate tracking of any special needs. Once the funding ends, a final report on the training program, and a Federal Financial Report (FFR) is required within 90 days of the end date. The Final Invention Statement and Certification is not currently required. For questions, please contact the awarding institute as listed in your NRSA training grant award.
