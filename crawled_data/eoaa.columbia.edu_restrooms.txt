Each individual has the right to work and learn in a professional atmosphere that promotes equal employment opportunities and prohibits discrimination and harassment. Consistent with Federal, New York State, and New York City law, it is Columbia University policy campus-wide that all students, faculty, staff, and visitors should use whichever restroom and sex-segregated facility that is most consistent with their gender identity. For example, a person who identifies as a man should be permitted to use men’s restrooms, and a person who identifies as a woman should be permitted to use women’s restrooms. Columbia University has also created a map identifying the locations of gender-neutral restrooms at the Morningside campus and information about the location of gender-neutral restrooms for the Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) campus is available here. In all instances, the faculty member, staff member, student, or visitor should determine the most appropriate and safest option for themselves. No one should be questioned about their use of a restroom or sex-segreated facility or asked to provide identification or any medical or legal documentation in order to access gender-appropriate facilities. In addition, no one should be required to use a segregated facility because of their gender identity or transgender status. If you have questions or concerns regarding this information, please reach out to EOAA, your supervisor, or Human Resources for more information.
