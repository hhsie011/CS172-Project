This is your chance to explore your options. Many Boston College graduates have pursued careers in chiropractic medicine, optometry, and podiatry. Physician assistant programs and physical therapy have become increasingly popular the last few years, and students with a strong background/interest in chemistry have pursued pharmacy degrees. Great resources for exploring many health professions include the BC Career Center's Healthcare & Nursing page and ExploreHealthCareers.org, a resource for health careers information and interactive tools for exploring health career paths, and finding schooling and funding opportunities. more info on Health Careers Career Center Healthcare & Nursing Pre-Health Program Affiliated Student Groups STEM and Health Outreach for AHANA (SHOfA) Mendel Society EagleShadow Pre-Physician Assistant Society Pre-Dental Society Mission Statement The STEM and Health Organization for AHANA (SHOfA) is an emerging organization dedicated to serving students on their journey towards their accomplished careers in STEM and healthcare fields despite the social pressures they may face on campus. The goal of SHOfA is to increase recruitment and academic success of underrepresented students, as well as educationally and economically disadvantaged students, who are interested in pursuing careers in the STEM professions. Each event organized by SHOfA is set to inspire students to thrive academically and emotionally during rigorous coursework. These events will be especially beneficial to students pursuing degrees in the STEM fields, taking a STEM course, enrolled on a Pre-Health Track (such as pre-medicine, pre-dental, pre-veterinary, graduate school in the sciences, public health, nursing, etc), or students interested in increasing racial diversity in the sciences. The ultimate goal is that students within the organization feel well supported and develop the confidence to continue on STEM and health tracks in order to serve as mentors for the next generation of students. SHOfA aims to ultimately create a highly qualified and diverse workforce in STEM. Through SHOfA, a community of students, alumni, professors and faculty are brought together in order to encourage one another to achieve academic success as BC eagles. SHOfa Membership Sign Up Form Apply to be on the SHOfA E-Board Initiatives Alumni Mentor-Mentee Program BC alumni and other professionals with careers in Health and STEM fields will be matched with upperclassmen juniors and seniors who are interested in majoring in a STEM topic or enrolling onto a pre-health track. Mentor-mentee pairs will decide on their own how often they would like to meet throughout the academic year. The program requires that each pair meets at least once a month throughout the semester. The goal is to introduce upperclassmen to STEM networks inside and outside the BC community and develop a mentoring relationship with well qualified STEM professionals. Alumni Mentor/Mentee Sign Up Form Peer Mentor-Mentee Program Upperclassmen juniors and seniors either majoring in a STEM subject or enrolled on a pre-health track will be matched with underclassmen sophomores and freshmen interested in majoring in a STEM topic or enrolling onto a pre-health track. Mentor-mentee pairs will decide on their own how often they would like to meet throughout the academic year. The program requires that each pair meets at least once a month throughout the semester. The goal is to introduce underclassmen to peer role models who will encourage them and offer advice on how to succeed in the sciences on campus while combating lack of racial representation in the classroom. Peer Mentor/Mentee Sign Up Form Alumni Networking Alumni in the STEM and pre-health fields will be invited on a monthly basis to speak to students about their career path. They will also address the challenge of diversity in STEM fields and help encourage students to overcome such barriers. Alumni may return to Boston College to participate in panels and Alumni Networking fairs targeted for undergraduate students. Join the SHOfA Alumni Community Motivational Workshops Workshops will be hosted by either SHOfA executive board members, BC upperclassmen, professors, faculty or guest speakers. They will explore studying tips, interview skills, resume construction, networking, self-care, racial trauma, and how to find solidarity in minority groups in the STEM field. Pre-Health Seminars In these seminars, professors and BC faculty will discuss each pre-health track application process. Points of discussion are deadlines, standardized testing dates, average standardized testing scores, topics to include in personal statements, resources for standardized testing help, and classes needed for each pre-health track. Students may make appointments afterwards to meet with the faculty in order to develop their personal timeline to stay on track throughout their time at BC. The Mendel Society aims to serve Boston College undergraduates who are interested and passionate about pursuing the Pre-Health track. The following committees work to guide and further the knowledge of all the students interested in these fields: Medical School Admission Night Committee The Medical School Admission Night Committee annually organizes an event with Admission Deans from Harvard, Tufts, BU, UMass, and Kaiser Permanente. Each dean presents the ins and outs of applying to medical school, preparing for the MCAT, and building a strong portfolio. Pre-Med/Mentorship Committee The Mentorship Committee aims to foster communication and guidance among Boston College students on the pre-health track. Underclassmen are matched with upperclassmen that share the same concentration and major so that monthly they can meet to discuss relevant topics like going abroad as a science major, finding an internship/shadowing experience, taking the MCAT or DAT, etc. If you are interested in joining the Mendel Society or have any questions please reach out to georgide@bc.edu.

Affording participants with the opportunity to "virtually" observe and interact with physicians through the evaluation of actual case studies and virtual engagements, students can view a perspective of the lives of practicing physicians. Specialities as well as medical school experiences are shared, including immersions in internal medicine, sports medicine, surgery, toxicology, cardiology, pediatrics, among others. Participants receive a certificate of participation verifying "virtual" shadowing hours from the EagleShadow leadership as well as a journaling experience to discern a deeper understanding of the profession, which can later be used to complete graduate school applications and essays. EagleShadow Members Founders: John Dempsey, Victoria Wittgen, and Daniel Pacella The Pre-Physician Society aims to serve as a resource for undergraduate students considering the Physician Assistant (PA) career by creating a community of Pre-PA students and PA alumni.
