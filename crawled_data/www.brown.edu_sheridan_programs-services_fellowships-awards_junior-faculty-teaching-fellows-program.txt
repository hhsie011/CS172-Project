During the Fall semester, fellows participate in the Sheridan Teaching Seminar Reflective Teaching Certificate, completing online components and attending Certificate workshops facilitated by the Sheridan Senior Associate Director. Fellows also learn strategies for observing teaching and giving formative peer feedback across disciplines. During the Spring semester, fellows participate in three reading group discussion sessions on teaching-related topics of interest to fellows, observe another fellow's class, and discuss insights and ideas gained from the experience. Sample topics might include: Inclusive Teaching, Classroom Strategies, Writing Pedagogy, Course Design and Assessment, or Documenting Teaching. Participants also receive feedback on their teaching through a course observation or early student feedback session and one-on-one consultation with Sheridan staff. Fellows will receive a $500 research stipend after completing the program.* Program Dates Fall sessions will be held remotely via Zoom. Spring session locations TBD.
