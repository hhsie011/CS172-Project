Then, tens of millions of years later, the Sierra Nevada mountain range as we know it today was “reborn.” ClockNov 15 Mail LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Navigate to item Dynamic Earth Researchers recreate deep-Earth conditions to see how iron copes with extreme stress New observations of the atomic structure of iron reveal it undergoes "twinning" under extreme stress and pressure.

The model quantifies the conditions necessary to initiate the kind of caldera collapse that sustains big, damaging eruptions of basaltic volcanoes like Kīlauea and could help to inform forecasting and mitigation.

ClockJun 22 Mail LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Navigate to item Dynamic EarthNatural Hazards What causes earthquake foreshocks? Because foreshocks precede larger quakes, they have long presented the tantalizing prospect of warning of potentially damaging earthquakes. But to date, they have only been recognized in hindsight, and scientists for decades have sought to understand the physical processes that drive them. Computer modeling by Stanford geophysicists finds answers in the complex geometry of faults.
