The student budget (also referred to as the cost of attendance) includes direct costs, which are billed by the University, and indirect costs, which are part of the overall cost of attending Princeton, but are not directly charged on the student bill. Direct costs include tuition, room, and board. Indirect costs include books, personal items, and a travel allowance for students who reside more than 200 miles from the University. Included in the books and personal estimate are charges for the activities fee, the athletics fee, class dues, and the one-time transcript fee, which are charged centrally to the student account for convenience. Standard student budgets for the 2021–22 academic year: First-Year/Sophomore Junior/Senior Tuition $56,010 $56,010 Room $10.690 $10,690 Board $7,490 $9,934 Books and Personal $3,500 $3,500 Total $77,690 $80,134 Students who are not covered by a family health insurance policy must enroll in the Student Health Plan, which is $2,780 for the 2021-22 academic year.
