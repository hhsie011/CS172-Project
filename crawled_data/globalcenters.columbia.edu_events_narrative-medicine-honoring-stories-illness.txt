No:78, 34093 Fatih/İstanbul Show Map Columbia Global Centers | Istanbul invites you to a conversation with Rita Charon, M.D., Ph.D. Professor and Chair of Medical Humanities and Ethics, Professor of Medicine, and Executive Director of Narrative Medicine, at the Columbia Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons on the "Narrative Medicine: Honoring the Stories of Illness" on Monday, October 1 at 6:30 pm. This event is co-sponsored by the Istanbul Faculty of Medicine at Istanbul University. About the Talk Dr. Charon will describe the origins of the field of Narrative Medicine and its efforts to improve healthcare through rigorous and consequential training in close reading, creative writing, and the capacity to enter into the narrative worlds of the other. Deep and enduring consequences – for patients, for clinicians, and for institutions of health care – ensue from disciplined narrative training. Rita Charon, M.D., Ph.D. is a general internist, literary scholar, and the originator of the field of narrative medicine. She is Professor and Chair of the Department of Medical Humanities and Ethics and Professor of Medicine at Columbia University. She completed an M.D. at Harvard in 1978 and a Ph.D. in English at Columbia in 1999, after realizing that she needed to understand how stories work in order to fulfill her duties as an internist. Her research focuses on the consequences of narrative medicine practice, reflective clinical practice, and health care team effectiveness. She is the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Rockefeller Bellagio residency, and recognition from many medical and literary societies. Her work has been funded by NIH, NEH, and private foundations, and her essays appear in the leading medical and literary journals. Her most recent book, co-authored with seven narrative medicine colleagues, is The Principles and Practice of Narrative Medicine (Oxford 2017). For more information, click here.
