Contact us Who We Are Improving the status of women at OSU The Women's Faculty Council (WFC) works to improve the status of women at OSU by being advocates for women through educational programming, award funding, research, and career support. We also serve in an advisory capacity to the administration and university community. What We Do Advocate for women at OSU We study needs and problems that impact women in institutions of higher education, and we recommend actions that promote progress toward equality. We provide space for those on OSU’s campus interested in raising awareness and developing action to share resources and spark movement. We share resources and connect individuals across the our community.
