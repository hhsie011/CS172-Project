FAQ Contact International Applicants International Applicants: Applications from International students, including those with "Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals" status (DACA), are accepted. Consistent with the mission of the University of Louisville as a state university, those with significant academic, personal or family ties to Kentucky are given preference. International applicants are considered under the following circumstances: The applicant has a pending application for permanent residency status in the United States and A) is either married to a U.S. citizen who has an established residence in Kentucky and intends to remain in Kentucky, or B) has numerous members of his or her immediate family who have established residence in Kentucky indefinitely; or The applicant is married to the beneficiary of an approved I-140 Petition for Immigrant Worker (“I-140 spouse”) and the applicant and the applicant’s I-140 spouse are eligible for permanent residency except for delays stemming from backlogs in visa priority dates, and the applicant and the applicant’s spouse are presently in an immigration status that is renewable until they obtain permanent residency and A) the applicant’s I-140 spouse has an established residence in Kentucky and intends to remain in Kentucky, or B) the applicant has numerous members of his or her immediate family who have established residence in Kentucky indefinitely; or The applicant has been granted DACA status and A) is either married to a U.S. citizen who has an established residence in Kentucky and intends to remain in Kentucky, or B) has numerous members of his or her immediate family who have established residence in Kentucky indefinitely. All decisions as to whether consideration circumstances exist in a particular application for admission shall be made by the Admissions Dean or the Dean's designee. International Course Credit Students who are permanent residents of the United States who have attended an institution outside the United States, must have obtained the equivalent of a U.S. bachelor's degree, and have completed a minimum of 24 credit hours from an accredited college/university in the United States. Financial Aid International students, including those with a pending application for permanent residency or with DACA status, are not eligible for most federal benefits, including federally-guaranteed student loans. Such loans usually comprise an important part of a medical student's financial aid package. Therefore, if these international students are offered admission, they must submit documentation of sufficient funds to cover the cost of completing a medical degree (see estimates at http://louisville.edu/medicine/financialaid/cost-of-attendance). Admission offers to international students who are unable to submit adequate documentation of sufficient funds will be withdrawn. All decisions as to whether the documentation of sufficient funds is adequate for a particular international student offered admission shall be made by the Dean or her designee.
