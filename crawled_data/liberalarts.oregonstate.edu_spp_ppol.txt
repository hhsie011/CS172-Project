Our Mission: The BSPP program equips its graduates with the analytical, research, and communication abilities to positively impact public policy initiatives. This is done through: An interdisciplinary approach that examines how the confluence of economic, political, and social forces inform and shape public policy The development of a diverse cohort of faculty and students with a shared value of public service at the local, regional and global levels An emphasis on experiential learning that gives students opportunities to apply their academic training to practical policy issues About Us: The BSPP is an interdisciplinary program that draws primarily from economics, political science and sociology to provide you with a full toolkit for analyzing and addressing the complex policy issues of your generation. Some of these challenges include climate change, demographic and population shifts, rapid technology development, and a globalized economy, and their impacts resonate across communities. In a time of tight budgets and high skepticism of government, we are dedicated to preparing graduates who can develop and implement innovative, evidence-based solutions focused on serving the public good. The program’s focus on policy methods, along with its specialization options in environmental, rural, and social policy will prepare you for exciting, high-impact careers in the government, nonprofit or private sectors, as well as graduate studies. The BSPP facilitates a collaborative student community and professional network. Our accomplished teachers provide world-class instruction and mentorship to support your learning and success. The BSPP also has a dedicated advisor to support your academic progress and offer career guidance.
