Through ongoing discussion, the Forum tackles current diversity challenges, uncovers opportunities for improvement, and brainstorms possible solutions. “When individuals are not recognized, or don’t feel at home, or are unable to contribute as they might, we all suffer; we’re all weakened. We’re not as strong as we could be.” William P. Leahy, S.J., University President Scenes from the Voices of Diversity and Inclusion Forum « » Past Events Tiziana Dearing, Professor of the Practice, Founding Co-Director, Center for Social Innovation, and Co-Director, RISE3, facilitated this year’s Forum in an effort to uncover strategies that develop, support, and sustain transformative leadership skills. These skills drive diversity and inclusion to create an environment where all members of the community can bring their best self to the workplace. Through shared storytelling, table discussions, and identification of individual and collaborative activities, Boston College administrators were able to develop transformative interaction techniques to bring back to their role as a leader. 2017 Voices of Diversity and Inclusion Forum Advancing and Sustaining an Inclusive Work Environment in Today's Changing World Brad Harrington, Executive Director and Jennifer Sabatini Fraone, Director of Corporate Partnership, of the Boston College Center for Work & Family presented research and lead the discussion on the changes that are occurring in the workforce and in contemporary workplaces. This research confirms these changes are pushing organizations to broaden their perspectives regarding the policies, practices and workplace cultures that will meet the needs of today's dynamic organizations and increasingly diverse workforce. Participants had the opportunity to engage in reflective dialogue that help us think about ways to establish a more inclusive culture both as an employer and as an educational institution. The Center for Work and Family is one the country’s leading university-based research centers that focuses on enhancing the employee experience and supporting employers in their efforts to improve the lives of working people and their families. The Center's research focuses on changing gender roles, generational differences, workforce management practices and the leadership of global organizations. Its members include many of the country's most progressive and well respected employers.
