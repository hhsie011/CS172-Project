Located in a thriving metropolis of polyglot communities, the University of Miamiâ€™s Creative Writing Program features a broad multilingual focus and offers writers a singular opportunity to hone their craft in a vibrant, multicultural city unlike any other. Enrollments in our courses are kept deliberately small to maximize student-teacher interaction, and faculty at UM are supportive of the linguistic and cultural differences that writers bring to their art.
