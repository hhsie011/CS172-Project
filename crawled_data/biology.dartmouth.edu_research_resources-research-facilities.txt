This state of the art building houses approximately 28 research programs, a light microscopy facility, Drosophila media kitchen, apparatus shop, 3-D printing shop and rooftop greenhouse. The department has numerous pieces of shared equipment including multiple autoclaves, super-speed centrifuges, ultra centrifuges, fluorescence plate reader, Chemi-Doc and two Nano Drop spectrophotometers. The Life Sciences Light Light Microscopy Facility has two laser scanning confocal microscopes, two spinning disk confocal microscopes, a TIRF system, a multi-photon microscope and a wide-field fluorescence microscope. An EM facility with transmission and scanning electron microscopes is located in nearby Remsen Hall. The building is equipped with several constant temperature rooms, three walk-in plant growth chambers and several reach-in plant growth chambers. Additionally, there is 3000 square feet of research greenhouse space in the Life Sciences Greenhouse. The Life Sciences Center adjoins the Geisel School of Medicine facilities on the Hanover campus. The Institute for Biomolecular Targeting, the Molecular Biology Core Facility, the Electron Microscopy Facility and a National Institutes of Health-approved Animal Care Facility are all located in Geisel. Ecological and Environmental Studies feature5.png For ecological studies, the glaciated terrain of New Hampshire and Vermont offers innumerable streams, ponds, bogs and extensive deciduous and coniferous forests. Alpine tundra and coastal habitats are within a 1-2 hour drive. Several areas owned by the college are available for teaching and research, including the Dartmouth College Grant, a 26,000-acre tract in northern New Hampshire. The nearby White Mountain National Forest and the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest are used extensively for teaching and research by Dartmouth faculty and students. Dartmouth's Organic Farm is just up the road from the from the Life Sciences Center. The farm's house, barn and greenhouses sit along on the Connecticut River and there are extensive woodlands to the east of the farmhouse.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Biological Sciences Undergraduate Overview Welcome Class of 2026 Welcome Back Classes of 2023, 2024, 2025 Major & Minor Course Schedules & Syllabi Current and Upcoming Bio 11 and Foundation Classes First Year Writing Seminars - Biology 7 Biology 11 Foundation Course Offerings Foundation Level Course Syllabi Intermediate Level Course Syllabi Advanced Level Course Syllabi Non-Major Course Syllabi Foreign Study Program Faculty Advisors Teaching Science Fellows Independent Study & the Honors Program Research Opportunities Dartmouth-sponsored Research Programs Funding and Finding an Advisor Transfer Credits Graduate Overview Ecology, Evolution, Environment & Society Molecular and Cellular Biology Research Overview Resources & Research Facilities Life Sciences Light Microscopy Facility Faculty Publications Neukom Postdoctoral Fellowship Foreign Study Program Seminars, News & Events News & Events Cramer Seminar Series Chris Reed Memorial Lecture Past Symposia and Conferences Travel People SEPA My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
