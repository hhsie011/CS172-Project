Housed in the College of Liberal Arts, Health and Society is an interdisciplinary major with associated faculty and courses in the College of Natural Sciences, the College of Education, the College of Communication, and the LBJ School of Public Affairs. The central goal of Health and Society is to train students to understand the socio-demographic, cultural, political, and ethical contexts that underlie health behavior and health policy. We expect many of our graduates to move into positions in non-profit organizations, government, international development or the healthcare industry. Yet Health and Society is also a Liberal Art. While focusing on health, our graduates acquire a broad set of interdisciplinary perspectives and methods that they can apply to any other substantive area. What can you do with a degree in Health and Society?
