The Office of Risk Management works with local fire officials, the Office of Facilities Planning and Management, as well as building end-users to coordinate fire safety inspections of academic, residential, and commercial buildings on and off campus. ORM also coordinates activity with the local fire marshals in the jurisdictions in which SMU operates for day-to-day operations, as well as for special events and other circumstances as required. ORM works closely with the University Park Fire Marshal’s office and Residence Life and Student Housing office to ensure the safety of all residence halls on campus. This includes annual inspections, frequent fire evacuation drills, inspecting rooms for fire hazards, and providing informational materials pertaining to items that are not permitted in the residence halls.
