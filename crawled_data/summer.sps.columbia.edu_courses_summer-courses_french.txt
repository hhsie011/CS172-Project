Wait List) In-Person Blackness in French: From Harlem to Paris and Beyond FREN3822W001 3 points. What distinctions must be made between US-black American fantasies of Paris and realities for Blacks in Paris? What are the historical linkages between black Americans and Paris? Between black Americans and black French women and men? How is this relationship different from and contingent on the relationship between the “French” and their colonial “others?” How is “blackness” a category into which all non-white racial others are conscripted? (e.g. Arab and Roma communities)? Using an internationalist (specifically transatlantic) approach and covering the 20th and 21st centuries, this course explores these and other questions over the course of the semester through a close consideration of the literature, arts, culture, history and politics emanating from or dealing with Black France. The texts and artifacts examined in this course will consider “race” as both fact and fantasy in the unique, long-historical relationship between the United States, Paris, and the wider French empire.

This course will chart a history of postwar cinema through exemplary films of mauvais goût, or bad taste. Whether they were explicitly banned or censured, deemed too grotesque, pornographic, or violent, or quite simply panned or labeled unwatchable, the films in this course come up against received expectations of what a film could or should . We will begin with Louis Malle’s Les amants (1958), which was famously banned in the US, and sparked an important legal debate about the nature of the pornography in the US (Judge Potter Stewart’s famous claim: “I know it when I see it”). We will move into lesser-known examples of French New Wave of the 1960s and ‘70s, notably a concert-film by Jean-Luc Godard, Sympathy for the Devil (1968), which far from serving up the raucous, blues-rock tunes of the Rolling Stones, performed an extended critique of the Vietnam War, and Agnes Varda’s documentary about the Black Panthers and her Le Bonheur (1965), a film much disliked by contemporary feminists. Our consideration of 1960s cinema will continue with Marguerite Duras’s India Song (1975), a film adored by critics but deemed almost universally unwatchable by subsequent viewers, as well as Roger Vadim’s Barbarella (1968), the quintessential pop science fiction film, which launched Jane Fonda’s career as an iconic sex symbol. We will then explore cult classics like Jean-Jacques Beineix’s hyperstylized thriller Diva (1981), part of the commercially successful cinéma du look, as well as René Laloux’s experimental animated film La Planète sauvage (1973). Exemplary of low-tech cinema of the 1990s, Hervé Guibert’s La pudeur ou l’impudeur (1992) is a homemade documentary film about succumbing to AIDS. Turning to the ‘00s and early ’10s, we will consider quasi-pornographic films like Catherine Breillat’s works, or others that were controversial for the conditions of production, notably La vie d’Adèle by Franco-Tunisian filmmaker Abdellatif Kechiche. Finally, the course will close with a couple of very recent films that delve into grotesque or bizarre imagery, like Julia Ducourneau’s narratives of sexual awakening through cannibalism or a woman impregnated by a Cadillac. Bruno Dumont’s murder mystery film and TV series P’tit Quinquin, revives aspects of New Wave praxis, like that use of non-professional actors. This class will also involve a couple of class field trips, to the Museum of the Moving Image (in Astoria), as well as to the Lincoln Film Center and to MoMA. Class taught in English with films in French with English Subtitles. Secondary materials in English or French, with English translations.
