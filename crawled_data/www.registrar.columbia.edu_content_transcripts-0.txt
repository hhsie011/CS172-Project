Due to a high volume of transcript requests, you may experience longer processing times than normal. Please allow 3-5 days to process email and paper transcript request(s) ordered via SSOL. Actual processing times may be considerably shorter. We are providing this advisory so that you can plan accordingly. If any urgent requests are needed, please email [email protected] with the attached transcript request document. We appreciate your patience. Please refrain from submitting duplicate transcript orders if you are experiencing a delay. Duplicate orders are contributing to the volume backlog. Current and former students who attended after 2001 must request transcripts online using SSOL. If you know your UNI, but have forgotten your password, please reset your password. A transcript is an official record of a student's entire tenure at Columbia. It reflects all coursework and grades per term for each school attended within the University. Other information on the transcript includes: Name as it appears in the Columbia University records School and departmental affiliation Degree/certificate program (if applicable) Degree/certificate conferral date (if applicable) Honors earned (if applicable) G.P.A. is printed only on transcripts of students from CC, GS, SPS, and SEAS. Note: G.P.A. will not be printed on transcripts of students who attended prior to 1982. There is no fee for this service. Transcripts cannot be produced for anyone whose record has been put on hold for an outstanding University obligation. Current students and recent alumni with a UNI should request transcripts and certification online using SSOL. The Student Service Center is unable to print transcripts at the counter during the first three weeks of each semester in order to focus on the provision of quality service to all students and their families.
