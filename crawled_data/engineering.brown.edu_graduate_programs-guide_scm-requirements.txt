Options below may be chosen and programs tailored toward your individual needs. Please see related pages on graduate areas of study and research for more specific information. Master of Science (Thesis Option) Candidates must complete a coherent plan of study based in engineering or engineering science consisting of eight graduate or advanced level courses and an acceptable thesis, which is normally sponsored by a member of the engineering faculty. The program must include ENGN2010 and 2020* (Mathematical Methods in Engineering and Physics) or their equivalent (must be 2000 level) and two additional 2000-level engineering courses other than ENGN2980 (Special Projects: Reading Research and Design). For thesis students, ENGN2980 may be counted up to two times towards satisfying the degree requirements; it is typical that students sign up for two semesters of ENGN2980 as part of their thesis preparations. Classes in engineering management (PRIME) are not acceptable for use as one of the 2000-level engineering classes. The remainder of courses may include up to two 1000-level engineering classes. Students should choose courses in consultation with the student’s advisor to develop a coherent program. * Either ENGN 2010 or ENGN 2020 can be replaced by an alternate mathematics course with approval of the appropriate Graduate Representative and the Director of Graduate Studies. For students in the Master of Science in Engineering program (thesis option,) the approved course sequence is 3-2-2-1. Meaning the student takes 3 courses the first semester, 2 the second (plus research), 2 the third (plus research), and 1 the fourth (and finalizes writing of thesis). Any deviation from this schedule can result in additional tuition and/or penalties. Master of Science (Non-Thesis Option) Candidates must complete a coherent plan of study based in engineering or engineering science consisting of eight graduate or advanced level courses. The program must include ENGN2010 and 2020* (Mathematical Methods in Engineering and Physics) or their equivalent (must be 2000 level) and three additional 2000-level engineering courses other than ENGN2980 (Special Projects: Reading Research and Design). Courses in engineering management (PRIME) are not acceptable for use as one of the 2000-level engineering classes. The remaining courses may include one ENGN2980 class and up to three 1000-level engineering classes. Students should choose courses in consultation with the student’s advisor to develop a coherent program. * Either ENGN 2010 or ENGN 2020 can be replaced by an alternate mathematics course with approval of the appropriate Graduate Representative and the Director of Graduate Studies. For students in the Master of Science in Engineering program (non-thesis option,) the approved course sequence is 3-3-2, meaning the student takes 3 courses the first semester, 3 the second, and 2 the third. Any deviation from this schedule can result in additional tuition and/or penalties. The proposed program of study must be approved by the Director of Graduate Programs in the School of Engineering. Note: students enrolled in the Ph.D. program, including first-year fellowship students, should understand that an application to receive a non-thesis Sc.M. in engineering must be approved by the student's research advisor. Master of Science (Non-Thesis Professional Track Option) Candidates must complete a coherent plan of study based in engineering or engineering science consisting of eight graduate or advanced level courses. The program must include ENGN2010 and 2020* (Mathematical Methods in Engineering and Physics) or their equivalent (must be 2000 level) and three additional 2000-level engineering courses other than ENGN2980 (Special Projects: Reading Research and Design). Courses in engineering management (PRIME) are not acceptable for use as one of the 2000-level engineering classes. The remaining courses may include one ENGN2980 class and up to three 1000-level engineering classes. Students should choose courses in consultation with the student’s advisor to develop a coherent program. * Either ENGN 2010 or ENGN 2020 can be replaced by an alternate mathematics course with approval of the appropriate Graduate Representative and the Director of Graduate Studies. A paid or unpaid internship is a required component of the program. All internships must be pre-approved by the School of Engineering. Assistance in obtaining internships will be provided by the School and Brown CareerLAB. The proposed program of study must be approved by the Director of Graduate Programs in the School of Engineering. Professional Track Internship Information Internships are traditionally utilized during the first summer of the Sc.M. program. You should however start early (January is generally recommended) to try and find a suitable internship. Please refer to CareerLAB guidelines and recommendations for resume preparation, interviewing, and general procedures about which you should be aware when deciding on an internship. Consult the CareerLAB employment listings, BrownConnect alumni internship listings, or your own research/contacts/faculty referrals to find suitable options. The School of Engineering also holds a Career and Internship Fair every November. Fill out the internship approval form and submit it to Associate Dean Jennifer Casasanto (Jennifer_Casasanto@Brown.edu) before the end of the semester (or earlier if you are intending to get CPT approval from OISSS). You should NEVER begin work before your internship is approved. Other Sc.M. requirements International students must be full-time at all times throughout their academic program, with few exceptions: Documented medical reasons (up to a maximum of one year) Documented academic reason (one semester only) During last semester of coursework Data-Enabled Computational Engineering and Science Program View the requirements for the Data-Enabled Computational Engineering and Science Program. PRIME Program View the requirements for the Program in Innovation Management & Entrepreneurship (PRIME) program.
