As one of over 50 CTSA hubs working nationally for the same purpose, we utilize our YouTube channel to share research, lectures, and innovations. The highlighted video below is part of series of rap videos launched today by Hip Hop Public Health, a community outreach organization founded by Columbia neurologist and Irving Institute faculty Olajide Williams, MD, aims to increase COVID-19 vaccine coverage in communities of color. community_immunity_part_1_-_what_are_vaccines_and_why_do_they_work Implementation Science Seminar Series on Health and Equity implementation_science_series_on_health_and_equity Provided by the Irving Institute Implementation Science Initiative in partnership with the New York State Psychiatric Institute. These monthly seminars will be held from September 2020 through June 2021, and will feature national experts who lead research focused on health equity, racial justice, and implementation science. As a rapidly growing field, implementation science has developed over the past ten years in response to the well-documented gap between research and practice that exists in real-world community and clinical contexts. This series will focus on the research needed to help advance understanding of how to enhance the uptake, reach, implementation, and impact of evidence-based interventions and practices for populations and settings experiencing health inequities.
