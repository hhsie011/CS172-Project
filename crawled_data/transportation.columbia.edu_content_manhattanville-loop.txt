The driver will wait at a hard stop until the time when the Shuttle schedule indicates that the Shuttle should arrive. Other stops are "soft stops", where the driver will slow down, but continue past the stop if no one is waiting. Below is a list of the hard and soft stops on the Manhattanville Loop Shuttle Summer Schedule: Hard Stops 116 St. North Soft Stops A Train (a.m.) Hard Stops Jerome L.

By turning each route off or on on the map, you will see the route the shuttle takes and which stops it includes. As the Shuttle does not stop at every stop on every run, please use the map to get directions or refer to the schedule to ensure you choose the correct route. When searching for directions using the maps, the system will only search times for the routes you have showing on the map. To search all available routes and times, ensure that all routes are visible. Clicking on a stop marker will display information about the stop, a picture of the stop, and the next three times the shuttle stops there. The shuttle is tracked live via GPS on our website. A moving bus icon on the map will show you where the shuttle is in real-time. fullscreen Manhattanville Loop: Summer 2022 (Morning) Metro North 2, 3 Train a.m. A Train a.m. Small Square 132 South Studebaker South Jerome L.
