This area-studies program is focused on Asia, broadly defined as including East Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East. A major or minor in this program serves the needs of: (1) general liberal arts students who wish to learn more about these important areas of the world; (2) students who wish to pursue graduate work in these or related fields; and (3) students who seek employment in or related to Asia. The program combines area- or country-specific courses with more general comparative courses that provide students with the necessary intellectual tools, concepts, and theories to make sense out of their particular disciplinary concentrations. Students are to select language and thematic specializations in line with their intellectual interests and career goals and design their program of studies accordingly. In addition to the regular major in Asian studies, the program also offers a second option designed for students who want to combine linguistic, cultural, and other relevant knowledge of Asia with business skills. Students electing this option will take a significant proportion of their coursework in the College of Business. This option is intended to prepare students for a career that capitalizes on their knowledge of Asia. The undergraduate program in Asian studies is administered through the College of Social Sciences and Public Policy. Students interested in either of these degree program options should consult with the Director of Asian Studies. Computer Skills Competency All undergraduates at Florida State University must demonstrate basic computer skills competency prior to graduation. As necessary computer competency skills vary from discipline to discipline, each major determines the courses needed to satisfy this requirement. Undergraduate majors in Asian Studies satisfy this requirement by earning a grade of “C–” or higher in any course at FSU which meets the liberal studies computer competency designation, though it is strongly recommended that students take either CGS 2060 or CGS 2100 in order to satisfy this requirement. Requirements Asian Studies Major Students majoring in the program are to construct their study program around three components: (1) a language requirement, (2) an area-specific coursework requirement, and (3) a concepts and theories requirement. ASN 2299 (Professional Development for Asian Studies Majors) is a required course for this program and counts toward total hour requirements. The total hour requirements for the major are thirty-six semester hours beyond the liberal studies requirements with a grade of “C–” or better in each of the Asian studies courses. As this is an interdisciplinary program, no minor is required. In addition to a 2.0 overall GPA, all students must meet “mapping” requirements. See https://www.academic-guide.fsu.edu/ for more information. Language Requirement All students are also required to complete relevant area language coursework to the intermediate level or demonstrate proficiency to the intermediate college level in Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, or some other Asian language (at 2200 level or equivalent course). Students will be encouraged to bring their chosen language up to an effective level of proficiency in reading, writing, and speaking by either taking additional coursework on the campus of Florida State University or by participating in a semester- or summer-abroad program in their relevant cultural area as such programs become available. These programs should be administered by, affiliated with, or approved by Florida State University. To encourage the achievement of language proficiency, language coursework hours taken beyond the twelve semester hour minimum or demonstrated intermediate college-level proficiency may be counted toward the required thirty-six semester hours for the major. Area Specific Course Requirement Students are to select at least twenty-four semester hours of area specific coursework from the approved area-specific courses listed below. Note that special topic area-specific courses may be approved from time to time; for the most current list, students are encouraged to view the term-specific courses posted on their International Studies Canvas site and available in the advising office in 105 Bellamy and the program office in 211 Bellamy. Concept and Theory Course Requirement Students are to select at least six semester hours of coursework from among the concept and theory courses listed below. Students should carefully select these courses in consultation with their academic advisor, to ensure that the courses meet any required prerequisites for the approved courses. Additional Course Requirement The remaining six credit hours may be selected from any approved Asian Studies course and/or an approved internship (INR 4941). Asian Studies Major with an Emphasis in Business This degree program combines the regular Asian Studies major with a planned series of economics and business courses. The requirements for this degree are to complete relevant area language coursework to the intermediate level or demonstrate proficiency to the intermediate college level in Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, or another approved Asian language, twenty-one semester hours in Asian studies coursework, and fifteen semester hours in multinational business courses. The Asian studies coursework is to be selected from the area specific courses. With this degree there is no concepts and theories requirement. Students are also to select between two fifteen semester hour business coursework options listed below, an international marketing/management track or an international finance track. The prerequisites for both tracks include ECO 2013 and 2023, which may be taken as part of the student’s liberal studies requirements. In addition, students opting for the international finance track must complete ACG 2021 as a prerequisite. Students should seek advising from the Asian Studies program advisor in 211 Bellamy about registering for business courses.

The Summer programs in China, Indonesia, and Thailand offer relevant course work. See https://international.fsu.edu/ for more information on the various options available through Florida State International Programs. Students should consult with the Asian Studies Director about any other study abroad programs they wish to pursue. Coursework taken in overseas locations must be approved in advance for credit toward the major. Internship The Asian Studies program encourages students to take advantage of internships with an area focus. Information on possible placements can be found on the International Studies Canvas site. All internships must be approved the semester before the internship takes place. See the Asian Studies program advisor in 211 Bellamy for further information. Honors in the Major The program in Asian Studies offers honors in the major to encourage talented juniors and seniors to undertake independent and original work as part of the undergraduate experience. For requirements and other information, see the “University Honors Office and Honor Societies” chapter of this General Bulletin. Second Majors Majors in Asian Studies may pursue a second major. When students pursue a second major, they may count six semester hours of coursework toward both majors. Minor in Asian Studies Students pursuing a minor in the program must complete eighteen semester hours of Asian studies coursework beyond the liberal studies requirement. In this case none of the broader comparative concepts and theories courses will count toward the eighteen semester hour minimum. Students may select freely from all area-specific courses. Modern language courses numbered above 2999 may count toward the minor. Nine of the eighteen semester hours must be numbered above 2999. A maximum combined total of six semester hours in internship or directed individual study may apply to the minor. Approved Courses Note: Descriptions of specific courses can be found under the individual departments in which they are taught. In addition to the courses listed below, special topics courses may be approved by the program director in any particular term. These courses appear on the term course lists and are available at the International Studies Canvas site, the advising office in 105 Bellamy, and the program office in 211 Bellamy.
