Students may drop class sections via BearWeb through the 12th class day (fall/spring); 4th class day (summer sessions I and II); 8th class day (full summer). Advisor approval is required to drop a class section beginning the 13th class day (fall/spring); 5th class day (summer sessions I and II); 9th class day (full summer). Students must also complete the Before you Drop Form found on the University Advisement website. Adding a course The last day to add a course is listed in the Academic Calendar for the specific term and can be found on the Events Calendar website. The change in schedule fee is charged beginning the 13th class day (fall/spring); 5th class day (summer sessions I and II); 9th class day (full summer). Students should be reminded that the days missed while not registered for the course are considered absences. Dropping a course The university has specific dates that determine the effect of the drop on the student's academic record. These dates are listed in the Academic Calendar for the specific term and can be found on the Events Calendar website. A class drop or University Withdrawal during the period of the 13th through the 50th class day results in a W being recorded for the class(es) on the student's record and appearing on the transcript. Department chairs (and faculty) should not grant student requests to date a Add/Drop and Registration form retroactively to avoid academic or financial penalties. Federal financial aid guidelines and university policies prohibit such practices. Students might ask you what kind of refund can be expected when they drop a class. The refund policy is under the purview of the Cashier's Office. Dropping versus Withdrawing Dropping and withdrawing are not the same thing. Beginning the first day of a semester, students are prevented from dropping all of their classes on BearWeb since this is considered a withdrawal from the University. Academic advisors should not drop all classes for students as well. Students should be directed to the Academic Success & Engagement website to officially withdraw from the University.
