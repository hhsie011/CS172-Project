FAFSA applicants will be considered for all types of financial aid listed below. CA Dream Act applicants will be considered for the state funded programs denoted with an asterisk (*). Students who demonstrate significant financial need may qualify for grant aid while students with less need may obtain low cost loans. Your Financial Aid is awarded based on Full-Time Enrollment (12 or more units), and will be adjusted at the University Census Date - established by Admission and Records - based on your final enrollment status. CSU NET PRICE & COST CALCULATOR (CSUNPCC) Use the net price calculator to get an estimate of your financial aid eligibility. The use of the net price calculator does not constitute an actual financial aid award. To receive financial aid from a California State University campus, you must complete either the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or the California Dream Act (CDA) Application. See How to Apply. Eligibility for financial aid is the amount that remains after the student's Expected Family Contribution (EFC) is subtracted from the cost of education. The cost of education is the amount the University estimates the student will spend to attend college for the academic year. The cost of education includes the basic tuition fee, various campus-based fees, room and board, books, supplies, transportation and miscellaneous personal expenses. Private Loans Private educational loans have different terms and conditions compared to the Federal Direct loans. To better your search and obtain competitive interest rates, we highly advise you to compare current Federal Direct loan options prior to seeking private funding. Private educational loans, also known as Alternative Education Loans, help bridge the gap between the actual cost of your education and the amount of your other financial aid funds. Private loans are nonfederal loans, made by a lender such as a bank or a credit union. These credit-based consumer loans often carry a higher interest rate and fees than the federal loan programs. If you have exhausted all sources of federal funding and decide to borrow a private loan, compare lenders to ensure you are making the best choice for you.

A student's financial aid award cannot exceed the student's Cost of Attendance. If a student receives financial aid exceeding the Cost of Attendance - causing an over-award - the Office of Financial Aid, will reduce the student's aid -- starting with the least desirable aid. A student may be billed because of the Over-award. This site is maintained by Office of Financial Aid.
