It has shown me that there are lots of progressive organizations and people that center racial justice and equity on the path to abolition of the carceral system. I see myself working in a collaborative environment alongside progressive political leadership and advocacy groups to dismantle a system that has continuously oppressed Black and Brown communities for decades. I think purposeful, informed policy is critical now more than ever to reshape public safety in our communities and CRC has shown me how to work toward this." Nick Barracca (MGPS '21); Internship: UN Foundation "The UN Foundation (UNF) helps the UN mobilize ideas, people and resources on a variety of issues, including climate change, global health, peace and security, women's empowerment, poverty eradication, energy access and U.S.-UN relations. My team is a part of the Executive Office and supports work that may not match the portfolio of other teams and the UNF family of alliances. During my internship, I monitored developments at the G7, G20, IMF and World Bank group because these international financial institutions are responsible for the majority sustainable development and the COVID-19 response financing. I would write up daily news reports and summary memos about latest think tank events, research and policy developments that would go on to leadership. Also, I supported two experts on my team and their work on emerging technologies and subnational SDG initiatives." Sisto Campana (MGPS-DC '20); Internship: United States Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration — Office of Policy Development and Research "Due to the coronavirus pandemic and the accompanying economic crisis, the Department of Labor has been at the epicenter of the government's response. I have been working closely with the Office of Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs to complete congressional requests from both chambers of Congress that range from technical assistance on bills related to the CARES Act, to individual casework helping workers receive unemployment compensation. It has given me a better understanding of how government operates and relies on executive agencies for their expertise in helping craft legislation. It is very fulfilling knowing that my office and my work has impacted legislation that potentially affects millions of people throughout the country." Reena Birch Fram (Dual Degree MPAff/MBA '22); Internship: Walmart, Inc. "The business community has immense influence in the way policies are formed and how our society functions. Working with my team at Walmart and learning how they drive forward their sustainability efforts was an incredible experience. Although the internship was remote, my colleagues were generous with their time, provided me with a challenging and relevant project, and made sure I had a fun summer networking with interesting people!" Katrina Parkey (MPAff/MBA '21); Internship: City of Austin, COVID-19 Finance Response "I am working directly with City of Austin staff across nearly all city departments, in addition to private consultants who were hired on to help with the COVID-19 response. Managing relationships with so many people across so many departments has been a challenge, but everyone is working together to keeping our communities safe and healthy. While tracking finances, I've strengthened my Excel skills and learned more about auditing techniques. While serving directly onsite, I've learned a lot about improving operational processes to make sure that each site is operating as efficiently and effectively as it can. It is a privilege to do work every day that is having a direct impact on Austinites."
