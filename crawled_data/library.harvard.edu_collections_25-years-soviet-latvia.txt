Kindergarten children, 1965. View Details. 25 Years of Soviet Latvia, Fung Library The date was marked by festivals, a commemorative stamp, a special meeting of the Latvian Communist Party’s central committee, and several other events and publications. One such publication was this collection of photographs, "Padomju Latvijas 25. Gadadienai" or "25 Years of Soviet Latvia." Issued by the Latvian Society for Friendship and Cultural Ties with Foreign Countries, it was intended “to tell our friends abroad about Soviet Latvia.” (Explore the introductory booklet here.) These 60 photographs depict various aspects of economic development and everyday life in the republic. Captions in the accompanying booklet emphasize the progress Latvia has made in manufacturing, education, public health, and other spheres since being annexed by the Soviet Union.
