With 1,596 seats needed for seniors and their parents, a larger space was needed. Thus, in a tradition that continues today, the procession of graduating seniors marched to the church grounds to hear the senior orations and be officially admitted to the bachelor’s degree. Then, they marched back to the College Green for the awarding of diplomas in the presence of family and friends.
