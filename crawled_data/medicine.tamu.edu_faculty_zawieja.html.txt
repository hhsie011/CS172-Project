Our interests include the control and regulation of fluid and macromolecular exchange and transport throughout the three microcirculatory compartments: the microvascular compartment, the interstitial compartment, and the lymphatic compartment. We are investigating both the normal physiological control and pathophysiological alterations of these functions.  We have focused most of our recent work on the function of the lymphatic system and are investigating the mechanisms responsible for the generation and regulation of lymph flow. The lymphatic system is vital to body fluid/protein homeostasis, edema prevention, lymphocyte circulation, immune function and lipid absorption. All of these functions require a regulated lymph flow. We are investigating the influence of physical, neural and humoral factors on the generation of lymph flow with particular emphasis on the mechanisms by which these factors alter the active lymph pump. Mammalian lymphatics possess intrinsic phasic contractions that pump lymph throughout the body and tonic contractions that regulate outflow resistance. The cellular mechanisms regulating the lymphatic contractions are unknown and are the subject of our current studies. Recently we have focused on the role of calcium and the contractile and regulatory proteins involved in the phasic and tonic lymphatic contractile activity. We have also investigated the influences of flow and shear on lymphatic contractile function and found that shear modulates the phasic and tonic contractile activity via a nitric oxide/cGMP based mechanism. These studies also include the development of more accurate models of lymph flow/shear in microlymphatics. The growth of new lymph vessels, lymphangiogenesis, is another area of interest in our lab. We have developed and characterized the first cultured microlymphatic endothelial and muscle cell lines. We have begun studies of the factors which regulate the proliferation and migration of these cells.  To accomplish these studies, my laboratory utilizes a number of different techniques including: 1) in situ studies using intravital video microscopy, 2) isolated microvessel studies using fluorescent video microscopy, 3) dispersed smooth muscle cells, 4) isolated cultured vascular cells, 5) calcium and membrane potential imaging using fluorescent microscopy, 6) confocal microscopy, 7) mathematical simulation of physiological processes.
