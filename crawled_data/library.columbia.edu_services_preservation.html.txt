The Division provides a comprehensive program to prolong the existence and accessibility of the collections for current and future students and scholars, by acting to prevent or retard deterioration of physical materials through correct housing and environment, through disaster preparedness, and through staff and user education; where possible, acting to improve the condition of materials through conservation treatment; and, when necessary, acting to change their format in order to preserve their intellectual content, including converting analog content to digital form. The Division coordinates with other units in the Libraries to assure preservation of digital content. Learn more about Conserving Cultural Heritage at Columbia and the Andrew W.
