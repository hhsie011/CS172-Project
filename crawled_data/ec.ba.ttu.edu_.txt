Additionally, the Area supports the college's core curriculum by providing the Applied Business Economics courses. Energy Commerce is a broad based business degree that prepares students for careers directly and indirectly related to the energy industry. While primarily concentrating on the upstream (exploration and production), midstream (transportation and refining) and downstream (wholesale and retail distribution) sectors of the oil and gas industry we also recognize the increasing and important role of alternative and renewable energy sources. We focus on teaching the primary skills necessary to a successful business career: issue analysis, critical thinking and problem solving. Students learn and practice through a series of hands-on experiential opportunities, case studies and simulation projects. Our award-winning faculty and staff members engage and teach students on a personal level to allow for a full understanding and grasp of the various topics. In addition to extensive academic research and publication, our faculty bring a wealth of industry experience to the classroom.
