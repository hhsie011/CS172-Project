Broad exposure to the components of general surgery and to the surgical subspecialties is gained through rotations at Rhode Island Hospital (RIH), The Miriam Hospital (TMH) and Providence Veterans Administration Medical Center (VAMC). In addition to the seven categorical residents accepted into the program, up to eight interns are accepted into a preliminary program for one year of education in general surgery prerequisite to entering programs in various surgical subspecialties. The primary goal of the program is to produce superior clinical and academic surgeons who are trained in all facets of modern general surgery. Specifically, this training includes intensive exposure to surgery of the gastrointestinal tract, breast, head and neck, vascular system, endocrine system, trauma, cardiothoracic, pediatric surgery, transplant surgery, and surgical nutrition. Surgical residents are part of the operating team in all cases at the affiliated institutions. All residents are afforded a rich operative experience due to the volume and variety of surgical diseases throughout the hospital system. Interns will perform an average of 100 cases during the first year and chief residents will average 1200 cases over five years. The operative experience of the program is complemented by a rigorous academic conference schedule, which is designed to promote resident advancement in surgical knowledge and to develop and hone presentation skills. The interdisciplinary nature of several of the conferences enhances the educational experience of the residents and promotes an appreciation for various views and approaches to surgical problems and issues. In recognition of the need for both clinical and academic physicians in the current and future healthcare environments, the program offers two tracks to categorical residents. Those residents who wish to pursue an academic surgical career may enter into two years of basic science research in one of the many available research opportunities following their PGY-2 year. The Department of Surgery represents one of the most highly-funded and productive clinical and science research departments in the Alpert Medical School. The second clinical track allows for completion of the categorical program in five years. How do residents describe the program in one word?
