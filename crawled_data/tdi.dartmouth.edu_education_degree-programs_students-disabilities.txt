We encourage applicants with disabilities, who contribute to a diverse Dartmouth community, to apply for admission with the expectation that reasonable accommodations and access to The Dartmouth Institute's graduate programs, including curricular and co-curricular pursuits, will be provided. The Dartmouth Institute and Dartmouth College are committed to ensuring equal access under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) as amended, and Sections 504 and 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Applicants may disclose disability prior to admission but are not required to, nor will disability status be considered in the admissions process. Disability disclosure can be made at any time during your enrollment; however, students are encouraged to engage the interactive process and request accommodations prior to the start of classes or as soon as a disability is identified during enrollment. Early notification allows for a smooth transition and the implementation of auxiliary services or modifications in a timely manner. Students are further encouraged to make use of reasonable accommodations and the supports available throughout their enrollment. Getting Started Accommodations are determined on an individual basis through an interactive process that includes the student and The Dartmouth Institute and are based on federal law and Dartmouth College guidelines. To begin the interactive process, please contact the Geisel Office of Student Accessibility Services.
