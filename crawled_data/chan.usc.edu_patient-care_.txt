Occupational Therapy Patient Care USC occupational therapists are experts at restoring, rebuilding and redesigning the lives of USC patients by optimizing their quality of life through health-promoting habits, independence and life satisfaction. At Keck Hospital of USC and USC Norris Cancer Hospital, occupational therapists start the rehabilitation process in order to decrease lengths of stay, build patients’ functional skills and prepare for their transition back to everyday life outside the hospital. We also treat outpatients at the USC hospitals and hospital-affiliated clinics, enabling patients to maximize participation and engagement in their personal daily activities. And at the USC Occupational Therapy Faculty Practice, our practitioners lead patients through Lifestyle Redesign®, the transformative process of enhancing health and wellness by preventing or managing chronic health conditions within the contexts of everyday living. At 10 sites of services across the Greater Los Angeles area — including the Keck Medicine of USC hospitals and clinics, our Faculty Practice locations, primary care settings and out in the community — USC occupational therapists fulfill a mission of delivering science-driven, evidence-based occupational therapy. As we have for over two decades, USC occupational therapists are here to support physicians seeking to refer patients for rehabilitation and better management of chronic conditions and to ensure our patients Fight On! for independent, safe and meaningful lives.
