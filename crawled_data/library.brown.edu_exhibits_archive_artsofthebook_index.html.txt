Teaching the Arts of the Book Work by students of Walter Feldman 1980-2003 For over twenty years, Walter Feldman has taught the arts of bookmaking to Brown University students in his Arts of the Book course, in the Department of Visual Arts. Over 300 examples of student work have been deposited in the collections of the John Hay Library. The work features papermaking and pulp painting, binding techniques and boxmaking, woodcuts and other illustrative techniques, and formats such as pop-ups, miniatures, and accordion-folds. There are books reflecting assignments on the circus, the alphabet book, texts of Edgar Allan Poe's The Raven and by William Blake, among many others. These works demonstrate the remarkable creativity of Brown students, and the inspired teaching of Walter Feldman. This online exhibit is based on the exhibition of student work mounted in the John Hay Library, Brown University April-August 2003. The exhibition coincided with the celebration of Walter Feldman's fifty years of teaching at Brown University.
