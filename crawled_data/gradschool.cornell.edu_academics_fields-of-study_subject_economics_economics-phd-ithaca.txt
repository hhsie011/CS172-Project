Within the first year of study, Ph.D. students should complete requirements in mathematics and econometrics and pass qualifying examinations in micro- and macroeconomics. Completing those core requirements, and selecting a core committee member, satisfy the requirements of the basic analytical economics minor. Students interested in this field may also want to consider the Fields of Agricultural Economics; and Management.

Success in this regard is distinguished by the ability to design and execute a long-term research program that addresses a sequence of well-defined and important problems in economic theory, resource allocation, markets, macroeconomics, public policy, economic measurement, or other area of applied economics. An essential skill of any successful researcher is the ability to communicate effectively in both written and oral presentations. Although careers may diverge after the Ph.D. is completed, most students will enter the international Economics Ph.D. job market during their fifth year of study. At that time students should have a polished, substantial research paper, known as the Job Market Paper, that demonstrates their skills in the design, execution, and presentation of a significant project. The Job Market Paper is one part of a well-developed early career research plan whose promise and significance can be reasonably assessed by the economics profession at that time. Those interested in teaching positions should have a portfolio of teaching experiences that demonstrates their skills and preparation.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
