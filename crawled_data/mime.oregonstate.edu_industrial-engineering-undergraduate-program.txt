This flexibility allows you to tailor your program of study to meet your individual career goals. IE students who take the Business Engineering Option can easily add a Business and Entrepreneurship minor from the College of Business. Also, because of the close association between the industrial engineering and manufacturing engineering programs at OSU, many students elect to pursue a Dual Major or Double Degree in these two programs.
