If selected, you'll be notified by the Office of Student Financial Aid & Scholarships. Scholarships are awarded on a first-come, first-served basis until funds are depleted. New students are required to attend an in-person Red Raider Orientation (RRO) prior to June 1, 2022 for early summer classes, and prior to July 1, 2022 if attending late summer classes.
