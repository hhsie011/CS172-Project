Guests: The four guest limit has been lifted. The Ph.D. Recognition ceremony: The Ph.D. Recognition ceremony will be on Saturday evening, May 28th, after the Schoellkopf events, and will be open to doctoral candidates who graduated August 2021, December 2021, and will graduate May 2022 and August 2022. Other events: College, school, and departmental events will occur throughout Commencement weekend. Which ceremony should I attend? Cornell University will host in-person Spring 2022 Commencement events to recognize August 2021, December 2021, May 2022, and August 2022 graduates. To accommodate more participants, the commencement ceremony will be split into two separate events in Schoellkopf Stadium on Saturday, May 28, 2022.

Land Acknowledgement Cornell University is located on the traditional homelands of the Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' (the Cayuga Nation). The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
