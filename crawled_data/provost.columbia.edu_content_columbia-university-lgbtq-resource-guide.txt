The task of compiling this guide was undertaken with much care over the past year, and was informed by individual interviews with faculty and staff, as well as focus groups of graduate and undergraduate students. With this project, we sought to create a comprehensive one-stop living repository of campus resources, and to relay recommendations from our interviewees about how we all can be better, more visible LGBTQ+ allies. Click on the image below to view the complete PDF. This resource was developed under the leadership of Vice Provost for Faculty Advancement Dennis Mitchell and Professor Walter Bockting and the Provost’s Advisory Council for the Enhancement of Faculty Diversity, a group created with the conviction that an inclusive environment is critical to achieve our highest ideals of research, teaching, and engagement in the larger world.
