Contents Before You ApplyWhen You ApplyAfter You ApplyRequest to DeferCost and AidContact Before You Apply Applying to college shouldn’t be hard. That’s the approach we take here at Temple. Our goal is to make the admissions process as simple and straightforward as possible. Find all the information you need to navigate the application process and the contact information for our admissions staff who can help answer any questions you might have. First, read our admissions guidelines. Find application deadlines, evaluation criteria and other important information for high school students, transfer students, international students and veterans. Temple exclusively uses the Common Application. Next, figure out the best application path for you. You’ll first want to pick a decision plan and decide if you’d like to apply Early Action or Regular Decision based on the following deadlines. Early Action: Nov. 1 (first-year applicants only) By selecting the Early Action deadline, you can submit your application earlier to get an admissions decision earlier. If you apply by Nov. 1, you’ll receive an admissions decision by Jan. 10. Note that using Early Action is not binding, and we generally do admit students at a higher rate who apply by this deadline. If you decided to apply Early Action, you must indicate so on your application to ensure you will receive an admissions decision early. Regular Decision: Feb. 1 (first-year applicants only) By selecting the Regular Decision deadline, if first-year students apply by Feb. 1, they’ll receive an admissions decision in four to eight weeks. NOTE: Early Action candidates receive priority review and can delay our review of Regular Decision candidates. During peak admissions (October through March), it might take more than eight weeks for a decision to be made on your application. Transfer Student Deadlines If you are applying to Temple as a transfer student, you must apply by June 1 if you’d like to start in the fall semester. Students interested in transferring for the spring semester (January start) must apply by Nov. 1. The Nursing* program is only available for fall start for transfer students and applications for this program must be submitted by Feb. 1. *Nursing is a four-year program, even for transfer students. Spaces in the program are limited. Honors Program For first-year students, there is no separate application required to be considered for the Honors Program. Early Action and Regular Decision applicants are automatically reviewed. Transfer students who wish to be reviewed for the Honors Program must apply: https://honors.temple.edu/honors-program-application. Then, decide if you want to submit your test scores. After deciding which deadline you want to meet (Early Action or Regular Decision), the next step is to consider your standardized test scores if you’re a first-year student. Temple offers two ways to apply. You can choose to submit your test scores. Or you can not submit test scores. We are a test optional school, and choosing to not submit your scores does not negatively impact your application. If you choose not to submit your scores, you will apply test-optional. If you believe an SAT or ACT score would complement your application, you should submit your scores. Standardized test scores are otherwise entirely optional and in no way required for admission. If you are a first-year international student, please review guidelines for test score requirements.
