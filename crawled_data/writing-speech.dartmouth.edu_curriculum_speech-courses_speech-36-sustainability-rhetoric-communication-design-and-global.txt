We will draw on communication and rhetorical theory and research to understand the complex dynamics of contemporary organizational contexts. We will use case studies to interrogate the challenges and opportunities that global organizations face in pursuit of sustainable development and learn as well as develop theory-based strategies for maximizing such growth and improving the communication of organizations and their stakeholders. Discussions will focus on concepts of global teamwork, glocalization, civil regulation, agency, and corporate social responsibility (CSR), among others. No prerequisites. Limited enrollment. Instructor: Grushina. Distributive: SOC Offered: 22W: 2A. Organizations everywhere work to self-govern in ways that balance transparency with promoting a positive self-image while shaping and being shaped by global rhetoric on sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). This course uses rhetorical theory and social theory to unpack the underlying mechanisms of these developments. We will draw on contemporary social theory of globalization, traditional argumentation and modern policy deliberation theory, and analyses of influential documents that shape global rhetoric of CSR and sustainability to address these unifying questions: What is the role of business in society? How do we shape this role? How could we? Class discussions will focus on cornerstone readings in these conceptual fields, and we will pay detailed attention to analysis of the Global Reporting Initiative's (GRI) four Guidelines for Sustainability Reporting. Students will complete three (3) speaking presentations, write five (5) short reading critiques, and complete a final project in which they analyze and evaluate an organization's sustainability report from communication design and rhetorical perspectives. Although the organizational practice of CSR has existed in some form dating back to the 1970's, it has become an important area of academic study and criticism across a wide variety of disciplines across the curriculum over the past 20 years. Scholars from fields as diverse as business, economics, accounting, sociology, environmental studies, communication studies, rhetoric studies, and technical writing have written extensively about sustainability and CSR. More recently, scholars have turned their gaze toward the practice of sustainability reporting, and the use of the GRI Guidelines by the vast majority of global companies to produce these reports. Some have found sustainability reporting to be a positive step in self-governance and transparency while others have been far more skeptical about the accuracy of such reporting and the lack of accountability. This course will examine these issues from both theoretical and applied perspectives. Course Goals: The main goal of the course is to help you become a better critical thinker as you learn to apply the theoretical perspectives we discuss to global organizational practices and policy analyses that have major implications for economics, the environment, and the social well-being of individual, groups, communities, and societies. An important second objective is to help you become a better public speaker and a better writer. To accomplish these objectives, I will help you do the following throughout the term: 1) critically analyze scholarly texts to a) summarize key arguments, b) evaluate academic evidence, and c) critique research conclusions; 2) develop the ability to write a thesis-driven essay (using textual examples for support) 3) become skilled at enacting a close analysis of a text; 4) explore constitutive nature of discourse and communication; 5) apply rhetorical principles to analyses of contemporary CSR and sustainability rhetoric; 6) evaluate others’ and support own arguments through solid reasoning and communication of that reasoning; 7) expand your ideas of what it means to speak publicly; 8) test public speaking against criteria of good dialogue; 9) gain a more nuanced understanding of rhetorical goals; 10) evaluate and implement organizational strategies for speaking and writing and craft transitions that guide audience understanding; 11) use wording that is clear, concise, accurate, and interesting; 12) improve public listening; 13) create, prepare, and deliver more effective public speeches, individually and in a group; 14) develop a deeper understanding of thoughtfully informed and articulate speaking, writing, and thinking – by doing.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Institute for Writing and Rhetoric Philosophy & Aims About Writing at Dartmouth Speech at Dartmouth Our Stories The Story of Writing Instruction at Dartmouth The Story of Speech at Dartmouth The Story of Writing Support at Dartmouth Curriculum Overview Writing Courses Writing 2-3 WRIT 5 First-Year Seminars Humanities 1-2 Speech Courses Speech 20 Speech 25 Speech 26 Speech 27 Speech 30 Speech 31 Speech 33 Speech 34 Speech 36 Speech 37 Speech 40 Placement and Enrollment Policies First-Year Writing & First-Year Seminar Requirements Differences Among First-Year Writing Courses FAQ Directed Self-Placement Process for Writing Registration for Writing 5 or Writing 2-3 Registration for First Year Seminars FAQ First-year Writing Registration First-year Writing Choices Prizes Writing Prize Winners Speech Contest Winners Speech Contest Call for Entries Learning Overview Writing Center Make an Appointment Materials Sources and Citations at Dartmouth Teaching Overview Guidelines Teaching Writing in the First Year Expectations for Writing 2-3 Expectations for Writing 5 Teaching the First-Year Seminar First-Year Writing: Pedagogies, Methods, & Design Active Learning in the First-Year Writing Classroom Syllabus and Assignment Design Teaching Writing as Process Integrating Reading and Writing Diagnosing and Responding to Student Writing Conducting Writing Workshops Collaborative Learning/Learning with Peers Teaching Argument Teaching Research Addressing Grammar Useful links Support The Writing Assistant Program Research Past Research Activities Research Overview Multilingual Overview Support for Undergraduate Students Support for Graduate Students Faculty Support News & People People News Employment Upcoming Events Past Events My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
