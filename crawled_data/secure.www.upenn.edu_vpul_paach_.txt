Through advising, leadership development, advocacy, social and cultural programming we expand student access to the University’s resources. The Pan-Asian American Community House opened in the fall of 2000 in response to students’ calls for a cultural resource center at the University of Pennsylvania where South Asian, East Asian, Southeast Asian, and Pacific Islander cultures could be celebrated. PAACH is a community center that develops and implements innovative programs for leadership development and community service in close collaboration with Asian American student and community groups.
