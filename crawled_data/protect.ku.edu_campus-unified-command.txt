In December 2020, KU reshaped the team structure to better reflect local, regional and national recommendations on crisis and incident response activities. The new Campus Unified Command structure eases the time commitment on our top-level team members and allows greater input from across campus, while also maintaining excellent awareness of changing conditions. The Campus Unified Command is led by KU’s Emergency Management Coordinator Andrew Foster.
