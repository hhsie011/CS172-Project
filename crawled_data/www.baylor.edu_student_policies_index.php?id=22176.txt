Baylor University admits students of any race, color, national and ethnic origin, sex, age, disability, religion, or veteran status to all the rights, privileges, programs, and activities generally accorded or made available to students at the school. It does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national and ethnic origin, sex, age, disability, or veteran status in administration of its educational policies, admissions policies, scholarship and loan programs, and athletic and other school-administered programs. Baylor University is controlled by a predominantly Baptist Board of Regents and is operated within the Christian-oriented aims and ideals of Baptists. The University is also affiliated with the Baptist General Convention of Texas, a cooperative association of autonomous Texas Baptist churches. As a religiously-controlled institution of higher education, the University is exempt from compliance with some provisions of certain civil rights laws. As such, the University prescribes standards of personal conduct that are consistent with its mission and values. This policy statement is neither intended to discourage, nor is it in fact applicable to, any analytical discussion of law and policy issues involved, or to discussions of any recommendations for changes in existing law. Discussions of these matters are both practiced and are welcomed within our curriculum.
