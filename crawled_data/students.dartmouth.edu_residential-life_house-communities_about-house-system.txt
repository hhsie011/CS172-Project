Houses promote intellectual engagement, community, and continuity. They increase student access to members of the faculty in residential spaces, build community by creating opportunities for enhanced social ties and shared experiences in the residential system, and respond to the long-standing call from students for more continuity in their residential experience. For many years, students and young alums have expressed frustration with how many times they've moved across campus due to variations in their D-plan. They've told us they haven’t known anyone on their floors and have treated their room assignment as “just a place to sleep.” Older alumni have reflected how much they appreciated living in the same location from year to year. Everyone Has a House Every student has a House membership, regardless of where you live. As a House member, you’ll be eligible to participate in all House programs and activities, even if you live off-campus or in Greek housing or Living Learning Communities. You can choose for yourself how much you want to be involved. House Leadership Each of the six House Communities is co-lead by a live-in Residential Education professional staff member and a House Professor who lives nearby. In addition, each House Community leadership team consists of four Resident Fellows and a team of Undergraduate Advisors (UGAs). An administrative assistant is also a part of the House team and student leadership opportunities exist through the House Executive Council. House Activities You can participate in all House activities, including dinners and events at your House Professor’s residence. Being a member of a House doesn’t determine your schedule, and it doesn’t change any of the other ways in which you’re involved in campus life and student organizations. First-Year House Assignments First-year students will receive their randomly assigned house memberships in the summer when they receive their room assignments. First-year students live on first-year floors affiliated with their House Community unless they live in a Living Learning Community where roommates will have membership in the same House. All first-year students will be included in House Community activities, and then move into their House Community residences from their second year onward. House Centers House Centers increase currently available “living room space” for Allen House and School House on the west side of campus and North Park House and South House on the east side of campus. As with similar spaces within East Wheelock House and West House, these centers provide flexible, open living room space for House members to hang out, study, meet, or to use for House gatherings.
