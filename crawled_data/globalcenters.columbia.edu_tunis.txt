In this sense, pre-departure Testing is no longer required for vaccinated passengers (over 18). However, it is essential to present on arrival a vaccine certificate proving the completion of the vaccination schedule against Covid-19 or a vaccination passport issued by the health authorities of the country of residence. From 1st April 2022, the Ministry of Health has decided to increase the capacity of indoor spaces to 100% with the requirement to present a vaccination passport, wear a mask and ventilate spaces. It also announced that it will intensify vaccination campaigns against COVID-19, and strengthen vaccine passport control and individual precautionary measures in each sector of activity.
