Quinton Huang '19 My name is Quinton Huang, and I’m a senior focusing on East Asia within the History concentration. I love the History concentration because every single History professor I've had has been warm, welcoming and supportive to all their students, and because I value the empathy for people of other times, places and circumstances that the study of history instils. My main interests are Hong Kong, Manchuria, Korea and the global Third World. Outside of history, I am also an East Asian Studies concentrator, study Chinese at Brown, and am involved in the Southeast Asian Studies Initiative. Jane Lichacz '19 Hi! My name is Jane Lichacz and I am a senior, concentrating in History with a field of focus in Modern America.

Ben Martel '19 Hi, my name is Ben Martel and I am a senior concentrating in history, with a focus on Europe and Judaism.

Tomi Onabanjo '19 While my full name is Oluwatomisin, I usually just go by Tomi for short. I am currently a senior concentrating in History and Africana Studies. I am particularly interested in the historical, social and cultural relationships between individuals of the African continent and those of the Diaspora. My interest in the History Department largely stems from my ardent belief that there is no means to ameliorate the problems of today, without understanding their roots in the events of the past. I am also one of the co-captains for the Men’s Club Volleyball Team, a tutor for Brown’s Refugee Youth Tutoring and Enrichment Program, and an upperclassmen mentor in the Black Student Union. Gabriela Ortiz '19 "Hi! My name is Gabriela Ortiz and I am a senior from Santa Fe, NM. I am concentrating in History with a particular focus on the development of medicine, science and technology in Colonial Latin America. A concentration in History has allowed me to connect with my fellow students, establish meaningful relationships with my professors, and gain a deeper appreciation for the different cultures, languages, and belief systems that have shaped modern society. Outside of history, I am a student coordinator for the BRCC, a member of Brown's Pre-med Society, a student archivist and a licensed EMT." Gwenyth Winship’19 Hello! My name is Gwenyth and I’m a senior concentrating in Modern U.S. History. I’ve held two research positions on campus working with a professor of Civil War history and an associate professor of Indigenous Peoples in the English Atlantic. In addition to studying modern America, I love histories of the Middle East, Caribbean, and South America, so don’t hesitate to reach out to me for any of those areas too. When I’m not studying, I compete as a sprinter for the Varsity Track & Field team, and share cups of coffee with Brown’s quirky “Write It!” Novel-ing Club. CLASS OF 2018 Katy Chu '18 My name is Katy, and I am a senior from Los Angeles. This year, I am writing a thesis about how British missionaries in interwar Egypt worked within imperial contexts.

I am currently writing a senior thesis that combines these interests, focusing on the intersection of drug use, race and athletics and their relation to the 1986 Anti-Drug Abuse Act. I’ve found that the History department offers students a chance to think in new and critical ways about widely accepted narratives, and I’ve greatly enjoyed my courses in the department.
