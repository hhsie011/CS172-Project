Elizabeth Bracher Director, Courage To Know Gasson Hall 109 617-552-1749 elizabeth.bracher@bc.edu Cornerstone: Course-based Advising Opportunities for First-Year Students The Courage to Know First-Year Topic Seminar Writing Advising Sections Perspectives I Advising Sections The Courage to Know (UNCS2201) A cornerstone elective for first-year students The college experience can be seen as a puzzle, a myriad of pieces that fit together to create a picture- a road map per se- of what the Good Life ought to be and how to live it. During your time at Boston College, it is your challenge to put these pieces together in a way that makes sense for the person you are becoming. The Courage to Know is a first-year elective designed to confront students with the most fundamental formational questions that will guide your years at Boston College and beyond: Who am I? What am I good at? Who am I called to become? In this seminar, the instructor will lead the class through a semester-long examination of identity development, asking the question of what it means to live a life of meaning and purpose. This course will call on contemporary literature, current research, and social commentary as you discuss the impact of race, class, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, intimacy, faith, and vocational discernment in our lives. CTK sections also incorporate outside-of-the-classroom activities in and around campus and the City of Boston into the course curriculum. This three-credit seminar is offered to first-year undergraduates who may chose to take it in either the fall or spring semester. For those taking this course in the fall semester, the course instructor will serve as your academic advisor until you move into major advising sometime in your sophomore year. Instructors are faculty and administrators from across the University. Print all courses on page Fall 2021 First-Year Topic Seminar The First-Year Topic Seminar (FTS) is the 12-week, one-credit Cornerstone option for students in the Morrissey College of Arts & Sciences. These seminars are taught by faculty who lead the discussion on a research topic within their academic discipline and their specific area of expertise. First-year Topic Seminars offer students the opportunity to explore academic areas of interest without having to commit to a major just yet. Enrolling in a FTS is a unique opportunity to test the waters in such disciplines as Economics, Theatre, Political Science, History, Communication, etc. The faculty instructor for your FTS will also be your academic advisor for your first year and until you are assigned an academic advisor in your major program sometime in your sophomore year. FTS sections also incorporate outside-of-the-classroom activities in and around campus and the City of Boston into the course curriculum. Graded on the scale of Pass/Fail, this course ends the week before Thanksgiving Break.
