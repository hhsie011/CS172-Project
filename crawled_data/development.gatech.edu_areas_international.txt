Learning, working, and living in a foreign country provides them with distinct career advantages by preparing them to navigate an increasingly global marketplace, and it also broadens their view of the world, inspires their interest in other cultures, and enriches their lives. The International Plan The International Plan is a four-year academic program designed to develop the global competence of students within the context of their majors. The program requires students to engage in a minimum of 26 weeks of international experience, to develop proficiency in a language other than English, and to take internationally-oriented coursework — preparing them for success in a diverse global work environment.
