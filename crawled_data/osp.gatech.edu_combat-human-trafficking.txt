Amendments in 2015 to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) require that all federal contracts and subcontracts comply with Executive Order 13627, which strengthens protections against human trafficking. This FAR clause requires contractors to notify employees of the policy and establish an appropriate employee awareness program. It is also a mandatory flowdown in all subcontracts for the acquisition of services. Contractors are required to submit a certification that they have implemented an appropriate compliance plan, conducted due diligence to identify and prevent any prohibited activities, and that no prohibited activities have occurred. Additionally, contractors must certify that they have implemented appropriate remedial or referral action, if prohibited activities have occurred. The Department of State's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons is leading the U.S. effort against human trafficking, an umbrella term that describes activities involved when someone obtains or holds a person in compelled service. in 2016, a Presidential interagency task force developed innovative solutions to combat trafficking, including gathering data on sectors at greatest risk of trafficking-related activities. TIP 101 Training Because human trafficking is a hidden crime, the first step to combat it is to identify victims so they can be rescued. The State Department's Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Office, in collaboration with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has developed a wealth of materials that increase awareness and provide information about key indicators of human trafficking. A good first step is to take a few moments to watch this Human Trafficking Awareness Training video, which offers general information about how to identify a potential victim and contact the proper authorities. Victimology Trafficking victims can be men or women, young or old, American or from abroad, with or without legal status. Traffickers prey on victims with little or no social safety net. They look for victims who are vulnerable because of their illegal immigration status, limited English proficiency, and those who may be in vulnerable situations due to economic hardship, political instability, natural disasters, or other causes. Victims are found in legitimate and illegitimate labor industries, including agricultural fields, restaurants, hotels, and domestic service, to name a few. Contact Georgia Tech's Ethics Point System to report any potential violation.
