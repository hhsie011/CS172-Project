Although all groups meet together for combined events throughout the year, there are also discipline-specific events offered such as a Young Alumni Panel and an annual Portfolio Review day designed to help students in Architecture who plan to apply to graduate school. DUG officers are chosen from both concentrations and work together closely to provide an integrated program of DUG events and resources.
