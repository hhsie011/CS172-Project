Academic Services, Programs and Facilities Special Academic Services, Programs and Facilities Overview Special Programs Special Facilities On This Page University College Advising Academic Advising LASSO Center Department of Transfer and Student Veteran Success University Assessment and Testing (UAT) University College Advising Nick Holmes—Director, University College Advising and LASSO University College Advising (UCA) provides academic advising and assistance to a variety of diverse student populations. Students advised by UCA include, but are not limited to, undecided students and those admitted through the alternative admission and holistic admission programs. Additionally, UCA is the advising home for pre-CEAT students, undecided transfer students, some students on academic probation and some students who need help developing individualized degree plans. By providing personalized attention and assistance, UCA strives to retain students as they adjust to OSU and explore their academic options. University College Advising is located in 214 Student Union. Please visit uca.okstate.edu or contact 405.744.5333 for more information. The following programs are offered through University College Advising: Freshman Programs Students who are undecided with interests spanning more than one academic college Students admitted through OSU's holistic or alternative admissions programs Students admitted through OSU's pre-CEAT program In addition to academic advising, UCA provides students with a First-Year Seminar (UNIV 1111) designed to help freshmen adjust to the demands of college life, learn how to become academically successful, explore various major and career options, and make students aware of university rules and regulations. This class is taught by UCA advisors in conjunction with UCA’s Student Academic Mentor Program. After remediating any subject area deficiencies and completing one semester with a 3.0 GPA or higher or two semesters with a minimum 2.00 GPA, students may generally transfer to their academic college of choice, depending on their college and department’s individual GPA and course requirements. Transfer Probation Transfer students who do not meet OSU's minimum hour/GPA transfer requirements may be admitted on probation by a joint decision of their academic college and University College Advising. University Academic Assessment Program The University Academic Assessment Program is designed for students who have experienced academic difficulty at the college level, including: students on academic probation; freshmen on academic notice; students in good academic standing, who are ineligible for admission to their desired college or major; and students who left OSU while on probation or suspension and after taking off at least one regular semester have been readmitted based on a demonstrated potential for success. In conjunction with hands-on academic advising, University College advisors assist Academic Assessment and Transfer Probation students in developing realistic plans of study, informing students of important policies and requirements, such as OSU and major-specific GPA requirements and OSU's Academic Forgiveness policies. These students are advised by UCA until they are eligible to transfer to their academic college of choice, depending on their college and department's individual GPA and course requirements. Bachelor of University Studies Occasionally a student experiences great difficulty in finding a degree plan appropriate for his/her interests and career goals. In this case, an individual degree plan may be developed to meet State Regents' and OSU's degree requirements. Academic advisors in UCA can be instrumental in helping draft the initial stages of such plans, which are then forwarded to the academic colleges for approval. Academic Advising Academic advising is a major function within the University and serves the student first and foremost. Advising assists students in developing their intellectual potential through effective use of all resources available at the University—academic, cultural and social. The role of the student's academic advisor is to: assist in educational planning, including clarification of career and educational goals, curriculum planning and short-term course selection, become aware of and make appropriate referrals to campus support services, provide information to prospective majors, and prepare degree plans for graduating seniors and submit these to the respective college graduation certification office. Advising is performed within each of the undergraduate colleges and in University College Advising. Each college structures its advising system based upon the college's philosophy and perceived student needs. In most colleges, freshmen and undeclared students are advised through the college's office of student academic services, while declared majors are advised in their major department. In the Division of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources, all students are advised by faculty members. Each college has an office of student academic services to represent the dean in matters concerning undergraduate students. Students should contact their office of student academic services when questions arise regarding advising, academic programs and requirements, and academic support services. The locations of the offices of student academic services are: Arts and Sciences, 213 Life Sciences East Education and Human Sciences, 101 Human Sciences Engineering, Architecture and Technology, 110 Engineering North Ferguson College of Agriculture, 136 Agricultural Hall Spears School of Business, 155 Business Building University College Advising, 214 Student Union OSU-Tulsa Advising Services, North Hall 130 Honors College, 101 Old Central Graduate College, 202 Whitehurst Center for Health Sciences, 1111 W. 17th, Tulsa College of Veterinary Medicine, 110 McElroy Hall Students should keep in mind that while the University provides advising as a service and resource, the ultimate responsibility for identifying and completing degree requirements rests with the student.

University Assessment and Testing (UAT) Ryan Chung, PhD—Director University Assessment and Testing (UAT) at OSU supports institutional, college and academic program improvement and provides public assurance of academic program quality and accountability by documenting assessment progress toward meeting educational goals as required by accreditation agencies (Higher Learning Commission, HLC) and the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education (OSRHE). Assessment involves creating measurable student learning outcomes, collecting data through various direct and indirect methods, analyzing and reviewing data and, most importantly, using data to improve student learning. Assessment is an integral part of the institution's commitment to enhance and sustain academic program quality and students’ overall educational experiences. The OSU Assessment and Academic Improvement Council (AAIC) guides the institution's assessment plan and coordinates with the director of UAT to facilitate assessment processes for all academic programs. Membership of the AAIC consists of faculty from each college and representatives from the offices of Student Affairs, Institutional Research and Analytics, University Libraries, and the Student Government Association. The AAIC supports assessment by providing resources to: Measure the effectiveness of all academic programs, Utilize information provided by assessment processes to improve student learning, and Determine the overall educational impact through assessment processes of the university learning experience on all students. Assessment activity at OSU, coordinated by UAT, includes four primary initiatives: Entry-Level Placement Assessment assists OSU advisors and faculty in making placement decisions to give students the best chance of academic success. General Education Assessment evaluates student achievement of institutionally recognized general education competencies, including written communication, problem solving, diversity, critical thinking and information literacy. UAT works with the Committee for the Assessment of General Education (CAGE) to improve efforts on general education assessment. Program Student Learning Outcomes Assessment evaluates achievement of student learning goals in academic programs. Survey development, data collection, analysis and reporting on student engagement, student satisfaction, and alumni perceptions of academic programs and services of OSU. Results of these assessment initiatives and efforts provide significant information for improvement of academic programs and services, of students' achievement of learning outcomes and of students' satisfaction with their educational experience. UAT submits annual reports to the OSRHE that summarize the assessment initiatives listed above. These reports include program student learning outcomes, assessment methods used, student population of interest, measured criteria and expectations, results, and uses of assessment data (action plans).

Study Abroad OSU students can add an international dimension to their degree program through education abroad designed to support specific academic and professional goals. International programs such as study, internships, research, and service learning equip students with the skills and knowledge required for future leadership. By developing global competencies needed to engage with local, national, and global communities as a culturally perceptive citizen, participation in international education opportunities also expand key academic and career benefits, such as: Students who studied abroad were twice as likely to find a job quickly following the completion of their college studies. College graduates who studied abroad see a 25% higher average starting salary than those who did not study abroad. Nearly 60% of employers consider study abroad to be a valuable asset for an individual’s career path. Study abroad participants are about 20% more likely to graduate on time than non-participants. As part of Oklahoma State University’s global engagement initiative, the University partners with over 55 universities abroad for semester and academic-year exchanges. There are also hundreds of options for students looking for summer break, spring break, and winter intersession options. The following program types allow students to have an international experience that aligns with their academic and professional goals. Reciprocal Exchanges. Students may earn OSU credit through reciprocal exchanges in over 37 countries in Europe, Asia and Latin America and other regions. While participating in reciprocal exchange, students pay tuition and fees to OSU. OSU Faculty-led Programs. Students may also earn OSU credit by enrolling in short-term international courses offered by OSU college outreach units in countries such as China, Ecuador, France, Greece, Italy, Mexico, Peru and South Africa. Affiliated/Approved Programs. Students may earn transfer credit through participation in pre-approved study abroad programs offered by other U.S. universities or study abroad program providers.
