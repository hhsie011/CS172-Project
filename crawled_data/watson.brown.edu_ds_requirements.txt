Students must secure a primary thesis advisor by the end of the Spring semester Junior year and seek approval from the DS Concentration Advisor and DEVL 1500 instructor. If a primary thesis advisor has not signed on to the student's project by the end of the spring semester junior year the student will not be permitted to write a thesis. Requirements: i. DEVL 1980: Thesis Writing Seminar, offered in the Fall of the Senior Year ii.

B. Senior Capstone Seminar This option is for students who did not receive approval for a thesis or who have chosen not to complete such a project. The senior capstone seminar will require that the student in their senior year write a research paper utilizing one’s thematic or regional expertise and foreign language skills and be about 20-25 pages in length. A capstone course may be a pre-approved WRIT-designated senior seminar, an independent study, or a group independent study (GISP) with the approval of the director of Development Studies.
