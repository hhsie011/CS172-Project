This special offer is one that, in essence, would guarantee you the opportunity to transfer to SMU after completing a year at another college or university. If your goal is to graduate from SMU, this is a way to make such a dream into reality. As the academic reputation of SMU rises and admission as a first-year student becomes more difficult, we are increasingly unable to admit every talented student who would very much like to be a Mustang. Each year, however, we have space available for qualified transfer students. In fact, over 400 students come to SMU each year to continue their college education. Conditional admission is offered to a limited number of students who apply for but are not offered first-year admission. The exact conditions are outlined in your decision letter from SMU, but the conditions for assured admission generally include all of the following: Complete a minimum of 24 hours of transferable work following high school graduation, at an accredited two- or four-year institution (dual-credit, Advanced Placement and IB credit do not count toward this requirement) Enroll as a full-time student at the selected institution, with at least 12 or more hours during regular fall and spring semesters Earn at least a 2.700 GPA (4.0 scale) in transferable coursework Maintain a satisfactory record of academic and personal behavior Among the transferable courses must be: One English composition course One math course (college algebra or higher) One natural science course that includes a laboratory component (such as biology, chemistry or geology) SMU believes that by taking courses at another institution, students will develop an academic record crucial to their success at SMU. Make the Commitment If you have been offered conditional admission to SMU, please let us know whether you plan to pursue this option. This allows us to help you as you prepare to become a Mustang.

Meet Your Counselor Once you have chosen the institution at which you would like to fulfill the conditional admission requirements, reach out to your SMU Transfer Admission Counselor, who will guide you in the transfer process. (Note: Please select your counselor based on the state of the institution you will be attending and not based on your home or high school state.)
