She is the author of American Routes: Racial Palimpsests and the Transformation of Race (Oxford, 2017) which examines changes in race and racialization in New Orleans under the French, Spanish and Anglo-American administrations. The book was co-winner of the Social Science History Association’s Allan Sharlin Memorial book award (2018); co-winner of the American Sociological Association’s Barrington Moore book award in comparative-historical sociology (2018); and recipient of an Honorable Mention from the Thomas & Znaniecki Best Book Award, International Migration Section, American Sociological Association (2018). She is currently at work on a book manuscript tentatively entitled “Layered Memories” which compares and contrasts the social histories of three key sites in New Orleans over a two-hundred-year period as a way of examining transformations in race, gender and power. In addition to this research, she is active in public-facing teaching and scholarship where she provides training for K-12 educators who are looking to better integrate Black writers and Black history into their teaching. A book related to this work is under contract with Classical Academic Press and is entitled “The Black Intellectual Tradition and the Great Conversation: Black Writers as Essential to an Education in Truth, Goodness, and Beauty”. She serves on the editorial board for Cambridge Studies in Historical Sociology, a new series housed at Cambridge University Press and is an associate editor with the forthcoming journal Principia:A Journal of Classical Education which is devoted to bringing insights of writers from classical antiquity into dialogue with contemporary issues in education and society. She completed her B.A. in sociology at Yale University and her M.S. and Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. She has been a member of the School of Social Science at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, as well as the recipient of a Fulbright grant.
