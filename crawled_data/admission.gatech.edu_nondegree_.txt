Please be aware of the following course registration challenges for non-degree students: Heavily subscribed courses are typically unavailable to non-degree students. This typically includes core-curriculum courses such as first-year and second-year calculus, chemistry, physics, humanities, and social sciences. Space is normally unavailable in courses taught by major schools that teach at capacity, including the Aerospace Engineering, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering schools. Course registration depends on availability, and special/transient students are given last priority for registration. If you would like to take graduate classes at Georgia Tech (i.e. 6000-level courses and above), you must apply through the Office of Graduate Studies. If you would like to take Georgia Tech classes without seeking college credit, the Georgia Tech Professional Education offerings may interest you. Transient Students You’re currently enrolled as an undergraduate in a college or university and plan to return to your home institution after one semester at Georgia Tech. Review Application Steps Special Students You have not previously attended Georgia Tech as an undergraduate student. You have completed a baccalaureate or bachelor’s degree from another institution. You are applying to study undergraduate courses at Georgia Tech for personal or professional growth, not in pursuit of a degree. Review Application Steps Readmission If you were previously enrolled as an undergraduate student at Tech and have been out of school for two or more consecutive terms, you must apply for readmission. Readmission includes Tech graduates and former students who are readmitting for the same level of study. A former Tech student who studied at the graduate level only and now wants to study courses at the undergraduate level should use the Special Student application.
