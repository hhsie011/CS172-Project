The overview below provides basic information about the housing process and what you can expect of your new living arrangements. Living in a residence hall on campus keeps you close to all the action and provides a convenient homebase for studying and relaxing. If you haven't yet secured your on-campus housing, visit housing information to find the applicable steps. Check out a floor plan How it Works Syracuse University requires incoming students to reside on campus during their first two years of enrollment. All first-year students will reside within North Campus residence halls, while new transfer students will reside within South Campus SkyHalls or (a small amount) within South Campus apartments. New transfer students are not required to live on campus; however, if you have completed fewer than 40 credits, you are welcome to apply. Housing assignments reflect a conscious effort to ensure a diverse and inclusive Syracuse experience. The housing office does not endorse, nor are they able to honor room switches or trades. From Housing to Home The University’s placement process for new freshmen housing is random. You may be assigned to live in one of the following residence halls on Main Campus: Boland, Brewster, Brockway, Day, DellPlain, Flint, Haven, Lawrinson, Sadler, and Shaw. The majority of first-year students will live in open- or split-double style rooms, but there are also single rooms made for one student, and open-triple rooms designed for three or more. Our residence halls are conveniently located near many dining centers, wired for cable TV, and ready for direct connection to the campus computer network. Roommates You’ll be assigned housing and a roommate on an equal basis without regard to race, religion, sexual orientation, or national origin. You can also request a roommate before or during the selection process. Your resident advisor will be responsible for setting floor standards, and making sure you and your roommate(s) are comfortable in your new space.
