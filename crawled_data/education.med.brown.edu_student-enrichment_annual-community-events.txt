Breeze Against Wheeze Breeze Against Wheeze 5K is the biggest charity event organized by medical students each year. The race has drawn upwards of 250 participants in the past as well as numerous supporters within our community. The race was conceived to help finance the Hasbro Children’s Hospital Asthma Camp, a unique program focused on helping children with asthma from disadvantaged backgrounds. The program provides children and their families with the tools, knowledge, and resources necessary to manage pediatric asthma. The camp is an incredible opportunity for these children to enjoy a fun and life-changing summer they would not otherwise have the chance to experience. Bone Marrow Registry and Blood Drive Started in 2006, the Bone Marrow Drive holds annual events to encourage members of the Brown and Providence community to enroll in the National Marrow Donor Program's Match Registry. The registry helps save lives by helping patients in need of marrow donors find a match. Skin Check on the Beach Each summer, the Brown University Department of Dermatology with Dermatology Interest Group volunteers provides free skin cancer screenings on popular beaches in Rhode Island as part of the annual Skin Check event in partnership with Channel 10, Lifespan, the Department of Health, and the Partnership to Reduce Cancer in Rhode Island. This program is annually met with success, and we look forward to continuing to educate the public on how to examine the skin.
