The $250 million initiative prioritizes investing in projects that enhance academic innovation, empower students, transform campus structures and enrich the community. It is an opportunity for the entire Titan family – faculty, staff, alumni and community members to be the difference in elevating the potential of our remarkable students. View Campaign Leadership “Perhaps a true measure of success is not one person scaling a mountain but how many others that person brings along.” – Irena Praitis, CSUF professor of English, comparative literature and linguistics Inspired by the snowcapped San Gabriel mountains on the campus horizon, our campaign logo evokes Titans’ determination, persistence and ascendance to success, all while blazing a path for others.
