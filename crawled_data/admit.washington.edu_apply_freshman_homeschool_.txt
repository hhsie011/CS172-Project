Homeschool applicants are assessed in the same context as other freshman in the UW’s holistic review process. Not sure if you’re a freshman or a transfer student? Let us help. College Academic Distribution Requirements (CADRs) All freshman applicants are required to meet minimum academic distribution requirements as set by the Washington Student Achievement Council (WSAC) and the faculty of the UW. Learn more about freshman CADRs. Test scores Scores from SAT or ACT are not required for 2022 applicants due to the lack of available testing sites in light of the COVID-19 outbreak. However, 2023 home-schooled applicants and applicants who do not have letter or numeric grades will be required to submit SAT or ACT scores. Transcripts Do not send transcripts until you receive a request from the Office of Admissions. The application asks you to provide a detailed account of your academic coursework, and that’s all we need to review your application. Applicants who are admitted and who confirm their intention to enroll at the UW will be required to send final transcripts. At that time, we will verify that all admission requirements have been satisfied. The offer of admission may be withdrawn if important discrepancies are discovered. Final college transcripts are also required for applicants who attended college.
