Search committees are typically given aggregated information on the demographics of the applicant pool for the search, as well as a comparison with the national availability pool for that field using NSF-NORC data. Following the selection of the final candidate, the search committee will prepare a search committee report indicating who the shortlisted candidates were, and why the selected candidate was chosen over the others. When external letters are sought, letter writers will be sent guidelines on avoiding gender bias in letters of recommendation.
