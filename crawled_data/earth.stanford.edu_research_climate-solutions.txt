Climate change, in turn, is affecting other Earth processes. Stanford Earth faculty work across disciplines—and at the interface of atmosphere, ocean, land, ice systems, and human behavior. They characterize climate changes and help develop adaptation strategies that matter to people. Stanford Climate Solutions Finding Climate SolutionsF At Stanford, we focus on understanding and communicating climate change risks, as well as how to limit and adapt to those changes.
