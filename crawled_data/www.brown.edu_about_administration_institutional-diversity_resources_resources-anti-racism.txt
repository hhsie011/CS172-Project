We also hope the resources we have assembled will inspire you to begin or continue disrupting anti-black racism in organizational settings as well as in your daily life. We encourage you to use the list below to expand your knowledge on anti-blackness and systemic racism, look into forms of meaningful allyship, and come to learn some of organizations that are deeply committed to this work. (In compiling this list OIED’s goal is not to endorse but rather provide resources based on the inquiries received in our office). If you would like further guidance on transforming knowledge to practice after engaging in critical self-reflection, please feel free to email us at [email protected].
