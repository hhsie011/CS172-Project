There are several opportunities at both the graduate and undergraduate levels to seek financial support through government programs; state, university and school scholarships and fellowships; and other finanical packages. Scholarships and Aid Cockrell School undergraduates received more than $5.6 million in merit-based awards this past year, including awards for first-year and current students. UT Austin recommends a completed FAFSA to be considered for available university scholarships. Graduate Funding The Cockrell School offers academically competitive students financial packages that include one or more fellowships, paid teaching or research positions, insurance and tuition coverage. After completing an admission application, students will be considered for any available fellowships and accompanying support. Tuition Waivers To be eligible for an out-of-state (non-resident) tuition waiver, a student must receive an academically competitive scholarship or fellowship of $1,000 or more during an academic year. Waivers are rarely available for undergraduate students. Privacy Policy | Web Accessibility Stay up to date with Cockrell School news!
