Grounded in the areas defined by the University as most critical for Brown’s overall academic excellence, the plan lays out a vision for how the Library can do more to help realize key University goals and contribute to Brown’s distinction in the wider scholarly world. The 2019-2024 strategic plan grew out of work begun in 2017-2018 to review the mission, organization, direction, and operations of the Library. The resulting plan benefited from the vision and work of many staff and the valuable input from faculty, students, staff, administrators, and other stakeholders. The Library’s operational plan establishes key strategic priorities and sets forth a path to help the Library achieve new levels of effectiveness in managing its resources and fulfilling its mission. As a working document, the operational plan will adjust over time, building on the strides made towards accomplishing our strategic goals and reflecting the dynamic environment in which the Library operates. Ongoing progress will be tracked on the Status Matrix while more detailed measures for specific goals will be showcased on the Metrics Dashboard (forthcoming).
