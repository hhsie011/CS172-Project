In pursuit of this goal, a limited number of funding opportunities are available to help offset costs associated with serious study and disciplined exploration of the theater. Students attending the Theater Department's Foreign Study Program in London may seek Kingsdale Fund support in order to attend additional theatrical productions. Student-produced productions such as Theater Major Julie Solomon '17's "Away This Night" may receive support through the Kingsdale Fund. Photo Rob Strong. PreviousNext For Majors, Minors, and other Advanced Theater Students The Kingsdale Fund The Kingsdale Fund was established in 1994 by James R. Kingsdale ’65 to help advanced theater students underwrite the costs of creative and/or research projects. Kingsdale grants support expenses directly related to these projects, such as travel, production costs, or the acquisition of research materials. For all Theater Students with Financial Aid Need-based Funding Students with a demonstrable financial need may request additional funding from the department beyond the parameters of typical Kingsdale Fund support. Need-based funding is most often granted to support FSP-related expenses, but students may submit requests in support of other initiatives. For all Theater Students with Financial Aid The Goldner Mini-Fellowship A pilot program, the Goldner Mini-Fellowship is designed for students with demonstrable financial need who are unable to participate fully in department productions due to the time constraints associated with work study or other job obligations. For all Theater Students Funding opportunities at the College In addition to funding opportunities in the Department of Theater, students can apply for additional funding from the College to support independent projects and arts internships. We recommend that you share your proposal with a faculty member for feedback since that can help to ensure your chances of success. For all Theater Students Funding for Graduate Studies If you are planning on continuing your studies in Theater after graduation, here are a few resources for Funding for Graduate Studies.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Theater Undergraduate Overview Equity and Inclusivity Peer Advisors and Student Representatives The Major Major Requirements Honors Thesis The Modified Major Modified Major Requirements Modifying another Major with Theater The Minor Minor Requirements Courses: offerings by term Course Descriptions Instructor Permission Courses Independent Study Off-Campus Exchange National Theater Institute For Prospective Students Onstage Overview Get Involved Performing and Auditions Directing and Designing Playwriting Stage Managing The Scene Shop The Costume Shop Now Onstage: Upcoming Productions Season Archives: Past Productions Production Photos About Student Productions Workshops and Full Productions Studio Lab: Exploring Theatrical Boundaries YourSpace: Performance Spaces for Creative Minds Student Work in the time of COVID About MainStage Productions Opportunities Overview Summer Theater Lab: Cultivating New Work VoxLab Frost and Dodd Play Festival New York Theatre Workshop Residency The VOICES Program Experiential Learning with Northern Stage Testimonials Student Funding Opportunities Kingsdale Fund Need-Based Funding Goldner Mini-Fellowship Other funding opportunities Funding for Graduate Studies Internships, Fellowships, and Graduate Programs The Neukom Institute Literary Arts Award in Playwriting Foreign Study News & Events All News and Events MainStage Production News Student Production News Honors Thesis Productions Summer Theater Lab News Faculty News Student News Visiting Artist News Alumni News People Faculty and Staff Visiting Artists Alumni Tell Us Your Story Theater and Performance Studies My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
