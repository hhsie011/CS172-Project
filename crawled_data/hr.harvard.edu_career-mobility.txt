Open to benefits-eligible staff with a Harvard Key, this all-virtual event will be held on Thursday, June 9, 12 pm to 4 pm. The agenda will feature career programming, networking opportunities, and the always-popular resume review and critique. As an event attendee, you'll be able to: Connect directly with representatives of Harvard schools and units across the University Explore future opportunities as you listen to inspiring career stories Sharpen your knowledge of career development tools and resources At Harvard, our philosophy is that career development is a process where employees strategically explore, plan and create their future paths with feedback and guidance from their managers and information and resources from the University. Current staff members are encouraged to use the resources here – including your manager, human resources, training and education opportunities – and to see Harvard as an active partner in advancing your career. We’re committed to internal mobility for staff members, whether that means growing in place by exploring new responsibilities and enrichments, or advancing to a new position. As you consider internal opportunities, maybe you’ll be interested in tuition reimbursement for an advanced degree. Maybe you’ll be looking for resources to help you prepare for a different position, or skills training for a stretch position. Or you might be interested in opportunities to network with others to improve your chances. There are additional opportunities for those at the managerial level, including manager training and Executive Education Fellowships, which let you learn and network with other managers and leaders. If you’re ready to do your part to advance yourself, we’re ready to help you pursue the future you want.
