Get Involved In the Cockrell School, education happens inside and outside of the classroom.

Practice entrepreneurship and make your ideas a reality by establishing your own student organization, event or even your own start-up with the help of entrepreneurial programs on campus. Learn more Explore Austin There's a reason — multiple reasons — why Austin is consistently named at the top of best-city lists. There are the obvious standout qualities: a sunny, temperate climate year-round; a music, arts and culture scene that's ever-changing; and its position as a major technology hub with a thriving economy and job market. And then there are the extra qualities that make Austin special: an open-minded spirit that welcomes all; the natural beauty built into the city; and no shortage of festivals, events and activities happening at all times of year. Students can ride public transportation for free with your UT ID, and with Austin being walkable and bike-friendly, you should get away from campus when you can and experience your new home city.
