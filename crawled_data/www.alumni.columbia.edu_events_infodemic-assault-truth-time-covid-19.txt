One overlooked aspect of COVID-19 is that autocrats around the world—in China, Russia, Egypt, Iran, Brazil, India, and the Trump White House—have used the pandemic to censor information and flood the airwaves with lies, in the name of crisis management. As a result, democratic institutions and governance across the globe have vastly deteriorated, and the effects may be felt long after the pandemic is over. CGR director Nick Lemann will moderate a conversation between authors Joel Simon and Robert Mahoney, longtime senior leaders of the Committee to Protect Journalists, Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr founder and director of ICAP, and investigative journalist Sheila Coronel discussing how to use the pandemic experience to strengthen our information ecosystem—and restore trust in our democratic institutions worldwide.
