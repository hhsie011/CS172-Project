Pronoun data (test data) is available from UW-IT Enterprise Web Services and Events.

Several test identities can be used to test integrations and display of pronouns in applications. These test identities are available in UW-IT Enterprise Web Services and Events, and are described further in the uw-iam-pronouns-test-data repository.
