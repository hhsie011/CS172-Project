When determining admissibility, we look at a number of factors such as academic performance, motivation and interests, and English proficiency. Please review dates and information on admission decisions below. Viewing Your Decision Letter You will receive an email after a decision has been made, prompting you to log in to your Student Portal to view your admission decision. If admitted, you will be eligible to register for courses within any program as long as you meet course prerequisites and minimum eligibility requirements. Please reference individual program pages for eligibility requirements. Early Action Decisions If you complete your application by January 14, you will receive your admission decision on January 28. Early Action admits will be eligible to register for courses starting on January 31. The application form and any supplemental requirements (e.g., recommendation) must be received by January 14 for your application to be considered complete. We recommend you begin working on your application well in advance of January 14. Rolling Admissions If you do not submit your application by the Early Action deadline, your application will be reviewed on a rolling basis, with an initial decision release date of February 7. After February 7, applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis until courses reach capacity. In most cases, admission decisions are made within 10-15 business days of receiving a complete application. Denials Not all applicants who apply will be admitted. In addition to denials based on academic performance, applicants may be denied admission if: We have concerns about your English language proficiency (for students whose primary language isn’t English). You don’t meet minimum eligibility requirements for any program. It was found in our review that any portion of your application, such as your essay, was plagiarized or not completed independently. Redirects As part of our holistic review process, when reviewing an application, we may make note that you are better suited for a smaller subset of courses. This may be decided based on your English language proficiency or your age. If this occurs, you will be redirected to this smaller subset of courses from which you may choose. Confirming Attendance with a Program Deposit If admitted, you must confirm your attendance by submitting a $300 non-refundable program deposit. This deposit will enable you to register for open courses in the catalog. Admission does not guarantee registration in a specific course or program. Questions? Questions regarding your application?
