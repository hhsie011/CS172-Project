Admission of PSEO applicants to Iowa State University Iowa State is pleased to offer qualified high school students the opportunity to enhance their education by taking college-level courses. Because the grades earned in these courses are reflected on a college transcript that will follow the student for life, we want to make sure PSEO applicants are prepared for the rigor of Iowa State coursework and are likely to be successful academically. When reviewing a PSEO applicant, the Office of Admissions reviews the student’s preliminary high school transcript to project whether the student would likely be admissible as a freshman applicant upon high school graduation. Detailed information concerning Iowa State’s freshman admission requirements may be found at www.admissions.iastate.edu/freshman/requirements.php If the preliminary transcript suggests the student would likely meet Iowa State’s freshman admission requirements upon graduation from high school, the PSEO applicant will be approved for admission.
