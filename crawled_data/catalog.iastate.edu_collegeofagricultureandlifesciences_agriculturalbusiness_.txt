Overview Degree Requirements Four Year Plan Undergraduate Minor Graduate Programs Catalog Home > Undergraduate Majors, Certificates, Minors, Pre-Professional Study > Agriculture and Life Sciences > Agricultural Business The Department of Economics offers coursework for a Bachelor of Science degree in Agricultural Business. The major in Agricultural Business prepares students for advanced studies (e.g., Masters or Ph.D. in Agricultural Economics, Law School, MBA, etc) and for careers in agricultural finance, management in agricultural supply and marketing industries, commodity merchandising and research, business research and management, farm and ranch operations, commercial farm management and appraisal, agricultural sales and marketing, agricultural reporting and public relations, agricultural extension, international activities, and government service. A minor in Agricultural Business is also possible. Students majoring in Agricultural Business often choose elective coursework leading to minors in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences or the Ivy College of Business, or that emphasize specific areas within agricultural business such as finance, management, commodity analysis, research, agricultural sales and marketing, environmental economics, farm and ranch operations, international economics, agricultural extension, or government service. A major in Agricultural Business with a minor in Economics is not permitted; however, a double major in Agricultural Business and Economics is permitted. Customization of the Agricultural Business major is possible. Students may request to pursue one of three Business Options in Finance, Marketing, or Supply Chain Management. Electing a Business Option does not change the overall requirements of the Agricultural Business major. Eligibility and coursework requirements for Business Options are maintained and approved by the Department of Economics and details are available on the department website.
