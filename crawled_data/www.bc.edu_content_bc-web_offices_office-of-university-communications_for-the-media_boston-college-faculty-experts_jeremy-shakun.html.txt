He says understanding how and why climate has changed in the past provides insight into what to expect from it in the future. Among his research articles on the topic: “A Reconstruction of Global and Regional Temperature for the Last 11,300 Years” and "Global Warming Preceded by Increasing Carbon Dioxide Concentrations During the Last Deglaciation.” Dr. Shakun’s various studies have been published in the leading journals Nature, Science, and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences; he has spoken about climate change with numerous media outlets, including the BBC, NPR, U.S. News & World Report, Associated Press, New York Times, MSNBC, Christian Science Monitor, Scientific American, WGNH-TV, and WBZ News Radio.
