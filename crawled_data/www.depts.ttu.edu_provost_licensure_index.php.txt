Texas Tech University Directory Raiderlink A-Z Index Professional Licensure Menu Search TTU Office of the Provost Professional Licensure Professional Licensure By law, Texas Tech is required to notify students and potential students about the university's ability to meet licensure requirements in a state. Texas Tech University programs are designed to prepare students for licensure in Texas. Texas Tech has not determined if academic programs meet licensure requirements in states/territories other than Texas. Students enrolling in or changing their major to a program which may lead to licensure should review state requirements of the specific licensing entity. TTU makes every effort to ensure information regarding state licensure boards is current; however, board information and state requirements for licensure may change. In addition to academic requirements, licensing boards may have additional requirements, such as professional examinations, background checks, years of professional experience, training, etc. It is recommended you contact the licensing entity in the state you are seeking licensure for information regarding certification or licensure requirements before beginning a program. Texas Tech shall not be held liable if a student is unable to qualify for licensure or certification in their chosen state/territory.
