Nickoll Professor of History Overview Hal Cook comes from the American Midwest, although he is now a British as well as US citizen, having devoted almost a decade to his work as Professor of the History of Medicine and Director of the Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at UCL. He previously taught at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Harvard University, and has served the communities of the history of medicine and science, as well as history in general, through various professional society committees and editorial work. He takes an interest in global history, science and capitalism, and the history of medicine, especially in the early modern period, with the aim of exploring how some forms of knowledge-making are transcultural; his research has been mostly on the 17th century, in recent years focusing on the relationships between commerce, medicine, and science in the Dutch Golden Age. A book on The Young Descartes: Nobility, Rumor, and War, has recently appeared with the University of Chicago Press, and an edited collection, Translation at Work: Chinese Medicine in the First Global Age, with Brill. He has held several fellowships and has been the recipient of a number of honors and awards, including two book prizes: the Welch Medal of the American Association for the History of Medicine (1997) and the Pfizer Prize of the History of Science Society (2009).

Full Text Research Research Overview Hal Cook's research interests are in the early modern period with special attention to changes in the seventeenth century. He writes about the History of Medicine, Global Knowledge Exchanges and Appropriations, the Scientific Revolution, Science and Commerce, the Politics of Knowledge, the Dutch Golden Age and, most recently, Descartes's World. Research Statement I have investigated the "rise of modern science" in early modern Europe, especially as viewed through the eyes of medical practitioners, first by looking at London and England, then at a Dutch doctor who emigrated to London and was tried for malpractice there in the 1690s, and then by looking into medicine and natural history in The Netherlands and wherever the Dutch entangled themselves in the larger world. I have helped to pioneer the use of the medical marketplace as a historical tool of investigation, encouraged attention not only to medical concepts but to practices, substances, and people, and pressed for a better understanding of the slipperiness and stickiness of knowledge exchanges across borders. Many of these historical interests can be put under the general heading of the subject of transcultural medicine and political economy, an aspect of which is science and capitalism. My recent study of the early life of Descartes -- when he was moving through most of Europe, in armies and on the fringes of princely courts -- situates one of the most recognisable philosophers in those kinds of relationships, too. Descartes was no more a disembodied mind than anyone else, which helps us glimpse the multiple strands of causation at work in the development of "modern science."
