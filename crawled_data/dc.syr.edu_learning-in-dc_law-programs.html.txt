The College of Law puts students at the center of an intellectual, professional, personal, and cultural experience that makes them better lawyers and better leaders throughout their lives. Law Semester in DC Program Syracuse University College of Law’s Semester in DC Program combines professional experience with unique coursework to develop an understanding of how lawyers function in our nation’s capital. Externship placements allow students to work full time as part of a legal team in a variety of different environments—like the Senate, Securities and Exchange Commission, NASA, United Nations, FBI, public defender’s office, and countless other non-profits, government agencies, and corporations. In a weekly course taught by a Syracuse Law faculty member, students study legal issues specific to DC practice. They also write a substantive research paper on a topic related to federal regulation or a legislative topic or process. The Syracuse Law Semester in DC Program is offered three times a year, every summer, fall, and spring semester. Students have the opportunity to network with DC-area alumni and other practitioners each week. Rising 2L and 3L students who are in good standing at Syracuse University’s College of Law are invited to apply.
