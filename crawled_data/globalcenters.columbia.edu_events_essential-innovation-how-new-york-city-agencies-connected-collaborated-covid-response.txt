Multiple City agencies responded to the need by sourcing PPE through donations, purchases, and manufacturing partners. The NYC Mayor's Office of the CTO partnered with vetted expert tech volunteers to create a PPE Dashboard, a comprehensive asset tracker that brings together multiple spreadsheets daily to provide updated counts of PPE inventory, demand, and incoming supplies. Through connection and collaboration across agencies and with external technologists, in less than a week, the NYC CTO team created one unified resource for agencies to share data, gain insights, and report a complete picture of the City's preparedness to key decision-makers." >>> Please join us on JUNE 3 at 5PM (EDT) | 6PM (BRT) for a webinar with professor Alexis Wichowski from Columbia SIPA and Manuel Bonduki, Professor of Innovation in the Public Sector and Behavioral Sciences at INSPER Upcoming Events Columbia Global CentersAmman / Beijing / Istanbul / Mumbai / Nairobi / Paris / Rio / Santiago / Tunis Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
