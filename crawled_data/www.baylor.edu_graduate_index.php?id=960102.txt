What happens if I have already been accepted, and I want to change programs? 5. I have a hold on my account that is preventing me from registering. 6. I was admitted on probation. What does that mean? Admitted Students 1. My application was accepted for the semester to which I applied; however, I will not be able to attend Baylor at that time. Can I change my entry term (earlier or later)? 1) Find out if your program enrolls new students in the semester to which you want to defer. 2) Obtain permission from your department's Graduate Program Director to change your entrance semester. This can be done via email asking if your admission can be deferred to a specific semester. 3) If he or she approves your request, your graduate program director should then email his or her approval to the Graduate School Deferrals to process the request to defer your admission. 4) Once all of the changes have been made, the Graduate School will notify you via your application status page to confirm your new entry term. It is important to note that accepted applications may only be deferred up to one year, after which time, you must reapply. 2. I'm an international student and I've been accepted. Are there additional forms I need to fill out? Please contact the Center for Global Engagement International Student and Scholar Services office by phone (+1.254.710.1461) or by email (ISSS_Support@baylor.edu) for assistance with immigration issues. You can find information online at the International Student and Scholar Services/International Students Welcome page. 3. How do I activate my Bear ID and how is that different than my Baylor ID? See the Baylor ITS (Information Technology Services) Department web pages for explanations and instructions about your IDs at Baylor. 4. What happens if I have already been accepted, and I want to change programs? If you have already enrolled as a student and are taking classes, you will need to fill out a Change of Degree form. Please contact the Assistant Director of Student Records, Alana Schaeper, at Alana_Schaeper@baylor.edu. If the desired degree is under the same department, you will need the approval of your Graduate Program Director. Please have him/her email the requested changes to GraduateAdmissions@baylor.edu. If you are an incoming student and the degree you wish to change to is not under the purview of your current Graduate Program Director, you will need to complete the application process for the degree to which you'd like to apply. 5. I have a hold on my account that is preventing me from registering. If you are a newly accepted student or just starting your 2nd semester, it is most likely a hold due to need for an official transcript showing degree conferred. If you were accepted using unofficial documents, you must submit official copies to validate your admission. If you were accepted with official documents but had not yet completed your degree, you must provide an official transcript showing the degree conferred and the date of graduation. If you are an established graduate student at Baylor [2nd year or beyond], please contact Alana Schaeper at 254-710-3583. 6. I was admitted on probation. What does that mean? Students on probation cannot receive university funding in the form of tuition remission or a stipend. In addition, upon completing 9 hours, you must have earned an overall GPA of 3.0 or higher in order to continue in the program.
