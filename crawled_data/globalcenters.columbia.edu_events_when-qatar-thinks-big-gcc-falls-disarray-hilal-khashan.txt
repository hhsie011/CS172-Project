Saudi Arabia, aided by a sizable geography, a relatively large population, huge oil wealth as well the custodianship of Islam’s two holiest shrines, led the efforts of founding the GCC in 1981. Professor Khashan will delve into how in recent years, the relatively small state of Qatar has sought to carve for itself a niche in Gulf affairs, pan-Arab issues and beyond, all of which has led to the political, diplomatic, and economic isolation of the small state by the GCC. Hilal Khashan is a Professor of Political Science at the American University of Beirut (AUB). He is on the editorial board of Shi'a Affairs Journal and has reviewed manuscripts for Security Dialogue, The Arab World Geographer, The Emirates Center for Strategic Studies and Research and International Studies Perspectives. He has reviewed grant proposals for the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and the Research Council of Norway. Professor Khashan was awarded the Aida al-Sanyura prize in political science in 1990 and the Abdul Hameed Shoman prize for young Arab scholars in 1991. He has also received research grants from the Ford Foundation (1988) and the Frederick Nauman Foundation (1998). Currently, his research interests focus on Middle Eastern regional security, with an emphasis on the Gulf, Shiite Islamic revival and the militarization of Lebanese Shiites. Professor Khashan is the author of five books and over 100 articles, with many of them appearing in publications such as The Journal of Conflict Resolution, International Affairs, The British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies and The Brown Journal of International Affairs, among many more. He is currently working on a book that focuses on the political leadership in Hizbullah. Professor Khashan's first academic appointment was at King Saud University between 1981-84 and he has been teaching at AUB since 1985. He received his PhD from Florida State University in 1980, and his Bachelor’s degree from the University of Florida in 1977.
