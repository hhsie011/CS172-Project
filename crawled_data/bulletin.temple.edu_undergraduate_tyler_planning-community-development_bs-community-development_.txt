Particular emphasis is given to empowering disadvantaged communities to address inequalities and improve their long-term social, economic, and environmental sustainability. The program enables students to lead efforts to create and maintain healthy, sustainable communities by providing a broad-based understanding and awareness of multi-dimensional aspects of urban and suburban community challenges in a metropolitan regional context and the means of effecting change from both grass-roots and public policy perspectives. Eligible undergraduate students can also choose the +1 accelerated B.S. in Community Development and M.S. in City & Regional Planning Program. The accelerated degree program enables students to complete both degree programs in 5 years by taking up to 12 specified graduate credits to fulfill the undergraduate degree requirements. Upon graduation from their undergraduate program, students move seamlessly into their graduate program, which they complete in one additional year. To be eligible for the program, students must be declared community development majors; have a minimum of 3.25 cumulative GPA in at least 45 credits of coursework taken at Temple; be able to complete their undergraduate degree according to the specified academic plan; and be able to complete the graduate degree in one additional year including two summer semesters of graduate coursework. Community development majors apply to the +1 accelerated program in March of their sophomore year. Sasha W.
