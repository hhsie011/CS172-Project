The university is implementing many of the items listed in the plan including: A process for updating university websites with accessibility; A process for including accessibility into university digital course content; Updates to current purchasing procedures and contracts that incorporate accessibility into the procurement process; Implementation of the EIT Accessibility Policy; and An annual training available through Canvas that provides staff, faculty and students with the information they need to understand the university's policies, expectations and resources around eAccessibility. Supporting resources for the EIT Accessibility Plan In recognition of the effort required to implement the EIT Accessibility Plan and Policy, the University has created a cross-functional governance structure including representatives from: the Office of the Provost, Accessibility Resources Clifton, Accessibility Resources Blue Ash, Accessibility Resources Clermont, Office of Equity and Inclusion, Governmental Relations and University Communications, IT@UC, Student Affairs, Administration and Finance, Office of General Council, Faculty Senate, representatives from each UC college, and many more. In addition, the Accessibility Network was created to support university faculty and staff with resources and training to help drive the establishment and sustainability of eAccessibility as part of the university's core commitment to provide an inclusive student environment.
