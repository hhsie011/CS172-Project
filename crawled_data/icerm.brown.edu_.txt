However, with the increasing prevalence of available data from practical experiments, it is of high relevance to include such measurements in the modeling process. Data corresponding to the underlying dynamical systems are available in various formats. For example, among others, in the form of the frequency response. In such cases, one could construct a simplified empirical model of lower dimension that fits the measured data, and hence accurately approximates the original system. This reduced-order system may then be used as a surrogate to predict behavior or derive control strategies. The main motivation of the methods discussed here is that measured system response data can be used in a beneficial way without the need of accessing any prescribed realization of the original model. The balanced truncation (BT) method (introduced by Moore '81) and Loewner-matrix (LM) methodologies (introduced by Mayo/Antoulas '07) are common model reduction approaches. However, only the latter approach (LM) is purely data-driven, while the first is not. We show how to implement a data-driven counterpart of the classical BT approach by using only frequency response data, without explicitly using the model (system's matrices). This recent method (G./Gugercin/Beattie '22) is based on implicitly imposing quadrature approximations on the infinite Gramians, and on constructing the reduced-order model by accessing the transfer function values only. 3:00 - 3:30 pm EDT Coffee Break 11th Floor Collaborative Space June 1, 2022 Spring 2020 Reunion Event 11:00 - 11:45 am EDT Stabilizing Dynamical Systems in the Scarce Data Regime 11th Floor Lecture Hall Steffen Werner, Courant Institute, New York University Abstract Stabilizing dynamical systems in science and engineering is challenging, especially in edge cases and limit states where typically little data are available. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach that guarantees finding stabilizing controllers from as few data samples as the dimension of the unstable dynamics, which typically is orders of magnitude lower than the state dimension of the system. The key is learning stabilizing controllers directly from data without learning models of the systems, which would require larger numbers of data points. Numerical experiments with chemical reactors and fluid dynamics behind obstacles demonstrate that the proposed approach stabilizes systems after observing fewer than five data samples even though the dimension of states is orders of magnitude higher. 2:00 - 3:00 pm EDT Tensor-tensor Algebra for Optimal Representation and Compression of Multiway Data 11th Floor Lecture Hall Elizabeth Newman, Emory University Abstract With ever-growing data resources and modern advancements of data-driven methods, it is imperative that we represent large datasets efficiently while preserving intrinsic features necessary for subsequent analysis. Traditionally, the primary workhorse for data dimensionality reduction and feature extraction has been the matrix singular value decomposition (SVD), which presupposes that data have been arranged in matrix format. However, many data are natively multidimensional and can be more compressible when treated as tensors (i.e., multiway arrays). In this talk, we will provide a brief overview of a particular compressed tensor representation, the t-SVDM, which is formed under an algebraic tensor-tensor product. We will demonstrate that compressed representations obtained from the t-SVDM satisfy Eckart-Young-like optimality results. Moreover, we will show that an optimal t-SVDM representation is provably better than its matrix counterpart and two tensor-based analogs. We will support these theoretical findings with some empirical studies. 3:00 - 3:30 pm EDT Coffee Break 11th Floor Collaborative Space June 2, 2022 Spring 2020 Reunion Event 11:00 am - 12:00 pm EDT Reduced-order modeling and inversion for large-scale problems of geophysical exploration 11th Floor Lecture Hall Mikhail Zaslavsky, Schlumberger Abstract Geophysical exploration using electromagnetic and seismic method involves large-scale forward and nonlinear inverse problems that often have to be solved in real-time. We address this challenge by employing reduced-order models (ROMs) that represent low-dimensional surrogate of full-scale problem. In this talk I will provide an overview of model-driven ROMs we developed for forward modeling as well as structure-preserving data-driven ROMs that are crucial for inverse problems. The latter enable constructing physics-preserved low-order models with direct access to unknowns of inverse problem and, consequently, optimization-free inversion algorithm. I will show numerical examples confirming the advantage of our approaches compared to state-of-the art algorithms.

One of the most successful data assimilation frameworks is the linearized weak-constraint four-dimensional variational assimilation problem (4D-Var), that can be ultimately seen as a minimization problem. One of the main challenges of such approach is the solution of large saddle point linear systems arising as inner linear step within the adopted nonlinear solver. The linear algebraic problem can be solved by means of a Krylov method, like MINRES or GMRES, that needs to be preconditioned to ensure fast convergence in terms of number of iterations. In this talk we will illustrate novel, efficient preconditioning operators which involve the solution of certain Stein matrix equations. In addition to achieving better computational performance, the latter machinery allows us to derive tighter bounds for the eigenvalue distribution of the preconditioned saddle point linear system. A panel of diverse numerical examples displays the effectiveness of the proposed methodology compared to current state-of-the-art approaches.# 3:00 - 3:30 pm EDT Coffee Break 11th Floor Collaborative Space June 3, 2022 Spring 2020 Reunion Event 3:00 - 3:30 pm EDT Coffee Break 11th Floor Collaborative Space June 4, 2022 There are no events currently scheduled for June 4th.

Recent collaborations between universities and government agencies in India and the United States have resulted in detailed observations of oceanic and atmospheric processes in the Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea, and the Indian Ocean, collectively observing manyÂ coupled modes of variability. One key target identified by these groups was the improvement of forecasts of variability of the summer monsoon, which significantly affects agriculture and water management practices throughout South Asia.Â The Monsoon Intraseasonal Oscillation is a northward propagating mode of precipitation variability and is one of the most conspicuous examples of coupled atmosphere-ocean processes during the summer...
