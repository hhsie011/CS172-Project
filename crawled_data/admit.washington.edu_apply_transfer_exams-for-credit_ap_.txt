You can use this procedure even if you take the exam as a junior in high school; the UW will keep your scores until your senior year. If you do not name the UW as a recipient when you take your exam, just contact the College Board and request that scores be sent to the UW Office of Admissions. The UW’s four-digit code is 4854. When you enroll at the UW, you may be eligible for UW credit; if so, information about courses and credit awards will be accessible to you via MyUW. To ensure that your AP scores match up with your UW academic record, be sure to identify your name and date of birth with the College Board in the exact same way you identify, or expect to identify, yourself on your UW application. AP Policy Overview The UW recognizes AP coursework as a challenging academic program that provides excellent preparation for university study. College Board Advanced Placement (AP) exams are scored on a scale of 1 – 5. At the UW, scores of 3 or higher are considered for college credit awards or placement into UW courses. The table below shows the UW’s departmental policies for awarding course equivalencies and credits for each exam. Students who complete two exams with duplicate or overlapping content (e.g. AP and IB), or who complete an exam and a college course with duplicate or overlapping content will be awarded credit for only one exam or course. Note: AP scores may be submitted only for courses taken while in high school and for tests taken during or within six months after leaving high school. AP test results may not be used to waive admission requirements.
