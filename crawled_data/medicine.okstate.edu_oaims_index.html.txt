Improving Health Care for Tribal Communities SImilar to the primary tenets of the osteopathic philosophy, many American Indians believe the mind, body, and spirit are inseparable units when it comes to health and wellness. Improving the overall health of American Indian communities requires the commitment of many including university and tribal leaders who must maintain trust and meaningful partnerships aimed at training the next generation of American Indian health care providers, researcher, and educators. AIMS partners with Oklahoma-based tribes to coalesce traditional ways and culture with western medicine in osteopathic and biomedical training programs to improve the health and wellness of Oklahoma’s tribal and rural citizens. Through recruitment, training, and tribal partnerships, AIMS is helping to address the local health care needs of the American Indian population in Oklahoma. Providing Opportunities and Support for American Indian Students AIMS strives to increase the number of American Indians applying and accepted to programs in osteopathic medicine and graduate programs including the School of Allied Health, School of Biomedical Sciences, School of Forensic Sciences, and the School of Health Care Administration. Success and retention for American Indian students are a high priority for the AIMS office.
