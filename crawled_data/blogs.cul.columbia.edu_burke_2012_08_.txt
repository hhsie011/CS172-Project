Meverden As a doctoral student, and specifically a student of ancient Near Eastern languages, I have learned to become increasingly detail oriented (read: anal retentive) as the years pass.

Kamsler Entrance to Union Theological Seminary Brown Tower When I first saw the posting for the project archivist position at Burke, it was a bit daunting. For one thing, it was a Columbia University Library – the academic library system is one of the top five in the nation.

Kamsler Now that you know a little more about the MRL and WAB collections, as well as the Luce Foundation, I thought it would be useful to explain the reason behind needing this project in the first place. Most, if not all, archives and libraries have what we call "backlog."
