They would load up the car with a huge Italian spread for game day. So much food! Our extended friend group would gather pre and post-game, and it was as much about hanging out with the parents as it was with one another. For me, being from Florida, they were among the many surrogate parents I was fortunate to have during my time at BC, and I have always been grateful to my friends for sharing their families with me. Why did you get involved in your local chapter?: I moved home to South Florida a few years ago after being gone for 20 years. I was living and working in an area different from where I grew up so I was looking for social and professional networking opportunities. Everywhere I have gone in the world I have come across BC grads, and I am still in touch with many of my college friends. Maintaining a connection to BC is important to me. What I found in the local alumni chapter were people like me who recently moved home or were new to Florida looking to keep up that BC connection, as well as those looking to reconnect to BC. Through our chapter I have met fantastic people and had so many thoughtful conversations. What are your local favorites in your city?: I love anywhere I can sit outside and enjoy a great meal or cocktail with a fantastic view of the sun, surf, and sand. I also enjoy exploring the robust South Florida craft beer industry. Fortunately, we have lots of options in the Fort Lauderdale area! Fun Fact: I love to travel. I have been to almost every state in the US and I am really looking forward to getting back out there to check off the remaining ones and revisit many other special places. In the meantime, I plan to explore all that Florida has to offer. Alumni Staff Liaison Name: Maria D'Alessandro '11, CGSOM'18 Contact: knoerrm@bc.edu Events ENGAGE WITH US ON EAGLE EXCHANGE!
