Breadcrumb Home Music Making Sub Navigation In This Section Ensembles Lessons Applied Music Program Guidelines Individual Lessons Students seeking to improve their playing or singing ability have the option of taking individual private lessons with about thirty professional musicians from the greater Boston-Providence area. Our Teaching Associates offer intensive instruction in piano, voice, and all the individual instrument families of the symphony orchestra, the wind ensemble and jazz ensemble. Students may also study instruments such as organ, African drums, harpsichord, tabla, and sitar. Lessons are offered for academic credit and for an additional fee through the Applied Music Program (AMP). Ordinarily, new students audition at the beginning of the fall and the spring semesters. In non-pandemic years, students seeking credit are expected to attend and perform in the group classes, master classes, and juries arranged for their instrument group over the course of the term. Following safety guidelines the University set for all students and faculty, these types of activities will undoubtedly vary from other years. Administration General policy for the AMP is made by the Music Department faculty, subject to approval by the Administration and Corporation. The Chair of the Department of Music is the director of the program and responsible for its administration. Division administrators, appointed annually and reporting to the Chair, are responsible for administration of their divisions.
