Informed by natural and social sciences, arts, and humanities, the Bacc Core requires students to think critically and creatively, and to synthesize ideas and information when evaluating major societal issues. Importantly, the Bacc Core promotes understanding of interrelationships among disciplines in order to increase students' capacities as ethical citizens of an ever-changing world. No single course may be used by a student to satisfy more than one subject area of the Core even though some courses have been approved in more than one area. See Academic Regulation 25(a)(5).
