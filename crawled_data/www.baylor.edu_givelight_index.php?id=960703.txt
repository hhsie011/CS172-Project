Truett Theological Seminary George W. Truett Theological Seminary The George W. Truett Theological Seminary has set an ambitious goal to raise $50 million as part of the Give Light Campaign in order to advance the priorities and areas of growth highlighted within Illuminate, the University Strategic Plan. During the Give Light Campaign, Truett Seminary will focus their fundraising efforts in the following areas: Endowed scholarships to meet the needs of future ministers and equip them for their God-called ministry. Endowed faculty positions and program funding to broaden and deepen academic opportunities and recruit faculty to help the Seminary’s faculty remain equipped for their teaching and outreach. Growth opportunities to enhance Truett’s capacity to prepare future ministers through the Seminary in Houston and through congregational outreach efforts. The following are Truett Seminary’s highest priority fundraising projects that are being highlighted in the current phase of the Give Light Campaign. Truett will bring forward other opportunities for the Baylor Family to support the talented students and faculty within the Seminary. Endowed Scholarships Men and women choose to attend Truett Seminary because they have discerned God’s call upon their lives. During their time in seminary, these students will be trained and equipped to pursue this calling, and upon graduation, they will engage in gospel ministry across the nation and around the world. It is our goal to reduce and even eliminate the financial burden of theological education for these future ministers. Truett Seminary is seeking funding support in the following ways: Endowed Scholarships Expendable Scholarships Travel Funds Baylor’s Seminary in Houston In 2018, Truett Seminary began offering classes leading to the Master of Arts in Christian Ministry (MACM) and the Master of Theological Studies (MTS) degrees in Houston, Texas. The seminary’s Houston campus offers evening classes and intensive courses in order to accommodate the demanding schedules of ministers and working professionals. The Seminary is calling on members of the Baylor Family to support the Houston campus in the following ways: Scholarships for students, many of whom are already working in ministry or in other full-time jobs The funding of a Houston Director, who would manage the day-to-day operations of the campus Gifts to the Program Excellence Fund, which would enable the needs of students, faculty, and staff to be met as they arise Investment in Faculty Support When asked why they chose to pursue their degree at Truett Seminary, our graduates consistently reply, “the faculty.” At Truett, professors serve as examples of academic and ministerial excellence. They are published scholars and experienced ministers, investing in their students’ lives both inside and outside the classroom. It is imperative that they be well resourced in their pivotal roles. The Baylor Family can support Truett’s faculty in the following ways: Endowed chairs and professorships, which in addition to assisting in the recruitment and retainment of world-class faculty, allow professors to make significant contributions to their given fields of study Investment in faculty-led programs, like the Truett’s Sports Ministry Program or Kyle Lake Center for Effective Preaching Ecumenical hires that could lead to the establishment of Methodist, Presbyterian, Episcopalian/Anglican, and other denominational houses Enhance the Truett Church Network Truett Seminary exists to serve the church, and the newly established Truett Church Network seeks to extend and expand that mission. This hub of support and encouragement connects friends of Truett to each other and to the wide array of ministerial resources available through the seminary. Just as Truett seeks to provide quality masters-level and doctoral-level education for ministers-in-training, through the Truett Church Network, the seminary offers support and encouragement to churches, as well as alumni and friends who serve them. Priority funding for the Truett Church Network includes: A Spanish-speaking Online Certificate, which will broaden the reach of the seminary’s not for credit courses and online resources Continuing Education Programming for pastors and ministers through the Dr. W. Winfred Moore Center for Ministry Effectiveness Sports Ministry Programs Truett's Sports Chaplaincy and Ministry programs train leaders at the intersection of faith and sports on and off the field. Truett in Houston Truett's Houston location addresses the educational of non-traditional students. Dr. Michael W. Stroope Professor and the M.C. Shook Chair of Christian Missions Michael W. Stroope, Ph.D., brings a wealth of international missions experience to Truett.
