Instagram About HGSE Campus and Facilities The Campus HGSE is located on Appian Way in the heart of Harvard Square. The campus consists of several buildings and is in close proximity to most other Harvard Schools and an abundance of dining and shopping options. Classrooms HGSE has 19 classrooms for classes of all sizes. Most classrooms are fully equipped to provide faculty with presentation requirements, from audio and video projection to audio and video capture. Multimedia Development Lab The multimedia development lab provides students and faculty with computers set up for a wide variety of media production, including audio and video editing, DVD production, web development, and other applications that might be needed for media-enhanced projects. Public Computers Over 100 public PC workstations, located in Gutman Library and elsewhere on campus, are available to the HGSE community. Additionally, students may use PCs and Macs in the General Computing Area (GCA), located on the third floor of Gutman Library, and wireless connectivity is available throughout most of the HGSE campus. Videoconference Facilities HGSE features several spaces to conduct high-end videoconferences. Faculty host “virtual guest speakers” in which professionals from various fields visit a class session remotely via a videoconference. Conference Rooms and Conference Center HGSE has 26 conference rooms, including a full-service conference center that can be rented by the public for meetings and events. The Commons at Gutman Library Enjoy breakfast, lunch, dinner, or a snack at The Commons at Gutman Library. The Commons' culinary team is proud to offer menu selections such as fresh baked goods, breakfast sandwiches, grilled items and pizza from the stone hearth oven. Recharge with a fresh made salad or home cooked entree in a relaxed cafe setting. Building a Sustainable Community From solar panels on the roof of Gutman and filtered water stations across campus to our four LEED certified building projects, the HGSE Operations Office and Green Team are focused on building and operating a sustainable, energy efficient campus. These efforts are part of Harvard’s University-wide commitment to sustainability, including a goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 30% by 2016.
