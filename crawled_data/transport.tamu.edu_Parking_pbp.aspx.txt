You will also receive an optional 15-minute notification to let you know when your session is about to expire. How does the parking officer know I've paid by phone? When you pay for your parking by phone, your space or license plate number and parking time are automatically displayed on a handheld device used by the parking officer. How many vehicles can I add to my account? You can have up to five vehicles on your ParkMobile account. You can add a vehicle to your account in your Personal Pages, mobile app, or mobile web. Under Settings in your app, view the Vehicle tab to manage the vehicles associated with your account. To manage your vehicles on the ParkMobile site, sign in to your account and choose the Vehicles tab on your Personal Page. What do I need to do if I receive a citation even though I used the ParkMobile app? Although this is unlikely to occur, first review the copy of your ParkMobile receipt to ensure the space, license plate number and time for which you paid matches the space where your vehicle was parked and is within the time indicated on your citation. If you paid for the wrong space number or license plate number or if your time was expired, pay the citation or you may follow the instructions on the citation to file an online appeal. If the space and time paid match the information on the citation, provide your citation number and a copy of the ParkMobile payment receipt that was sent to your email address to the parking office via email to parking@tamu.edu, fax at 979-845-6025, in person at Polo Rd. Building, Suite 350, or by mail to Transportation Services, 1250 TAMU, College Station, TX 77845. Is it safe to do a credit card transaction on the ParkMobile app? Yes. Your credit card number and cardholder information is encrypted to the industry standard and no employee or user has access to any cardholder data. How much does it cost to pay for parking by phone? You pay the stated posted hourly parking rate for the lot where you parked plus a $0.35 transaction fee. For more information, please visit the ParkMobile website.
