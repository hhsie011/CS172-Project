It involves a grounding in the methods of applied mathematics and studies of scientific areas in which significant applications of mathematics are made. The field has a broadly based interdepartmental faculty that can direct student programs in a large number of areas of the mathematical sciences. Many specialized or interdisciplinary programs can be designed for individual students, including, for example, a variety of possibilities in biomathematics. The dissertation is normally a mathematical contribution toward the solution of a problem arising outside mathematics. Students who are interested in this field may also want to investigate the related fields listed under Mathematical Sciences in "Opportunities for Study," pages 7-8.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
