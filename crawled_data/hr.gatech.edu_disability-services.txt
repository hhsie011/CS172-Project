An individual with a disability is a person with a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities; has a record of such impairment; or is regarded as having such impairment. A qualified individual with a disability is one who possesses the requisite skills, education, experience and training for a position, and who can, with or without reasonable accommodation, perform the essential functions of the position the individual desires or holds. What is a Reasonable Accommodation? A reasonable accommodation is defined as a modification or adjustment to the job application process or the work environment that enables a qualified person with a disability to be considered for a position, perform the essential functions of a position, or enjoy the same benefits and privileges of employment as are enjoyed by similarly situated employees without disabilities. Americans with Disabilities Act The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is intended to protect qualified individuals with disabilities from discrimination on the basis of disability with regard to employment decisions, transportation, and services provided by state and local government and telecommunications relay services. It is our policy to provide accessible programs, services, activities, and reasonable accommodations for any student, employee, or visitor with a disability as defined by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Services are available to ensure that individuals with disabilities have an equal opportunity to pursue education and employment and to have access to campus programs, activities, or services.
