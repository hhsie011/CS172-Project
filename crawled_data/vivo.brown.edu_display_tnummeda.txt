Full Text PubMed Research Research Overview My research has focused on knowledge of nature and its place in the society and culture of early modern Europe. I situate my work at the intersection of the history of central Europe and the history of science, examining connections between natural knowledge and print culture, gender, commerce, state building, and satire in the early modern period. I am particularly interested in the history of alchemy, and have begun to dip my toe into digital humanities as well. My first book, Alchemy and Authority in the Holy Roman Empire (University of Chicago Press, 2007), examined how three groups – entrepreneurial princes, cultural critics, and alchemical practitioners – competed to shape the meaning of alchemy in sixteenth and seventeenth-century central Europe. In addition to several essays that emerged from this project, I have published more generally on print culture and science in two additional essays, one (with Paula Findlen) on scientific publishing and another on the Jesuit polymath Athanasius Kircher. My most recent monograph, The Lion’s Blood: Alchemy and End Time in Reformation Germany (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2019), takes up questions of gender, the body, and religious culture in connection with alchemy. Donna Bilak and I explored the potential of digital publishing in Furnace and Fugue: A Digital Edition of Michael Maier's Atalanta fugiens (1618) with Scholarly Commentary (University of Virginia Press, Studies in Early Modern German History, 2020). Research Statement As a historian of early modern Europe and a historian of science, I have primarily used the history of alchemy to examine questions of gender, court culture, natural knowledge, religious reform, and the body. Most recently, I have published two essays that attempt to frame the contours of these fields: the introduction to a 2013 special issue of Ambix on "Alchemy in Christian Europe," for which I also served as guest editor, and "Words and Works in the History of Alchemy," part of a 2011 Focus section in Isis on “Alchemy and the History of Science.” My most recent monograph, Anna Zieglerin and The Lion's Blood: Alchemy, Gender, and the Last Days in Reformation Germany (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2019), uses the dramatic tale of Anna Zieglerin's rise and fall at a ducal court in the 1570s as a point of entry into the intersection of science, gender, and religious culture in Reformation Germany. One of the few women alchemists about whom we have extant sources, Zieglerin practiced alchemy in her own laboratory, recorded her recipes involving a golden oil called the lion's blood, and attracted the support of a German duke for her alchemical work. At the same time, she articulated an eschatological program in which she, as a "new Virgin Mary," would use the lion's blood to repopulate the world in preparation for the Last Days. In positioning her body and her alchemy at the center of a spectacular cosmic drama, Zieglerin offers an opportunity to explore the porous boundary between science and religion in the era of the Reformation. My first essay associated with this project, “Alchemical Reproduction and the Career of Anna Maria Zieglerin (c. 1550-1575),” won the Society for the History of Alchemy and Chemistry’s 2000 Partington Prize, a triennial award “for an original and unpublished essay on any aspect of the history of alchemy or chemistry,” and was published in the Society’s journal, Ambix, in 2001. In 2011, I published “Anna Zieglerin’s Alchemical Revelations” in Secrets and Knowledge in Medicine and Science, edited by Alisha Rankin and Elaine Leong. In connection with Brown's Digital Publishing Initiative, Donna Bilak and I have explored the possibilities of digital technologies for understanding early modern knowledge. Conceived from the outset as a digital publication, Furnace and Fugue: A Digital Edition of Michael Maier's Atalanta fugiens with Scholarly Commentary (University of Virginia Press, 2020) brings together new interdisciplinary scholarship on the German physician and alchemist Michael Maier's Atalanta fugiens (1617/1618) with a dynamic, enhanced digital edition of the text itself. This extraordinary alchemical emblem book re-casts Ovid's tale of Atalanta—the fleet-footed virgin—as a series of fifty emblems set to music. Comprised of text, image, and canons for three voices, each individual emblem engages sound, sight, and intellect; read together, these emblems serve as an interlocking guide to alchemical theory and the production of the philosophers’ stone. As a pilot project of the Digital Publishing Initiative, Furnace and Fugue seeks to bridge the gaps between the readers of today and their seventeenth century counterparts. By transforming Atalanta fugiens into a dynamic, scholarly, digital object through the collaboration of historians, musicians, rare book curators, linguists, scientists, artists, and other scholars, Furnace and Fugue reflects a dynamic, emergent form of interdisciplinary scholarship. My first book, Alchemy and Authority in the Holy Roman Empire (University of Chicago Press, 2007; pb ed. 2019) argues that debates about fraud, carried out in alchemical treatises, laboratories, satires, paintings, and courtrooms, are crucial to understanding the varieties of alchemical practice in the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Holy Roman Empire. As patrons and practitioners alike sought to navigate an increasingly vibrant and unregulated market for alchemy, they employed the category of the fraudulent alchemist to marginalize competitors, explain failed alchemical processes, and define what they envisioned the “true” alchemy to be. At the same time, literary authors and artists increasingly drew on the figure of the alchemist as a symbol of social and commercial deceit. By working on two levels, as an archivally-based social history of alchemical practice and a cultural history of why alchemy proved to be so contentious, this book not only reveals diverse understandings of what “real” alchemy was and who could practice it; it also connects a set of little-known practitioners to the largest questions about state-building, trust, and intellectual authority in early modern Europe. Prior to the appearance of Alchemy and Authority, I published several articles in connection with this research. My essay on alchemical practice and commerce appeared in the 2001 state of the field anthology Merchants and Marvels: Commerce, Science and Art in Early Modern Europe, edited by Pamela Smith and Paula Findlen and published with Routledge. I also completed a pair of essays arguing for a critical reexamination of fraud in connection with alchemy: “The Problem of Fraud in Early Modern Alchemy” (in Shell Games: Studies in Scams, Frauds and Deceit, 1300-1650, 2004) and “On the Utility of Fraud” (in Chymists and Chymistry: Studies in the History of Alchemy and Early Modern Chemistry, 2008). In addition to the cluster of essays connected with Alchemy and Authority, I also published two pieces that extended beyond my main focus on alchemy. In a 2000 co-authored essay, Paula Findlen and I explored connections between new ideas about nature and new forms and genres of printed books in seventeenth-century Europe. The second essay (in The Great Art of Knowing: The Baroque Encyclopedia of Athanasius Kircher, 2001) argued that the Jesuit polymath Athanasius Kircher’s work on the terrestrial sphere, particularly his spectacular book Mundus Subterraneus (1664-65), was an attempt to elevate what he called the “geocosm” and make it a fitting a subject of natural philosophy. In these two essays, I was able to explore my interests in the history of the book and the history of science broadly. Funded Research 2018: The Richard B.
