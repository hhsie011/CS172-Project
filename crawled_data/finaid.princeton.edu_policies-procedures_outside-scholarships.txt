Once this is eliminated, any additional outside scholarships will replace your Princeton grant. If your Princeton grant is reduced as the result of an outside scholarship, you may recover reduced funds toward the one-time purchase of a personal computer. This policy applies to basic hardware and software products up to $3,500. Federal and state grants do not replace the student earnings expectation—instead, these need-based awards reduce Princeton grant. All outside scholarships must be reported to our office—to report scholarship and donor information, please email faoffice@princeton.edu. Students searching for outside scholarships may wish to visit fastweb.com or the Army ROTC website.
