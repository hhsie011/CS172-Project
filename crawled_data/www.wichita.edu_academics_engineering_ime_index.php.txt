Industrial engineers apply scientific knowledge to solve problems in manufacturing and other industries, businesses, and institutions, focusing on productivity improvement through better use of human resources, financial resources, natural resources and manmade structures and equipment. IEs apply a full range of analytical, simulation, and experimentation tools that are applied to problems in designing, planning, implementing, and operating systems. These problems are found in a wide variety of service organizations (such as, banks, hospitals, social service and governmental agencies), project-based firms (such as, construction and consulting), and product-based firms (such as, processing, manufacturing, and electronics). The focus of industrial engineering is systems integration and improvement. Industrial Engineering at Walt Disney >> Industrial and Systems Engineers Make a Difference >> What do manufacturing engineers do? Manufacturing Engineering is concerned with converting raw materials and intermediate products into final and other intermediate products through the use of various design, processing, assembly, and automation techniques as well as the design and manufacturing of tools, jigs, and machines used in these processes. The strength of the Product Design and Manufacturing Egnineering program at Wichita State is its emphasis on the following manufacturing engineering areas: materials and processes; product engineering and assembly; industrial robotics and automation; manufacturing quality and productivity. Manufacturing engineers can apply their broad and comprehensive skills in a wide spectrum of industries.
