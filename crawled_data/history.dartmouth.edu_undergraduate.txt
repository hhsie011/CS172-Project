Founded in 1894, the History Department has long offered one of the most popular majors and broadest course selections in the undergraduate College. It is impossible to understand today's world without studying how people lived in the past. Historical forces have made every aspect of our contemporary existence, from political divisions to patterns of migration, technological innovation, and ecological devastation. Through history, we grasp that there is nothing "natural" or "inevitable" about our lives; they are the product of past generations' choices, contingencies, and challenges. But while the past fundamentally shapes our present, we can also use this knowledge to effect change; only by studying and understanding how we came to be can we create new possibilities for the present and the future. Through studying history, you will also develop excellent writing, analytical, and above all, critical reading and thinking skills. In particular, history teaches you how to carefully read and assess different sources of information. History therefore offers an outstanding foundation for a wide array of careers: our majors work in every field from law, entertainment, and finance to education and social justice. PreviousNext Tradition History traditionally has stood at the heart of Dartmouth's emphasis on the liberal arts. Our curriculum—broadly international in its reach and deep in its chronological perspective—serves to prepare society's future citizens and leaders to understand the world in which they live, its historical development and inter-relatedness. History helps students appreciate their place within that world, and hence something about who they are and what makes them tick. Not surprisingly, History achieves special relevance during periods of global crisis and uncertainty, as young people grapple with the confusing and troubling events of the day. The Profession Some of our graduates go on to enrich our profession. The Department currently has former majors pursuing advanced degrees at Berkeley, Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Princeton, Michigan, Stanford, Virginia and Wisconsin—among other graduate schools—and former students teach in some of the most prestigious universities here and abroad. Yet most of the students drawn to our courses have no interest in becoming historians. Instead, they go on into careers in business and the professions, embracing any number of interesting experiences and occupations along the way. Wherever they end up, our graduates find continuing value in what they learned in our courses—we know this because they stay in touch and tell us so. The Appeal The breadth of our discipline's appeal is understandable. The perspective of History has practical use as a mode of thinking and inquiring with everyday applications. The things historians do—in exploring the complex relationships between causes and consequences, in adducing explanations that best fit the evidence, in constructing and articulating nuanced arguments—not only can have enormous importance in one's daily life, but also in whatever world of practical affairs one happens to inhabit. Students necessarily develop skills of critical thinking and analysis that include awareness of sources, contexts, interrelations and interactions, comparisons and contingency. Students in our more advanced courses also come to appreciate History as an empirically based discipline that operates within historiographical traditions—appreciating, indeed, that History itself has a history. All our students are required to develop bibliographic research skills in varying degrees, and quite a few apply them to independent projects of impressive scope and sophistication. Finally, History at Dartmouth is writing-intensive. The skills honed in writing many papers that are thoroughly critiqued by faculty who care about style as well as substance can be applied in any walk of life where persuasiveness and clarity of expression are valued.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of History Undergraduate Overview History FAQs for First Year and Transfer Students How to Declare a Major or Minor in History Major Modified Major Minor Transfer Credit Policy Course Descriptions First-Year Seminars Introductory Africa, Asia, Latin America & The Caribbean (AALAC) Europe (EUR) Interregional & Comparative (INTER) United States (US) Seminars & Colloquia Independent Study & Honors Course Schedule 2021-2022 Schedule 2022-2023 Schedule 2023-2024 Schedule Course Syllabi Honors Thesis Program General Timeline Guidelines for the Class of 2022 Guidelines for the Class of 2023 Honors Theses By Year Phi Alpha Theta Honors Society Prizes After Graduation Alumni Update Research Overview Faculty Research Initiatives Dartmouth History Institute Student Research Initiatives and Resources The Dartmouth Vietnam Project History Librarian Research Funding Resources Undergraduate Research Database Student Class Projects Foreign Study News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
