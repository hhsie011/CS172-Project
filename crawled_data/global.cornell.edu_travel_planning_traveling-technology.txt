When traveling internationally, remote devices and the information they contain should be protected while accessing the internet or not physically under your control. CIT has compiled helpful information and suggests that you start preparing weeks before leaving on an international trip. Mobile electronic devices such as laptops, tablets, and cell phones, when taken abroad, might be successfully attacked with malware and automated attack tools. Even when kept current with security software, these devices may not be able to thwart such an attack. Some countries, such as China, Israel, and Russia, have restrictions on importing and using encryption tools and do not allow cryptography tools to be imported or used within their borders without a license, or in some extreme cases, at all. Under these restrictions, any country can potentially confiscate systems entering or leaving their borders. For that reason, we strongly recommend loaner devices. Cornell's High-Risk Travel Loaner Program is available to faculty and executive staff. If travel to one of these countries is a frequent or routine occurrence and/or loaner equipment isn't a viable option, contact your designated IT Security Liaison for support (NetID required).
