As of September 25, 2017, the 20th Class Day of the Fall 2017 semester, Texas Tech University reported to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB) an enrollment of undergraduate full-time equivalent (FTE) students that is 27.8% Hispanic students. Can I apply to HSI grant opportunities at the Department of Education? No. Although we meet the enrollment criteria to be classified as an HSI, the Department of Education bases grant eligibility on IPEDS data, which lags two years behind. What is IPEDS? IPEDS is the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System. It is a system of interrelated surveys conducted annually by the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). IPEDS gathers information from every college, university, and technical and vocational institution that participates in the federal student financial aid programs. The Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, requires that institutions that participate in federal student aid programs report data on enrollments, program completions, graduation rates, faculty and staff, finances, institutional prices, and student financial aid. Can I apply to HSI grant opportunities at other federal agencies? It depends on the program/program officer. Some programs require only proof of an enrollment of 25% Hispanic undergraduates, while other programs require institutions to be listed on the Department of Education's (ED) eligibility list. Generally, programs that require institutions to be on the ED eligibility list will have language that requires the institution to satisfy the HSI definition as specified in Section 502 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C 1101a). Some program officers, though their program states a requirement to be included on ED's eligibility list, will still allow TTU to submit an application and prove our enrollment eligibility for this school year but you must contact that program officer to get permission to submit. How do I know which opportunities are available? The TTU HSI Grants Subcommittee has a list of HSI grant opportunities posted on https://www.depts.ttu.edu/diversity/ HSI/grants/. Eligibility for each opportunity is identified within the list. If the grant opportunity you are interested in is not listed and you are unsure of TTU's eligibility, please contact the program officer for clarification and report your findings to the HSI Grants Subcommittee. What do I need to tell the program officer about TTU's Hispanic enrollment so that I can submit to an HSI grant opportunity? TTU has a Hispanic student enrollment of 27.8% as of Fall 2017. However, because IPEDS data lags two years behind, TTU will not be listed on the Department of Education's eligibility list until IPEDS publishes 2017-2018 school year data. Will TTU be allowed to apply for this grant opportunity with proof of Hispanic enrollment criteria alone? What information will I need to submit as proof of enrollment?Will TTU be allowed to apply for this grant opportunity with proof of Hispanic enrollment criteria alone?
