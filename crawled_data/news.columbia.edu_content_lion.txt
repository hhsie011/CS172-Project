In Like a Lion? Photo credit: Eileen Barroso April 29, 2022 The old saying "in like a lion, out like a lamb" usually refers to the weather in March, but with this month's rain and cold weather, the proverb seems appropriate for April as well. Here's to better weather in the days ahead, particularly for our graduation ceremonies on May 18 and May 19!
