The answer is simple: It’s what TU graduates can do that sets them apart. Their high achievement typically begins with small, student-centered language classes, continues with a study abroad experience and concludes with challenging advanced-level courses. Students of Language and Literature acquire greater awareness of and appreciation for other cultures; develop proficiency in a target language and a basic understanding of its linguistic structure; gain a deeper understanding of textual analysis and literary genres, styles, and periods; engage with current scholarship; and prepare themselves to participate in a global society. As a significant component for the college experience, every language student is encouraged to participate in a study abroad program to acquire cultural literacy and fluency in a foreign language. “As many languages you know, as many times you are a human being.” – Czech saying International Business and Language The Bachelor of Science in International Business and Language degree combines the business core, emphasis on international business and language proficiency in Chinese, French, German, Russian or Spanish.
