Adams Nanofabrication Facility Menu link to menu page Search this unit Start search Submit Search Ralph N. Adams Nanofabrication Facility Our Purpose The KU Nanofabrication Facility is a Core Lab supported by the University of Kansas Center for Research and the Center for Molecular Analysis of Disease Pathways. The KU Nanofab primarily caters to researchers who are manufacturing micro- and nanofluidic devices for biomedical research, but has the equipment and resources to accommodate broad research applications with micro- and nanofabrication needs. Our Facility The KU Nanofabrication Facility is located in the newly-constructed Gray-Little Hall in the Central District of the University of Kansas Lawrence campus. The facility consists of about 1,300 ft2 of ISO class 5, 1,700 ft2 of ISO class 6 and 2,700 ft2 of ISO class 7 cleanroom space. Our Capabilities The facility house tools and materials for techniques including photolithography, nano-imprint lithography, plasma (dry) etching (ICP-RIE), wet etching, metal and dielectric material thin film deposition, metrology, wafer dicing, laser ablation and engraving, 3D printing, and hot embossing. In addition, the facility has numerous microscopes for general inspection, ovens and furnaces, ultrapure water, dedicated process fume hoods and filtered lighting for photolithography. COMSOL software for device modeling is available for paying users as well.
