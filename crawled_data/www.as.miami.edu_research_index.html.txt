The A&S research community is led by more than 400 faculty scholars who are redrawing the boundaries of their respective fields. Centers and Institutes – 13 collaborative research efforts across the humanities, social sciences, physics, medicine and more Research Opportunities for A&S Students Central to our mission as a research university is to train both undergraduate and graduate students in the rigorous process of inquiry and analysis that results in meaningful discovery. The best way to acquire solid research skills is through original, hands-on research experience under the guidance of faculty mentors. To promote and fund student research on all levels, A&S offers a number of research grants, scholarships, and research-enriched learning opportunities. Office of Undergraduate Research and Community Outreach Undergraduate Research Scholarships PRISM – Advanced Program for Integrating Science and Math Da Vinci Scholars Program Graduate Research Grants and Fellowships Community Impact & Engagement By conducting community-based research, A&S faculty are addressing the most pressing challenges to the health, education, and economic vitality of South Florida. But this “local” research has a broader impact: insight into such topics as the economic and cultural effects of population migration, the preservation of wetland species diversity, or the history of race and colonialism in world literature deepen our understanding of the world and point to solutions to our shared challenges.
