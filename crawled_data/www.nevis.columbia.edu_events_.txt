Columbia University physicists and scientists present an overview of the experiments our world-renowned research teams are working on. The lectures are given on the second Thursday of the month during the school year. Each lecture begins at 7PM unless otherwise noted. Nevis seminars The Nevis Seminars are for Nevis scientists to share their work with each other. The talks are technical, and are intended for people with a strong background in physics. Group visits We invite school, scout, and activity groups for private visits to Nevis Laboratories. These visits are handled on a case-by-case basis, but generally all groups get a tour of our laboratories and educational discussions regarding the science experiments which our scientists participate in. Please contact us to make arrangements for your group. WEBMASTER
