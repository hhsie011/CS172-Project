With the WHS just on the horizon, Columbia Global Centers | Istanbul is bringing together a group of specialists from Turkey who have been actively involved in the lead-up to the Summit. The panel discussion will shed light on the goals of the WHS and why its Agenda for Humanity matters for Turkey and the international community. Representatives from NGOs, humanitarian organizations, the media, academia and others are invited to participate and contribute to the event. Kindly note that the event will be held in Turkish. A briefing note summarizing the discussion will be made available in English in a few weeks. Please RSVP.
