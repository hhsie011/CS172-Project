For the 2022 application cycle all interviews will be conducted virtually. Interview days are held every Thursday and most Fridays, from mid-September through February. Applicants will be invited by email to schedule interviews on selected dates and are expected to schedule their interview date online as soon as the invitation is received. All applicants will be notified by March whether or not they will be invited to interview. If selected for an interview, your interview day at Alpert Medical School will include the following: a group session focusing on the admissions process, financial aid, and an overview of the school, including a virtual tour of the building; a session with current medical students; and two half-hour, individual meetings with students, faculty, and/or administrative staff who serve as voting members of the MD Admissions Committee. Interviewees to the combined MD-ScM Program will interview on the same days as those applying only to the Regular MD Program and must qualify for the Regular MD Program first. Decisions for the MD-ScM Program are made in March; see our FAQ section for more information.
