The US government requires reporting of information throughout the entire OPT period. Because most students are not enrolled while on OPT, the fee will help offset the post-graduation costs associated with mandatory monitoring and reporting. Beginning February 1, 2022, KU students will pay ISS a $170 fee before ISS submits recommendations for initial post-completion OPT or for STEM OPT extensions. This fee was approved by the Kansas Board of Regents in Spring 2021, but implementation was delayed for one year.
