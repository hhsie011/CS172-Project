The museum has numerous spaces including the Mary Alice Gallery, The Donna R. Danielson conservation laboratory, and the Waldee storage facility. The collection primarily serves as a teaching tool for the Apparel, Merchandising, and Design curriculum where students engage in interactive, object-based learning. The collection is accessible to students, faculty, and other scholars. Students utilize the collection for vintage inspiration and learning about fashion innovations throughout history. Students also learn through research and curating fashion exhibitions.
