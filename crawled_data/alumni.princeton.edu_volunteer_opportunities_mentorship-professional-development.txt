Check out a list of companies that have hosted PSIP interns, and consider hosting a PSIP intern at your startup. Learn More Scholars Institute Fellows Program Alumni (and friends!) play a hugely important and powerful role in our FLI (first generation, low income) community, helping us to surround our scholars with mentorship, guidance, and care. We recognize that there is no “one-size-fits-all” brand of mentorship, so there are many different ways for you to get involved. Learn More Princeton Internships in Civic Service Princeton alumni are the beating heart of the PICS program. As an alum, an alum spouse, or a Princeton parent, sharing your experience and connections with Princeton students gives the next generation of service leaders the relationships and knowledge they will need to be successful as professionals and as changemakers. Learn More AlumniCorps Princeton AlumniCorps programs engage alumni of all ages in a suite of activities that build civic leadership skills while also contributing to the collective capacity of organizations and communities to address social issues. Through an arc of opportunities beginning with the first year out of college and continuing to later in life when alumni are looking to put their skills and experience to work in new ways, AlumniCorps provides formative experiences, training, community, and support. Learn More Princeton University Mentoring Program (PUMP) The Princeton University Mentoring Program, sponsored by the Carl A. Fields Center for Equality + Cultural Understanding, is a mentoring program for students of color designed to assist first-year students in their academic, cultural, and social acclimation to Princeton. First-year students are paired with a sophomore, junior or senior who serves as a peer mentor and each student mentor/mentee pair is also matched with a Princeton alumni of color mentor for the academic year. Alumni of color mentors can serve as role models, provide opportunities for personal and professional development, and help guide two students of color (peer mentor and mentee) through their academic, social, and cultural journey at Princeton.
