Your support allows us to bring high-quality services to the Morningside Heights and Washington Heights communities. Learn More This year's Benefit celebrates Community Impact's 40 years of community service. We will gather to recognize our volunteers, program partners and participants, and esteemed members of our community, including our Circle of Champions. The Benefit is Community Impact's most important fundraising event of the year, the highlight of which is a benefit auction that will help raise vital funds to support our mission to serve disadvantaged people in Upper Manhattan through high quality programs, and to provide meaningful service and leadership opportunities for volunteers from Columbia University, Barnard College, and the surrounding community. With the effects of the pandemic still ongoing, it is more important than ever that CI's Adult, Youth, and Emergency Food programs thrive so our volunteers can continue to help advance the public good. As CI enters its fifth decade, we ask that you join us in our passion for our mission and devotion to our community by participating in this year's Sharing Our Stories Benefit.
