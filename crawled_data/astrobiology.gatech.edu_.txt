Astrobiology Graduate Certificate Learn More The Georgia Tech Astrobiology Graduate Certificate Program is part of an initiative linking the Georgia Tech Schools of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Chemistry and Biochemistry, Biological Sciences, Daniel Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering, and Sam Nunn School of International Affairs. The purpose of the certificate program is to expand opportunities for students in the interdisciplinary field of astrobiology, which combines astronomy, biology, geosciences, chemistry, and physics to understand the origin, evolution, and possible distribution of life in the universe. Unique components of the GT certificate program include the mission design course, in which students will forge innovative links between astrobiology science and engineering, and the science communication project, in which students will gain skills in translating astrobiology findings to the greater community.
