This program is developed specifically for students who seek ways to bring narrative methods into their clinical or teaching practices. This program introduces students to the principles and practice of narrative medicine through rigorous courses leading to intellectual growth, interpersonal relationships, and personal insight. Students will practice designing and evaluating narrative training interventions in clinical settings. Curriculum Students in the Narrative Medicine Certification program complete five online courses and attend one workshop in-person or virtually.

Each online course will begin at the traditional start of the fall, spring, and summer terms, and run for 10 weeks. The program is part-time and online. The courses are asynchronous, with no required weekly meeting time, giving students the flexibility of accessing course materials, lectures, and assignments within a specific weekly timeframe to accommodate their schedules. To receive the certification, students must complete the five 3-credit courses (for a total of 15 credits) and the non-credit workshop.
