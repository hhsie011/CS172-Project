Department Undergraduate Group (DUG) [email protected] Recent Senior Honors Theses Current Concentrators Graduate Courses Research & Projects Events News About Us Undergraduate The undergraduate concentration in Archaeology and the Ancient World provides students with the opportunity to explore the multi-faceted discipline of archaeology while examining the critical early civilizations of the so-called “Old World” — that is, the complex societies of the Mediterranean (not least Greece and Rome), Egypt, and the ancient Near East. The concentration, with its three tracks and its encouragement of fieldwork and independent research, is designed to allow students flexibility in structuring their own path through this remarkably diverse, and highly engaging, field of study. Students interested in learning more about concentrating in Archaeology and the Ancient World should talk with the Director of Undergraduate Studies, Professor Felipe Rojas. For information on the courses we offer, please visit our Courses pages. For general information about being an undergraduate at Brown, consult the information offered by the Dean of the College.
