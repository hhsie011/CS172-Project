This program is designed to accelerate the formation of a diverse faculty that will advance the University’s vision whether or not there is an ongoing planned search, and whether or not there is a faculty line currently available in a particular department. The Target of Excellence Faculty Hiring Program provides a pathway to identify for appointment to their faculties individuals who have achieved national or international distinction and would reflect the rich diversity of our student body and surrounding community. This program has two core pathways: 1. Waiver of the standard requirement for a national search when an opportunity placement arises; and / or 2. Adjustment to a faculty line when one might not otherwise normally be available in order to take advantage of an opportunity hire. Reasons for engaging in the hiring program include: An exceptional scholar who provides a rare opportunity to diversify the research portfolio of a department or school, typically an individual of great eminence who would ordinarily not be available; An exceptional teacher who would not only be an innovative teacher, but would also be a role model for our diverse student body; A faculty member who makes other exceptional or extraordinary contributions to diversity and equal opportunity in the department or school, such as a clinical faculty member with exceptional work experience that will enhance student preparation for entering the work-force; An academic professional who would enhance campus diversity by bringing perspectives to the community from a range of diverse backgrounds, experiences, underrepresented groups, and / or whose work will foster new and creative ways of involving our diverse student body in an accessible and engaging educational experience that is aimed at producing highly capable graduates. Under some circumstances, a national search may be required, such as to support applications for permanent residency (green card) status. In those cases, a waiver of normal search processes may not suffice. Collaboration with Human Resources, Center for Global Engagement, and Office of General Counsel may be necessary in the event that a candidate’s eligibility to work in the United States depends on being hired through certain competitive processes. Target of Excellence Faculty Hiring Program agreements between departments and the administration vary on a case-by-case basis. Funding can come from department, college, or Provost’s funds. The Provost may fully or partially fund the position. Funding of Program hires: 1. Current vacancy – the college will use its own funding for this hire; or 2. Known future vacancy – the Provost will provide bridge funding until the vacancy takes June 25, 2021 place at which time the Provost funding will be removed; 3. New position funding – the Provost will provide funding for the position. Proposals will be considered beginning August 1st, and will continue to be accepted throughout academic year. Proposals will assume routine routing processes, which will be through the department chair and dean prior to Provost review. A Target of Excellence Faculty Hiring Program proposal should include the following items in electronic format: 1) The name of the proposed appointment and the unit(s) proposing the appointment; 2) A copy of the candidate’s curriculum vitae; 3) Statement of how this person fits this program; 4) Explanation of how this person more than meets the campus' exacting standards of excellence; 5) Indication of unit-level resources, if any, that can be applied toward the costs of the hire; 6) Statement of support within the hiring unit(s) for the candidate; In addition to the Target of Excellence Faculty Hiring Program, hiring departments are expected to engage in rigorous efforts to ensure that deep, diverse, mission-centric pools of candidates are developed in the standard search process. Completed program proposals may be submitted electronically to Enid Watkins Holleyman, Assistant to the Provost and Communications Manager.
