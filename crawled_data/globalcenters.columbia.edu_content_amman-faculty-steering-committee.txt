The Committee provides academic and intellectual input, leadership, and advice regarding the Center’s activities and plans, supports its engagement with faculty, as well as helps identify, expand and advance scholarly exchange, and create innovative and sustainable programming, at and through, the global center. The Faculty Advisory Committee is chaired by a faculty member who serves a renewable three-year term and is viewed as a thought-leader by other members of the faculty. Committee members represent a wide spectrum of faculty interests and disciplinary areas, and are selected because of their commitment to globalization in general, and to the study of the Middle East, as well as their familiarity with, and interest in, the region’s nations, cultures, and issues.
