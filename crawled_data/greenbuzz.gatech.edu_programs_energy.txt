Sustainable solutions, such as the use of solar panels in powering the Campus Recreation Center and Clough Undergraduate Learning Commons, reduce reliance on traditional energy sources on Georgia Tech's campus. Energy is one of Georgia Tech's Core Research Areas. Research on energy policy, conservation, and alternative sources occur in every college at Georgia Tech. In practice, Georgia Tech uses efficient systems, demand management, and a Smart Energy Campus initiative that collects data from energy utility systems all over campus. (More about on-campus practices from the Office of Campus Sustainability.) Georgia Tech also houses numerous research centers dedicated to the development of alternative energy, including: Center for Innovative Fuel Cell and Battery Technologies (FC/BT) Center for Organic Photonics and Electronics (COPE) Brook Byers Institute for Sustainable Systems National Electric Energy Testing Research and Applications Center (NEETRAC) Strategic Energy Institute (SEI) University Center for Excellence in Photovoltaics Georgia Institute of Technology North Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332 +1 404.894.2000 Campus Map General Directory Employment Emergency Information Legal Legal & Privacy Information Human Trafficking Notice Title IX/Sexual Misconduct Hazing Public Disclosures Accessibility Accountability Accreditation Â© 2022 Georgia Institute of Technology GT LOGIN
