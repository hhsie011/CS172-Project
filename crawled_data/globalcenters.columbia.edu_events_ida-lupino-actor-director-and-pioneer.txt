To celebrate International Women's Day, Columbia Global Centers | Mumbai and the U.S. Consulate General in Mumbai invite you to a lecture on 'Ida Lupino: Actor, Director and Pioneer' by Richard Peña, Professor of Professional Practice in Film at the School of the Arts, Columbia University. The lecture will focus on Lupino’s career as a director using clips from several of her films. Lupino is best known for her work in front of the camera for which she became one of Warner Bros. Pictures’ top female stars. In 1946, she broke her contract with them and went on to become a successful director and pioneer in independent feature film production. Lupino’s works tackle a number of women-oriented and bold subjects for her time, including unwanted pregnancy, rape and bigamy. This year marks her birth centenary. The lecture will be followed by a panel discussion on Women Directors in the Indian Film Industry, with filmmaker Alankrita Shrivastava. About the Speaker Richard Peña is Professor of Professional Practice in Film at the School of the Arts, Columbia University. He also served as the Program Director of the Film Society of Lincoln Center and Director of the New York Film Festival from 1988 to 2012.
