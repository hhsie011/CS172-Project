Texas Tech University Directory Raiderlink A-Z Index School of Law Menu Search TTU School of Law Welcome Alumni and Friends Annual Gifts Annual gifts provide an important source of flexible revenue that has an immediate positive impact on today's students, faculty, and programs. These gifts may be designated for a specific purpose, such as a contribution to the library, a scholarship, or an endowment. Gifts may also be given without a specific, donor-designated purpose and serve as unrestricted donations. Support Tech Law Dean's Excellence Fund The Dean's Excellence Fund consists of undesignated gifts and provides essential, unrestricted support directed to wherever needs are most pressing at any given moment, including faculty research, student organizations and programs, financial aid, library resources, distinguished guest lecturers, and important initiatives of the dean. Dedicated to everything it takes to provide Texas Tech Law students a stellar legal education, the Dean's Excellence Fund provides a vital source of steady and adaptive support. Gifts to Law School Organizations, Publications, Centers, and Programs Many of the law school's student organizations and publications benefit from donations, gifts, and sponsorships, and you can direct your gift toward them. You may also choose to donate to law school centers and programs, such as the clinics and advocacy teams. Individual organizations may be contacted to identify specific projects and events that need alumni and donor support. Leave Your Mark To leave your mark on the law school in a visible way, brick and stone pavers are available as well as sponsoring opportunities for study carrels and benches. Gifts of $50,000 or more provide room naming opportunities in the law school to recognize the donor or any individual the donor chooses to honor. For information about any type of gift, pledge, donation or bequest to the Law School, please contact Karen Holden at (806) 834-4910 or karen.holden@ttu.edu.
