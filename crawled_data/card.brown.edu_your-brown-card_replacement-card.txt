How to Obtain a New Card Cardholders may visit the Brown Card Office during regular business hours (8:30 am - 5:00 pm) to obtain a replacement card. In order to obtain a new card, the cardholder must provide positive proof of identification (state-issued ID, driver's license, or passport, etc.). Card Replacement Fee The replacement fee for a lost card or a card deliberately or negligently damaged, is $20.00 per instance. The Brown Card Office accepts cash, check, Visa, MasterCard, Discover, AMEX, or Bear Bucks to pay for a new Brown Card. Students may also apply this fee to their student account. It is the responsibility of the cardholder to pay for their own replacement ID card. Brown University is not responsible for lost ID card fees and will not reimburse cardholders for such instances. Once a replacement Brown Card has been issued, and the previous card is subsequently located, there will be no refund issued by the Brown Card Office. Malfunctioning or Worn Out Cards If a Brown Card is malfunctioning or is worn out, it should be reported to the Brown Card Office during regular business hours. Cardholders with malfunctioning, worn out, or accidentally damaged Brown Cards will receive a replacement card, free of charge. During non-business hours, cardholders may also report the card to Brown Public Safety and receive a temporary dorm access card to utilize until the next business day. Reactivate a Found Card If you find a Brown Card that you recently reported missing and it has not yet been replaced, you can contact the Brown Card Office for reactivation, free of charge.
