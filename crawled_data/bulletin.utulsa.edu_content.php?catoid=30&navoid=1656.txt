We seek to create, refine, conserve, and disseminate knowledge and artistic expression at the highest levels. The success of the College in offering all students of The University of Tulsa a broadly based liberal arts education depends upon the rigor with which the faculty approaches teaching and scholarship and upon the degree to which students commit to intellectual excellence, aesthetic appreciation, and critical thinking. The faculty affirms that service to the institution, the profession, and the community is a significant dimension of the professional life of faculty members.
