Full Text Research Research Overview Stephen Bush works in the fields of theory of religion, philosophy of religion, and religious ethics. His book, Visions of Religion, attempts to integrate three major understandings of religion: religion as a matter of personal experience, as a matter of symbolic meaning, and as a matter of social and political power. His second book project, William James on Democracy and Religion (in progress, under contract with Cambridge University Press) investigates the intersection of politics and religion in the thought of William James. Research Statement Stephen Bush works in the fields of theory of religion, philosophy of religion, and religious ethics. His book, Visions of Religion: Experience, Meaning, and Power (Oxford University Press) is an exploration of three of the most influential approaches to the study of religion since the twentieth century: approaches that view religion as primarily experiential, those that view it as symbolic meaning, and those that view it as primarily a matter of social power. The book integrates the valuable insights of each approach into a social practical theory of religion. His second book project investigates the intersection of politics and religion in the thought of William James, focusing especially on James's notion of individuality in its political and religious dimensions. He also has a series of essays on topics related to religious ethics and violence, including torture and just war killing.
