At this time, we are not hosting in-person events and cannot confirm space for future rentals. We continue to follow guidance from Harvard University and Harvard University Health Services and will update this page as more information becomes available. Harvard Radcliffe Institute is an ideal location for groups to host events and conferences. Our buildings and grounds offer historic charm with amenities to meet modern technology needs. Please note that we can accommodate requests only from internal Harvard schools and organizations. For rental space inquiries, please complete and submit our Meeting Spaces Inquiry form.
