ACE, CARE, and Strozier’s Learning District are hosting the Readiness Review Series to get you powered up for success. No matter how long ago you took algebra, pre-calculus, trigonometry, calculus 1, general chemistry 1, or organic chemistry 1, it doesn’t change how important mastery of that material is. These short, peer-led review sessions will cover the most important concepts, formulas, and vocabulary from those prerequisite courses and will help you prepare for success in the next class you’re taking in math, chemistry, physics, accounting, engineering, and more. The R/R sessions will cover the following subjects and courses. Algebra Pre-calculus Trigonometry Calculus 1 General Chemistry 1 Organic Chemistry 1 Accounting Notetaking & Study Strategies The spring sessions have completed, but you can still get FREE tutoring in any of these subjects from academic programs on campus. Visit the Tutoring Resources at FSU page for more information on specific details. The Readiness Reviews will return in Fall 2022. Specific dates and times will be posted at the beginning of the semester. Unsure which review to attend? Start here. The Notetaking & Study Strategies session is suitable for any student in any program of study.
