Chaired by prominent community leader, the Honorable Judge John A. West, representatives of this group also included: UC students, faculty, staff and alumni; neighborhood community groups; civic, faith and business leaders; and law enforcement officials. Following the completion of numerous police reforms, in January 2019 the CAC was renamed the Community Compliance Council (CCC). The diverse membership of the CCC will continue to promote diversity of thought and information exchange. The role of the CCC, however, has transitioned from advisory to compliance. As such, the CCC will perform the following activities: Review summary information on use of force incidents and investigations to determine compliance with UCPD policies and review the work of the UCPD Use of Force Review Board when convened. Review summary information of the internal investigations and complaint review process to determine compliance with UCPD policies. Monitor notable UCPD activities to ensure continued compliance with the policies and procedures set forth as part of the larger reform work of the UCPD. Provide community perspectives and insight to the UCPD Chief of Police on matters related to enforcement patterns, community engagement, recruitment, hiring, promotion, training, etc. Department of Public Safety 51 West Corry Boulevard Cincinnati, OH 45221-0215 Main Number: 513-556-4900 Background Checks, Keys and IDs: 513-556-4925 UC Tools Canopy & Canvas One Stop Email Catalyst Shuttle Tracker IT Help UC VPN Bearcats Landing About Us Maps & Directions Jobs News Diversity Governance & Policies Directory Events Calendar University of Cincinnati | 2600 Clifton Ave. | Cincinnati, OH 45221 | ph: 513-556-6000 Alerts | Clery and HEOA Notice | Notice of Non-Discrimination | eAccessibility Concern | Privacy Statement | Free Speech | Copyright Information © 2020 University of Cincinnati Department of Public Safety 51 West Corry Boulevard Cincinnati, OH 45221-0215 Main Number: 513-556-4900 Background Checks, Keys and IDs: 513-556-4925 © 2020 University of Cincinnati scroll up to the top
