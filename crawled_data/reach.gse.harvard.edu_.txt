REACH explores how these policies are understood and experienced by students, teachers, and governments in contexts that host large refugee populations. We find that refugees are often included in national schools that already serve marginalized national students who feel alienated from opportunities. The collective challenge is to raise the quality of education for all, including access to feelings of belonging and future opportunities. Our work demonstrates how key to meeting this challenge is focusing on inclusive curricula and pedagogy and caring relationships among teachers and students. Explore Integration & Belonging ‚Üí Globalization & Migration Refugees often experience multiple cycles of displacement and return, forcing young people to constantly re-imagine their futures. REACH considers how education can support physical and cognitive mobility, thereby enabling individuals and nation-states to build productive futures. Explore Globalization & Migration ‚Üí Conflict Transformation We identify policies, pedagogies, and curricula that can mitigate conflict and reduce resource-based and identity-based inequalities. Our work at REACH shows how young people can develop inclusive and multiple identities through education, which are important for their futures and those of their nation-states. Particularly critical is education that allows young people to understand and link their pasts, presents, and futures and the inequalities that shape their experiences and opportunities. Explore Conflict Transformation ‚Üí Quality Education Over one half of children globally who are out of school live in conflict settings. Yet quality education is an essential component for securing a future for refugee children. REACH identifies ways to strengthen and build refugees‚Äô ‚Äúunknowable futures.‚Äù This work is relevant not only for refugees but for other young people globally who face similar, even if less extreme, uncertainties in the face of rapid globalization and technological change.
