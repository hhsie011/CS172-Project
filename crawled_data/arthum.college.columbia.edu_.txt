It is not a historical survey, but an analytical study of a limited number of monuments and artists, and teaches students how to look at, think about, and engage in critical discussion of the visual arts. Classes are limited to 22 students; they are discussion-based and make extensive use of New York City through field trips to museums, buildings, and monuments.
