Global Immersion Course: Exploring Turkey’s Start-Up Culture Columbia Global Centers | Istanbul welcomes Columbia Business School students who will be in Istanbul from March 16 to March 22 as part of a Global Immersion course focusing on Turkey’s start-up culture. The course, led by Professor Jack McGourty, is a semester long program that seeks to assess the current conditions for entrepreneurship in the region with a focus on the city of Istanbul. As part of the course, the week-long visit to Istanbul will include visits to stakeholders groups critical to ecosystem development and start up culture formation including government officials, members of the investment community, corporate leaders, and of course, entrepreneurs. Students will undertake projects that focus on each major stakeholder group, investigating recent activities and influence these groups have on the overall entrepreneurial ecosystem. Working in teams, the students will generate a report that provides an up-to-date view of the region from an economic, political, and cultural perspective while interweaving how these regional elements influence the entrepreneurial ecosystem in Istanbul. The report will outline specific recommendations to enhance the ecosystem in Istanbul.
