Trebat. About the book Brazil: The Reconstruction is a political study focused on the fight against corruption, engaging with relevant aspects of the economy and eventually offering recommendations for Brazil to take its rightful place in a globalized world. More than a technocratic compilation of data and opinions, this book constitutes a synthesis of the main issues to which she has been dedicating her work as journalist and researcher, using interviews and historical contextualization to present a general picture of Brazil’s situation in the current moment. This inquiry engages with important theoretical issues that have a broader relevance in emerging countries, such as: unanticipated economic crisis, the impact of corruption on development, the relationship between the fatalistic behavior of the population and political unrest, the role of the press in democracy, and the reorganization of the state machine to seek efficiency in the public sector. Written in the contemporary context of unrest, the book seeks to understand which Brazil will triumph from the current troubles. In other words, who will reap the fruits of Brazil's much celebrated motto “Order and Progress”? Will it be the corrupt and inefficient political class, or the organic population in its entire social, economic, and ethnic diversity? Maria Paula Carvalho holds a master's degree in political journalism from the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism (New York); Master's degree in Social Communication from the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (2009) and a bachelor's degree in journalism from the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul (1996). Author of the book Caravanas da Identidade - inside the biggest report in Brazil and close to the Brazilians (2010). Author of the master thesis: Brazil, is the future Now?, analyzing the economic and social situation of Brazil, focusing on politics and the fight against corruption. For nearly 20 years she has been a television anchor and reporter, having worked in TVGlobo and GloboNews television news departments in Rio de Janeiro. She participated in the Rio 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games as a bi-lingual on-screen presenter with the Sport Presentation Team. Previously, she worked at RBS-TV in Porto Alegre and TVE - Fundação Cultural Piratini - Rádio e Televisão Educativa. Thomas J.
