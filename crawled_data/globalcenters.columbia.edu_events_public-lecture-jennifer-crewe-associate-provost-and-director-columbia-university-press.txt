About Columbia University Press Columbia University Press was founded in 1893 and is the fourth-oldest university press in the United States. The purpose of the press as expressed in its Certificate of Incorporation is to "promote the study of economic, historical, literary, scientific and other subjects and to promote and encourage the publication of literary works embodying original research in such subjects." Signers of the certificate included Seth Low, then president of Columbia, and Nicholas Murray Butler, who succeeded Low in 1902 as president of the university and of the Press. Throughout its history, one of the strengths of the Press has been the diversity of its list. It has distinguished itself with its strong program in Asian humanities, begun in collaboration with Wm. Theodore deBary and other faculty at the Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures in the late 1950s. The Press's Translations from the Asian Classics books and its sourcebooks on Asian civilizations have been widely adopted in courses and are used by professionals in the field. Through its European Perspectives series, which publishes works by leading European historians, philosophers, and social theorists, the Press has published a range of innovative and field-leading scholarship by world-renowned thinkers such as Theodor Adorno, Antonio Gramsci, Roland Barthes, and Gilles Deleuze. The Press also publishes notable lecture series, such as the Leonard Hastings Schoff Memorial Lectures, sponsored by the University Seminars at Columbia; the Bampton Lectures in America, also sponsored by Columbia University; and the Kenneth J. Arrow Lectures, sponsored by the Committee on Global Thought at Columbia. The Press has published prominent authors from a variety of disciplines, including Wm. Theodore deBary, Victor Mair, Burton Watson, Wang Anyi, David Wang, Yu Ying-shih, Talal Asad, Alain Badiou, Peter Brown, Judith Butler, Arthur Danto, R. Glenn Hubbard, Roald Hoffman, Donald Keene, Rashid Khalidi, Julia Kristeva, Michael Mann, Howard Marks, Andrew Nathan, Paul Offit, John Rawls, Jeffrey Sachs, Edward Said, Joseph Stiglitz, Mark C. Taylor, David Foster Wallace, and Kenneth Waltz. The Press publishes approximately 200 new titles every year in the fields of animal studies; Asian literature, philosophy, politics, and history; biological sciences; business; culinary studies and food history and science; current affairs; economics; environmental sciences; film and media studies; finance; global history; health policy; international affairs; journalism; literary studies; Middle East studies; New York City history; paleontology; philosophy; political theory; psychology; religion; science policy; social work; sociology; and U.S. history.
