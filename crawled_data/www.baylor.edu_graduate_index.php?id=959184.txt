The hard waiver insurance requirement means that as a degree seeking graduate student, both domestic and international, (enrolled in 3 or more credit hours, including online graduate students, or those who are enrolled in at least 1 hour of a full-time equivalency course) are required to have health insurance coverage. To help graduate students meet this requirement, Academic Health Plans (AHP) has been selected to administer the Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP) underwritten by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas. Domestic students will be charged for the student health insurance plan through Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, upon registering for classes. Domestic students who have existing health insurance may show proof of alternate health insurance coverage by completing the waiver process during the annual open enrollment period that begins each July 1. Inaction from a student will result in financial responsibility for the student health insurance fee. International students will be automatically enrolled through Health Services at Baylor. If you have questions about your subsidy status, please check your program admissions letter. All of the resources for insurance help can be found through the AHP website.
