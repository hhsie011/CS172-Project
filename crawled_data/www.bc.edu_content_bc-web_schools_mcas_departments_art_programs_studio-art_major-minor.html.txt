There are features of the minor program that resemble, in an abbreviated way, aspects of our majors studio program that we have found to be successful. The required Senior Minor Project class, for example, will function analogously to our major’s Senior Project. This curriculum of six courses is designed to encourage an in-depth investigation of one medium, rather than a generalized sampling of many. The course structure aims at having the individual student develop the artistic techniques and conceptual visual sensibility necessary for working as an artist today. Students are encouraged to declare the Studio Minor before their senior year. Students who are interested in declaring the Minor should contact Prof. Hartmut Austen.
