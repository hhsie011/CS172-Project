Contact LGBTQ Life Michael Falk Sabrina Scarborough Toni Blackwell Sign up for a Safe Zone Training Get Involved with LGBTQ Life OUTlist Members The Johns Hopkins OUTList consists of members of the Johns Hopkins community, including faculty, staff, alumni, students, postgraduate students, and fellows, who identify as LGBTQ. OUTList members are willing to serve as mentors and/or part of an informal network for the LGBTQ community. The list is also intended to serve as a tool for recruiting and retaining the most talented people, to foster a culture in which everyone feels that their contributions are valued, and as another example of the university’s commitment to diversity and inclusion. You welcome to contact individuals on the OUTList for advice and networking. These names represent just a few of the LGBTQ members of our Hopkins community. There are barriers (both domestically and internationally) that prevent some members of our community from safely coming out. We hope that this list serves as a reminder that LGBTQ people deserve to live open and safe lives. If you are interested in joining the OUTList, we would love to add you! You can fill out our form here. Contact information for Hopkins affiliates is limited to what is publicly available on the Hopkins directory. Click on th first or last name to go to that person’s entry. We don’t publish email addresses for alumni, but you can contact us if you’d like to get in touch with someone. View the OUTlist Click the column headers to alphabetize the names, or use the search box to find a specific person. You may also use the search box to find faculty, staff, students, alumni, or a particular campus.
