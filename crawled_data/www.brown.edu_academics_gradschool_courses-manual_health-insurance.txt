Students may waive SHIP coverage by presenting proof of adequate outside coverage to the University Office of Insurance & Purchasing Services. Dependents Health Insurance Coverage Dependents of graduate students may be enrolled in SHIP at an additional cost. Eligible dependents include a legal spouse or domestic partner, children up to the age of 26, or a child born while the graduate student is covered by SHIP. A spouse or partner is generally expected to be living with the covered student in order to be eligible for coverage. Doctoral and MFA students who receive health coverage through their financial support packages from the University are eligible to receive a 75% subsidy on the annual premium cost of enrolling a dependent. Enrollment is available directly through the Gallagher website. Once logged in through the portal, you will be able to add your dependents. After the dependents are added, you will receive a payment link to make the payment. Your coverage will be added upon processing the payment.

Students waive the University plan and who are eligible for the subsidy, will receive a buyout of $400 ($200 for spring-semester coverage). This buyout will be distributed through the student account system. If students have a credit balance on their student account at the time the buyout is disbursed, they will be able to request a refund from the Bursar's Office. If they do not have a credit balance at this time, the $400/$200 will be applied to their student account. Students who choose coverage through both the University's health insurance plan and an alternate plan should be aware that the University plan includes a "Coordination of Benefits" provision. Students should contact their other insurance company to inquire about a similar provision in that plan. "Double coverage" may affect the timely processing of claims between the two plans.
