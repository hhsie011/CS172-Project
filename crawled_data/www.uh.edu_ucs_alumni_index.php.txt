Recent Graduates Experienced Alumni Alumni Resources UH Alumni Association Alumni Testimonials “I received a world-class education at the University of Houston and had a strong professional background, but having trouble landing a dream job post-graduation, so I decided to start taking advantage of all the resources at University Career Services. I began regularly meeting with Cynthia Olmedo, and with her guidance, I redid my resume, attended career fairs and information sessions, and prepared for interviews. Thanks to her help, I landed a temporary job helping out with fundraising at KIPP Texas, and am getting interview offers in my field with Fortune 500 companies and Government Agencies.” Aldo Charles KIPP Texas Public Schools “We appreciated the opportunity to participate as an employer at the 2018 STEM Career Fair. It was a great introduction for Amos Global Energy's first career fair. We were impressed with the great turnout and enjoyed meeting and speaking with all of the students.” Chris Hasty Amos Energy Group Share your Experience Upcoming Alumni Events Contact us at UH Main University of Houston University Career Services 106 Student Service Center 1 Houston, TX 77024-3040 713-743-5100 ucs@uh.edu Campus Map Contact us at UH at Sugar Land University of Houston at Sugar Land University Career Services 14000 University Blvd. Sugar Land, Texas 77479-0800 713-743-5091 praut@central.uh.edu Campus Map University of Houston Houston, Texas 77204 (713) 743-2255 A–Z Index Academic Calendar Campus Carry Policy Campus Map Career Opportunities Directory Emergency Information Get Help Human Resources Library Mental Health Resources Fraud & Non-Compliance Hotline Office of the President Parking Report Copyright Infringement Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Reporting and Awareness Open Records/Public Information Act Texas Veterans Portal Tuition & Fees UH System Virtual Tour ©2022 University of Houston.
