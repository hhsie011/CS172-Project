As you may suspect, we have many more requests for co-sponsorship than our budget can accommodate. In order for us to fairly evaluate all inquiries, we ask for specific information from all requests for co-sponsorship. If you would like us to consider your scholarly program/event for co-sponsorship, please complete the webform. Our Center Manager will be automatically notified upon your submission and we will be in touch with a decision (usually within 1-2 weeks).
