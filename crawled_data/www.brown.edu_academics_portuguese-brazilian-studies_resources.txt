The monograph collection consists of approximately 6,000 items, mainly in English and Portuguese language, and it reflects over thirty years of collecting 19th- and 20th-century materials on Brazil and other areas of Latin America. Brasiliana Collection Brown University Library is committed to become the premier academic collection for Brazilian Studies outside of Brazil. The Brasiliana Collection focuses on Brazilian literature, history, education, anthropology, cross-cultural studies, race relations, ethnic studies, cultural studies, environmental studies, music, public policy, sociology and Portuguese second-language acquisition. International Partners The department also maintains close cooperation with several universities in Brazil and Portugal through joint publications and research projects, sponsorship of events, advising of doctoral students, hosting of post-doctoral scholars, and study abroad. Visiting Scholars Over the past three decades the department has welcomed a steady flow of visiting scholars from other institutions in the United States, as well as from abroad; these scholars have come to Brown to conduct research for dissertations, books, and articles. Most of the foreign scholars have been supported by grants from funding agencies of the Brazilian government (CAPES and CNPq), from Portuguese foundations such as Calouste Gulbenkian, Instituto Camões, and FLAD (Luso-American Development Foundation), and from the Fulbright Commission.
