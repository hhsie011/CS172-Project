7:30 PM Columbia Global Centers | Mumbai, 12-13, Maker Chambers VI, First floor, Jamnalal Bajaj Road, Nariman Point, Mumbai 400 021 Join us for a panel featuring two recipients of the Yusuf Hamied Fellowships, Professor Bhaven Sampat from Columbia University and Dr. Hasan Farooqui from the Public Health Foundation of India, who will discuss the impact of regulations on pharmaceuticals in India. India has long been known as the ‘pharmacy to the developing world’ and many policies have been put in place to ensure India is able to continue to supply medications at reasonable prices. Yet as some of these policies have only been implemented in the past two decades, their comprehensive impact is yet to be explored. Our distinguished speakers will address the implications of policies on drug prices and utilization, as well as the broader issue of balancing innovation and access to treatment. To register, please send an email to [email protected] About the speakers: Dr. Bhaven Sampat is an Associate Professor in the Department of Health Policy and Management at Columbia University and a Research Associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research. He received his B.A., M.A., M.Phil. and Ph.D. (all in economics) from Columbia University. Most of his research focuses on issues at the intersection of health policy and innovation policy. His current work includes various empirical studies of drug and life science patent policy in the U.S. and developing countries; evaluating the validity of different approaches to measure science, innovation and science-technology linkages; examining whether and when science is self-correcting; and assessing the impact of federal indirect cost recovery policy on the biomedical research enterprise. His previous work includes research on the political economy of the NIH, patent examination and patent quality, and the roles of academic patenting in university-industry technology transfer. The title of his presentation is TRIPS, Patents and Drug Prices in India. Dr. Habib Farooqui is currently serving as an Additional Professor at the Public Health Foundation of India and a Visiting Fellow at the Institute of Health and Society at Newcastle University, UK. He has an M.D. from Banaras Hindu University and postdoctoral trainings from Sydney Medical School and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. He is involved in teaching and research in pharmaceutical economics with a specific focus on access to medicines. He has also served as a technical expert to the Competition Commission of India on Mergers and Acquisitions in the Indian pharmaceutical market, and provided policy advice to the Ministry of Health and the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority on Pharmaceutical Pricing Policy. Previously, he has evaluated the earlier version of the Jan Aushadhi Scheme - a flagship medicine access program, and completed an EU Framework 7 project on Multinational Enterprise (MNE’s) Impact on Global Development Challenges. The title of Dr. Farooqui’s talk is Impact Evaluation of Pharmaceutical Regulation on Medicine Utilization in India: An Interrupted Time Series Analysis.
