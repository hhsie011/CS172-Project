In his announcement, Lombardi wrote: The Board of Trustees approved a new Student Code of Conduct (Student Code) in December 2020. I am pleased to share with you today that the new Student Code and procedures will take effect August 2, 2021. The new Student Code focuses on making sure that the conduct process is objective, transparent, fair, and that students are an active participant throughout the process. Importantly, it is also focused on creating an educational and restorative approach to resolving student behavior concerns. All student organizations are covered under this new Student Code. As we transition to the new academic year, the Office of the Judicial Administrator staff will become part of the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards (OSCCS) and will report to the Robert W. and Elizabeth C. Staley Dean of Students, effective July 1, 2021. The OSCCS will support the holistic development of the student experience that fosters campus safety, accountability, and personal/organizational development. About the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards The Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards (OSCCS) is a newly formed office under the Vice President for Student & Campus Life responsible for engaging with our community about the values and expectations of all Cornell students. The OSCCS supports the holistic development of the student experience by educating students about behavioral expectations and enforcing the Student Code through a fair and educational process that fosters campus safety, accountability, and personal/organizational development. The OSCCS ensures proper investigation and resolution of alleged Student Code violations or any other regulation as the University President and/or Board of Trustees may direct. The OSCCS adheres to the established procedures under the Student Code when resolving alleged conduct violations with fairness, integrity, and objectivity for all parties involved, consistent with the university’s educational goals.
