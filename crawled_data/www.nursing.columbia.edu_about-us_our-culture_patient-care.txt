Most maintain an active practice, introducing students to the challenges of clinical practice by bringing real-world experiences and scenarios into the classroom Columbia Nursingâ€™s faculty practice opened at Columbia-Presbyterian Eastside in Manhattan on September 29, 1997. The faculty's first commercial venture, originally called Columbia Advanced Practice Nurse Associates (CAPNA), responded to the need to further validate cost, quality, and competence benefits of advanced practice nurses. In 2016 it was rebranded as ColumbiaDoctors Primary Care Nurse Practitioner Group. Today, the practice operates out of a practice location in Washington Heights, just across the street from Columbia Nursing. Additional practice components include a nurse practitioner house calls service in upper Manhattan and using telehealth to increase access to care. As part of their practicum, both student nurses and student advanced practice registered nurses have an opportunity for clinical preparation via rotations through the primary care faculty practice. The faculty practice sub-specializes in the following areas: Integrated mental health Palliative care within the primary care setting Care of LGBTQ individuals In addition, Columbia Nursing has clinical partnerships with more than 200 practice sites throughout New York City, and affiliations with major New York medical centers including NewYork-Presbyterian.
