In the event a crisis occurs on university property, the Code Maroon emergency notification system will notify students, faculty, and staff of emergency information via text message, Texas A&M email, KAMU-FM radio, campus cable television, Emergency Alert System (EAS) radios, computer alerts (pop ups), classroom alerts, Twitter, and RSS.

The Division of Marketing & Communications will be responsible for the communication efforts that relate to the incident. As such, they will coordinate communication efforts with other university units and/or government agencies. Marketing & Communications will disseminate press releases, respond to media inquiries, and maintain/update the main university website. Marketing and Communications has primary responsibility for communication efforts during an emergency; however, the University Police Department (UPD) Public Information Officer (PIO) or the local Emergency PIO Group may provide additional support. They will work closely with emergency management and response officials to ensure that information being released to the campus community and media is accurate and timely. More information about communications planning in a crisis can be found in Texas A&M University's Emergency Operations Plan.
