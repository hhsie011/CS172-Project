In the 3-D areas, students discover the broad scope of form in space. They explore a variety of means through which ideas and inspiration are conceptualized in sculpture and ceramics. Contemporary trends and evaluations of artistic development are woven into class projects. Assignments challenge creativity as well as provide a basic understanding of the different tools, materials, and techniques which are used to communicate through three-dimensional form. Undergraduates share and interact with graduate students in large studios which are equipped for welding metals, modeling and firing works in clay, casting in permanent materials, and constructing in wood. In Ceramics, students learn new and traditional techniques in clay and glaze technology, expanding their knowledge in the use of clay, glaze, and slips in the building and decorating of pottery and ceramic sculpture. The use of gas and electric kilns, and other equipment, are included in the program.
