Credit: Phil Wilde Alongside nine other students selected from 22 preliminary round competitors, Yesudasan had to present his dissertation research in just three minutes to a panel of non-specialist judges, staff, and students from across campus. Presentations were judged on their comprehension, clarity, engagement, and communication style. His presentation, “What Makes a Red Potato Red?” earned him first place and $1,500. Second place and $1,000 was awarded to genetics, genomics, and development doctoral student Shao-Pei Chou for her presentation, “Decoding the 2% Difference That Makes Us Human.” After nearly 200 audience members cast their ballots, votes were tallied and the People’s Choice Award was presented to policy analysis and management doctoral candidate Pamela Meyerhofer for her presentation, “Paid Family Leave and Fertility.” “Prior to competing, I was struggling to explain why my research was interesting to someone besides myself,” said Meyerhofer. “Having this compelling framework makes it easier to discuss and share my work.” Chou voiced similar takeaways, adding that her public speaking and communication skills were enhanced by competing. “I often found it’s difficult to explain what I’m working on to my friends and family. Even to other biologists, my field is new to them,” Chou said. “I made a decision last year that I was going to compete for the next 3MT and use that as a chance to force myself to find an … excellent way to explain my research. It worked super well!” The 3MT competition was first held in 2008 at the University of Queensland and has since been adopted by over 600 graduate schools in over 65 countries. This year, Cornell’s winners will compete in the inaugural Ivy+ 3MT competition to be held April 25 at the United Nations (UN) in New York City. Yesudasan will also compete via video at the Northeastern Association of Graduate Schools annual conference in Philadelphia in April. Finalists for 3MT 2019 with Associate Dean Jan Allen.

Credit: Phil Wilde “3MT is a wonderful opportunity for students to refine their presentation skills and translate their research into language appropriate for policymakers and others in a general audience,” said Jan Allen, associate dean for academic and student affairs. “It’s always so impressive – and fun – to watch our students be so great at this!” Yesudasan and Chou look forward to the opportunity to present on behalf of Cornell at the upcoming event. “I consider it an honor and a privilege to be able to participate and represent Cornell at this inaugural event,” said Yesudasan. “I have always wanted to visit the UN, so representing Cornell as an international student at this event is extra special.” Cornell’s 5th annual 3MT final round competition was held on Wednesday, March 20, 2019 at 5:00 pm ET in Call Auditorium. 3MT challenges research degree students to present a compelling story on their dissertation or thesis and its significance in just three minutes, in language appropriate to a non-specialist audience. 3MT Finalists First Place: Teddy Yesudasan, Plant Breeding & Genetics: “What Makes a Red Potato Red?” Special Committee Chair: Walter De Jong <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> Download Accessible Transcript of Teddy Yesudasan’s 3MT Presentation Second Place: Shao-Pei Chou, Genetics, Genomics & Development: “Decoding the 2% That Makes Us Human” Special Committee Chair: Charles Danko <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> Download Accessible Transcript of Shao-Pei Chou’s 3MT Presentation People’s Choice: Pamela Meyerhofer, Policy Analysis and Management: “Paid Family Leave and Fertility” Special Committee Chair: Francine Blau <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> Download Accessible Transcript of Pamela Meyerhofer’s 3MT Presentation Katherine Adler, Civil & Environmental Engineering: “Making Waves to Competitively Produce Biofuel” Special Committee Chair: Edwin Cowen <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> Download Accessible Transcript of Katherine Adler’s 3MT Presentation Cassandra Benson, Economics: “Born on the Wrong Day?” Special Committee Chair: Maria Fitzpatrick <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> Download Accessible Transcript of Cassandra Benson’s 3MT Presentation Michelle Duong, Food Science & Technology: “Franken-phage to Save the Day” Special Committee Chair: Sam Nugen <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> Download Accessible Transcript of Michelle Duong’s 3MT Presentation Ashwariya Lahariya, Fiber Science & Apparel Design: “What if Your Clothes Can Warn You of Dangerously High Carbon Dioxide Levels” Special Committee Chair: Jintu Fan <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> Download Accessible Transcript of Ashwariya Lahariya’s 3MT Presentation Jeffrey Pea, Biomedical & Biological Sciences: “Oh-No Varies!

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
