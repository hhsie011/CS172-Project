Refresh and expand your introductory chemistry knowledge. Get feedback about your level of preparation. Do it online and at your own pace. CHEM-Web is a free online tutorial that helps incoming first-year students review general chemistry. It covers stoichiometry, atomic and molecular structure, chemical bonding, solutions, chemical reactions, and thermochemistry. The CHEM-Web does not exempt students from taking the Chemistry placement exam. The program can help you prepare for the placement exam. The alternative is to take CHEM0100, a semester-long class offered during the fall, then take CHEM0330 in the spring semester. This tutorial is cost-free and is appropriate for students of all backgrounds. Registration The CHEM-Web tutorial will open on June 15, 2022. Access the CHEM-Web Registration Form. Please note that you will need to log in with your Brown e-mail credentials. Within 24 hours of registration, you will be added to CHEM-Web in Canvas, Brown's learning management system.

No, the tutorial is for the students' benefit and will assist in preparing for the Chemistry placement exam. 2. Does taking the CHEM-Web tutorial replace taking a semester of chemistry or the chemistry placement exam? No, the CHEM-Web tutorial is not for credit or for a grade. Students must take the chemistry placement exam. 3. Are there exams or quizzes in the CHEM- Web tutorial? Yes, there are quizzes and exams. The Canvas program automatically grades your quizzes but the grades are not used in your placement in a chemistry course. Students should complete the quizzes and exams to keep track of their progress. It is a good idea to aim for 70% on the first four unit exams. 4.
