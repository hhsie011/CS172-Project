The core of our Eagle Eye Campus Visit is a candid conversation with current studentsâ€”an opportunity to ask them about classes, housing, Boston, service learning, and more. And our virtual visit programs allow you to engage with our community from the comfort of your home. Eagle Eye Campus Visit These two-hour visits include an information session and student-led outdoor campus tour. The information session features authentic conversation with current students. We also provide a live hour-long virtual opportunity for those unable to make it to our campus.
