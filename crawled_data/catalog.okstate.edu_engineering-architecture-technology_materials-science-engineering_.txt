Architecture and Technology/ Materials Science and Engineering Materials Science and Engineering Overview Courses Graduate Programs Faculty The field of materials science and engineering is expanding into a period of unprecedented intellectual challenges, opportunities and growth. Products created using materials science and engineering research contribute to the economic strength and security of not only the state, but also the country. The School of Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) is located at OSU-Tulsa Greenwood campus at the Helmerich Research Center, a premier facility which places the College of Engineering, Architecture and Technology in a unique position to conduct world-class education, research and technology development and transfer in advanced materials of strategic importance to our nation. Current research programs focus on materials for energy technologies, bio-materials for medical technologies, advanced materials for aerospace and defense, and materials for electronics and control technologies. Program Educational Objectives OSU is currently offering only a graduate program in Materials Science and Engineering. MSE 5000 Master's Thesis Prerequisites: Graduate standing and permission of instructor. Description: Students will be performing thesis research under the guidance of a thesis advisor. This will involve performing literature search, writing proposal for the research and conducting research in the laboratories. At the end of the course students will present the findings of research to the committee and prepare a thesis for approval by the thesis committee. Offered for variable credit, 1-6 credit hours, maximum of 6 credit hours.

A program of independent study and research on a project under the direction of a member of the Graduate Faculty will be satisfactorily completed by all graduate students. For the Master of Science candidate, the project may result in a thesis. For the Doctor of Philosophy candidate, the project results in a dissertation. Four research areas of strategic importance have been identified at the Helmerich Advanced Technology Research Center (HRC) at OSU by industry leaders in and around Tulsa. These include: Materials for Energy Technologies, Bio-Materials for Medical Technologies, Advanced Materials for Aerospace, and Materials for Electronics and Control Technologies. All areas fall under the broad umbrella of the School of Materials Science and Engineering. Admission Requirements Admission to either the Master of Science or Doctor of Philosophy degree program requires graduation from a materials science and engineering or related curriculum approved by the ABET or a recognized equivalent from any international program. Students with related undergraduate degrees, such as chemistry, physics, engineering physics, applied physics, etc., can be admitted conditionally, subject to completing prescribed Materials Science and Engineering program core courses. Admission is competitive based on undergraduate GPA, GRE and TOEFL (for international students), statement of interests, experience and recommendations. The Master of Science Degree The M.S. degree in MSE has both thesis and creative component (non-thesis) options. The thesis option requires a total of 30 credit hours, which includes 24 hours of formal coursework (regularly scheduled classes, not independent study) and 6 hours of a thesis. The non-thesis option or creative component requires a total of 35 credit hours, which includes 33 hours of formal coursework (regularly scheduled classes, not independent study) and 2 hours of a creative component or project. The main difference between the two options is that in the thesis option, students conduct independent research while in the creative component option, students conduct critical review of the literature on an advanced topic of interest to the MSE program. Both options require a professional report or thesis and an oral presentation. Students take 15 hours of core courses (required) with the remainder of the hours being MSE elective courses or their equivalent (to be approved by MSE graduate coordinator and the thesis advisor or has been considered as an equivalent MSE course). Students must complete no less than 21 hours of MSE 5000- and 6000-level courses through Oklahoma State University. For both options the courses taken must include: Course List Code Title Hours MSE 5013 Advanced Thermodynamics of Materials 3 MSE 5023 Diffusion and Kinetics 3 MSE 5043 Advanced Materials Characterization 3 MSE 5093 Fundamentals of Materials Science 3 MSE 5193 Advanced Materials Processing 3 MSE 5010 Materials Science and Engineering Seminar for Masters Students 0 The Doctor of Philosophy Degree The general credit requirement is a minimum of 90 credit hours beyond the BS degree, including at least 36 hours of credit for research and at least 30 hours of class work. It is expected that the courses must include: Course List Code Title Hours MSE 5013 Advanced Thermodynamics of Materials 3 MSE 5023 Diffusion and Kinetics 3 MSE 5043 Advanced Materials Characterization 3 MSE 6010 Materials Science and Engineering Seminar for PhD Students 0 Students are responsible for consultation with their doctoral advisory committee in preparing the plan of study. Furthermore, students have to pass the PhD qualifying exam and the dissertation proposal defense to become eligible for candidacy for the PhD Degree, successfully conduct independent research for the dissertation, and pass the final dissertation defense in order to qualify for the PhD degree.
