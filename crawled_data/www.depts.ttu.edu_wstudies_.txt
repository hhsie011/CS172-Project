Moving Forward. The Women's and Gender Studies program at Texas Tech University is an interdisciplinary academic program supporting transformational undergraduate- and graduate-level scholarship and teaching that explores how gender intersects with other social identities like race, ethnicity, sexuality, class, and disability. Through engaging feminist coursework, research, and practicum opportunities, we examine systems of power, privilege, and inequality. Women's and Gender Studies fosters creative, collaborative, and sustaining social justice approaches and feminist scholarship that advance understanding, equity, and compassion.
