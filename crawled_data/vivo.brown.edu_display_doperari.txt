His research addresses two inter-related areas. The first general area concerns the social psychological determinants of HIV, mental health, and related health issues (substance use, structural violence, access to services) in historically marginalized communities, with an emphasis on developing and evaluating theory-based social and behavioral interventions that are relevant for delivery in complex communities. A second research area concerns the lived experiences associated with social inequality, with an emphasis on understanding the perspectives of intersectional identities and addressing health and psychosocial disparities. His NIH-funded projects examine these public health issues among racial and ethnic minority populations as well as sexual and gender minority populations in the United States, the Philippines, China, South Korea, Kenya, and South Africa. At Brown, he is affiliated with the International Health Institute, Center for AIDS Research, Population Studies and Training Center, and Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies. He received the Dean’s Award for Excellence in Teaching in the Brown University School of Public Health, the University of Oxford Excellence in Teaching Award, the American Psychological Association Distinguished Leadership Award on Psychology and AIDS, and recently served as Chair of the American Psychological Association Committee for Ethnic Minority Affairs.

Full Text Research Research Overview I am a social-behavioral scientist and health psychologist committed to research that addresses health inequities in the United States and in international settings. My current research involves developing and testing psychosocial and community-based health interventions for reducing HIV transmission, as well as other mixed methods research aiming to understand the determinants of psychological and behavioral health in racial/ethnic minority populations and sexual and gender minority populations. Research Statement My research bridges psychological and social sciences with public health, with a specific focus on the social determinants and social sequelae of HIV/AIDS. I work with vulnerable populations for health disparities - including ethnic minorities, sexual minorities, and other disadvantaged groups in the United States and in developing world settings. I am fundamentally interested in conducting work that has public health and policy relevance, aimed especially toward improving outcomes in historically disadvantaged communities. My current work is based in urban centers in the United States as well as international settings including China, South Africa, Kenya, Mexico, and Peru. At Brown University, I am affiliated with the International Health Institute (IHI), Center for AIDS Research (CFAR), Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies (CAAS), and Population Studies Training Center (PSTC).
