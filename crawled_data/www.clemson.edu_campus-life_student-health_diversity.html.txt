The ethics and standards of our professional practice similarly compel us to affirm the dignity and worth of each individual regardless of gender, ethnicity, race, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, religion, socioeconomic status, and physical and mental abilities. Within this context, our staff is committed to maintaining an atmosphere of respect and trust in which we feel free to explore and discuss our attitudes, beliefs, values and behaviors in relation to others who are similar to and different from ourselves. To honor our clients, our co-workers and ourselves, we pledge to recognize and eliminate prejudice and discrimination through active training and professional and personal growth. As we strive to educate ourselves and others about the issues of a pluralistic society, we recognize that the promotion of diversity will often challenge our values and perspectives. Thus, our aim is to cultivate an openness and respect that embrace and appreciate the differences that enrich both us and the people we serve.
