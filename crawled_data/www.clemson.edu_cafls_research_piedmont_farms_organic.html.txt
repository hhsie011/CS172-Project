The center, originally established as the Student Organic Farm in 2001, has remained USDA certified organic since 2005. The Organic Research Center is used as an official university resource for ongoing organic research under the Piedmont Research and Education Center. In addition to serving as an experimental research farm, hosting training and other events, the farm produces a variety of seasonal vegetables for direct sale and wholesale markets. All revenue generated by the sale of farm products goes directly toward salaries of farm staff, student workers, and farm operating expenses.
