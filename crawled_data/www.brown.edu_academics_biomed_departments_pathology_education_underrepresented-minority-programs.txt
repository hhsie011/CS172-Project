In accordance with Brown University’s Diversity and Inclusion Action Plan, the department has developed its own plan focused on providing observerships and clinical rotations in pathology; participating in the nationwide Leadership Alliance; and outreach to high school students from the greater Providence area. Departmental Initiatives Diversity in Medicine Visiting Student Scholarship The Diversity in Medicine Visiting Student Scholarship provides qualified underrepresented minority students with the opportunity to participate in clinical electives at The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University. Participants in the pathology elective block interact with residents and faculty and receive mentorship from members of the Brown Minority Housestaff Association (BMHA). Summer Enrichment Program The Summer Enrichment Program exposes high school students from economically disadvantaged and historically underrepresented backgrounds to career possibilities in basic and translational scientific research in pathology. Students are placed in an immersive work environment within individual research labs where they can interact directly with junior and senior scientists. University Initiatives Initiative to Maximize Student Diversity The Graduate Program in Pathobiology is an active partner in Brown's Initiative to Maximize Student Diversity. The program provides research training support for students in underrepresented groups in and effort to increase the participation of these groups within the fields of biomedical and behavioral research.
