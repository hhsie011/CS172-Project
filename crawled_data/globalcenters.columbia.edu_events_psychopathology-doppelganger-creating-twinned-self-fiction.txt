Exploring psychoanalytic ideas and literary strategies to engage with the uncanny, Levy will unfold her approach to doubling, split selves, wayward selves, contested identities, alter-egos, shadows, avatars, being in two minds, and speaking through an other. Deborah Levy | United Kingdom Deborah Levy is the author of six novels, including Swimming Home and Hot Milk, both shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize, and a collection of widely translated short stories, Black Vodka. Her two acclaimed “living autobiographies”, Things I Don't Want To Know and The Cost of Living , have been described as ‘Wise, subtle and ironic, Levy’s every sentence is a masterpiece of clarity and poise.” For BBC Radio 4, Levy dramatized two of Freud’s case histories, Dora and The Wolfman, along with the modernist short stories of Katherine Mansfield, In a German Pension, and Colette’s novella, Chance Acquaintances. Levy taught writing at the Royal College of Art, London, and has recently written the script for a short film, Freud’s Lost Lecture, directed by Jane Thorburn, to be screened in Paris and London this year.
