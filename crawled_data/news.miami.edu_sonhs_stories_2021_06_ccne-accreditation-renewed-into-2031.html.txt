A letter dated June 9 from the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) advises that the CCNE Board of Commissioners acted at its May 11-14 meeting to grant accreditation to the baccalaureate degree program in nursing, master’s degree program in nursing, Doctor of Nursing Practice program, and post-graduate APRN certificate program administered by the UM School of Nursing and Health Studies (SONHS) for a period of 10 years, extending to June 30, 2031. The CCNE Board determined that each of these programs met all four accreditation standards— program quality: mission and governance, institutional commitment and resources, curriculum and teaching-learning practices; and program effectiveness: assessment and achievement of program outcomes—with no compliance concerns identified with respect to the key elements. The programs were considered using the CCNE Standards for Accreditation of Baccalaureate and Graduate Nursing Programs (2018). “This maximum time period for accreditation granted by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education is testament to our stellar faculty, staff, students, and programs at the School of Nursing and Health Studies,” says SONHS Dean and Professor Cindy L. Munro. “I want to thank Professor John Clochesy, Director of Evaluation and Strategic Initiatives, for leading this effort, as well express my appreciation for the SONHS leadership and faculty, our Steering Committee members, key participants, and many other contributors. You all paved the way for our excellence to shine through, from the self-study to site visit to accreditation report. This timely and welcome news will help ensure our upward trajectory well into the future.” The CCNE is an autonomous national accreditation agency, recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education, that contributes to the improvement of the public's health by ensuring the quality and integrity of baccalaureate, graduate, and residency programs in nursing.
