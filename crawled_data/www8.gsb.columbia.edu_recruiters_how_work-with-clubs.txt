Why Recruit Columbia Talent? Employment Reports Contact Us Student clubs play a major role in the development of Columbia MBAs. With over 100 student groups on campus, opportunities abound for them to pursue passions and develop skills to aid their post-graduation success. These clubs also are a way for recruiters to track down students with specific interests. Companies can get involved with clubs by hosting networking events, presenting business cases, participating in brown-bag lunches or panel events, or becoming sponsors for conferences and other events. At the Career Management Center, we help clubs manage their calendars, keep a level recruiting playing field, and minimize conflicts. Student feedback consistently indicates a preference for fewer events — as a result, each event should include a robust number of company representatives to maximize student-company interaction. Companies planning to hold events with clubs must request event dates through COIN. Sidebar Content Post a Job Log Into COIN Make a Gift Have a Question? Just contact us.
