Department courses take advantage of the extraordinary cultural resources of New York City and often involve museum assignments and trips to local monuments. The department offers a major and concentration in art history and in the history and theory of architecture, and a combined major in art history and visual arts. At the heart of the major is AHIS UN3000 INTRO LIT/METHODS OF ART HIST, which introduces students to different methodological approaches to art history and critical texts that have shaped the discipline. The colloquium also prepares students for the independent research required in seminars and advanced lecture courses, and should be taken during the junior year. Surveys and advanced lecture courses offered by Barnard and Columbia cover the spectrum of art history from antiquity to the present and introduce students to a wide range of materials and methodologies. Limited-enrollment seminars have a narrower focus and offer intensive instruction in research and writing. The opportunity for advanced research with a senior thesis is available to students who qualify. The major readily accommodates students who wish to study abroad during junior year. Courses taken at accredited programs can generally count as transfer credits toward the major, but students must gain the approval of the director of undergraduate studies. Similarly, any transfer credit for the major must be approved by the director of undergraduate studies. Generally no more than 12 points of transfer credit are applicable to the major. The form to petition for transfer credit can be found on the department website. Eligible Art History courses taken at Reid Hall and through the Berlin Consortium are counted as Columbia courses, not transfer courses. All newly declared majors and concentrators should visit the department office and speak with the undergraduate program coordinator about the requirements and their planned curriculum. The director of undergraduate studies regularly communicates with majors by e-mail to announce departmental events, museum internships, and other news. Students who do not receive these messages should email the undergraduate program coordinator. The director of undergraduate studies is also available to talk to students about their professional goals and plans to study abroad. Course Information Lectures Attendance at the first class meeting is recommended. Colloquia For information about enrollment in the required colloquium AHIS UN3000 INTRO LIT/METHODS OF ART HIST , students should consult the department during the registration period in the semester prior to the one in which the course is offered.

Only the first course a student takes in the department may be taken for a grade of Pass/D/Fail. Classes taken in the Architecture or Visual Arts departments to fulfill the studio requirement may be taken for a grade of Pass/D/Fail. Senior Thesis The senior thesis project consists of a research paper 35-45 pages in length. It is a year-long project, and students writing a thesis must register for AHIS UN3002 Senior Thesis for the fall and spring terms. Much of the fall semester is devoted to research, and the spring semester to writing. All thesis writers are required to participate in class and, on alternate weeks, meet as a group or individually with the instructor. Group meetings are designed as a series of research and writing workshops geared toward students' research projects. Students receive a total of six credits for successful completion of the thesis and class. In order to apply, students follow a selection process similar to the one currently used for seminars. Students must identify a thesis topic and secure a faculty adviser in the Department of Art History and Archaeology. Applications must indicate the subject of the thesis, a short annotated bibliography, and the name and the signature of the adviser, followed by a one-page statement (400 words) outlining the topic, goals, and methodology of the thesis. The application deadline is set for August before the senior year. Please check the department website for exact dates. Applications may be delivered in person or emailed to the coordinator for undergraduate programs. The director of undergraduate studies, in consultation with the thesis adviser, reviews the applications. Students who intend to write a thesis should begin formulating a research topic and approaching potential faculty sponsors during the spring of the junior year. Currently, the department offers the Summer Research Travel Grant fellowship, which supports thesis-related research and travel during the summer. Additional senior thesis research funding during the academic year is administered through Columbia College and General Studies. Senior thesis applications may be found at: http://www.columbia.edu/cu/arthistory/undergraduate/forms.html Summer Research Travel Grant The department offers the Summer Research Travel Grant, which may be used for travel to museums, building sites, libraries, archives, and other places of interest relevant to the thesis project. Students normally use these funds to conduct research during the summer before senior year. Travel grant applications require a carefully edited thesis proposal, itemized budget, and supporting letter from a faculty sponsor. Applications are due in April of the student's junior year. Students will be notified of deadlines as they become available. Please contact the coordinator for undergraduate programs with any questions.

The Western Hemisphere was a setting for outstanding accomplishments in the visual arts for millennia before Europeans set foot in the so-called âNew World.â This course explores the early indigenous artistic traditions of what is now Latin America, from early monuments of the formative periods (e.g., Olmec and ChavÃ­n), through acclaimed eras of aesthetic and technological achievement (e.g., Maya and Moche), to the later Inca and Aztec imperial periods. Our subject will encompass diverse genre including painting and sculpture, textiles and metalwork, architecture and performance. Attention will focus on the two cultural areas that traditionally have received the most attention from researchers: Mesoamerica (including what is today Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, and Honduras) and the Central Andes (including Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia). We will also critically consider the drawing of those boundariesâboth spatial and temporalâthat have defined âPre-Columbianâ art history to date. More than a survey of periods, styles, and monuments, we will critically assess the varieties of evidenceâarchaeological, epigraphic, historical, ethnographic, and scientificâavailable for interpretations of ancient Latin American art and culture.

CC/GS/SEAS: Partial Fulfillment of Global Core Requirement This lecture course offers a comprehensive and chronological overview of the major masterpieces of art and architecture of the Muslim world between circa 700-1000 AD. Topics concerning the rise of Arabic as the official language of the new Muslim Empire and the aesthetic transformation it went from script to calligraphy, the shaping of sacred spaces and liturgical objects, rulersâ iconographies and urban designs, as well as daily-life objects, will be discussed. Mecca, Madina, Jerusalem, Damascus, Fustat (old Cairo), Qayrawan, Cordoba, Baghdad, Samarra, Balkh, Bukhara and early Fatimid Cairo are the major playgrounds to illustrate particular moments of shifting powers and aesthetic paradigms in the early days of the Muslim empire, suggesting a more differentiate picture of the arts of Islam in the age of imagining a world-wide empire. The past narratives for these regions will be critically presented by both looking at the medieval sources and the modern historiographies for these regions and by highlighting the varied ideologies at play. Taking this critical vein of studying the arts of the early Muslim age, past narratives will be reconsidered, while enhancing our awareness to the complicated, if not sometimes manipulated, processes of giving works of arts meanings and values Fall 2022: AHUM UN2800 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment AHUM 2800 001/12553 M W 4:10pm - 5:25pm Room TBA Avinoam Shalem 4.00 60/60 Fall 2022 Undergraduate Seminars and Bridge Seminars UNDERGRADUATE SEMINARS: 3000-level courses open to undergraduate students only.

AHIS UN3410 Approaches to Contemporary Art. 3 points. This course examines the critical approaches to contemporary art from the 1970s to the present. It will address a range of historical and theoretical issues around the notion of "the contemporary" (e.g. globalization, participation, relational art, ambivalence, immaterial labor) as it has developed in the era after the postmodernism of the 1970s and 1980s.

How did changing modes of representation reflect and contribute to shifting conceptions of embodiment and identity? This advanced undergraduate seminar explores the complex relationship between photography and the human body in the United States since the introduction of photography in 1839. Moving decade by decade, this course traces the development of photography alongside social and political change that altered how human bodies were understood, represented, inhabited, and controlled. We will examine a variety of photographic genres that figure the body, including personal portraits, ethnographic images, identification images, documentary photography, and fashion photography. Alongside the close examination of photographs, we will read key primary sources, scholarship in art history, and theoretical texts. Two field tripsâone to Columbiaâs Art Properties and one to the Metropolitan Museum of Artâwill give us an opportunity to have our own embodied encounters with historical photographs. Although the course explores the period between 1839 and 1970, we will reflect upon the legacy of historical photographic practices in the years since and in the contemporary world Fall 2022: AHIS UN3456 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment AHIS 3456 001/12198 M 10:10am - 12:00pm Room TBA Katherine Fein 4.00 10/12 AHIS UN3703 Sin Autorizacion: Themes in Contemporary Cuban Art. 4.00 points. This course is planned in conjunction with the exhibition Sin autorizaciÃ³n, to be on display at the Wallach Gallery in Fall 2022. Using the exhibition and its works as a guide, this class focuses on main themes within Cuban art from the last few decades. Rather than proceeding in chronological order, each unit will address a theme present both within the greater history of contemporary Cuban art and works from the exhibition itself. The course will make use of public programming for the exhibition, as well as direct access to the artists included in the exhibition, through in-class visits and workshops, as possible. While we will focus on contemporary art from Cuba, we will begin by grounding our study within Caribbean cultural theory and important scholarship in Caribbean art history. Using Caribbean theory will help to contextualize and situate contemporary Cuban art within the greater field of art history and cultural theory Fall 2022: AHIS UN3703 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment AHIS 3703 001/14892 W 10:10am - 12:00pm Room TBA Gwen Unger 4.00 0/12 AHIS GU4646 Foucault and the Arts. 4 points. Michel Foucault was a great historian and critic who helped change the ways research and criticism are done today â a new âarchivistâ. At the same time, he was a philosopher. His research and criticism formed part of an attempt to work out a new picture of what it is to think, and think critically, in relation to Knowledge, Power, and Processes of Subjectivization. What was this picture of thought? How did the arts, in particular the visual arts, figure in it? How might they in turn give a new image of Foucaultâs kind of critical thinking for us today? In this course, we explore these questions, in the company of Deleuze, Agamben, RanciÃ¨re and others thinkers and in relation to questions of media, document and archive in the current âregime of informationâ. The Seminar is open to students in all disciplines concerned with these issues.

This course surveys the earliest forms of visual production by North Americans of African descent, spanning the period from 1650-1900. Our focus encompasses decorative arts and crafts (furniture, pottery, quilts), architecture, and the emerging field of African American archeology, along with photography and the fine arts of painting and sculpture. We will consider how certain traditions brought from Africa contributed to the development of the early visual and material culture of what came to be called the United States. We will also reflect on how theories of diaspora, and resistance help us understand African American and American culture in general Fall 2022: AHIS GU4742 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment AHIS 4742 001/13458 Th 10:10am - 12:00pm Room TBA Kellie Jones 4.00 0/15 AHIS GU4743 Colonial Visual Systems: Constructing a "New World". 4.00 points. This course will examine the visual organizational systems used by Europeans during their colonization of the Americas, specifically the Caribbean. These systems were used in several ways: first to classify that which Europeans had never encountered through botanical and zoological illustration, then, as tools to assert control over groups of people and land through mapping practices and ethnographic illustrations. As such, the course will examine the broad history of colonialism and the transAtlantic slave trade, beginning in the early fifteenth century and ending with twentieth-century tourist photos. The course will study the ways these visual systems were marshaled to create narratives that persist to this day, including the construction of race and use of the Picturesque as a pro-slavery tool that rendered the Caribbean as a pastoral haven. Stressing the development of image analysis skills and primary source materials, the main requirement will be a final 15-20 page paper. Over the course of the semester, we will work on developing this paper together; the end goal is that students will have a paper they can use for conference presentations or even rework for publication. At the end of the course, the student will be versed not only in colonial history but in the ways visual systems have functioned to construct systems of power and control Fall 2022: AHIS GU4743 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment AHIS 4743 001/15056 W 4:10pm - 6:00pm Room TBA 4.00 0/12 Majors Colloquium The Majors Colloquium is a required course for all majors in the department.

The course will examine a variety of figures, movements, and practices within the entire range of 20th-century artâfrom Expressionism to Abstract Expressionism, Constructivism to Pop Art, Surrealism to Minimalism, and beyondâsituating them within the social, political, economic, and historical contexts in which they arose. The history of these artistic developments will be traced through the development and mutual interaction of two predominant strains of artistic culture: the modernist and the avant-garde, examining in particular their confrontation with and development of the particular vicissitudes of the centuryâs ongoing modernization.

This course examines some of the key moments of architectural modernity in the twentieth century in an attempt to understand how architecture participated in the making of a new world order. It follows the lead of recent scholarship that has been undoing the assumption that modern twentieth-century architecture is a coherent enterprise that should be understood through avant-gardist movements. Instead, architectural modernity is presented in this course as a multivalent, and even contradictory, entity that has nonetheless had profound impact on modernity. Rather than attempting to be geographically comprehensive, it focuses on the interdependencies between the Global North and the South; instead of being strictly chronological, it is arranged around a constellation of themes that are explored through a handful of projects and texts.

This course will study building practice, sculpture, and architectural ornamentation in Western Europe during the Middle Ages. The monuments selected belong to a period that starts when architecture moved away from Roman antique models and ends just before the re-adoption of Classical standards in the Renaissance. In this course the originality of medieval architecture, its relationship with earlier and later monuments, and the dramatic effort involved in its creation will be discussed. Major themes of medieval society such as pilgrimages, crusades, piety, the cult of relics, and the social and intellectual context of the Middle Ages are also part of this lecture. The course will also introduce students on how to harness digital technologies such as laser scanning or photogrammetry for the study of medieval art. No preliminary knowledge of medieval history or architectural history is needed and no knowledge of digital technologies or specific computer skills is expected.

This course is a survey of the art of Italy from the early fourteenth century until the onset of the Reformation. It will cover the major artists and cultural centers of the peninsula, examining them in the context of broader artistic currents and conventions of the period. Special attention will be paid to the social, political, and historical factors that led to changes in the visual arts as well as the impact of cultures beyond classical antiquity on the form and iconography of paintings and sculptures in the Early Renaissance. The lectures will provide students with a deeper understanding of the canonical works of Italian artists from Cimabue and Giotto to Leonardo da Vinci and Giovanni Bellini, of the development of new criteria for assessing the visual arts, of the relationship between artists, patrons, and audiences in the period. The readings, in turn, will familiarize them with key primary sources of the fourteenth and fifteenth century, as well as the writings of distinguished Renaissance scholars from the nineteenth century until the present Spring 2022: AHIS GU4031 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment AHIS 4031 001/15055 M W 10:10am - 11:25am 612 Schermerhorn Hall Irina Oryshkevich 3.00 48/60 AHIS GU4042 AFR AMER ARTISTS IN 20/21 CENT. 3.00 points. This course is a survey of visual production by North Americans of African descent from 1900 to the present. It will look at the various ways in which these artists have sought to develop an African American presence in the visual arts over the last century. We will discuss such issues as: what role does stylistic concern play; how are ideas of romanticism, modernism, and formalism incorporated into the work; in what ways do issues of postmodernism, feminism, and cultural nationalism impact on the methods used to portray the cultural and political body that is African America?

AHIS UN3104 The Art of the Gods: Images of the Divine in the Ancient Mediterranean. 4.00 points. Divine images made the gods present, gave physical and tangible form to something not (often) to be seen or touched, and served as a crystallization of the religious imagination of society. The way different cultures represented the divine can tell us a lot about the use of images in those cultures, as well as communicating much about how the gods themselves were understood. This topic connects art historical concerns of form, material, and style to rituals, social practices, and religious beliefs. This course will combine these elements, showing the interconnections between physical appearance and sacred function in the Greek and Roman world; Mesopotamia and Egypt will act as crucial points of comparison Spring 2022: AHIS UN3104 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment AHIS 3104 001/13729 M 2:10pm - 4:00pm 934 Schermerhorn Hall Alexander Ekserdjian 4.00 12/12 AHIS UN3444 Reflexivity in Art and Film. 4 points. This seminar will explore a range of individual works of Western art from the 16th century to late 20th century in which the tension between illusionism and reflexivity is foregrounded. It will focus on well-known paintings and films in which forms of realism and verisimilitude coexist with features that affirm the artificial or fictive nature of the work or which dramatize the material, social and ideological conditions of the workâs construction. Topics will include art by Durer, Holbein, Velazquez, Watteau, Courbet, Morisot, Vertov, Deren, Godard, Varda, Hitchcock and others. Readings will include texts by Auerbach, Gombrich, Brecht, Jameson, Barthes, Didi-Huberman, Bazin, Lukacs, Mulvey, and Daney Spring 2022: AHIS UN3444 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment AHIS 3444 001/13730 T 4:10pm - 6:00pm 934 Schermerhorn Hall Jonathan Crary 4 10/12 AHIS UN3454 Zines by Artists. 4.00 points. Most often associated with the explosion of punk rock at the end of the 1970s, self-published booklets, fanzines, or simply âzines actually arose first in the context of science fiction collectors in the 1930s. Beginning in the early 1970s (independently of, and before the advent of punk music), artists adopted and developed the format as a vehicle for visual expression, drawing from precedents in pop art, artistsâ books, mimiographed literary magazines, historical avant-garde movements such as dada, and more contemporaneous developments in conceptual art and mail art. Overlooked in favor of artistsâ books and artistsâ magazines, on the one hand, and in favor of various types of music- or personal expression-based zines, on the other, the artistâs zine forms a rich and multifaceted genre spanning over five decades of practice. This course will examine the artistâs zine in the contexts of both art and music history, issues related to the expression and exploration of race, gender, and sexaulity, and the notions of networking and community building. Although distinct from the development of punk rock, artistsâ zine practice has forged and maintains a close connection to it and to its evolution into Queercore, Riot Grrrl, and Afropunk, all of which are covered in the course readings Spring 2022: AHIS UN3454 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment AHIS 3454 001/14346 Th 10:10am - 12:00pm 930 Schermerhorn Hall Branden Joseph 4.00 11/14 AHIS UN3455 The Art of the Document. 4.00 points. This course addresses the tension between art and document, or making and recording, in twentieth-century visual culture.

This course takes up a question posed by Terry Smith and applies it to Africa: "Who gets to say what counts as contemporary art?" It will investigate the impact of modernity, modernism, and increasing globalism on artistic practices with a special focus on three of the major centers for contemporary art in sub-Saharan Africa: Senegal, South Africa, Nigeria. Some of the topics covered will be: the emergence of new media (such as photography or cinema), the creation of "national" cultures, experiments in Pan-Africanism, diasporic consciousness, and the rise of curators as international culture-brokers. The course will examine the enthusiastic embrace by African artists of the biennial platform as a site for the production of contemporary art. What differential impact has French vs. British colonialism left on the arts? How are contemporary artists responding to calls for restitution on African cultural heritage?

This seminar examines Kyoto, Japanâs capital from 794 to 1868, through a study of its art and architecture, and how visual experience is shaped by the cityâs particular urban setting and natural environment from its founding to the present. The course will begin by exploring the impact of the cityâs original grid plan, the architecture and art of its Buddhist temples, and the strategic role of water in the cityâs history. Pictorial representations of the city on folding screen paintings and in printed guidebooks created during the 16th-18th century will guide us in studying Kyotoâs early modern transformation and the development of the cityâs rowhouses (machiya). The course will also focus throughout on the old capitalâs role in the specialization of such arts as textiles and ceramics.

This seminar reconceptualizes traditional Chinese paintings (hua) through the perspectives of medium and format. The class sections are arranged in chronological order. We will investigate the distinct formats of portable paintings from the 2nd to 18th centuries (including funerary banners, handscrolls, hanging scrolls, albums, screens, and fans) and the representations of paintings of various formats in tombs and other architectural-pictorial contexts. We will probe into the new notions and thoughts presented by the new pictorial formats, and examine how they have been conventionalized and re-developed by later works. The goal is to foreground frame, scale, surface and ground, as carriers as well as boundaries, of image in the discussions of image, and to see painting as the happenings that were schematized and realized by these external, yet also intrinsic, agents. Students will have the chance to peruse the artworks in museum visits, and are expected to do presentations that address the selected pictures with format insights. Class discussions will be both theoretical and object-oriented, exploring the depths of visual analyses on a par with methodological reflection.

The objective of this graduate seminar is to bring a historiographical dimension to the training of students enrolled in archaeology and art history of the ancient world or Classics, by providing them with the keys to various readings of ancient Greek societies and their material culture and the way these have been constantly renewed since the nineteenth century. Through class discussions of ancient sources and modern texts, the seminar will develop ways of identifying the interpretive models that have shaped classical scholarship up to now. The seminar will offer the opportunity to discuss these models, be they supplementary or conflicting, in order to move towards an ever more explicit reasoning on the interpretations of ancient sources and archaeological evidence Spring 2022: AHIS GU4512 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment AHIS 4512 001/15056 T 10:10am - 12:00pm 934 Schermerhorn Hall Alain Duplouy 4.00 6/15 AHIS GU4741 Art and Theory in a Global Context. 4.00 points. What is âglobalizationâ? How does it change the way we think about or show art today? What role does film and media play in it? How has critical theory itself assumed new forms in this configuration moving outside post-war Europe and America? How have these processes helped change with the very idea of âcontemporary artâ? What then might a transnational critical theory in art and in thinking look like today or in the 21st century? In this course we will examine this cluster of questions from a number of different angles, starting with new questions about borders, displacements, translations and minorities, and the ways they have cut across and figured in different regions, in Europe or America, as elsewhere. In the course of our investigations, we will look in particular at two areas in which these questions are being raised today -- in Asia and in Africa and its diasporas. The course is thus inter-disciplinary in nature and is open to students in different fields and areas where these issues are now being discussed Spring 2022: AHIS GU4741 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment AHIS 4741 001/15225 M 4:10pm - 6:00pm 807 Schermerhorn Hall John Allan Rajchman 4.00 16/25 AHIS GU4949 Architecture in the Age of Progress. 4.00 points. This course focuses on buildings and design theories from the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the United States that were responding to industrialization and rapid urbanization. Based on the premise that modernism in architecture has as much to with attitudes toward change as it does a particular set of formal traits, this class will examine those works that responded to significant technological and social upheaval in an effort to welcome, forestall, or otherwise guide change. We will look at broad themes of the period, including national character, rapid economic growth, the quickened pace of urban life, and shrinking distances due to emerging forms of transportation and communication, all in the light of new methods and materials of construction, new functional programs, and the growing metropolis Spring 2022: AHIS GU4949 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment AHIS 4949 001/13732 M 10:10am - 12:00pm 930 Schermerhorn Hall Samuel Isenstadt 4.00 11/15 Columbia College Columbia University in the City of New York 208 Hamilton Hall, Mail Code 2805 1130 Amsterdam Avenue New York, NY 10027 ColumbiaCollege@columbia.edu Phone: 212-854-2441 College Offices Alumni Affairs and Development Berick Center for Student Advising Center for Career Education Center for the Core Curriculum Center for Undergraduate Global Engagement Double Discovery Center Eric H.
