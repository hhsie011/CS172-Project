Your personal statement should answer the question: Why are you looking to transfer to another institution? Line up your transcripts. We’ll need official transcripts from high school and college. Both should be sent to the Admissions Office directly from the institution, either electronically or by mail. Complete a College Official’s Report. Your registrar, dean or another official can fill out this form, which verifies you’re in good standing with your institution. Submit letters of recommendation or test scores — if you like. These are optional. Undergraduate Admission College Official's Report Take the next steps. You don’t have to make the trip to Omaha to know that Creighton is right for you.
