Graduates of this unique two-year, or six semesters program, receive a Bachelor of Science in Nursing and a Master of Science in Nursing. Upon graduation, the direct-entry master’s students will be eligible to sit for National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX-RN) for registered nursing licensure and the Clinical Nurse Leader Certification Examination offered by the AACN Commission on Nurse Certification. The MEPN program has been at UofL since 2016 but the CNL portion was initiated in 2020. The goal of the CNL is to improve the process of patient care and quality of care outcomes. The CNL applies evidence-based practice to assure that cutting edge advances in care are in action and are positively influencing patient outcomes. CNL responsibilities include developing patients’ care plans, leading healthcare teams, managing processes, using data to create and implement evidence-based practice, and handling patients and colleagues’ issues and problems. Prior to graduation, the students were celebrated and recognized at a poster presentation at the School of Nursing. Some of the poster presentations for the first CNL nurses included needed projects at local hospitals, such as: Utilizing Evidenced-Based Communication Tools to Improve Interprofessional Collaboration Enhancing Pre-Operative Carbohydrate Loading Drink Compliance Increasing Visualization of Gait Belts to Reduce Patient Falls Implementing a Suboxone Protocol with Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale Students worked with nursing leaders during the COVID-19 pandemic. Health care and nursing leaders were thrilled with UofL students’ excellent performance and adaptability in their clinical leader immersion clinical experience. “Through the MEPN program we have had the wonderful opportunity to experience what lies beyond of bedside nursing. The immersion has provided us with invaluable knowledge and networking that we may use in our careers to further the nursing profession and make a difference in healthcare. It is because of this immersion that we discovered what it truly means to be a nurse,” student Aleah Khan said. These students also worked clinicals which provided them the networking and real job experience prior to joining the workforce.
