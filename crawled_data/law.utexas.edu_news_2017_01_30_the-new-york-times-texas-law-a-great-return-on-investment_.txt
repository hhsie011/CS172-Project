The Times notes that the School of Law is “among the 10 schools offering the best salary-to-debt ratios,” and “grouped with Harvard, Yale and Stanford among the top schools that offered their graduates good value for the substantial debt they incurred while law students.” The reporting is based on a recent analysis released by SoFi, or Social Finance Inc., a company that focuses on student debt issues as part of its mission of developing financial security for young people. The figures presented in SoFi’s review of average salary and average debt follow a similar study conducted last fall by U.S. News & World Report, looking at the ratio of median starting salaries to average law school debt. That study found that Texas Law has the best salary-to-debt ratio of any law school in the country. For Dean Ward Farnsworth, the law school’s excellent return on investment is among its greatest virtues. “The idea of this law school has always been to provide a top-tier education and top-tier credential without putting our students deep into debt,” he said. “We’re always grateful when objective sources recognize our success in getting it done.” Category: Law School News Thurgood Marshall Legal Society Recognized as Best in Southwest by the NBLSA Bookfest: Celebrating Jordan Steiker’s Newest Publication Texas Law News Alumni Magazine Archives Latest News Faculty in the News For the Media Contact Us Categories Alumni News Center News Clinic News Events Faculty News Feature Stories Law School News Student Life Student Spotlight Archives Select a Month Select Month May 2022 (12) April 2022 (9) March 2022 (10) February 2022 (7) January 2022 (7) December 2021 (7) November 2021 (8) October 2021 (9) September 2021 (8) August 2021 (3) July 2021 (4) June 2021 (6) May 2021 (11) April 2021 (10) March 2021 (12) February 2021 (8) January 2021 (7) December 2020 (7) November 2020 (11) October 2020 (11) September 2020 (9) August 2020 (3) July 2020 (5) June 2020 (10) May 2020 (7) April 2020 (4) March 2020 (2) February 2020 (7) January 2020 (4) December 2019 (1) November 2019 (4) October 2019 (4) August 2019 (2) July 2019 (1) May 2019 (8) April 2019 (2) March 2019 (2) February 2019 (4) January 2019 (4) December 2018 (8) November 2018 (1) October 2018 (1) September 2018 (13) August 2018 (3) July 2018 (3) June 2018 (2) May 2018 (4) April 2018 (1) February 2018 (1) January 2018 (5) November 2017 (2) October 2017 (3) September 2017 (3) August 2017 (3) July 2017 (4) June 2017 (4) May 2017 (6) April 2017 (5) March 2017 (2) February 2017 (8) January 2017 (5) December 2016 (2) November 2016 (4) October 2016 (2) September 2016 (3) August 2016 (3) May 2016 (4) February 2016 (3) January 2016 (5) December 2015 (9) September 2015 (1) July 2015 (4) May 2015 (2) April 2015 (3) March 2015 (2) February 2015 (3) January 2015 (4) December 2014 (2) November 2014 (4) October 2014 (12) September 2014 (1) August 2014 (4) July 2014 (10) June 2014 (4) May 2014 (3) April 2014 (8) March 2014 (4) February 2014 (4) January 2014 (4) December 2013 (6) November 2013 (6) October 2013 (5) September 2013 (6) August 2013 (4) July 2013 (3) June 2013 (5) May 2013 (11) April 2013 (9) March 2013 (9) February 2013 (10) January 2013 (10) December 2012 (6) November 2012 (7) October 2012 (19) September 2012 (14) August 2012 (12) June 2012 (4) May 2012 (12) April 2012 (12) March 2012 (9) February 2012 (18) January 2012 (12) December 2011 (5) November 2011 (12) October 2011 (15) September 2011 (14) August 2011 (7) July 2011 (4) June 2011 (10) May 2011 (3) April 2011 (13) March 2011 (14) February 2011 (12) January 2011 (12) December 2010 (8) November 2010 (24) October 2010 (13) September 2010 (12) August 2010 (9) July 2010 (10) June 2010 (10) May 2010 (3) April 2010 (11) March 2010 (1) February 2010 (35) Twitter Tweets by UTexasLaw Contact Texas Law Texas Law 727 East Dean Keeton St. Austin, Texas 78705 (512) 471-5151 Give to Texas Law Connect with Texas Law Facebook Twitter YouTube Flickr Instagram Helpful Links UT Home ABA Required Disclosures Web Privacy Policy Web Accessibility Policy Emergency Information Contact Us Resources Student Resources Faculty Resources Staff Resources © 2022 The University of Texas at Austin.
