The Brown-NIH GPP allows participants to take advantage of the best of two worlds - the prestigious academic environment of Brown University and the breadth and depth of research at the NIH, home to one of the world’s largest neuroscience research centers. At the NIH, graduate students work in a highly research-focused and collaborative environment with leading scientists and clinicians covering every subdiscipline of the field. They also share the NIH campus with the largest translational research hospital in the nation. This atmosphere creates a different kind of graduate experience, one that focuses on training the next generation of scientific leaders by emphasizing communication and collaboration skills, integration of information, and interdisciplinary investigation.
