WHEELCHAIR RUNNERS University Disability Resources (UDR) will have staff at the gates to Tercentenary Theatre on Commencement 2022 on May 26th and for Commencement 2020/2021 on May 29th. These staff will be providing wheelchair assistance (rides) from the gate to the guest’s seat in Tercentenary Theater, either to general seating or accessible seating. No reservation is needed for the wheelchair runner service. AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE ASL is provided for the Commencement 2022 and Commencement 2020/2021 programs at the ticketed accessible seating section in Tercentenary Theatre. Guests at Commencement 2022 needing ASL should exchange general seating tickets for accessible seating tickets. Please see the 2022 Accessible Seating Ticket information below on how to exchange. Guests at Commencement 2020/2021 needing ASL should request accessible seating tickets during online registration. CAPTIONING Open captions are provided on the video screens in Tercentenary Theatre. Please see the Commencement Accessibility Map for the locations of the screens. ACCESSIBLE SEATING TICKETS Accessible seating tickets are available on a first-come, first-served basis and will be distributed until all tickets are gone. In order to accommodate as many family members and friends with disabilities as possible in the reserved seating area, individuals with an accessible seating ticket will be permitted to have one companion accompany them into the accessible seating section. The companion must also have an accessible seating ticket. Harvard will make every effort to accommodate parents and guests without accessible seating tickets on Commencement Day, however accessible seating is limited and advanced planning is strongly encouraged. 2020/2021 Graduates can request accessible tickets as part of the online registration process. Information on accessible seating tickets for Commencement 2022 are listed below by School. HARVARD COLLEGE STUDENTS Graduating seniors will be able to exchange a certain number of their general admission guest tickets for accessible seating tickets at Senior Desk in May. More details about Senior Desk (including location and timing) will be shared with seniors later this spring. One companion accessible seating ticket is available to each guest in the accessible section (as a replacement for a general admission ticket); however, when space is available, best efforts will be made to seat a limited number of additional guests (without accessible seating tickets) with the understanding that they may need to relocate if an accessible seating ticket holder needs the space. For additional requests for accommodations, please email the University Disability Resources office at disabilityresources@harvard.edu or call 617-495-1859.
