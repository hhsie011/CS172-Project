Breadcrumb Home Gifts from Retirement Plans Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Ways to Give Gifts from Retirement Plans Gifts from Retirement Plans Your retirement plan benefits are likely a significant portion of your net worth. Due to special tax considerations, you could use your plan to make a gift. A Qualified Charitable Distribution (QCD) from an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) helps you donate funds without counting them as income and incurring penalties. QCDs let you reach your philanthropic goals and meet your required minimum distribution, or the smallest amount a person over the age of 70.5 must distribute each year from their IRA. To leverage your retirement plan through a donation, visit giving.columbia.edu/IRA or contact the Office of Gift Planning at 800-338-3294 or gift.planning@columbia.edu.
