Students learn in the classroom and through hands-on research experiences, and they are tasked with sharing their knowledge with others at the University and beyond. Students have the option to declare a Psychology degree (B.A. or B.S. tracks) or a Neuroscience degree (B.S.). Psychology and Neuroscience at a Glance Faculty Areas of Expertise (Affective) learning and memory Cognitive and socioemotional development (from infancy through old age) Virtue and morality Synergy across multiple levels of analysis Our faculty study each of these core problems from multiple perspectives: from animal models and computational models, to systems and cognitive neuroscience, to behavioral and psychophysiological measurements from individuals or groups.

They become critical thinkers as they reflect on topics that are at the core of the human experience: How we learn through our experiences; how brain cells give rise to thought; how context influences everything from what we see to how we behave toward others; which aspects of human behavior are easily controlled and which proceed without conscious awareness.
