Visiting students may apply for Housing for the Spring Term as a non-guaranteed student and may be assigned a room depending on availability. If a student is given an assignment, they will be housed with their class in upperclass residence halls. Assignment is based on building preference, with applications processed on a rolling basis. Visiting students may state a preference for a specific residence hall. Please note that preferences are considering during the assignment process but are not guaranteed. Learn more about the Visiting Student Program at Columbia. Process Visiting students who are interested in Housing for the spring should submit a request. Housing will then grant interested students access to the Housing Portal through which students can submit a Housing application. Students will be notified in December about availability. If they were assigned a space on campus, they will receive their room assignment in early January.
