What can I expect when I audition? 2. When will I know if I am accepted? 3. What if I canât come during one of the scheduled audition days? 4. How do I apply for a piano scholarship? 5. When will I find out about my piano scholarship offer? 6. Are scholarships available for graduate students? 7. What is the difference between the MM in Piano Performance and the MM in Piano Pedagogy and Performance? Both degrees have the word "performance" in them. 8. How do I know who I will study with if I am accepted? Piano 1. What can I expect when I audition? You will be auditioning in one of our performance halls on a Steinway concert grand piano. The audition committee will select the performance order of your repertoire. We usually do not have time to hear pieces in their entirety, so donât be surprised if you are interrupted in the middle of a piece. After you perform, you will be introduced to the piano faculty and have an opportunity to ask questions. We may ask you some questions, as well. 2. When will I know if I am accepted? We are usually able to inform students of their acceptance status within a week of the audition. 3. What if I canât come during one of the scheduled audition days? We offer two alternatives to auditioning on a scheduled audition day. Applicants for whom long-distance travel prevents them from appearing on campus in person may submit a video recording of their audition repertoire. Applicants who have conflicts with scheduled audition days may request a specially scheduled audition time. Such requests are based on faculty availability and thus it cannot be guaranteed that a special audition can be arranged. It is always best to audition in person on a scheduled audition day. 4. How do I apply for a piano scholarship? Applicants for Bachelor of Music (BM) and Bachelor of Music Education (BME) degrees where piano is the main area of study are automatically considered for a music (piano) scholarship. 5. When will I find out about my piano scholarship offer? Several steps must be complete before an applicant can be officially offered a music scholarship. First you must be fully accepted into the University and into the music program for which you auditioned. You must also have completed the necessary financial aid forms through the Baylor financial aid office. Once these steps are completed, piano scholarship offers are usually finalized and mailed out at the end of March or beginning of April. 6. Are scholarships available for graduate students? Graduate students are supported through assistantships rather than scholarships. Students on an assistantship are granted full tuition waivers and paid a monthly stipend in exchange for work duties based on the program you have applied for. In piano, assistantship duties are in collaborative playing (MM in Piano Performance; MM in Collaborative Piano) and teaching (MM in Piano Pedagogy and Performance). To apply for an assistantship, you must complete the application for assistantship form when you submit your application materials. 7. What is the difference between the MM in Piano Performance and the MM in Piano Pedagogy and Performance? Both degrees have the word "performance" in them. The MM in Piano Pedagogy and Performance includes the word "performance" to indicate that high-level artistry in piano performance is a major part of the degree curriculum. Students in this degree take regular lessons and prepare a full-length memorized solo recital. In other words, this degree is not a strictly "academic" degree. However, the MM in Piano Performance is still more intensive in its focus on performance. For instance, this degree requires the performance of two full-length memorized solo recitals. 8. How do I know who I will study with if I am accepted? All incoming students have the opportunity to request a particular teacher at entrance. You may also wish to contact faculty members prior to your audition to ask them about their teaching style and priorities, or to request a sample lesson, if you are able to visit our campus.
