SAC hosts volunteer opportunities throughout the year, allowing staff to come together and give back to the Rhode Island community. Let your voice be heard on Brown advisory boards and committees. Brown offers many opportunities for staff to be involved on campus — several of Brown's advisory boards and committees feature voting staff members. When staff vacancies are available, SAC announces opportunities in Today @ Brown, reviews applications, and submits recommendations for candidacy to the committee's chair. Join SAC!
