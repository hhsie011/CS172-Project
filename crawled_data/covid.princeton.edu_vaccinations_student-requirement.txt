Compliance with the vaccine policy is necessary to maintain prox access to campus facilities and to continue your progress to degree. When Am I Eligible for a Booster? Five months after the second dose of an mRNA vaccine, including Pfizer and Moderna. Two months after the single dose of the J&J Janssen vaccine. Students who received a WHO-approved vaccine that is not Pfizer, Moderna, or J&J should follow the CDC guidelines for boosters. If you are not eligible to get a booster before January 31, 2022, you will have 30 days from the date that you become eligible to enter your vaccine booster information into MyUHS. For example, a student who got their second dose of Moderna on August 15 would be eligible for a booster on February 15 and would need to get a booster and enter their vaccine information in MyUHS by March 17, 2022. As of March 15, 2022, individuals are eligible to receive COVID boosters 5 months after their initial COVID vaccines, and should do so within 30 days of that 5 month mark. This timeline is regardless of a recent COVID diagnosis, as a review of scientific evidence indicates there is no reason to delay receiving a booster despite a recent COVID infection. Students must upload proof of booster to MyUHS. Please note: Anyone eligible for a booster may receive either the Moderna or Pfizer version, regardless of their original COVID-19 vaccine. “Third doses” of the vaccine for immunocompromised people will count as a booster for the purpose of this policy.
