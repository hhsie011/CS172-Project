The program is open to all New Haven Public Schools students finishing grades three through 12 and who are in good standing in their music classes. MorseOnline provides instruction to singers, percussionists, woodwind, brass, guitar, and string players. Students in the MorseOnline program will engage in wellness activities, take private lessons, participate in studio classes, learn to use recording and editing tools, compose their own music, study different cultures and musical contexts, and understand the fundamentals of music theory. The 2021 MorseOnline program is scheduled to take place July 5–30. Family members are encouraged to attend morning wellness activities, evening storytelling events, and informal performances. Students do not need to audition for the MorseOnline program. Students will be admitted to the program at the recommendation of the student's current public school music teacher. MorseOnline is a program of YSM's Music in Schools Initiative, which is supported with a gift from the Yale College Class of 1957. apply now news aboout morseonline Music in Schools Initiative Exploring sonic possibilities and authentic voices: an introduction to creative music-making "Our students are collaborating on ideas, leading discussions, building environments of support and respect for one another, and, most important, exploring their creative voices through music," composer Alexis C.
