The webinar panel discussed some emerging efforts to rectify the large air pollution data gap using surface monitoring, remote sensing, and air quality modeling, with a focus on Nairobi. The webinar panel also discussed solutions and pathways forward for reducing the health burden from air pollution in Africa focusing its facts on air pollution causing millions of premature deaths and a host of illnesses in the world’s cities each year. This millions of premature deaths according to the discussions are especially true in sub-Saharan Africa, where sparse air pollution monitoring imparts high uncertainty to estimates of exposure and impact. Highlighted from the discussions also is that over five hundred million African children live in areas with no reliable air quality monitoring and this plays a great role in contributing to their premature deaths. Apart from discussing some emerging efforts to rectify this large air pollution data gap using surface monitoring, remote sensing, and air quality modeling, with a focus on Nairobi.
