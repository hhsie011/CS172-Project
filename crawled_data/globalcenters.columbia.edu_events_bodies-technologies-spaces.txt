Organized by Professor Zeynep Çelik, our eighth workshop, "Bodies, Technologies, Spaces," explores the impact of new technologies on everyday life at home from the 1880s to the 1930s. Marketing Orient: Pilules Orientales and Feminine Body in Fin-de-Siècle Istanbul Ersin Altın is an architect by training. He earned his master’s degree in History and Theory of Architecture. He completed his doctoral studies in the Urban Systems, joint Ph.D. program of New Jersey Institute of Technology and Rutgers University. His work is situated at the intersection of urban studies, history, and digital technologies. His research focuses on everyday life in the late Ottoman period with an emphasis on the changes in the perception of the body, home, and the city through historical analysis of the material world. He is currently a Visiting Assistant Professor of History of Art and Design at Pratt Institute. He also teaches history/theory survey courses and design studio courses at New Jersey Institute of Technology and Rutgers University. Personal Spaces as Showcases: Interior Photography in the First Decades of Twentieth Century Ece Zerman received her Ph.D. in history at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales (EHESS) Paris and is an associate member of the Center for Turkish, Ottoman, Balkan, and Central Asian Studies (CETOBaC) at EHESS. She holds MA and M.Res. degrees from the history departments of Boğaziçi University and the European University Institute in Florence. Based on her master thesis, she conceptualized an exhibition at SALT Research, “Dismantling the Archive: Representation, Identity, Memory in an Ottoman Family.” She taught at INALCO (Institut National des Langues et Civilisations Orientales), Paris and at Strasbourg University. Her research focuses on social and cultural history of the late Ottoman Empire and early Republic of Turkey, with a particular interest in personal narratives, photography, and domestic interiors. Healthy Homes: Hygiene, Disease Prevention, and Domesticity During the 1930s in Turkey Cansu Değirmencioğlu is a doctoral candidate at the Technical University of Munich, the Chair of History of Architecture and Curatorial Practice. She received her bachelor’s degree in Interior Architecture and her master’s degree in Architectural History at Istanbul Technical University. She is currently residing and carrying her studies in Berlin and working on her dissertation titled “Prescribed Modernity: The Impact of Health and Hygiene Concerns on Turkish Architecture During the Early Republican Era”, funded by the DAAD doctoral scholarship. Her scholarly research focuses on the intertwined histories of hygiene, medicine and modern architecture, and history of lighting design. Discussant: Alice Friedman is the Grace Slack McNeil Professor Of American Art and co-director of the Architecture Program at Wellesley College. She is the author of numerous books and articles on the history of architecture, focusing on domesticity, gender, and sexuality, including Women and the Making of the Modern House (1998) and American Glamor and the Evolution of Modern Architecture (2010). Her current projects include a book-length study of queer New York in the 1920s and ‘30s, and a series of in-depth case studies that explore the idea that modern architecture, which comes in many different shapes and sizes-designed to accommodate non-conforming households and sexualities, does not look ‘modern’ at all.
