Colonial modernity could be another name for this doomsday machine. Roy’s word “portal” is a figure of Transition, a figure shot through with complex structures of feeling. Stephanie LeMenager uses the term “Transition” to indicate the socio-economic shifts that our climate crisis demands. Transition connotes a psychological or even spiritual atmosphere in the current US and other regions of the North where the hegemonies of liberal modernity and liberal humanism are shattering, where mainstream media channels are overwhelmed by the noise of populist propaganda, where humanities programs are questioning whether “humanities” disciplines can comprehend and adapt, toward decolonial thought, toward the ecological facts of a collapsing climate. Transition aesthetics evident in literature and art offer possibilities for living on within near, almost unrecognizable futures.
