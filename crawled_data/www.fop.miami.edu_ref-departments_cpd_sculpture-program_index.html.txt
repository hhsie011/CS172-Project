As part of their development regulations, the City of Coral Gables requires that public art be included as part of project development. The Campus Planning Department ensures that the University is in compliance with the City's Art in Public Places regulations. A Message from the Lowe Art Museum Director Art delights the senses and stimulates the mind. It is a keeper of memories (both individual and collective) and the hallmark of a civilized and engaged society. Public art, in particular, plays a critical role in giving voice to human creativity while also beautifying our surroundings. It is for these reasons that the University of Miami is proud to host a vibrant sculpture park, which comprises more than thirty pieces by leading sculptors from around the world. These works are a testament to the University’s commitment not only to the arts and all that they represent but also to globalism and diversity. In addition, they speak to UM’s abiding interest in enhancing our local community and promoting a shared sense of pride. The works held in the University of Miami’s sculpture park were generously gifted to the U by a number of remarkable philanthropists and are available for the general public to enjoy. This guide is designed to help you easily locate and identify these sculptures, which have been installed at strategic points throughout our lovely Coral Gables campus and are professionally overseen by the Lowe Art Museum. Founded in 1950, the Lowe is Miami-Dade County’s first collecting art museum. Its encyclopedic collection comprises 19,000 works and spans 5,000 years of global art and culture. The University’s outdoor sculpture park, which was formally established in 2001, is a fitting adjunct to the Museum's holdings and reflects Miami-Dade County’s diverse community. We hope you enjoy discovering the University of Miami’s outstanding collection of outdoor sculptures, which will continue to grow in the years to come.
