This program was developed to advance the research, education, and scholarship of engineering in medicine and was founded as a partnership between Clemson and MUSC. It has grown out of a desire for inter-institutional collaboration to enhance bioengineering research and education focused on clinical needs and develop economic opportunities in the engineering and technologies associated with healthcare delivery. Our mission is to be a premier program in Bioengineering in South Carolina and the South-East US with a clinical, translational and entrepreneurial educational and research focus. The program currently has five full-time tenured or tenure-track faculty from Clemson working and teaching on the MUSC campus, with a full complement of state-of-the-art laboratories and teaching facilities for graduate education in Bioengineering. The unique opportunities for students in this program include clinical immersion, direct collaboration with clinicians and basic life sciences, and working and living in a premier healthcare and life sciences educational environment. Innovation and translational research are a particular focus of the program and the potential for healthcare economic development opportunities that may arise from the close interactions of engineers with clinicians. The CU-MUSC Program in Bioengineering is poised for the next step in this exciting process of integrating bioengineering into medicine. News and Events Ying Mei has been awarded an NIH R01!
