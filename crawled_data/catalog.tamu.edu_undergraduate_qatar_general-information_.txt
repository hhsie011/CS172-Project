The ever-expanding population and the increased demands for goods and services have imposed new challenges to provide effective solutions while minimizing unwanted side effects. Engineers recognize that all actions taken have their respective costs, and that solutions to long-standing societal problems are found in careful, thorough planning and study. With a pragmatic background in problem solving, engineers are perhaps best qualified to address society’s problems. Texas A&M University’s College of Engineering strives to provide its students with a high-quality education that will prepare them for a wide range of careers at the forefront of the engineering field. The curriculum is designed to accomplish this by closely integrating cutting-edge basic and applied research with innovative classroom instruction. Texas A&M University’s engineering programs are routinely ranked among the best in the U.S., and graduates are highly recruited to provide leadership and innovative solutions to global challenges. Our faculty members maintain active research programs in a wide range of areas. In addition, our undergraduate students participate in numerous co-op and internship programs, which give them the opportunity to apply their knowledge to real-world challenges in a variety of settings. At Texas A&M University at Qatar, engineering students take courses in the fundamental disciplines—mathematics, sciences, and liberal arts—that will prepare them for the rigorous technical training that follows. This training is dedicated to specialized studies in one of the four engineering fields offered at Texas A&M University at Qatar. Combining intensive and demanding coursework with practical experience means students are ready to step into their professional fields and make immediate and meaningful contributions. Freshman Curriculum The freshman year is identical for all majors in the College of Engineering. It is recognized that many students will change the sequence and number of courses taken in any semester. Deviations from the prescribed course sequence, however, should be made with care and in consultation with an academic advisor to ensure that prerequisites for all courses are met. College Prerequisite Policy The following prerequisite policy applies to any student in a College of Engineering undergraduate degree program and to any student who seeks admission to an undergraduate degree program in the College of Engineering. This policy is in addition to prerequisite policies imposed by the University (Texas A&M University Student Rules). For complete details concerning this policy, students should contact their Undergraduate Advising Office. Students must earn a grade of C or better in all courses identified in each College of Engineering undergraduate degree program and any prerequisites for these courses. If a student earns a grade of D or F in any of these courses, the student is required to repeat the course before enrolling in a more advanced course that has the D/F course as a prerequisite. A student may attempt a course no more than three times, including courses graded Q or W but excluding those graded NG, unless approval has been received from their department. A student must complete all prerequisites for a course with a grade of C or better by the start of the semester in which the student plans to enroll in the course. A student is responsible for checking the prerequisites for each course to ensure the prerequisite requirements have been satisfied. A student who registers for a course for which he/she lacks the necessary prerequisite course(s) and/or the prerequisite grade requirement will be required to drop the course. A student who is told to drop a course and is still enrolled by the deadline set each semester may be administratively dropped by their department. If a student is administratively dropped from a course, the student is responsible for all financial obligations associated with the drop. An administrative drop may adversely impact (including, but not limited to): health insurance benefits, financial aid, athletic eligibility, INS status, veterans’ benefits, and eligibility to participate in extracurricular activities. Other Requirements All required coursework must be taken for a grade to satisfy requirements for a degree in the College of Engineering. Courses cannot be taken on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis to satisfy this requirement. ENGR[X] ENGR[X] is a college-wide, zero-credit-hour required program that is composed of approved engineering-centric activities that meet the criteria of high-impact learning experiences. Undergraduate students can use their participation in one of these activities to partially satisfy their ENGR[X] requirement. Full satisfaction of the ENGR[X] requirement includes participating in an engineering-centric activity and submitting a meaningful, self-reflection that discusses the experience and overall impact on the student’s education. Each engineering department identifies the activities it will accept in satisfying a student’s ENGR[X] requirement. Students should consult with their academic advisor for approved activities. More information on ENGR[x] at Texas A&M University at Qatar can be found at https://www.qatar.tamu.edu/students/academic-services/engrx. Course Credit Credit by Examination Undergraduate students at Texas A&M University at Qatar may earn course credit by demonstrating superior achievement on tests offered through several examination programs. Credit earned by examination does not contribute to a student’s grade point ratio. The university awards credit for scores on certain tests published by the Advanced Placement Program (AP), the SAT Subject Tests and the International Baccalaureate (IB) Program. Score minimums to be eligible for credit can be found on the Testing Services website. In some instances, Texas A&M University at Qatar also offers qualified students opportunities to earn credits by taking departmental examinations prepared by the faculty. Additional information concerning credit by examination or departmental examinations may be obtained from the Academic Services Office. Registration and Academic Status Registration for the fall and spring semesters is accomplished at several times. During the fall and spring semesters (in November and April), a preregistration period is held for currently enrolled and readmitted students to register for the next semester. There are periods of announced open registration for students who were unable to preregister during the scheduled preregistration period. New Student Conferences serve as an opportunity for new undergraduate students to register. Further information concerning registration may be obtained from the academic calendar published in this catalog or from the Office of Records. The schedule of classes is available online. More information may be found here. Grading System Because students attend a college or university to extend their education, grades are usually given as an indication of the proficiency of their endeavors. The student’s semester grade in a course shall be based upon performance and/or participation in class, exercises and tests, laboratory work and final examination as applicable to the course. The proportionate weight assigned to each of the factors shall be determined by the department administering the course. More information may be found here. Withdrawal from Texas A&M University at Qatar An official withdrawal from the university will result when a student drops all in progress and courses not yet started in a particular term. A student who withdraws from the university before the completion of a semester or summer term is required to comply with the official withdrawal procedure. This process is initiated by submitting a request through the Student Withdrawal channel on the My Record tab in the Howdy portal; the University Clearance Form found on the Office of Records website must also be submitted. Students may not withdraw after the Q-drop deadline. The student’s dean will retain the authority to support a student withdrawal after the deadline. If a student is enrolled in one or more inter/intra-session ("minimesters") or summer terms and chooses to withdraw, all current and future in progress courses for the entire semester will be dropped. The student will be ineligible to register for courses for the remainder of that semester. STUDENTS RECEIVING FINANCIAL AID or SPONSORSHIPS should contact their sponsor before withdrawing. Withdrawing from the university does not cancel all tuition and fees. Failure to comply may result in owing a substantial sum rather than having a zero balance or refund. In addition, withdrawing may affect immigration status. Please check this carefully before initiating the withdrawal process. For university policy regarding withdrawal, see the Texas A&M University Student Rules. Transcripts Students applying for admission to Texas A&M are required to submit transcripts of previous academic work and in some cases, results of standardized tests. The submission of altered documents or the failure to furnish complete and accurate information on admissions forms will be grounds for disciplinary action. Individuals who previously attended Texas A&M University at Qatar may obtain an official transcript of their completed coursework, provided they have no financial obligations to Texas A&M University, Texas A&M University at Qatar, or the Qatar Foundation. A fee, which according to state law must be paid in advance, will be charged for each copy. During grading and degree posting, official transcripts may be produced for enrolled students only if all courses for that semester or term are shown as in progress (IP) or have all final grades posted. Current Students Current students may order an official transcript through the Howdy Portal by navigating to the Grades and Transcripts channel under the My Record tab. Former Students Former students who attended Texas A&M University at Qatar may be able to purchase an official transcript online through the Howdy Portal by navigating to the Grades and Transcripts channel under the Former Student tab. Graduation Application, Diploma and Commencement Formal application for a degree at Texas A&M University at Qatar is done via the Howdy Portal. Students should navigate to the My Record tab and use the link in the Degree Evaluation channel to submit an Application for Graduation. Students must also pay the required diploma fee and the optional regalia fee (if planning to attend the commencement ceremony) using the Online Payment Portal. Applications for graduation should be submitted by the deadline stated in the Texas A&M University at Qatar academic calendar. Under unusual circumstances, an application for a degree may be accepted after the stated deadline. Students must have settled all financial obligations to the university and Qatar Foundation prior to receiving a diploma. Texas A&M University at Qatar graduate and undergraduate students completing their degree in July or December will have the opportunity to participate in the commencement ceremony in May, following the completion of their degree. Students must participate in the commencement ceremony at their home campus. Language of Instruction The language of instruction at Texas A&M University at Qatar is English.

Official high school transcript(s) or an official completion document from a secondary school program Freshman applicants who have not graduated from high school or who have not completed a secondary school program at the time of application must submit a current official transcript listing all high school/secondary coursework taken, credit earned, grades and, if calculated by the school, respective class rank. All will be used in determining the candidate’s academic preparation. Freshman applicants who apply and are admitted prior to having graduated from high school or having completed their final year of secondary school must submit an official transcript that indicates the graduation or completion date prior to the first day of class in order to remain eligible to enroll. Freshman applicants who have graduated at the time of application are to submit an official high school or secondary school program transcript that includes coursework, credit earned, grades and class rank, and date of graduation. To be considered official, a transcript must bear an original signature of a school official or an original school seal. Transcripts in a language other than English must be accompanied by an official English translation. Applicants who have attended more than one high school should submit official transcripts from each school attended. Emailed copies are not official and will not be accepted. 4. Official college and/or Academic Bridge Program (ABP) transcript(s) An official transcript is required from every post-secondary institution attended even if the applicant did not earn credit or receive a course grade, or if the course is not transferable. This includes attendance at the ABP and any colleges or universities. Coursework from one college posted on the transcript of another college will not satisfy this requirement. Failure to acknowledge attendance and provide transcripts from all schools attended may be considered a fraudulent and result in a rejected admission application. Official transcripts on paper are to be sent by the sending institution in a sealed envelope. The transcript will not be considered official if the student has had access to the actual transcript. Transcripts in a language other than English must be accompanied by an official English translation. Emailed copies are not official and will not be accepted. Evaluation of college and university transcripts for transfer credit will be based on the transfer admission procedures outlined in this catalog. 5. Official test scores OFFICIAL SAT or ACT Scores Due to the continued lack of availability of in-person testing opportunities, Texas A&M University will not require test scores from freshman applicants in the fall 2022 or spring 2023 semesters. The submission of tests scores will not create any unfair advantage or disadvantage for those students who provide them. Scores should be sent directly from the testing agency. The Texas A&M at Qatar SAT code is 4290; the ACT code is 5270. The highest total score from a single test date will be considered for admission. Test scores must be from a test date within five years of the date of planned enrollment.

Four years of science which must come from biology, chemistry, and physics. English language preparatory courses indicating a high proficiency of understanding course content and concepts taught in the English language. How to Be Admitted Applicants may be admitted one of three ways. Due to the limited size of the entering class, the number of students accepted from each category is limited. 1. Academic admits Applicants qualify for academic admission if they: Successfully complete the required high school coursework and achieve excellent grades. Achieve minimum college entrance test scores as follows: SAT Math score of 670 or ACT Math score of 29. IELTS score of 7 or TOEFL score of 100. Students who do not submit TOEFL or IELTS scores must submit a minimum SAT Evidence Based Reading and Writing (EBRW) score of 660 or higher and achieve a combined SAT Math and EBRW score of 1360 or higher, or the ACT English and Composite score equivalents. Students will be admitted according to availability of spots. 2. Review admits If an applicant does not qualify for academic admission, the complete application file will be considered through an extensive holistic review. Factors considered include: Academic achievements — class rank, school curriculum and recommended coursework, and college admission test scores. Personal achievements — involvement in extracurricular activities, community service, leadership, employment and summer activities, as well as any talents, awards and honors. Information shared in essays and resumes. Students will be admitted according to availability of spots. 3. Provisional admission into the Aggie Gateway Program The program is designed to offer high-achieving students from Qatar and the Gulf Corporation Council (GCC) (as well as other countries if space is available) who do not meet the minimum test scores the chance to enroll in courses at Texas A&M at Qatar for 12 months. Once students satisfy the criteria of the Aggie Gateway Program, they can become full-time engineering students. Students will be admitted according to availability of spots. Placement Tests Texas A&M at Qatar will administer placement tests to admitted students. Each accepted student may be required to participate in English and/or Mathematics placement exams. Details regarding the exams will be provided once a student has accepted his or her offer of admission. Application Calendar and Notification The freshman application to Texas A&M at Qatar is open from September 1 through March 1. Priority consideration will be given to those candidates who submit a completed application early. Failure to meet the application deadline will disqualify the applicant from being considered for admission. Candidates will be notified of acceptance once admission decisions are made, which is usually in April and May. New student orientation will occur the week prior to the start of classes, with dates to be announced, and attendance is mandatory for those admitted. Classes normally begin in August. Candidates admitted to Texas A&M at Qatar will be notified by telephone or email, followed by a written admission confirmation letter mailed to the student’s home address or collected at the Office of Admissions. Candidates denied admission will be notified by email and/or postal correspondence to the permanent address specified on the application for admission. When to Apply Students currently enrolled in high school or secondary school programs who wish to be considered for admission to Texas A&M at Qatar should apply while in their senior or final year of their high school or secondary school program. Candidates are strongly encouraged to take the necessary college entrance examinations before the beginning of their final year in high school or secondary school. Additional English Proficiency Requirements for Admitted Undergraduate Students Whose Native Language Is Not English The criteria for enrollment at Texas A&M at Qatar differ slightly for those students whose native language is not English. These applicants must demonstrate the ability to speak, write and understand the English language. Undergraduate students may meet this requirement in one of the following ways: Have an official TOEFL score of 600 on the paper-based test or 100 on the Internet-based test. Have an official IELTS score of 7.0 on the overall band. Have an official SAT Evidence Based Reading and Writing (EBRW) score of 560 or higher or an ACT English score of 21 or higher. Transfer from an accredited U.S. institution of higher education with at least 30 semester credit hours, including the equivalent to Texas A&M ENGL 103 or ENGL 104 with a grade of C or better. Achieve English language proficiency verification by taking an English language proficiency or placement examination prior to enrolling for the first semester at Texas A&M at Qatar. (If foundation English is required, the student will be enrolled in a pre-university English course, which will extend the time required to complete a degree.) Transfer Admission Students will be considered for transfer admission if they provide evidence of a successful record of proven academic rigor from a university whose accreditation is recognized by Texas A&M. Applicants wishing to transfer to Texas A&M at Qatar should have completed 24 transferable hours at the time of application and must have at least a 2.5 grade point average (GPA). Transfer admission decisions are very competitive; thus, admission standards are not known until the review process begins. Preference is given to applicants with the highest GPA and credit hours. Applicants who drop or withdraw from courses frequently and who do not achieve satisfactory grades routinely will be at a disadvantage in the review for admission. The entire application, including the essay, is considered in reviewing the transfer applicant for admission. Applicants with less than a 2.5 GPA will be denied admission. Only the most qualified transfer candidates will be admitted. For more transfer admission information, please visit the website at exploretamuq.com.

Credit by examination courses that are part of the applicant’s program of study at their previous institution will be awarded, provided they meet transfer guidelines. 4. Coursework taken as credit by examination must be listed as a specific course on an official college transcript to be considered in the admissions process and for transfer of credit. Transfer Course Credit Policy Transfer credit on coursework completed at the time of application to Texas A&M at Qatar is determined when an official transcript from the originating institution is presented as part of the application for admission or readmission process. An official transcript is required from every post-secondary institution attended (including dual credit earned in high school) even if the applicant did not earn credit or receive a course grade, or if the course is not transferable. The transfer of course credit will be determined by the Office of Records on a course-by-course basis. Credit submitted for transfer must be on an official transcript received by the Office of Records from the Office of the Registrar of the institution where the credit was earned. Course content will be determined from the catalog description or the syllabus. The transferability of credit decision will be based on the criteria as specified by Texas A&M University (see Transfer Course Credit Policies for more information). All criteria are to be considered together; for example, criterion 10 may be qualified by criterion 7. Credit from Non-Accredited Schools Students who transfer to Texas A&M from an institution of higher education that is not accredited by one of the regional accrediting associations may validate the work taken at the institution by one of the following methods: Successful completion of a comprehensive departmental examination or nationally standardized examination that is approved by the department. Successful completion of a higher level course in the same subject area when approved by the head of the department and the dean of the college. Credit will be given to students transferring from non-accredited public colleges in Texas for work completed with grades of C or better if they earn a grade point of 2.0 (C average) on the first 30 hours of coursework in residence at Texas A&M at Qatar. Credit from Foreign Institutions Transfer work from institutions following educational systems other than the U.S. with instruction in English will be evaluated on an individual basis. A-level examinations with a grade of C or better will transfer. Baccalaureate II examinations will not transfer; however, students may take placement and proficiency examinations to receive credit by examination. Credit will be given for work satisfactorily completed in an international institution offering programs recognized by Texas A&M. Official credentials submitted directly to the Office of Records and a listing of courses completed and grades awarded must accompany any request for transfer credit. Transfer work will be awarded by course title unless previous arrangements have been made using the Texas A&M at Qatar equivalency form or the course has been evaluated and approved as transferable to Texas A&M at Qatar. Courses must be equivalent in character and content to courses offered at Texas A&M at Qatar. Credit will not be awarded from international institutions that are not academically accredited by the Ministry of Education or other appropriate authority in the home country. No English composition courses will be transferred from institutions located in non-English-speaking countries. American history and American political science (government) courses will not transfer from foreign institutions outside the United States. Courses taken at language training centers or institutes are generally not awarded transfer credit. A transcript from such an institution must be issued through the Office of the Registrar at a Texas A&M–recognized university, institute or language training center. Credentials of all language training centers and institutes are carefully checked. Admission Criteria for Other Application Types Readmission Criteria Admission decisions for readmission are based on the following: GPA on Texas A&M at Qatar coursework; GPA on coursework since leaving Texas A&M at Qatar; Desired major; and Information presented in the application and essay/statement of purpose if provided.

Tuition and Fees for Texas A&M University at Qatar On This Page Tuition and Fees Payment of Tuition and Fees Financial Obligation for Graduating Students Citations Cancelling of Registration Cancellation for Nonpayment of Tuition or Fees Fees for Special Items or Services Application Fees Diploma Fee Refund Policy Withdrawal from Texas A&M at Qatar Tuition and Fee Adjustments Financial Assistance/Scholarships Tuition and Fees As a state institution, Texas A&M has held firmly to the premise that the Qatar campus should remain affordable, and therefore should follow the same tuition and fee structure as that of the main campus. All tuition and fee amounts provided herein represent the most accurate figures available at the time of this publication and are subject to change without notice. Full details on tuition rates are available at www.qatar.tamu.edu/students/tuition-financial-aid-and-scholarships. Educational expenses for the nine academic months will vary according to personal needs. University rules regarding tuition and fees and all related payments in place at the time of publishing are reflected here. All are subject to change. Payment of Tuition and Fees Students must meet all financial obligations to the university by their due dates. Officials at Texas A&M at Qatar calculate the appropriate tuition and fees of each student enrolled, and the Qatar Foundation issues to each student his or her respective tuition statement. Students are then responsible for making payment to the Qatar Foundation’s cashier office. Students will receive their invoices via their Texas A&M at Qatar email addresses. Failure to pay amounts owed may result in cancellation of the student’s registration and being barred from future enrollment and receiving official transcripts. Qatar Foundation policy requires that tuition and fees be paid as early as possible in the semester. Arrangements for paying tuition in installments should be made with the Academic Services Office and the Qatar Foundation Finance Office. Financial Obligation for Graduating Students According to Texas A&M University Student Rules and Chapter § 54.007 (c) of the Texas Education Code, all financial obligations owed to the university and/or to the Qatar Foundation must be paid by the end of the semester. Failure to settle all financial obligations will result in withholding a student’s diploma at graduation. Additionally, a block will be placed on the student’s account, which will prohibit registration in subsequent semesters and the receipt of official transcripts. Citations Section 14.15 of the Texas A&M University Student Rules states “The student must have settled all financial obligations to the University.” Chapter § 54.007 (c) of the Texas Education Code states “A student who fails to make payment prior to the end of the semester may be denied credit for the work done that semester.” Cancelling of Registration Once students have registered for classes and subsequently wish to withdraw from the university prior to the first day of classes, they must do the following to prevent being charged tuition/fees for the term: Contact the Office of Records prior to the first day of classes and complete a withdrawal form indicating the intent to officially withdraw from the university. Contact the Academic Services Office. Contact the sponsoring agency if the student is sponsored. Following this procedure is especially important for students in order to prevent being assessed tuition/fees for the term even if the student has decided not to attend. Failure to request cancellation of an unwanted registration may result in grades of F or I in all courses for the semester. The student will be held responsible for paying all fees for the semester, regardless of whether he or she attended classes. Cancellation for Nonpayment of Tuition or Fees If notified by the Qatar Foundation of nonpayment, the university reserves the right to cancel registration for any semester in which a student is enrolled. Fees for Special Items or Services Application Fees The application-for-admission fee for undergraduate and graduate applicants is: QAR 330, or $90 USD, and is non-refundable. Diploma Fee A non-refundable fee per degree sought is assessed the semester a student applies for graduation. This fee is payable each time a student applies for graduation. A late diploma fee is charged at the rate of QAR 185, or $50 USD, in addition to the diploma fee above, to those who apply for graduation after the set deadline. Refund Policy Withdrawal from Texas A&M at Qatar Once registered for classes, a student is considered officially enrolled unless otherwise restricted from enrolling. Stopping payment to the Qatar Foundation or allowing the check or bank draft to be returned unpaid by the bank for any reason does not constitute official withdrawal. The withdrawal process is specified in the section “Cancelling of Registration.” A withdrawal form found online at www.qatar.tamu.edu/students/office-of-records/student-forms explains exactly what the student needs to do. Failure to follow procedures for withdrawing from the university may result in financial penalties and delays with future enrollment, and course work may be recorded as incomplete and failed. Once a student registers, he or she is responsible for the total cost of the tuition and fees assessed if the withdrawal process is not followed properly, and refunds will occur only within the specified refund time periods as listed in the section “Tuition and Fee Adjustments.” Recipients of Qatar Foundation financial assistance should talk to a financial aid representative at the Qatar Foundation before withdrawing. Sponsored students should talk to a representative from their respective sponsoring agency prior to withdrawing. Tuition and Fee Adjustments Fall and Spring Semester and Eight-Week Summer Semester Tuition Refunds Timing Percentage By 4 p.m. on the last business day before the first day of class 100% During the first five class days 80% During the second five class days 70% During the third five class days 50% During the fourth five class days 25% After the fourth five class days None Five-Week Summer Term Tuition Refunds Timing Percentage By 4 p.m. on the last business day before the first day of class 100% During the first, second or third class day 80% During the fourth, fifth or sixth class day 50% Seventh day of class and thereafter None Financial Assistance/Scholarships The financial assistance program is designed for all students who have a demonstrated financial need for assistance to meet college expenses and who are making satisfactory academic progress, as defined by the policies of the Qatar Foundation Financial Services Office's financial aid agreement that students sign upon receiving financial assistance. Texas A&M at Qatar submits academic program reports to Qatar Foundation, following the guidelines of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). University scholarships, on a limited basis, are available to selected students and are also awarded based on academic excellence. Students who are on conduct probation are not eligible for university-awarded scholarships. In determining the type and amount of financial assistance necessary to meet a student’s financial need, Qatar Foundation expects parents to make a maximum effort to assist with college expenses. The financial assistance resources of Qatar Foundation and university scholarships should be viewed only as supplementary to the financial resources of the applicant and family. Only those students who have been accepted for enrollment into the university may apply for Qatar Foundation financial aid and/or for university scholarships.
