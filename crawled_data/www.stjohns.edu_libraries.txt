These ebooks will enhance the Libraries' ebook collection to include books about and by traditionally marginalized individuals and groups. Users can find these books through the Libraries catalog or by going to https://stjohnslib.overdrive.com/. There are instructions for reading these ebooks through the Libby app. Getting Started with Libby St. John’s University Libraries’ Community Norms St. John’s University Libraries fosters the open exchange of ideas and inquiry in a respectful environment free of harassment. Harassment may include comments, gestures, facial expressions, or imagery that demeans people based on language, religion, ethnicity, gender, physical or mental disability, physical appearance, or sexual preference. Those using library spaces, services and resources will treat other library users and employees with consideration and respect. We will respect the rights of others, and practice self-discipline. We will help protect the library collections and spaces while holding ourselves and each other accountable for keeping these norms. Together we can create a library environment that is welcoming, caring and affirming. Adopted by the St. John’s University Libraries Faculty Council on November 2, 2021.
