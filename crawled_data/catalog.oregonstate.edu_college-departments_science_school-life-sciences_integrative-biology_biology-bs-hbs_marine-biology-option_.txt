The core biological sciences background of the Biology major is coupled with field and laboratory course work in marine biology, ecology, conservation, and oceanography. The option emphasizes research and includes experiential courses completed in residence at the OSU Hatfield Marine Science Center in Newport, Oregon. Additional research or internship experience is strongly recommended for option students, and three credits can be applied to the option electives. The Marine Biology option provides excellent preparation for graduate programs in marine biology. Students completing the Marine Biology option cannot seek the Marine Biology and Ecology minor. Option Code: 572 Options in the Biology major require 15 or fewer additional credits (one term) beyond the basic Biology major, and most students can complete the additional Marine Biology option course work in four years. Courses used to satisfy the Marine Biology option also satisfy the Biology and Society, Organismal Biology, Physiology, Writing Intensive Course. Physics/Computer Science and Quantitative Applications, and Experiential Learning or Integrative Biology electives in the Biology major. At least one term in residence at Hatfield Marine Science Center is required (spring or summer). The 15-credit BI 450 Marine Biology and Ecology course is taught each spring term at Hatfield Marine Science Center and is by application only. The course covers marine invertebrates, algae and fishes, as well as sections on marine ecology, conservation and policy. It also includes an undergraduate research project. Students apply to, and are accepted, the fall term before the spring they plan to attend. Applications are available in the Integrative Biology Office, Cordley Hall 3029. The summer term at Hatfield does not require an application and includes a variety of courses. BI 111 is an optional weekend experiential course at Hatfield Marine Science Center that complements other option coursework, particularly for students with little or no previous marine experience. For further information, see MyDegrees or the Integrative Biology website.
