Nick Pace, PhD Home College of Medicine Faculty C. Nick Pace,PhD C. Nick Pace, PhD Distinguished Professor Regents Professor McMullin Professor of Genetics Biography Research Interests Representative Publications Contact Molecular & Cellular Medicine , TX Phone: 979.845.1788 Biography Dr. Nick Pace received his BS in chemistry from the University of Utah in 1962, and his PhD in biochemistry from Duke University in 1966 working with Dr. Charles Tanford. His postdoctoral work was in the chemistry department at Cornell University working with Dr. Gordon Hammes. He joined the faculty at Texas A&M in 1968. In 1982 he took a sabbatical at the MRC Centre in Cambridge England working with Dr. Tom Creighton and Dr. Alan Barrett. In 1992 he was a visiting professor at Osaka University in the Institute for Protein Research. Research Interests The important tasks in living cells are carried out by proteins in which the polypeptide chain is folded into a globular structure that is essential for their biological function. The amino acid sequence of the protein determines the folded structure. Proteins can now be constructed with any desired amino acid sequence. The potential applications of this technology in health and other areas are limited only by our knowledge and imagination. We try to learn how changes in the amino acid sequence effect the structure, function, solubility, and stability of a protein. Our ultimate goal is to be able to predict the folded structure of a protein given just the amino acid sequence. Representative Publications Grimsley, G.R., Scholtz, J.M., and Pace, C.N.
