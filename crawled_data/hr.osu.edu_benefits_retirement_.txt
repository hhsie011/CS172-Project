Executive Retirement Plans❯❯ The Ohio State University offers an additional retirement program called the Retirement Continuation Plan (RCP)/415(m) for some employees whose salary exceeds IRS and Ohio retirement system limits under OPERS, STRS, or ARP Ohio law limits each plan on the amount that can be sent to the mandatory retirement plans per year or the amount of compensation from which retirement contributions can be taken. The RCP/415(m) enables eligible participants to increase retirement savings. This page provides an overview of the plan. Specific plan details will be mailed to the employee upon eligibility for the plan. Limits Your retirement limit is determined by your base retirement plan and/or date of hire. Contributions to your base retirement plan (OPERS, STRS, or ARP) will stop for the remainder of the calendar or fiscal year when the applicable limit has been reached: Retirement Limits Retirement Plan Date of Hire 2022 Limit OPERS (Traditional and Combined Plans) Prior to 1994 $450,000 in retirement eligible earnings 1994 + $305,000 in retirement eligible earnings STRS-OH (Traditional and Combined Plans) Prior to July 1, 1996 $450,000 in retirement eligible earnings July 1, 1996 + $305,000 in retirement eligible earnings ARP and OPERS/STRS Define Contribution Plans All participants $61,000 in employee and employer contributions to the account The limits noted above apply to the 2021 calendar/fiscal year and are subject to change as determined by the IRS. How it works If you elect to make contributions to the RCP/415(m), contributions from your paycheck are made on a pre-tax basis. You may choose a contribution rate of 0%, 4%, 8% or 12%. This is a one-time irrevocable election that must be made within 60 days of eligibility. Your contributions will take effect as soon as administratively feasible after the signed RCP/415(m) election form is received and after your contributions to OPERS, STRS or ARP have reached the applicable limit. The RCP/415(m) contribution will continue for the remainder of that calendar/fiscal year and, if eligible, will be in effect for all future years in which you participate in the RCP/415(m) through Ohio State. The university may contribute to the RCP/415(m) on your behalf. The employer contribution will begin when you may no longer contribute to OPERS, STRS or the ARP and will continue for the remainder of the calendar/fiscal year, at which time base retirement deductions will resume. Note: It is not necessary for you to make employee contributions to receive the university contribution. Additional information will be provided upon eligibility for the plan(s).
