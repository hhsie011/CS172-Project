Planning and Real Estate Development Current: Real Estate Development Clemson MRED Welcome to the Clemson University MRED Program Clemson’s MRED program creates future development entrepreneurs who will produce innovative, quality projects respecting environmental and economic sustainability, design excellence and financial feasibility within the risk-reward framework. The MRED program focuses on promoting an entire vision for a community through sustainable design, creative financing methods, place making and healthy communities. The MRED degree is jointly offered by the Department of City Planning and Real Estate Development in the College of Architecture, Arts and Humanities, and the Wilbur O. and Ann Powers College of Business. The program’s degree blends together six disciplines designed to balance theoretical applications with real world relevance. The program offers MBA specializations with a more focused approach on the real estate industry. This interdisciplinary approach ensures that Clemson MRED graduates become visionaries who guide the multiple perspectives that converge during the development and building process. MRED News The Clemson MRED Way The complexities and dynamics of today’s real estate industry demand professionals who view themselves as stewards of our world’s fragile resources and who believe in responsible land use. Clemson University’s Master of Real Estate Development (MRED) program recognizes that responsible development is not just a real estate industry fad. It is a way of life and a way of work.
