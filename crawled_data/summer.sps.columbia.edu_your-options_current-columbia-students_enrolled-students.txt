Columbia Engineering High School Coding Academy Summer STEM Program for High School Students Summer STEM Program for Teachers Current Columbia Students: Enrolled Students Current Columbia Students Menu Overview Tuition & Fees Housing Registration Information Enrolled Students FAQ Contact Request Information Enroll Request Information Enroll Current Columbia Students Current Columbia Students Enrolled Students Add/Drop Students can make changes to their schedule free of charge on the second, third, fourth, and fifth days of each session. This timeframe is referred to as the Change of Program Period. Students who wish to add or drop a course during this timeframe can do so by logging on to SSOL during their registration/ enrollment appointment times. Dropping an Individual Course After Change of Program Period There is no refund of tuition for individual courses dropped after the last day of the change-of-program period. If you wish to drop a course during this timeframe, you must complete an add/drop form. Important: Failure to attend classes or notification submitted only to the instructor does not constitute dropping a course and will result in a mark of UW (Unofficial Withdrawal) for the course and full tuition will be charged. See the Change-of-Program Period Dates listed on the Calendars page. Withdrawals The University defines withdrawing as dropping oneâ€™s entire program of courses (to 0 points) in any given term. Students who wish to withdraw must notify the School in writing by following the necessary withdrawal procedures. Canceling Your Enrollment in the Summer Sessions There is no refund of tuition for individual courses dropped after the last day of the change-of-program period. If you wish to drop a course during this timeframe, you must complete an add/drop form. Important: Failure to attend classes or notification submitted only to the instructor does not constitute dropping a course and will result in a mark of UW (Unofficial Withdrawal) for the course and full tuition will be charged. See the Change-of-Program Period Dates listed on the Calendars page. Withdrawal Process and Information Withdrawal & Tuition Refund The University uses the term withdraw to formally indicate that a student has dropped or will drop all courses for a given term. Withdrawing from the university differs from dropping one or several classes within a given term, because as long as a student retains at least one class, he or she is still considered to be registered for that term. Students who plan to withdraw from any of the summer sessions should carefully read all of the information below concerning financial considerations, the withdrawal procedure, and tuition refunds. Financial Considerations Withdrawal Fee Students who drop their entire academic program during and after the change of program period will be charged a $75.00 withdrawal fee. The $75 withdrawal fee is not applied to students withdrawing prior to the start of each session. Tuition Refunds Tuition for courses dropped during the change-of-program period is refunded in full. After the last day of the change-of-program period, refunds are granted only when students withdraw by dropping all of their courses in a given session. When a student withdraws from all of their courses after the change-of-program period, the University retains a percentage of the remaining tuition (as indicated in the withdrawal schedules below) for each week, or part of a week, that the student remains registered. See the Calendar for the change-of-program periods for each session. Any adjustment of the tuition that the student has paid or still owes is reckoned from the date on which the Office of Student Affairs, 203 Lewisohn, receives the student's written notification (see How to Withdraw, below). Failure to attend classes or notification submitted only to instructors does not constitute formal withdrawal and may result in the student receiving a grade of F. Fee Refunds Fees such as the student activities fee, University facilities fee, course fees, and late fees are not refundable if the withdrawal takes place after the Change of Program period. The one-time document fee, application fee, and the Columbia Health Fee are not refundable. Special Note for GSAS Students Taking Summer Sessions Courses Students in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences who are recipients of Columbia University fellowships are advised that if they drop any Summer course or withdraw from a session, fellowship funds covering the tuition for that course or courses will be canceled, and the student will be responsible for payment of tuition charges incurred, as indicated in the schedules below. Withdrawal Statement on Transcript A withdrawal statement is added to the academic transcript for each term a student withdraws from the University. How to Withdraw A student in good academic standing who is not subject to disciplinary action may be permitted to withdraw at any time during the session up until the last day of classes (see Calendar), by doing the following: General Studies Consult with your academic advisor and review the GS semester withdrawal/leave of absence policy here.

Tuition Refunds Students must elect to participate to receive automatic refunds. Default participation status depends on a student's school. To opt into or out of automatic refunds, a student should log in to Student Services Online (SSOL) and select "Refunds" from the menu and follow the instructions. General Studies and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences students are not currently eligible for automatic refunds. These students should refer to the "Automatic Refund Options" page of Student Services Online. The University's preferred method of refund distribution is through direct deposit. Students can log into SSOL and click on "Direct Deposit" to set up transfer of funds to a U.S. checking or savings account. Click here for more guidance on how to do this. Refund checks for students who have not signed up for direct deposit are sent to the student's local address. To check their student account balance, students can log into Student Services Online (SSOL) and click on "Account Detail and E-Billing" and then "View Student Account Detail." If there is a valid credit on the account that is not based on anticipated credits, the refund will generally be processed within 48 hours of the credit appearing. If the credit is based on anticipated credits for financial aid, scholarships, or the payment plan, a refund will not be processed until the funds have actually arrived and been posted to the student account. For additional details regarding refunds please see Policy on Student Account Credit Balances and Refunds. All Other Students Fill out a Notice of Withdrawal form.
