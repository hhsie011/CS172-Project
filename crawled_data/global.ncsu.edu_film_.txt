Interdisciplinary partners across campus select films from current releases, documentaries, and classics highlighting the joys and struggles of the global community in which we live. These films also provide a venue for faculty, staff, and students to share their global experiences and expertise with a wider campus and community audience. All films feature an academic introduction and an opportunity for reflection at the film’s conclusion. The Global Film Series is presented by the Office of Global Engagement and NC State University Libraries. All films are free and open to the community. Accessibility If you require a disability-related accommodation to participate in this event, please contact Marian Fragola at marian_fragola@ncsu.edu or 919-513-3481 to arrange services. Early requests are strongly encouraged to allow sufficient time to meet your access needs. Additional Questions? Do you have a question about the Global Film Series?
