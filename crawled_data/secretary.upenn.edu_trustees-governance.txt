The trustees delegate the responsibility for the day-to-day management of the University of Pennsylvania to the administration and, in particular, to the president. For this reason, one of the most important responsibilities of the trustees is the selection, retention, and replacement of the president. The trustees, however, seek to support and reinforce the administration in several ways. They serve as a bridge between the University and the world; on the one hand, interpreting the institution to the public, and on the other hand, bringing in experience and perceptions gained outside the University. The trustees provide leadership in the identification and development of financial resources. They oversee the University's relations with other institutions, the private sector, government bodies, and the media. In consultation with the president, the trustees determine the long-range allocation of resources, making decisions in the context of the needs and expectations of the University's constituencies and of society. The Trustees Present and Emeritus Statutes of the Trustees Read all The primary work of the trustees is carried out by eleven committees: Academic Policy, Audit and Compliance, Budget and Finance, Compensation, Development, Facilities and Campus Planning, Honorary Degrees and Awards, Local, National, & Global Engagement, Nominating, and Student Life.
