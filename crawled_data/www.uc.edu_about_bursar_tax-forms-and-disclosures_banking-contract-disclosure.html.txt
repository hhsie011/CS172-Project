The Program Integrity and Improvement rules require the University of Cincinnati to maintain, account, and disburse Federal Title IV funds in accordance to these regulations. In addition, refunding credit balances associated with Federal Title IV should always be in the best interest of the student. This webpage is published to comply with these regulatory reporting requirements. On March 31, 2010 the University of Cincinnati (UC) entered a banking services agreement with PNC Bank. The agreement, and subsequent amendments, do not include services for handling student related Title IV credit balance refunds. However, since many UC students bank with PNC the U.S. Department of Education requires that UC publish the contract for public review by September 1, 2016. Students are not required to have a bank account with PNC to receive their refund via direct deposit (ACH). The University of Cincinnati encourages students to shop around to find a banking partner that fits their financial situation and needs. A good place to start is checking out Bankrate (http://www.bankrate.com) Student Banking Costs with PNC Bank Under Department of Education regulations 34 CFR 668.164(e)(2)(vii), e(2)(viii), (e)(3), (f)(2)(ii), (f)(4)(iv), (f)(4)(v), and (f)(5), the university is required to publish on its website contract data on the total consideration paid or received in connection with a financial institution or entity that offers financial accounts through a financial institution under which financial accounts are offered and marketed directly to students. The university is also required to publish the number of students and the mean and median student costs. For the most recently completed award year the university and PNC Bank, NA had this type of relationship. The information required under the regulations: Time Period: July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021 Mean student cost: $12.82 Median student cost: $0.00 Number of accounts: 3037 Total monetary consideration paid to UC: $330,974.52 ($290,700 +$40, 274.52 in branch rent) PNC Virtual Wallet Student Fee Sheet UC/PNC Banking Information UC-PNC Banking Services Contract with Amendment Payments made to UC under contract since 2010-2011.
