There may be only certain physicians or hospitals that may be used, depending on the insurance company, or the student may need prior approval from the insurance company or a primary care physician. Students without health insurance Students should either go to one of the Minor Emergency Centers or the Via Christi Clinic (formerly Wichita Clinic). These facilities have extended hours and are less expensive than hospital emergency rooms. Below are addresses for these offices closest to the Wichita State University campus: UHCSR insurance is accepted at the Via Christi Clinic. If you need medical attention when our office is closed, please see the options below. Each of these hospitals accept United Health Care Insurance. *If you do have United Health Care Insurance and the situation is NON-life threatening make sure to call the nurse hotline (PDF) through UHCSR before you visit the ER to receive recommendations.
