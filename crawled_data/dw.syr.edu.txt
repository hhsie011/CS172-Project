Degree Works is a web-based tool to help students and advisors monitor a student's progress toward degree completion. It is designed to facilitate academic advising, but is not intended to replace face-to-face advising. Degree Works combines Syracuse University's degree requirements and the coursework a student has completed into an easy-to-read worksheet that helps to show a student what courses will still need to be completed. The Office of the Registrar and the schools and colleges are continuously working on updating degree requirements so that they are as accurate as possible. As such, you may see changes or updates to audits. Also, please note that petitioned coursework may or may not be currently reflected on audits. For questions regarding audits or to provide feedback, please use the contact information below to reach out to the applicable school or college.
