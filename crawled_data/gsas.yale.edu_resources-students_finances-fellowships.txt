At Yale, you can earn your doctorate at our expense. You don’t need to incur any debt at all. How is that possible? It’s possible because we give every Ph.D. student a funding package that covers the full cost of tuition and provides a stipend to cover basic living costs like rent, food, and books — for a minimum of five years (some programs require less time, e.g., Investigative Medicine, Law, Nursing, and Public Health). Many students are eligible for funding in their sixth year, too, either from the Graduate School or their adviser’s research grants, and there is supplementary financial support to cover research-related travel and conference funding. On top of that, we pay for your health coverage. Our funding package for Ph.D. students is one of the most generous in the world. On average, doctoral students at Yale receive more than $500,000 in tuition fellowships, stipends, and health care benefits over the course of their enrollment.
