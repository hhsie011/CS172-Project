TTU HomeUniversity Student Housing Fall 2022 Room Availability Report The room availability report provides you with the ability to see all available spaces for each Residence Hall and Learning Community by gender (as applicable) for the upcoming academic year. The availability report page is live data, so be sure to refresh the page for the most accurate report. Most Learning Communities require students to be accepted into a particular major, minor, or program consistent with the focus of the Learning Community. If you would like additional information about a specific Residence Hall or Learning Community, please visit our Residence Hall Selection Guide. Reminder: This is a report of available spaces, it is not an eligibility report. You must meet the eligibility requirements for each Residence Hall or Learning Community in order to officially reserve a space during the signup process.
