Removal of Administrative Stipend: If there has been an administrative stipend associated with the related administrative duties during the appointment, that stipend shall be removed upon the termination of administrative duties and before any salary adjustments are made (i.e., from a 12-month appointment to a 9-month appointment). 2.1.3. Salary: The salary shall be adjusted from a 12 month administrative salary to a 9-month or 12-month faculty salary that is commensurate with the salaries of comparable faculty members in the department and prevailing market conditions. 2.1.4.

Prior to the beginning of the research leave, the administrator shall submit a written work plan for the leave period to include expected outcomes. The plan should reflect activities reasonably calculated to prepare the faculty member to resume teaching and research responsibilities at ECU. The plan will be reviewed by the Unit Administrator and approved by the Chancellor, and incorporated into the faculty members contract. The leave will be paid at a salary commensurate with the salaries of comparable faculty members. 2.1.5.

Requirement for repayment in accordance with this provision will be included in the written contract. 2.2. Reappointment of an Administrator without Faculty Return Rights An administrator leaving a position that is categorized as ,at will has no claim to a position at the University; however, there may be circumstances in which the Chancellor, or Chancellors designee, determines that an assignment to another administrative or teaching position would be beneficial for both the University and the employee. In these cases, the new salary should be appropriate to the assignment. Any exception must be approved by the Board of Trustees and by the President. This regulation does not supersede any notice or severance pay required by Board of Governors policy. 2.3. Separation from the University 2.3.1. In some cases, it may be in the best interests of the University to negotiate a severance agreement with an administrator.

Any agreement that results in a longer period of compensation must be approved by the Board of Trustees. 2.4. Retirement Nothing in these Regulations shall prevent a tenured faculty member from immediately participating in phased retirement, consistent with existing University of North Carolina and East Carolina University policies. 2.5.

Salary: The salary will be determined based on either a 9-month or 12-month appointment, as appropriate for the department, commensurate with the salaries of similarly situated faculty members in the department and prevailing market conditions. 3.1.4. Preparation for Return to Faculty Position: At the Chancellors discretion, the Chancellor may approve a reasonable period of time to provide an opportunity for the employee to prepare for teaching and research responsibilities.
