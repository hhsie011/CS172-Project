Do you realize that tuition and fees cover only about 85% of the real cost of a Syracuse University education? Your giving helps close that gap, enabling Syracuse University to provide the students of today—and tomorrow—with unique educational experiences and the tools they need to succeed in a world that’s ever more complex. Make a Gift Georgia Scholars Fund Benefits Local Students Help Georgia students succeed at Syracuse University! The Georgia Scholars Fund is a collaborative effort by the Syracuse University Alumni Club of Atlanta (SUACOA) and the Atlanta Regional Council to provide more scholarships and financial assistance for Georgia’s growing pool of applicants. The endowed scholarship fund will be used exclusively to reward academic achievement and provide need-based financial assistance to students from the state of Georgia. It’s a great way for Syracuse University alumni and friends around the state to have an immediate, local impact with their giving—while helping Syracuse University attract the best Georgia students!
