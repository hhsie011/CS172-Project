The goal of this program is to have an AED applied to a victim of a cardiac arrest within five minutes of the system being activated. The AED program is one component of the overall university plan for responding to medical emergencies. All of UC's police officers, security officers and fire safety personnel are trained in cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and AED usage. Colleges and departments are encouraged to participate in the university's AED program. For more information about participating in the program, or to see a list of program participants, please view the UC Guidelines for AEDs, effective November 2019. Report potential cardiac emergencies by calling 911 on any campus phone. Tell the dispatcher you are on the University of Cincinnati's campus.
