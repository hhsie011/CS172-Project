K. Brown Military Collection Posted on December 4, 2013 by [email protected] Next week the exhibit of the Dresden and Nymphenburg Porcelains from the Anne S. K. Brown Military Collection opens in the Rockefeller Library. This exhibit will be on display from December 9, 2013 to Arpil 25, 2014. While John Nicholas Brown was working with the allied forces in Germany in 1945 reporting on stolen art works, he visited the factory at Nymphenburg in Bavaria and ordered 21 porcelain figures for his wife, Anne S. K. Brown. Subsequent additions to this set came from the Dresden porcelain factory. Today these porcelains form a unique segment of the foremost American collection devoted to the history and iconography of soldiers and soldiering. Members of the general public wishing to to view exhibits at the Rockefeller Library should first check in at the service desk.
