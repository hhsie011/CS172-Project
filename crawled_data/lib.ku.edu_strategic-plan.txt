Goal 2 Create experiences that help students thrive in the classroom and beyond. Working with campus partners, the libraries will contribute to student success and retention efforts by enhancing and promoting our services, resources, and spaces. Goal 3 Enhance KU’s research profile. Through targeted professional development and engagement with partners, we will expand our capacity to support researchers, particularly in emerging areas of digital scholarship. Goal 4 Sustain the scholarly record for the KU community and beyond.
