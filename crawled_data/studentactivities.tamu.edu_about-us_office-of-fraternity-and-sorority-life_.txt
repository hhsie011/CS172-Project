We are home to 58 inter/nationally affiliated or local Greek-letter organizations, which collectively constitute the largest membership-based and multi-faceted community on campus. Representing 10% of the undergraduate student population, fraternity and sorority members are committed to their academics, developing and strengthening their leadership skills, volunteering time in the community and continually forming a campus and cultural support network for current and incoming Aggies. Fraternities and sororities have enhanced the lives of more than 20,000 Aggies since their inception. Office of Fraternity & Sorority Life Purpose & Mission Our purpose is to serve as a liaison among the collegiate chapters, parents, alumni, international organizations, and Texas A&M University to provide organizational guidance, educational programs, and resources while challenging members to live their fraternal values. Our mission is to build an inclusive fraternity and sorority community and enhance the collegiate experience by supporting opportunities for leadership, academic success, civic engagement and the creation of fraternal bonds. Interested in joining a Fraternity or Sorority? More information about being a part of the Greek community at Texas A&M can be found here. CHAPTER RESOURCES Annually, as new chapter officers are selected, each fraternity and sorority must go through University Recognition.

Fraternity & Sorority Life Event Planning Forms: Guide to Event Planning Planning an out of town event? Be sure to review the Travel Rule and file the Travel Information Form. Steps to Event Planning Complete the Pre-Event Planning Form Online: http://maroonlink.tamu.edu. Please note that the pre-event planning form should not be the first step in your event planning process. This form serves as a summary of the risk management and planning you have done to ensure your event is going to be well-executed, safe, and in compliance will all university and council policies. Your faculty/staff advisor must review the form. Upon your completion of the form, your faculty/staff advisor will receive an email notification that you have submitted a pre-event planning form. Your advisor must then log into Student Activities Online to review the form and denote that he/she has done so by providing their initials on said form. This review is required by Texas A&M University Student Rule 42.5 which states, “It is expected that all student organizations will have their events, whether on or off campus, reviewed by their university advisor(s).” I would encourage you to speak with your faculty/staff advisor about the review process. For some of your advisors, they may still want to meet in person to review the event even though the form has been submitted online, for others they may want to discuss your event via phone, and for others, they may be comfortable simply reviewing online. A member of the Office of Fraternity & Sorority Life staff can review the form. To have this form reviewed by a member of the Fraternity & Sorority Life staff, you will need to schedule an in-person meeting. This meeting should occur no later than 48 hours prior to your event, and prior to this meeting occurring, your form must be submitted online and reviewed by your faculty/staff advisor. A meeting can be scheduled by calling the Office of Fraternity & Sorority Life at 979.862.5636 (Note: You do not need to wait for Steps #1 and #2 to be completed to schedule this meeting, but these steps will need to be completed by the time the meeting occurs). Please note that we do not accept walk-in appointments, so you do need to schedule this meeting in advance. Greek Awards’ Applications For award descriptions, please click here.
