We now have a pandemic-compliant reading room and two other reading/lecturing spaces. Those of you who spent time in our campus may read the text in the wall and think of it as a mini replica of the Reference Room of Butler Library. The rooftop at Le15 remains available for our visitors to enjoy the view and feel the breeze. This is the work of Le Metre Carré.
