Dartmouth's Mission Dartmouth occupies a distinctive niche in higher education by combining the virtues of the very best liberal arts colleges and ambitious research universities. We are committed to providing an undergraduate education second to none, emphasizing close interaction between exceptional students and faculty members who devote considerable time and effort to teaching and mentoring. Those same faculty members are committed to making significant research contributions in a range of disciplines across the arts, the humanities, the social and physical and biological sciences, as well as in a host of interdisciplinary fields. The Dean's Diversity Initiative As part of our commitment to Inclusive Excellence, for the 2021-22 academic year the Dean of Faculty has authorized eight faculty searches and three postdoctoral fellowships in research areas related to race, racism, and racial justice.
