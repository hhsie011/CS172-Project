Students who cancel within 24 hours, arrive 10 or more minutes late, or fail to attend will receive a No-Show status for their workshop or appointment. Two No-Show statuses will result in a block from appointment-based services and workshops until the student meets with a professional staff member. Scheduling rights will be reinstated once the student has met with a Learning Commons staff member. Any future appointments scheduled at the time of receiving a second No-Show will be canceled. Three No-Show statuses will result in a block from appointment-based services and workshops until the end of the semester. By scheduling an appointment for any Learning Commons service, you acknowledge that you have read and understand the Learning Commons No Show policy. Late Policy Since these workshops are only 60 minutes, students who arrive late or leave early more than 10 minutes will receive a No Show status.
