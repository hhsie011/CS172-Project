Graduation To obtain a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering degree, the student must satisfy University and College requirements, earn a minimum 2.0 grade point average on all work completed, and earn a minimum grade of “C-” in all engineering, mathematics, and natural science courses used to satisfy degree requirements. Honors Program The Honors in Mechanical Engineering Program provides an exceptional educational opportunity for highly motivated students to develop their talents, interests, and abilities within a curriculum designed to encourage independence and creativity. Admission to the Honors Program: Incoming freshmen who score a minimum of 26 on the ACT, or its equivalent, are invited to participate. Transfer students or students previously enrolled at the University of Memphis are eligible for the program if they have an overall grade point average of 3.00 or higher, and a grade point average of 3.25 or higher for course work within the Herff College of Engineering. The departmental honors committee admits eligible students to the program upon approval of the Application for Admission to the Mechanical Engineering Honors Program. Students with academic records that fall short of these requirements may apply for provisional acceptance. Retention in the Honors Program: Participants must maintain a minimum overall grade point average of 3.00 and a minimum grade point average of 3.25 for course work within the college to continue in the program. The departmental honors committee may grant participants failing to meet this requirement a one semester probationary period before they are dismissed from the program. Requirements: To qualify for the designation “With Honors in Mechanical Engineering”, a student must successfully complete a minimum of 18 semester hours from the following: MECH 4395 , MECH 4396 , and 12 hours of mechanical engineering honors courses. To qualify for the designations “With Honors in Mechanical Engineering” and “University Honors with Thesis”, a student must successfully complete a minimum of 25 semester hours from the following: MECH 4395 and MECH 4396 , 9 hours of mechanical engineering honors courses, one hour of UNHP 1100, and 9 hours of general education honors courses. To enroll in mechanical engineering honors sections, a student must obtain departmental approval. A minimum grade of “B” (3.0) is required in each honors course for it to count toward fulfilling the honors course requirement. Regular credit for the course will be earned if the grade is lower than a “B”. A participant must select a major advisor by the beginning of the second semester junior year and enroll in MECH 4395 - Honors Thesis Proposal. Successful completion of this course requires acceptance of a thesis proposal by the departmental honors committee. During the second semester of the senior year, a participant must enroll in MECH 4396 - Honors Thesis. Successful completion of this course requires acceptance of a thesis by the departmental honors committee. Designation of “With Honors in Mechanical Engineering”: Students who successfully complete the prescribed course work will have earned the designation of “With Honors in Mechanical Engineering.” This designation will be recognized at the commencement ceremony and it will appear on the transcript and diploma.

Students are encouraged to begin planning to enter the Accelerated B S/M S program by the end of their junior year so that elective courses can be taken in their senior year, in consultation with their advisor in the department. Working with the undergraduate and graduate academic coordinators, undergraduates admitted to the ABM program begin a carefully tailored course of study which will allow them to complete their B S in Mechanical Engineering while they also begin the coursework toward their M.S. To be eligible for admission to the Mechanical Engineering ABM program the student must (1) have an undergraduate cumulative GPA of 3.25 or higher, (2) submit to the Graduate Program Coordinator 2 letters of reference in support of their application for admission with one letter being from their academic advisor, (3) have senior standing as determined by progress toward degree completion, and (4) complete an interview with the Graduate Program Coordinator. A student admitted to the Mechanical Engineering ABM program must apply to the Graduate School for the accelerated B S/M S program, which allows them to take graduate courses in their respective engineering department. ABM program admission or completion is no guarantee of admission into or progression in a graduate program of study. To continue in the program past the B S in Mechanical Engineering, students must apply for full admission into the Graduate School. Grades earned for graduate coursework will not apply to computation of their undergraduate GPA.
