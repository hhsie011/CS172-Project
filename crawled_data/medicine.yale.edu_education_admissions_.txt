Why Should You Apply? Yale School of Medicine allows you to assume responsibility for your professional development within a community of learners dedicated to each other, their patients, and society. The Yale system of medical education embodies a uniquely supportive environment for you to develop the foundation of knowledge, critical thinking, and clinical skills needed to be outstanding clinicians, scientists, and leaders. Being at Yale has shown me that it’s possible to set the groundwork to become a strong clinician in a way that is joyful and nurturing, without sacrificing your wellbeing or your life outside of medicine in the process. It has been exciting to grow into a physician-scientist and leader without compromising the other sides of myself as a daughter, partner, friend, and sibling.
