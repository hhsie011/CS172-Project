Since 2012, 43 out of 125 interns have entered into PhD programs including MIT (6), Harvard (6), Stanford (5), Columbia (4), Wharton (4), University of Chicago (2). Some interns, upon graduation, decide that a PhD is not for them or they decide to defer it for a few years. The experience from the internship also provides transferable analytical and quantitative skills. Interns have gone to prestigious firms in management consulting (McKinsey, BCG, Deloitte), economic consulting (Cornerstone Research, Analysis Group), financial firms and hedge funds (Goldman Sachs, Capital One, JP Morgan Chase, BlackRock, Blackstone, Bridgewater, AQR Capital Management), and technology companies such as (Facebook, Nielsen, eBay). Others have gone to masters programs in data science and some have been invited to return to CBS to join the Predoctoral Fellows (PDF) Program.
