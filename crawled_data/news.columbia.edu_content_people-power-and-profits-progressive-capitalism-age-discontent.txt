Stiglitz A Nobel Prize winner challenges us to throw off the free market fundamentalists and reclaim our economy. We all have the sense that the U.S. economy—and its government—tilts toward big business, but as Joseph E. Stiglitz, University Professor, explains in his latest book, the situation is dire. A few corporations dominate entire sectors, contributing to skyrocketing inequality and slow growth; and too many have made their wealth through exploitation rather than wealth creation. Stiglitz identifies the true sources of wealth and increases in standards of living. He finds that the assault on the judiciary, universities and the media undermines the institutions that have long been the foundation of America’s economic might and its democracy, and shows how a middle-class life can once again be attainable by all. 212-854-5573 [email protected] Genre Nonfiction Topic Economics Contact Us [email protected] Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
