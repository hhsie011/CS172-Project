Smalley Veterans Memorial Scholarship Clemson Veterans Living Library Clemson University Veterans Commission Clemson Corps Contact Us Clemson Student Veterans Association The Clemson Student Veterans Association is a student organization founded in 2008 by student veterans in order to advocate for military veteran and military-connected students at Clemson University. We promote their educational, social, recreational and cultural interests and cooperate with other organizations on campus. We do this by providing a community of support for student military veterans, as well as their family members and loved ones. We also serve on a number of student councils, speak before the student government and communicate with the National Student Veterans Association to find ways to better serve Clemsonâ€™s military population. Our Mission To build and sustain empowered veterans in the Clemson community through fellowship, support, and continuous service How to Join Please feel free to visit the student organization website in TigerQuest to indicate your interest in joining this organization or to find out about upcoming events.
