Ideally, IT products should be fully usable by people with disabilities, so they have equally effective access as people without disabilities have. Architecture and Security Review Departments are encouraged to discuss proposed products, and those up for contract renewals, with the Architecture and Security Review team to help ensure they meet the University's expectations for accessibility. VPAT Accessibility Conformance Report The University expects vendors to detail the accessibility of their product using the Information Technology Industry Council's Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT), using the 2.4 WCAG version of the report to indicate conformance to the World Wide Web Consortium's Content Accessibility Guidelines. The VPAT template should be filled out in its entirety and include testing methodology, conformance level, and detailed remarks for any partially-supported or non-supported level per the success criteria of WCAG 2.0 AA. Third Party User Experience (UX) Testing The University expects vendors to follow the best and increasingly common practice of having their products UX tested by an industry-recognized accessibility testing company or organization. While meeting technical accessibility requirements provides baseline access, UX testing reveals further blockers and confusing elements that should be addressed to ensure the product is truly usable by people who have disabilities. Product Accessibility Roadmap Vendors are expected to provide the University with an Accessibility Roadmap (.docx) document, structured to match the test findings of and accessibility UX tests. Each issue to be remediated should indicate a date by which it will be fixed. Departments should ensure the contract requires the vendor to commit to the roadmap, and should follow up with the vendor on a regular basis. Product Demonstration or Test The University may request a product demonstration of the accessibility of a product, or may conduct its own testing. The vendor should be prepared to provide a test account as well as a tour of the accessibility features (demonstrating both keyboard support and screen reader support) of their product. In general, the University does not conduct tests until after the vendor has conducted its own thorough testing and has submitted its VPAT report as described above.
