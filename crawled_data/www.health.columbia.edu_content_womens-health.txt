Our providers are attuned to the sexual, psychosocial, gynecologic, and body image needs that are part of providing comprehensive women’s health care. Depending on the women’s health issue or service needs, students will be directed to schedule an appointment with their primary care provider, or their team's registered nurse. Some specific on-campus services are: Periodic health (well woman) examinations Birth control, including IUD insertion and contraceptive injections (e.g., Depo-Provera) Pregnancy evaluations Emergency contraception Pregnancy options counseling Counseling for elective termination of pregnancy Testing and treatment for STIs Management of gynecologic concerns Prenatal care is provided off-campus and covered by the Columbia Student Health Insurance plan. What Does a Well Woman Examination Include? Examination of thyroid gland, neck, lungs, heart, breasts, abdomen, and skin Cervical cancer screening (PAP smear) Sexually transmitted infections (STI) testing Contraception as needed When Should I Get a Pap Smear? Cervical cancer screening (Pap smear) should begin at age 21. Women under age 21 who need contraception or STI screening may do so without having a cervical cancer screening exam. Cervical cancer screening is recommended every three years for women age 21 to 29 who are healthy and have had normal exams in the past. Women age 30 and older should speak with their provider about whether they should have cervical cancer screenings every five years. Women with certain risk factors may need more frequent screening, including those who have HIV, are immunosuppressed, or have had abnormal cervical screening test results in the past. ADDITIONAL RESOURCES Intra-uterine device (IUD) and Contraceptive Implant (Nexplanon) Insertion Birth Control and Contraception Columbia Health encourages students to learn more about birth control options by requesting a one-on-one educational session with an Alice! Health Promotion professional staff member. These sessions are designed for students who have never used birth control or are currently using birth control and wish to discuss other options. Peer advocates at Women's Health Advocacy Project are also available to discuss birth control during free and confidential peer counseling sessions. Pregnancy Management Pregnancy Options: If you have an unplanned pregnancy, make an appointment with a health care provider in Medical Services to discuss your options. Counseling and Psychological Services staff are also available to assist and support you. Call 212-854-7426 for Medical Services or 212-854-2878 for Counseling and Psychological Services. Prenatal Care: Once your pregnancy has been confirmed, we will provide you with a referral to an ob-gyn clinic. Then you will begin a routine schedule of medical visits with your obstetrician or nurse midwife. Pregnancy Complications: Minor spotting or cramps may be normal in pregnancy. However, bleeding and severe cramping can be signs of complications. If you experience these symptoms during your pregnancy, it is important to contact your obstetrician. The obstetrics clinics at Columbia University Medical Center can schedule a same-day appointment if your condition warrants immediate attention. Emergency Contraception You or a partner may need emergency contraception if: Sex was unplanned, unintended, or unwanted Contraceptives were not used, failed, or were used incorrectly (missed birth control pills, late for contraceptive injection, condom broke or slipped off) Diaphragm or IUD slipped out of place Emergency contraception is available through Medical Services. Testing and Treatment for Sexually Transmitted Infections Columbia Health is committed to assisting students in learning about preventing sexually transmitted infections (STIs). To talk with a staff member about STI questions, including prevention strategies, contact Alice! Health Promotion at 212-854-5453 or [email protected] to make an appointment. Testing and treatment for STIs is available through Medical Services. An STI evaluation will include a discussion with a healthcare provider about your concerns and possible symptoms, a physical examination, and testing as appropriate.
