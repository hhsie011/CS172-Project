Learn More “ “As the student manager for Special Projects, I gained a greater understanding of how the food science field actually works – not just head knowledge and facts from a classroom, but real understanding that comes from in-person experience. Crisis management, time sensitivity, and critical decision-making can’t be taught in a classroom, but I learned all of these things through my responsibilities at the ’55 Exchange.” Sam Lopane BS 2017, MS 2018 R&D Science and Technology Manager at Freshly/Nestle Campus Scoop Shop Stop In For Something Sweet The '55 Exchange is Clemson's very own student-run ice cream enterprise.
