We are taking a transdisciplinary approach that attacks this problem from all angles. Our research team includes experts in psychiatry, behavioral neuroscience, social psychology, women's health issues, clinical trial monitoring, biostatistics, public health, economics, adolescent psychiatry, lab medicine, neurochemistry, policy analysis and molecular neuroscience. One of our key areas of focus is trying to determine the best treatment for women, people who drink or people with mental or medical health problems, since research shows that those are the groups that most often relapse.
