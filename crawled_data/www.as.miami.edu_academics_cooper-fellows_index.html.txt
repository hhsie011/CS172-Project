In an effort to recognize and reward some of our most valuable faculty, the College is again allocating a significant portion of this fund according to the following policy: Cooper Fellows — tenured full professors in the College of Arts and Sciences— are appointed by the Dean from across the College, with up to three typically appointed each year. Each Cooper Fellow is appointed for a three-year period. Cooper Fellowships rotate among faculty after a three-year period. In addition to acknowledging the faculty member’s contributions by the title “Cooper Fellow,” the appointment comes with an annual research fund of $15,000. The funds may be used in whole or part to support the fellow’s salary (including cfb) or research; unspent funds may be “banked” by the fellow for use for a period of up to two years beyond the appointment upon approval by the Senior Associate Dean for Research. A faculty member may request a one-semester release from teaching in lieu of this three-year stipend. If combined with any other form of leave or release the term cannot extend beyond two consecutive semesters. Criteria for selection: excellence in contributing to our core missions of scholarship, teaching, and service (in that order). Cooper Fellows are expected to give a lecture on their research to the College faculty and students. To assist in making these appointments, the Dean seeks nominations from departmental chairs or any regular (tenure and tenure-track) faculty member. The Senior Associate Dean, in charge of this fund is Joshua Cohn, Senior Associate Dean for Research.
