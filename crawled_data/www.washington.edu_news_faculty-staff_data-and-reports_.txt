Media Impact Report This report tracks the University of Washington’s mentions in the media and notes specific efforts each month to share the great work happening at the UW with news outlets regionally, nationally and around the world. The UW News office produces the report on a monthly basis and it is sent to a recipient list that also receives the daily “UW in the Media” email. If you’d like to get added to this listserv, please contact us. You can also view this report, including past issues, by clicking below.

Currently this report is in V1, meaning there are some limitations to the filtering. You can access school- and college-level data (with some exceptions), as well as a selection of institutes and centers.
