Unlike traditional disciplines in engineering and the mathematical sciences, the fields address the role of the human decision-maker as key contributor to the inherent complexity of systems and primary benefactor of the analyses. ISyE Fields of Specialization Interdisciplinary Research Centers ISyE Centers and Labs ISyE Postdoctoral Fellowship Program Georgia Tech pursues leading-edge research with industry, government, and community partners. At ISyE, we are a national leader in 10 core fields of specialization: Advanced Manufacturing, Analytics and Machine Learning, Applied Probability and Simulation, Data Science and Statistics, Economic Decision Analysis, Energy and Sustainable Systems, Health and Humanitarian Systems, Optimization, Supply Chain Engineering, and Systems Informatics and Control.

Home Research ISyE Fields of Specialization Data Science and Statistics Other Research Areas Advanced Manufacturing Analytics and Machine Learning Applied Probability and Simulation Data Science and Statistics Economic Decision Analysis Energy and Sustainable Systems Health and Humanitarian Systems Optimization Supply Chain Engineering System Informatics and Control Data Science and Statistics Data and statistical science consists of a body of tools, concepts, and algorithms for collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data. It is an integral part of ISyE, where engineers are trained in understanding the system by collecting and analyzing data. Learning data science and statistics enables one to efficiently and cost-effectively gather data and build empirical models to describe and understand the performance of the system that can be used for prediction, control, optimization, and decision-making. Fundamental Research Areas Our statistics faculty at ISyE is involved in fundamental research in almost all aspects of statistics including: Bayesian Statistics Data Mining Design of Experiments Nonparametric Methods Regression Analysis Statistical Computing Statistical Inference Time Series Analysis Main Application Areas Quality and Reliability Engineering Health Informatics Logistics Advanced Manufacturing Georgia Tech Affiliations ISyE Research Areas Advanced Manufacturing Analytics and Machine Learning Health and Humanitarian Systems Optimization Applied Probability and Simulation Supply Chain Engineering System Informatics and Control GT Research Areas Data Engineering and Science Manufacturing, Trade, and Logistics Institutes Institute for People and Technology The Georgia Tech Manufacturing Institute External Collaborators A sampling of research is sponsored by various industries and government agencies including: Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Duke-NUS Health Services and Systems Research Emory University Department of Public Health, Georgia Department of Community Health, Georgia Institute of Systems Sciences National Cancer Centre, Singapore Singapore Eye Research Institute Singapore General Hospital Department of Emergency Medicine Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Tennessee Proctor & Gamble Data Science and Statistics About People #9 in the World in Statistics & Operational Research QS World University Rankings Find out more H.
