Donations of Pop-Tarts without a citation dismissal can be accepted at the TPS office or at any campus entry station. Pop-Tarts benefit Food 2 Kids, a program of the Junior League of Lubbock. Food 2 Kids provides a sack of food Fridays during the school year with children identified as being potentially at high risk for suffering from hunger during the weekend. The sacks contain shelf-stable food items that do not require cooking or preparation or tools to open or consume. They include items like juice, fruit snacks, pop-top cans of spaghetti, cereal, and nut snacks. The favorite among the included foods, though, is Pop-Tarts®. Pop-Tarts for Tickets began in 2016, and in its first two years, the promotion provided 12,400 Pop-Tarts to hungry elementary students and dismissed about $2,750 worth of citations. Dates and Location Tuesday, September 7, 2021, through Friday, September 17, 2021 Pop-Tarts for citation dismissal must be received during TPS office hours (weekdays from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.) during the promotion. Requirements Pop-Tarts must be at least the value of the unpaid citation. Good for one citation. Receipt for Pop-Tarts must be presented to redeem for dismissal. May not be used for violation numbers 3, 7, 16, 17, and 18. Contact TPS at (806) 742-PARK or parking@ttu.edu with any questions.
