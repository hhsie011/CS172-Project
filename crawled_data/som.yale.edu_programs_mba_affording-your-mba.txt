Our Financial Aid Office is dedicated to assisting students with the process of obtaining the right financial resources to finance their education. We work with prospective and admitted candidates, but continue to advise you on post-graduation loan repayment, fellowship programs, and loan forgiveness. Cost Information Types of Aid Merit-Based Scholarships At SOM all applications are considered for merit-based scholarships that require no separate formal application - all applicants are considered for merit-based funding. Scholarship recipients are notified of their merit-based eligibility at the same time that they are admitted. External Funding Resources The Financial Aid Office recommends that students research through different outside scholarships that they may be eligible for. Our team has created a filterable scholarship database, that allows you to filter by industry, region, population, etc., and is a great resource to assist you in finding external sources to finance your education. Career Support The Yale School of Management Loan Forgiveness Program was the first program of its kind and has provided a model for similar programs at business schools. Since its establishment, the school has provided more than $12 million in support to over 400 alumni around the country. It is the most generous loan forgiveness program among business schools. The Yale SOM Entrepreneurial Fellowship will allow students to defer their student loan payments for the first two years after graduation. The school pays the interest accruing on the loans, up to $7,000/year. The goal is to help entrepreneurs funnel more time and money into their startups during the critical early years. Student Loans For most students, educational loans represent a significant portion of financial aid. You can view information on federal, private, and international loans on the student loans page. Benefits for U.S. Military and Veterans As a token of our appreciation for your service, we waive the application fee for all U.S. Military applicants. To request a waiver, contact the Admissions team of the program to which you’re applying before submitting your application. We have put together additional information on all military financial aid programs online and hope you will use this information as you substantially reduce the cost of your degree.
