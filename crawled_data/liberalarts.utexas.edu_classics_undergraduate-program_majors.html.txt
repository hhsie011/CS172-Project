skip to content Menu x Majors The Department of Classics offers two undergraduate majors, Classical Languages and Classical Studies. All students must choose a track within their major; a total of five different track options are available. Classical Languages Classical Language majors are an excellent fit for students most interested in the literature and linguistics of Latin and/or Greek. With all Classical Language tracks, the majority of upper-division hours for the major will be Latin and/or Greek courses. All Classical Languages tracks require a minor in a field other than Greek, Latin, or Classical Civilization. Classics Track The Classics track combines advanced study of the classical languages (both ancient Greek and Latin) with study of Greek and Roman cultures from prehistory to late antiquity. Encountering ancient texts and ideas in their original language is richly rewarding in its own right; it also equips students with linguistic and analytical skills very useful in many other areas, including law, media, business, and public service. The Classics track is recommended for any student considering graduate school in Classics. 24 hours of coursework are required: 6 hours of upper-division Greek 6 hours of upper-division Latin One capstone course chosen from C C 375, GK 365, or LAT 365 9 additional hours of Classical Civilization (C C), Greek (GK), Latin (LAT), AHC 325, or AHC 378, including at least 3 hours upper-division* *AHC 325 and AHC 378 were added as options for this requirement starting in the 2016-18 catalog.

While study of Latin or Greek is still required, in the Classical Studies major the majority of upper-division coursework will be taken in Ancient History and/or Classical Civlization. Students who would like to pursue ancient history or classical archaeology at the graduate level should plan to study both Latin and Greek beyond the minimums required for the Classical Studies major. The Classical Studies major requires a transcript-recognized minor or certificate starting with the 2020-22 catalog; students in earlier catalogs are not required to complete a minor or certificate. Ancient History Track The Ancient History track combines study of the history and culture of ancient Greece and Rome with advanced study of classical languages, either ancient Greek or Latin. Study of these dynamic and influential societies is exciting in its own right and valuable also for the historical perspective it contributes to understanding our world today. 36 hours of coursework are required, including at least 21 upper-division hours: 6 hours of premodern history, chosen from topics of AHC 310 and 330. 9 hours upper-division Greek and/or Roman history, chosen from topics of AHC 325. 6 hours of upper-division Greek or Latin. 3 hours of AHC 378 Seminar in Ancient History. 12 additional hours of Classical Civilization (C C), Greek (GK), Latin (LAT), and/or topics of AHC 319 and 325.
