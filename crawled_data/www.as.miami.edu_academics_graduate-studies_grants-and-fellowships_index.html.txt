Both programs are designed to offer additional support to doctoral students in their research and dissertation work. These awards are highly competitive, with faculty review committees selecting the recipients in each of the main areas of the College (Arts and Humanities, Social Sciences and Natural Sciences). Key selection criteria will rely on the quality of the proposed research and the student’s achievement record. Students may apply for both awards but if selected for both can accept only one award.
