This resource will help guide you through the options for your event. Additional Helpful Information Selecting a Date- To help avoid date conflicts, consult the University Calendar; this will give you an idea of what is happening on campus, especially major events. (Be aware, however, that the calendar is not a complete list of all scheduled events at Baylor.) Reserving a room/space- There are many rooms and spaces at Baylor that you may want to consider for your events, and they are managed by many different offices. Institutional Events can provide you with a spreadsheet of possible rooms and spaces and the appropriate contact people. After Hours Room Use, Locking Schedule, Carpet Cleaning- Notify Rose Provost (710-3960) with housekeeping if you have needs in any of these areas. Setup & Furnishings- When you reserve a room, find out if the building/Institutional Events provide the setup for tables and chairs. If the venue does not, you can order tables and chairs and get assistance with room setup by submitting a work order through Facilities Services. Tablecloths do not automatically come with the tables. You can order table cloths from Catering Services. Decorations- There are a few fire and safety policies of which you need to be aware in planning for your decorations, particularly if you are planning to use candles or tall items such as Christmas trees. The Holiday and Event Guidelines document should be helpful in planning your decorations. If you have additional questions regarding safety and policies related to decorations, contact the Office of Risk Management for more information. Accommodations for Speakers/Guests- For accommodations in the Waco area, please see the Baylor University preferred local hotel program list. Baylor also has a few guest rooms and apartments available on a first-come, first-serve basis through Guest Housing. Payment for Speakers- For information about how to pay a speaker, please contact Accounts Payable. Parking- For information about visitor parking passes and other parking issues related to your event, please contact the Department of Public Safety. Security- If you believe your event has a security-related need, contact the Baylor Department of Public Safety to review the nature of the event. Campus Map- If you follow the links on the Campus Map website, you will be able to identify parking locations for faculty/staff and visitors. Wi-Fi for Guests- In order to preserve the security and integrity of Baylor's campus wireless network, the university hosts a sponsored guest wireless network. Baylor faculty and staff can authorize campus guests to access BU-GUEST.
