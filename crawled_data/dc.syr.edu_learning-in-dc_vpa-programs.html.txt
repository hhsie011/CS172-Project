In Communication and Rhetorical Studies in DC, an intensive two-week course in Washington, students study this intimate relationship. Students examine key sites of political messaging, from campaign advertising and lobbying to public diplomacy and policy promotion. After meeting in Syracuse for the first week, the class travels to Washington to meet with experts and determine how current practices reflect and/or complicate the prevailing scholarship.
