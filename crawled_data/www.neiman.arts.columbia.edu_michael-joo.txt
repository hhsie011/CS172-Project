By screenprinting epoxy ink onto paper and then treating it with a mix of silvering chemicals, it was discovered that the result was a lasting silvered image. Because of the variety of ways the chemistry responded to the surface, the project developed into a small, variable edition of 8. Each image from 7 Sins is identified by a specific number of calories, which corresponds with an activity and the energy units required to complete it. Joo is interested in investigating the concepts of identity and knowledge in a hybrid contemporary world. His artistic practice explores places, people and objects through reinterpreting perception: why do we perceive as we perceive? Joo's non-linear, almost cyclical approach to his practice together with his combination of scientific language and research, results in work that is a documentation of process. He continues to blur the boundaries between art and science through his investigation into ontology, epistemology and entropy, creating a cross-disciplinary and multi-dimensional dialogue to engage, question, meditate and explore. Joo (b. 1966) received his MFA from Yale School of Art in 1991. His work is in numerous public and private collections, including FNAC, Paris; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; Museum of Modern Art, New York; Samsung Centre for Art and Culture, Seoul and the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York. Joo currently lives and works in New York.
