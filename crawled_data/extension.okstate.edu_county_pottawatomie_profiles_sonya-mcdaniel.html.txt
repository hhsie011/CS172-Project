When I can reach people with information to help them handle everyday tasks and responsibilities, it is very rewarding and feeds my soul. Those little moments when something I’ve said or explained lights up their face and they see how the information can apply to them directly is the magic of education, which happens with children and adults alike! I hold a bachelor of science degree in family relations and child development from Oklahoma State University, and a master of science degree in human development and family studies from the University of North Texas. I have worked for OSU Extension Service for more than 20 years.
