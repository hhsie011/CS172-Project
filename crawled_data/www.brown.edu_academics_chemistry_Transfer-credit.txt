Questions about the process? Please email [email protected]. Guidelines Below are guidelines for transferring credit in chemistry. Each request is considered on a case-by-case basis. Type Minimum Score Transfer Credit Approval Course taken at another institution C or higher The Chemistry Department will recommend credit assignment for course content equivalent to Brown chemistry courses. IB-HL Score 6 or higher Students with qualifying results on record with the Registrar's Office may bypass CHEM0330 and enroll directly into CHEM0350. You may have CHEM0330 course credit transcribed on your Brown transcript if needed for graduation credit. Please contact Dean Bhattacharyya to have CHEM0330 credit transcribed. British A-Levels B or higher Students with qualifying results on record with the Registrar's Office may bypass CHEM0330 and enroll directly into CHEM0350. You may have CHEM0330 course credit transcribed on your Brown transcript if needed for graduation credit. Please contact Dean Bhattacharyya to have CHEM0330 credit transcribed. For more information on international exams, please see the Dean of the College webpage. Instructions Obtain the syllabus for the course. Syllabi must contain the following information for review: List of topics covered How often the course meets List of experiments performed in the laboratory If you are taking/have taken the course over the summer, the syllabus must be for the summer version of the course, not the regular semester version. 2. Sign in to the Transfer Credit Approval System in the Advising Sidekick (ASK) and follow the instructions for either Equivalency Review (for unassigned CHEM credits) or Post-Matriculation Transfer Credit Approval ("Study Away"). The Office of the Dean of the College highly recommends students considering Study Away meet with Deans Bhattacharyya, Cohen, Dennis, Lee, O'Neill, or Vassilev (pre-medicine) to discuss their Degree Completion Plan during open office hours in advance of submitting a request in ASK. Please allow ten business days for the department to review your course materials. Department Transfer Credit Policies In addition to Brown University transfer credit policies, the following apply to chemistry courses. Lab Policy: If you are seeking transfer credit for a Brown course that has a lab component, you MUST take both the lecture and the lab elsewhere for the credit to transfer. You cannot mix a lecture grade from another institution with a lab grade from Brown. Online Course Policy: The Department of Chemistry will not consider or transfer credit for courses with a virtual laboratory. Online lectures will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
