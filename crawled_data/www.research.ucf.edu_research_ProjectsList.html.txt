From Fiscal Year 2000 through Fiscal Year 2010, researchers at UCF have contributed $1.05 billion to the regional economy, highlighted on UCF's Bright House Stadium scoreboard. UCF's Center for Research and Education in Optics and Lasers is a world leader in education, research, and industrial partnership. UCF's centers and institutes offer faculty, students and, in many cases, industry the opportunity to work toward solutions to research problems. Participate in a Research Project The Office of Research & Commercialization is making available a database to recruit participants for research studies. Research participants are often undergraduates who receive credit for their time, however the opportunity is open to anyone interested in taking part in a research study. They delve into questions as diverse as the effect of distractions such as cell phones and text messaging on drivers and the neurological impacts of certain computer tasks. In addition to the educational value most studies offer some type of incentive or stipend for participants. To sign up as a participant go to http://ucf-ist.sona-systems.com/ and click on Request An Account under the New Participant bar on the lower left of the page. Faculty interested in using the Sona website to recruit research participants should contact the UCF-IST SONA Administrator at SONAadministrator@ist.ucf.edu for a user name and password.
