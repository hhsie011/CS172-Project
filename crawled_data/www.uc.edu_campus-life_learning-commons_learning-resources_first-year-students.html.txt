We are excited that you will be joining us this fall and become part of our University of Cincinnati family! Starting college is a huge transition, and the Learning Commons are here to help. In addition to utilizing our academic support services, check out our collection of “need-to-know” resources below. Feel free to visit us to learn more about campus and the steps to success that every student can take! Many entering freshman are unaware of the requirements and time commitments needed to be successful students in college. The rigors of college life will present many new experiences and challenges for you. The information included below seeks to address standard challenges and opportunities available to UC students; we hope it will be useful. If you have any questions about any of the resources, contact the Learning Commons, and we will be happy to provide more information or additional suggestions. Our programs will enable you to "hit the ground running" with a solid foundation of the study skills and habits necessary for a successful college student. While some advice included may seem like common sense, you will find that self-motivation and regulation are just as critical to your academic and personal success in college as specific content knowledge. Luckily, the Learning Commons runs programs for students seeking additional content knowledge, in addition to coaching for those students seeking to get organized. We hope you’ll make an appointment soon!
