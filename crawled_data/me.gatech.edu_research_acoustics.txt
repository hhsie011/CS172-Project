In fluid media, these vibrations are called sound, so the area is referred to as acoustics, but many of the questions and research tools are common to all areas. The basic objective shared by the projects is to understand the mechanisms by which the vibration or sound is initially generated, or modified as it propagates, or detected by the receiving transducer. In many cases, this information can be used to characterize the propagation medium. In some cases, this will lead to concepts for reducing the signal, but there are many situations where it is desirable to enhance it. Research funding is derived primarily from the Office of Naval Research, the National Science Foundation, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and industries such as Ford Motor Company, Cummins Engine Co., Lockheed-Martin Corporation, Newport News Shipbuilding, and Tenneco.
