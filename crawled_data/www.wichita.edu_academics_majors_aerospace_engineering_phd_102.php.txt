He chose WSU when he learned about its relationship with NASA. To say it worked out well for him is an understatement. After graduating in 2007, Alex immediately got a job at NASA. He now carries one of the heaviest responsibilities at mission control: training space station crew members for space walks in giant swimming pools, then monitoring them in space.
