This course is for students who seek a better understanding of how their everyday life and modern biology interact. As our health and policy decisions are increasingly motivated by recent events and new technologies, a fundamental understanding of biology is essential to making informed choices for ourselves and the community. This course is an introductory survey course that explores major discoveries and ideas that have revolutionized the way we view and understand biological life. The basic concepts of cell and molecular biology, genetics, and evolution, will be traced from seminal discoveries to the modern era. Students will learn critical scientific analysis to understand and communicate biological concepts, biotechnology, and bioethics.
