The competitive demands placed on organizations to be nimble, to produce more with higher quality, to change constantly, to be more innovative, and to partner more effectively require a fundamental understanding of individual and collective behavior in organizations. People-related issues such as leadership, human resource management, motivation, teamwork, conflict resolution, organizational structure, culture, change management, creativity, and innovation are key to the ability of firms to compete effectively in increasingly demanding and rapidly-changing environments. The organizational behavior area focuses on these issues in its research, teaching, and doctoral training.
