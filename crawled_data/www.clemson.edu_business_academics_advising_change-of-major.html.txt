Major Policy Frequently Asked Questions Contact Us Clemson Home Wilbur O. and Ann Powers College of Business Academics Academic Advising Current: Change of Major Policy Change of Major Policy The Wilbur O. and Ann Powers College of Business limits times when students may request a Change of Academic Program (CoAP) each semester. The Business School stops changing students into pre-business, business majors, and graphic communications on the last day to add or register for classes each semester. This is typically the Tuesday after classes begin in each regular semester. Students should submit their requests at least two business days prior to this cutoff date to ensure adequate time for processing to occur.
