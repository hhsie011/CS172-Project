She loves sharing all that is great about Baylor Law, hearing applicants' stories, and helping their law-school dreams become a reality. She received her A.B. from Harvard University in 2007 and her M.B.A. and her J.D., cum laude, from Southern Methodist University in 2011. While in law school, she was active in the Christian Legal Society and the Federalist Society, was a student worker in the SMU Law Admissions Office, and was Year-in-Review editor for the International Lawyer. She worked for several small bankruptcy, construction, and real estate law firms and served as a judicial intern for the Honorable Harlin D. Hale in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas. In 2011, she moved to Illinois, where she worked as Assistant Director of Admissions and Financial Aid at Northern Illinois University College of Law. She is a Dallas native and loves the great state of Texas. In her free time, she enjoys being involved in church activities, volunteering, exploring Waco, and finding the perfect cup of coffee.
