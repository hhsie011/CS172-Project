The Student Transfer Achievement Reform Act (SB-1440) was signed into legislation on September 29, 2010. The Policy supports transfer students from the California community colleges to earn an Associate in Arts (AA-T) or Associate in Science (AS-T) degree, while preparing students for CSU transfer. This degree is defined by having sixty transferrable units that include 18 units in a major or area of emphasis and the IGETC or CSU GE Breadth pattern. The benefits to students earning an AA-T or AS-T include: Guaranteed admission into a CSU. Students can earn a Bachelor’s degree in 60 units upon transfer, including any lower division General Education (GE) courses, all upper division GE courses, all major and elective course requirements. CSUs are prohibited from requiring students to repeat courses that are similar to those completed at the community college for the associate degree for transfer. Questions?
