From the Institute for Biomedical Studies to the Center for Reservoir and Aquatic Systems Research, the Robbins Institute for Health Policy and Leadership, the Center for Family and Community Ministries, and many more, faculty are actively working alongside undergraduate and graduate students to engage in discipline-shaping research and innovation that could change the trajectory of healthcare. Illuminate places an emphasis on several key areas of research interest - environmental determinants of health; family and community determinants of health; biomedical research; health policy, law, leadership, and ethics; and undergraduate health and medical education. It also calls for greater collaboration with health-related partners that share the Baylor name - Baylor College of Medicine and Baylor Scott & White Health - and other organizations that offer alignment with the University. Among Baylor's unique opportunities is the preparation of the next generation of Christian physicians, nurses, leaders, researchers, mental health providers, and policymakers at a time when a Christian voice can provide profound guidance. We must provide graduates with the ability to engage with a society faced with groundbreaking moral and ethical challenges to our understanding of human life and dignity.
