We are an integrative department taking a connective approach to the life sciences, fostering collaboration and intellectual partnerships across many different disciplines. The research and teaching we do spans from cellular and molecular biology to global climate change, and from bacterial microevolution in the lab to evolution and extinctions hundreds of millions of years ago. Unlike most other biology departments, ours is unique in its integration across organismal and organizational boundaries, its open and collaborative atmosphere, and the broad set of units and programs at the UW (and beyond) in which our faculty and students participate (e.g., Friday Harbor Labs, Allen Institute, Burke Museum). We relish working at the boundaries and across disciplines and are excited to find new ways to do so. We are not only the largest UW department, but also the largest producer of STEM degrees in Washington. Our success as a department is driven by the curiosity of our faculty, students, postdocs, and staff. They uphold our research and education missions through the quality of their work in classrooms, labs, field sites, and beyond. We recognize that diversity and diverse connections within our community are essential for generating novel ideas and approaches, and are working hard to create a truly equitable, inclusive and accessible department to promote such diversity. Come join the next generation of educators, researchers, policy leaders, and entrepreneurs!
