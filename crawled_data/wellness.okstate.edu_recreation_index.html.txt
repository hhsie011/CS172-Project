Our Mission To pursue excellence through innovative facilities, programs, and services in order to promote learning, institutional success, community impact, and lifelong wellness. History In August 2011, the Department of Campus Recreation and the Seretean Wellness Center merged, creating the Department of Wellness. With a focus on becoming America's Healthiest Campus, full-time employees of Oklahoma State University were given access to the first class facilities at the Colvin Recreation Center and the Seretean Wellness Center as a benefit of employment. The Department of Wellness continually develops new programs and services to fit the ever-changing wellness needs of the OSU community. Upcoming Events Unsupported browser detected.
