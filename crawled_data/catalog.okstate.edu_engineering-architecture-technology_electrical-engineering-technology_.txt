Architecture and Technology/ Electrical Engineering Technology Electrical Engineering Technology Overview Courses Undergraduate Programs Faculty The electrical engineering technology (EET) curriculum provides preparation for outstanding career opportunities not only in the electrical and electronics industries, but also in many other sectors because of their dependence upon electricity and electronics control, power, communications, and computation. The job responsibility of electrical engineering technology graduates ranges from application engineer, testing engineer, and field engineer. In addition, the graduates also work as design and development engineer and application development engineer for modern microprocessors. The EET program offers a Bachelor of Science in Engineering Technology degree with a major in Electrical Engineering Technology. An option with an emphasis on computers and computing is also available. The program focuses on a hands-on laboratory-oriented curriculum to meet the diverse needs of modern industries. It provides a strong foundation of specialized mathematics, science, applied electrical engineering, and related technical courses, as well as courses in the area of written and oral communications, humanities, and the social sciences. Program Educational Objectives OSU Electrical Engineering Technology graduates a few years after graduation will: Show continuous career improvement, evidenced by assumption of greater responsibility or leadership, promotion, participation in continuing education or graduate studies, or transition into other technical or professional careers. Be able to work independently as well as collaboratively with others while demonstrating the professional and ethical responsibilities of the engineering profession. Electrical Engineering Technology graduates can expect to obtain these student outcomes upon graduation: Program Outcomes (1) An ability to apply knowledge, techniques, skills and modern tools of mathematics, science, engineering, and technology to solve well-defined engineering problems appropriate to the discipline; (2) An ability to design solutions for well-defined technical problems and assist with the engineering design of systems, components, or processes appropriate to the discipline; (3) An ability to apply written, oral, and graphical communication in well-defined technical and non-technical environments; and an ability to identify and use appropriate technical literature; (4) An ability to conduct standard tests, measurements, and experiments and to analyze and interpret the results to improve processes; and (5) An ability to function effectively as a member of a technical team. The Electrical Engineering Technology major provides graduates the ability to enter into many dynamic fields of electrical engineering and electrical technology. The demand for graduates having electronic and electrical engineering design and application skills continues to grow. Graduates of this program are prepared for a wide range of opportunities for employment in an industry that requires considerable knowledge of the electrical engineering and technology professions. The Electrical Engineering Technology–Computer option curriculum provides the preparation for graduates to enter the growing field of computer hardware and software engineering. The demand for graduates having both computer hardware and software skills is of high demand as the intensity of automation, robotics, and artificial intelligence is growing.
