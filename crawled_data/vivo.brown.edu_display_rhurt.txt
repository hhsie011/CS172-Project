Full Text Research Research Overview Professor Hurt's research focuses on nanomaterials and their applications and implications for human health and the environment. Current research focuses on 2D nanomaterials - new atomically-thin sheet-like solids that are enabling components in next-generation environmental and biomedical technologies. The group is particular interested in the directed assembly of graphene to make three-dimensional architectures for barrier and encapsulation technologies, and the environmental and biological transformations and persistence of 2D materials. Research Statement Professor Hurt's research focuses on nanomaterials and their applications and implications for human health and the environment. Current research focuses on 2D nanomaterials - new atomically-thin sheet-like solids that are enabling components in next-generation environmental and biomedical technologies. The group is particular interested in the directed assembly of graphene to make three-dimensional architectures for barrier and encapsulation technologies, and the environmental and biological transformations and persistence of 2D materials. Nanotoxicology A major thrust in the laboratory at this time is the study of the human health impacts of manufactured nanomaterials. The nation has invested heavily in the development of new nanomaterials, which are currently serving as a materials tool kit for the development of a vast array of new technologies. The potential human health impacts of these nanomaterials is not fully understood and is an area of intense worldwide research at this time. In collaboration with the biological laboratory of Agnes Kane, David Rand, and Diane Lipscombe laboratories, we are studying nanomaterial interactions with cells, cellular substractures (membranes and ion channels), and whole organisms (Drosophila). The group is synthesizing and characterizing model nanomaterials based on carbon, silver, and selenium, with precise control of size, shape, hydrophobicity, and metals form/content to identify those nanomaterial features ultimately responsible for toxic responses. The samples are subjected to cellular and molecular assays that include metal mobilization and redox activity, cell viability, DNA damage and antioxidant destruction. The long term goal is to identify synthesis and purification proceedures that minimize human health impacts. We are striving for "green" nanomaterials that have been co-optimized for human health impacts and material performance. Current research includes a special focus on the biological responses to graphene-family materials, comprising monolayer graphene, few-layer graphene, and graphene oxide. We hypothesize the biological responses are functions of lateral dimension, layer number, and surface chemistry. We are studying adsorption and quenching artifacts associated with the ultra-high surface area of graphene materials, and their uptake and localization in cells in close collaboration with the pathology laboratory of Agnes Kane. Biological and Environmental Applications The Hurt laboratory has developed a nanomaterial-based technology for capture of mercury release from compact fluorescent lamps. The technology uses reactive barriers of unstabilized amorphous nSe for high efficiency room-temperature reaction with elemental mercury vapor. The laboratory is also collaborating with the Kane laboratory to develop carbon-selenium composites for treatment of mesothelioma. Recent work is addressing graphene-based environmental barriers, and composites made from folded graphene nanoparticles. Recent work has focused on development of graphene-oxide enhanced fabrics that provide chemical protection and breathability to enable user body temperature regulation through perspiration heat loss. Carbon Nanomaterials Another activity in the laboratory is the synthesis and characterization of novel carbon nanoforms from liquid crystalline precursors. This laboratory has pioneered techniques for the molecular control of carbon structure using surface-directed assembly of disk-like polyaromatic compounds. Confining discotic liquid crystals in nanospaces yields unique supramolecular fluid structures that can be quenched into functional organic solids or polymerized into carbon materials. Choosing the template material and geometry gives precise molecular control of crystal structure and interfaces, and can be used to fabricate optimal nanocarbon forms for fuel cells, batteries, sensors, and nanocomposites. Additional projects focus on the assembly of chromonic liquid crystals into carbon nanotubes, nanoribbons, and optical aniotropic carbon thin films. The group is also interestesd in the order/diorder phase transitions, wetting, spreading, and surface anchoring of polyaromatic compounds to understand the fundamental molecular interactions that drive these directed assembly processes. The newest topic in the group is the use of fine metal catalyst particles to etch complex patterns or pores in graphene and carbon thin films. The work includes the use of magnetic catalyst particles whose etch tracks can be steered through the application of external magnetic fields.
