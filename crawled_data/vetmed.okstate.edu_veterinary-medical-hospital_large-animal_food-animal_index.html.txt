We offer routine appointments Monday-Friday and 24 hour emergency service including holidays. The food animal medicine and surgery service is staffed by board certified specialists, post-graduate veterinary residents, interns and senior veterinary students. The service is supported by board certified specialists in other areas of the hospital including anesthesiology, surgery, ophthalmology, radiology, cardiology and pathology. Licensed animal health technicians specifically trained in food animal medicine and surgery assist our veterinarians and provide patient care during the day and after hours. All the members of our team utilize state of the art diagnostic and therapeutic modalities with the common goal of delivering the highest possible standard of compassionate veterinary care to ill or injured cattle, sheep, goats, llamas and alpacas, and swine, while training the food animal or mixed animal practitioners and veterinary specialists of the future. Diagnostic and treatment procedures can be tailored to suit your needs ranging from practical and frugal for commercial production animals or as detailed and intensive as need be for valuable seed stock or companion livestock.
