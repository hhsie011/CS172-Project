Why consider an on-campus co-op? Income: Earn up to $14 per hour to help offset tuition and living expenses (up to $4,200 per semester) Versatile: Learn cross-cutting skills that apply to any field or industry Fits into your schedule: Work five to 20 hours per week Convenient: Work right on campus What Students Say “Through this opportunity...I developed valuable relationships and transferable skills. [It] has given me the confidence to tackle the next step in my career journey.” -- Arin Gentry, Peer Career Coach “Having an on-campus co-op allowed me to have a competitive edge when looking for a full-time job and continuously impressed employers when I was able to speak about the experiences I had on campus!” -- Michael Santangelo, Peer Career Coach “Participating in an on-campus co-op was honestly one of the best experiences I have had in college. Not only did it allow me to dive deeper into how the curriculum in my majors related to potential career paths, but it also challenged me to reflect on how I can use these experiences to make myself more marketable for graduate school and future potential employment. This experience has also deepened my understanding of how to use and develop transferable skills that can carry on to my future endeavors.” -- Dylanie Schultz, Learning Commons Peer Educator Learning While Earning During your co-op, you take an online course that focuses on workplace etiquette, goal-setting, reflection and how to identify, develop, and articulate cross-cutting skills such as customer service, communication, leadership, and teamwork that every employer looks for. Developing these skills in yourself and being able to articulate them can help you rise to a leadership role in your on-campus co-op or be better prepared – and more competitive – for a future off-campus internship or full-time job. Where Can I Work? The following UC departments hire student co-ops, and more are being added all the time: Accessibility Network Campus Services: Campus Recreation Center and Parking Services Center for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning (CET&L) College of Allied Health Sciences: Contact Tracers College of Arts and Sciences Transfer Services Experience-Based Learning and Career Education Human Resources Learning Commons Lindner College of Business Instructional Design Marketing and Communications Next Lives Here: Communication Office of Innovation/1819 Innovation Hub One Stop Student Service Center RED Resident Education and Development Student Activities and Leadership Development Student-Run Free Clinic Transition and Access Program UC Foundation Digital Philanthropy Center University Bookstore University Libraries University Press How to Find an On-Campus Co-op You can find on-campus co-ops using UC’s career platform Handshake. After logging in, click Jobs, then apply the filter labeled "On Campus." Then, look for "co-op" in job titles or enter "co-op" in the search box. Work Authorization for International Students International students are allowed to work on campus 20 hours per week during a semester in which they are enrolled in classes full-time. Students who are completing an on-campus co-op are not required to submit a Curricular Practical Training (CPT) request to UC International Services. International students may not use the COOP-1000 course as a way to obtain authorization to exceed the limit of 20 hours per week for work on campus. Students who are not currently active in the University Human Resources (HR) system should contact UC International Services to complete onboarding.
