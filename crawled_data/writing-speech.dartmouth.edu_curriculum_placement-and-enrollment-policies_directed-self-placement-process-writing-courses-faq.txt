Dartmouth's directed self-placement process (DSP) for writing courses offers you the opportunity to reflect on your past writing experiences and abilities, learn more about Dartmouth's first-year writing courses, and receive a recommendation from Dartmouth writing faculty regarding which of these courses might be the best fit for you. How do I access the online directed self-placement process for writing courses? Starting June 1st, you may access the online DSP site using instructions that will be posted on the First-Year Writing Choices page. What does the process involve? To complete the directed self-placement process for writing courses, you complete a questionnaire, review our course offerings, read a set of selected essays, and compose a brief writing sample. Our faculty will then make a recommendation that will help you make a final decision about which writing course to take. The process itself is reflective and instructional, encouraging you to think about the intellectual work that lies ahead. Do I need to complete the placement process if I'm already sure that I want to be placed in Writing 2-3? Yes. Writing 2-3 is a popular course, and we typically have a wait list of students who want to take this course. Students who have completed the placement process will be given first consideration. Completing the placement process enables you to make an informed and thoughtful decision about which writing course is best for you. Do I need to complete the placement process even if I know I will decline the recommendation to be placed in Writing 2-3? Yes. All entering first-year students must complete the process or risk being placed into a course that might not be the best match for them. You will receive valuable information from this process that will help you assess what course is best for you. It also lets you indicate whether they are interested in taking other courses that satisfy the writing requirement. Do I have to accept the placement I'm given? No. Our faculty make recommendations, not placements. You may decline a recommendation for Writing 2-3 and request to take Writing 5 by emailing writing.placement@dartmouth.edu. If you are recommended to take Writing 5, but want Writing 2-3 you may need to be placed on a wait list, as space in that program is limited. If you are recommended for Writing 5 after completing the direct self-placement process and prefer Writing 2-3, you should email writing.placement@dartmouth.edu. What's the difference between Writing 2-3 and Writing 5? For more information comparing the first-year writing courses, see the Differences among First-year Writing Courses page. What if I have additional questions? Please write to the Institute for Writing and Rhetoric at writing.placement@dartmouth.edu.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Institute for Writing and Rhetoric Philosophy & Aims About Writing at Dartmouth Speech at Dartmouth Our Stories The Story of Writing Instruction at Dartmouth The Story of Speech at Dartmouth The Story of Writing Support at Dartmouth Curriculum Overview Writing Courses Writing 2-3 WRIT 5 First-Year Seminars Humanities 1-2 Speech Courses Speech 20 Speech 25 Speech 26 Speech 27 Speech 30 Speech 31 Speech 33 Speech 34 Speech 36 Speech 37 Speech 40 Placement and Enrollment Policies First-Year Writing & First-Year Seminar Requirements Differences Among First-Year Writing Courses FAQ Directed Self-Placement Process for Writing Registration for Writing 5 or Writing 2-3 Registration for First Year Seminars FAQ First-year Writing Registration First-year Writing Choices Prizes Writing Prize Winners Speech Contest Winners Speech Contest Call for Entries Learning Overview Writing Center Make an Appointment Materials Sources and Citations at Dartmouth Teaching Overview Guidelines Teaching Writing in the First Year Expectations for Writing 2-3 Expectations for Writing 5 Teaching the First-Year Seminar First-Year Writing: Pedagogies, Methods, & Design Active Learning in the First-Year Writing Classroom Syllabus and Assignment Design Teaching Writing as Process Integrating Reading and Writing Diagnosing and Responding to Student Writing Conducting Writing Workshops Collaborative Learning/Learning with Peers Teaching Argument Teaching Research Addressing Grammar Useful links Support The Writing Assistant Program Research Past Research Activities Research Overview Multilingual Overview Support for Undergraduate Students Support for Graduate Students Faculty Support News & People People News Employment Upcoming Events Past Events My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
