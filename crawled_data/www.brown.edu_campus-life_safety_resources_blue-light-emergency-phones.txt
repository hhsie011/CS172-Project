Blue-Light Emergency phone calls transmit an automatic identifier so that the Communications Control Officer will know your locations when the call is answered. These calls are treated like "911" calls. Upon answering, a DPS Officer will be dispatched to your location. The phones are housed in gray or yellow lexan cases, are mounted directly to buildings or stanchions, and have a blue light above them. Phones can be located at the entrance of every campus residence hall, in the area of most administrative buildings and also along most University walkways.
