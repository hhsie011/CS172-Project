Special tours of facilities within the School of Liberal Arts and the School of Architecture are available to prospective students interested in these areas of study at Tulane. Performing/Visual Arts Tours To schedule, select a date on the calendar and then click a time. Be sure to register at least five days in advance. Time and duration depend on student interests: we offer tours in music (including musical theatre), dance, theatre, and studio art. Facilities include Dixon Hall, McWilliams Hall, Newcomb Art Museum, and Woldenberg Art Center (buildings 68-70 & 81-83 on campus map). Please contact Angel Carter at acarte3@tulane.edu if you have any problems with tour registration, if you'd like to learn more about these departments through an in-person meeting or phone call, or if you need to cancel your reservation. Arts tours are typically one-on-one events, so to be considerate of our students' time between classes, we will alert the guide if your visiting group can no longer attend.
