Breakthrough Scholars receive a cost-of-attendance scholarship award and exclusive academic, personal, and professional development support, including a dedicated advisor and the opportunity to connect with local-area professionals in science, engineering, and health, as well as faculty mentors in research labs both on and off campus, across the nation, and in other countries. Scholars also spend the summer before their first year getting familiar with Clemson's campus and its surrounding communities (while also getting an early start on their research) through our innovative EUREKA! program, meeting Breakthrough Scholar faculty mentors and advisors, and participating in STEM workshops. Scholar Selection Process To be considered for the Breakthrough Scholars program, an applicant must submit BOTH the Clemson undergraduate admissions application AND the Clemson University Honors College admissions application online. Only applicants who meet the priority application deadlines outlined in the application timeline will be eligible for consideration. These applicants are notified of selection as a Breakthrough Scholars Program Finalist and invited to participate in the interview process. The final selection of the Breakthrough Scholars is based on the Clemson University admissions application, the Clemson University Honors College application, and interviews that take place during Selection Weekend.
