Some GSAS master’s programs offer a high-level introduction to study within traditional academic disciplines, while others allow students to pursue new fields of inquiry through an interdisciplinary course of study or to cultivate or enhance professional skills. Study in GSAS doctoral programs begins with several years of rigorous coursework and culminates in the writing of the dissertation, a substantial piece of independent research (or, in the case of DMA students, original compositions). The doctoral degree can be pursued in traditional disciplines as well as interdisciplinary research areas. Partnerships with research and cultural institutions in New York enhance Columbia’s educational offerings, while the vast array of industries centered in the city provide numerous opportunities for professional development. Mission Responsible for overseeing the education of graduate students in the departments of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences is central to the larger Columbia University mission of advancing knowledge through research while providing a distinctive and distinguished learning environment. Accordingly, the Graduate School seeks to admit a diverse group of students capable of producing rigorous, innovative scholarship and to support all aspects of their educational experience. The Graduate School’s support in academic matters includes facilitating the integration of graduate students into the research and educational enterprises of the university, establishing standards and policies for best practices among graduate programs, and fostering an environment for collegial, fruitful interaction and collaboration across a range of disciplines. The Graduate School also endeavors to promote the interests of graduate students in nonacademic matters that constitute an important part of the educational experience, including financial aid, housing, health and well-being, and the cultivation of professional skills apposite to careers inside and outside academia.
