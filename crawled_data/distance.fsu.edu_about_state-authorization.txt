If you’re interested in a program that may lead to professional licensure, make sure it meets licensing criteria in your state before you apply. Click or tap the Licensure Search button below for information on your program. FSU is a member of SARA (State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements) and approved by the National Council for State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements. Our membership enables us to admit students to online degree programs from all 50 states and most territories, including Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Online Programs that Lead to Licensure Many online courses and programs lead to professional licensure. Whether your academic path leads to a career in social work, speech pathology, law, teaching, or another field, you may need a license to practice. All online programs at FSU that lead to licensure meet Florida’s licensing requirements. Other states have their own requirements, and you’ll want to make sure your program meets criteria in your home state (or state where you intend to work) before you apply. FSU is unable to guarantee that program requirements are met in any other state besides Florida. Search our state licensure database to see if the program you're interested in meets the educational requirements for licensing in your home state (or state where you intend to work).
