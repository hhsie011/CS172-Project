The programs require students to be enrolled in courses in Fall, Spring, & Summer. This results in the students in these programs receiving unique financial aid awards. In the Office of Financial Aid we call these programs, Special Programs, as they have special financial aid rules. Some of these programs may have additional fees above and beyond the standard fees, books, parking, etc. The Office of Financial aid is required to reserve 1/3 of your annual Federal Direct Loan eligibility for that mandatory summer term and, if applicable, update your cost of attendance with any additional allowable educational expenses if you are in a Special Program.
