We believe in the idea that serving others brings us all to a higher place. We believe that each person has the capacity to enact change. And now, more than ever, we believe in empowering our Eagles to take action in the world. Your support can help BC change lives. The work done by our students through Campus Ministry programs is a prime example. Whether volunteering with 4Boston, serving domestically in Appalachia, or traveling to Latin America and the Caribbean through the Arrupe program, our young leaders quickly learn what it means to be "men and women for others" working and living with communities in need. Gifts from BC alumni and friends like you make these programs and opportunities possible for our Eagles. Every dollar makes a difference in bring our mission to life. You can donate online here or submit a gift via our office. With sincere thanks, Fr.
