The University undertook year-round operations and accelerated programs to provide the educated personnel needed for the war effort. Faculty and staff left to join the fight, with those who stayed also supporting the war effort, like Professor Charles Kraus, who assisted in the purification of uranium salts for atomic bomb research and discovered a chemical process that allowed submarines to stay underwater longer. Although the total number who served from the Brown community is unknown, former students who lost their lives would number 177, including four graduate students and one woman.
