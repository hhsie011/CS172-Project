As a part of that effort, WSU Athletics developed a targeted plan to ensure that it will return to an operating breakeven position by FY2023. The Athletics plan also ensures that WSU is fully compliant with RCW 28B.15.120. This statute requires that the Washington State University Board of Regents specifically approve, in an open public meeting, (1) the annual budget for the Athletics program; (2) the plan for reducing the Athletics operating deficit in future fiscal years; and (3) any transfers necessary at FY19 year-end to cover the deficit balance. In addition, the statute requires the Board to conspicuously post to the University’s website the financial statements of the Athletic program for the three prior fiscal years, as well as the plan for reducing the Athletics operating deficit in future fiscal years.
