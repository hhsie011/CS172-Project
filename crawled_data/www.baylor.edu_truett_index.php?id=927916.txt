Before joining the faculty at Truett, she worked with Baylor’s Institute for Faith and Learning on a grant from the Lilly Endowment’s Called to Lives of Meaning and Purpose Initiative that focused on the exploration of vocation in churches. Dr. Poe Hays believes that ministry must be grounded in faithful and responsible readings of Scripture, and she loves teaching the “Older” Testament in order to draw out its ongoing relevance for the church. She is particularly interested in how stories emerge from the Psalms and shape our engagement with these song-prayers, and in how these literary features might help individuals and faith communities cope with trauma and develop resilience. She presents regularly at the national meetings of the Society for Biblical Literature and is co-chair of the Old Testament/Hebrew Bible unit of the regional SBL. An ordained deacon, she has served in churches and Christian non-profits in Tennessee, Alabama, and Texas. Dr. Poe Hays and her husband Joshua, who serves as Associate Pastor at the First Baptist Church of Waco, have a daughter named Mary Brandon and a distinguished mutt named Cooper.
