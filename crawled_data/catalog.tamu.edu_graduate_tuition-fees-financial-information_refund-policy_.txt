Financial aid returned (by the University and/or the student or parent) must be allocated in the following order: Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loan Subsidized Federal Direct Loan Direct Graduate PLUS (Student) Loan Federal Direct PLUS (Parent) Loan Federal Pell Grant Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) TEACH Grant Other state or institutional financial aid programs State and institutional aid awards will be calculated using the same percentage proration used by Student Business Services to determine the amount of tuition and fees to be charged to a withdrawn student. Unclaimed Title IV Refunds According to federal law, the university is required to return Title IV funds that have not been claimed (i.e., refund check that has not been cashed) within 240 days of issue. These funds will be returned to the appropriate federal financial aid program. Dining Plan Refunds and Add/Change/Drop Policies Texas A&M University Dining’s dining plans and options listed are based on information available at time of printing and are subject to change. University Dining follows the University’s refund schedule for Tuition and Fee Adjustments. Refunds are given on the percentage basis listed for students dropping fee options or officially withdrawing from the University. Students may purchase a dining plan, change to a larger plan or add on to a plan during registration for classes through University Dining. Dining Plans and additions to the plans may be charged to the student account. Changes from a higher dining plan to a smaller dining plan or requests to cancel/drop are permitted until a date designated on dining.tamu.edu. The appropriate fee is to be paid to the Office of Student Business Services. Dining plans are valid for one semester starting with the first day of campus move-in (as designated by the Department of Residence Life) and end after the last final exam day. Check with Dining for posted dates for dining plan access. Location hours may vary during class breaks and meal availability may exclude official University holidays. Following University policy, no one is authorized to use or borrow a student’s identification card (Aggie Card); therefore, dining plans are not transferable between students. The Aggie Card must be presented to Dining cashiers for dining plan participation. If an Aggie Card becomes lost, report it immediately by calling (979) 845-4661 or go to http://myaggiecard.tamu.edu to deactivate the card. For questions and assistance, please email dining@tamu.edu (include name, UIN and instructions if dining plan related) or contact our office at (979) 845-0152. Additional information on University Dining and dining plans can be found on our website or in this catalog under Campus Dining. Fee Adjustments for Courses Dropped A student may drop individual courses during the first five days of a fall or spring semester (first four days of a summer term). Students also may drop individual classes with special permission of the dean between the 6th and 12th class days. Full refunds will be given for the individually dropped courses during these periods provided the student remains enrolled in at least one class and has not withdrawn from the university. Refunds will not be issued for classes dropped after the 12th class day. Any credit balance on a student account as a result of dropping courses will not be refunded until after the fifth class day. As of the first day of the semester, students may not drop all of their courses through the drop/add process, but instead must begin the official withdrawal process online through Howdy (see Withdrawal from the University below for additional information regarding the withdrawal process). A student may add courses during the first five days of a fall or spring semester. Reductions in Rates for Late Entry to the University No reduction will be made in the charge of room rent and board in case of entrance within 10 days after the opening of a semester or summer term, nor will a refund be made in case of withdrawal during the last 10 days of a semester or summer term, or the last days for which payment is made. Refund Delivery Texas A&M and Heartland ECSI have joined forces to deliver financial aid and other refunds to students faster through the University’s refund delivery process. You will receive information from Heartland ECSI and the University at your new student conference and in your official University email account, which will explain the process for signing up for direct deposit of refunds. Residence Hall and White Creek Apartments Rent Refund If a student withdraws, moves off campus or in any other way terminates the housing contract, a refund of residence hall rent may be made according to the housing contract. Any changes to the rent refund schedule will be detailed in the housing contract. The academic year contract period is from the time the contract is signed to the end of the fourth week of classes in the spring semester. Exceptions to this policy may be made for students who cancel their contract for the following reasons: Texas A&M University co-op or student teaching assignment, academic restriction, graduation and medical withdrawal. Tuition and Fee Adjustments Tuition and fee adjustments shall be made to a student officially withdrawing from the University for charges listed below according to the following refund schedule: Tuition and Required Fees, Residence Hall Rent and Meal Plans. If the student withdraws during a fall or spring semester or a summer term of 10 weeks or longer: Tuition Refunds Timing Percentage Prior to the first day of class 100% During the first five class days 80% During the second five class days 70% During the third five class days 50% During the fourth five class days 25% After the fourth five class days None If the student withdraws during a term or session of more than five weeks but less than 10 weeks: Tuition Refunds Timing Percentage Prior to the first day of class 100% During the first, second, or third class day 80% During the fourth, fifth, or sixth class day 50% Seventh day of class and thereafter None If the student withdraws from a term or session of five weeks or less: Tuition Refunds Timing Percentage Prior to the first day of class 100% During the first class day 80% During the second class day 50% During the third class day or thereafter None Withdrawal from the University Once the University has accepted payment for tuition and fees, a student is considered officially enrolled unless otherwise restricted from enrolling. Stopping payment on a check for fees or allowing the check to be returned unpaid by the bank for any reason does not constitute official withdrawal. Before classes begin, you may go online to Howdy and drop your courses and options for the semester. After classes begin, you must go through the official withdrawal process in order to cancel your registration for the semester. In Howdy, go to the Student Withdrawal channel on the My Record tab to begin the online withdrawal process. Failure to complete the withdrawal process will result in forfeiture of any tuition and fee adjustments, and course work may be recorded as incomplete or failed. Failure to follow procedures for withdrawing from the University may result in financial penalties and delays with future enrollment in the University. Once a student registers, they are responsible for the total fees assessed regardless of whether the installment option is used. Refund percentages are applied to total fees assessed and not the amount paid. This means that students who withdraw before paying all installments may, in the event of withdrawal, still owe the University. International students must visit with an advisor in International Student Services before withdrawing to determine if doing so will affect visa status. Student athletes should visit with an academic advisor in Athletics before initiating the withdrawal process. Recipients of financial assistance should visit with an Enrollment Services Advisor before withdrawing. Students receiving funds awarded by Scholarships & Financial Aid should be aware of policies regarding withdrawal from the University, which may be reviewed on our Maintaining Eligibility website. Federal regulations require a return calculation for all students who receive Title IV student assistance at a post-secondary institution of higher education and withdraw during a payment period (semester). Students withdrawing prior to the end of a payment period may be required to return disbursed funds not earned. The length of time during which it must be determined whether a return calculation is needed is up to 60 percent of the payment period. Additionally, students who do not successfully complete courses for the semester may be considered unofficially withdrawn and may be subject to a return calculation based on their last date of academic engagement. This type of activity includes, but is not limited to, submitting an academic assignment or taking an exam. All disbursed funds may be returned if attendance cannot be documented. Eligibility for state and institutional funds may also be impacted by withdrawing from the University. Drops and withdrawals are considered unsuccessfully completed coursework when determining Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) and will impact completion rate. For more information, please visit our Maintaining Eligibility website. Yearbook Yearbook charges are refundable in full during the semester in which payment is made. Thereafter, no refunds will be made on canceled orders. Yearbooks must be picked up during the academic year in which they are published. Students who will not be on campus when the yearbooks are published must pay a mailing and handling fee. Yearbooks will not be held, nor will they be mailed, without payment of the mailing and handling fee. Refunds will not be made on books not picked up within one semester of the publication date. Refunds will not be made before 21 days from the date of payment. Refund policies contained herein reflect policies in effect at the time of publication and are subject to change. © 2022-2023 Texas A&M University College Station, Texas 77843 Web Accessibility Site Policies Webmaster Back to top Close this window Print Options Send Page to Printer Print this page.
