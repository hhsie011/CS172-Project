There is the fascination of watching a figment of the imagination emerge through the aid of science to a plan on paper. Then it moves to realization in stone or metal or energy. Then it brings jobs and homes to men. Then it elevates the standards of living and adds to the comforts of life. That is the engineer’s high privilege." Herbert Hoover Quick links for Mechanical Engineering: ME Video Seminars Design Program Calendar Contact Us ME Faculty Spotlight Fadi Abdeljawad Fadi Abdeljawad of Clemson University is leading new research into a unique class of metallic alloys that show promise for a broad range of applications, including the development of cars and airplanes with improved fuel efficiency. Abdeljawad, a materials scientist and an assistant professor of mechanical engineering, said that he and his team are working to better understand how nanocrystalline metallic alloys respond to extreme environments, such as heat and external forces. Their work could be the next step in creating a new generation of alloys with unprecedented properties, he said.
