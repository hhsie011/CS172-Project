disbursed (usually just prior to the first day of classes each semester) and again at the end of the add/drop period. Making enrollment changes, such as failing to enroll for the number of hours on which a financial aid offer was based, dropping hours, or withdrawing from school, frequently requires a repayment of aid. Contact the Office of Scholarship and Financial Aid before making any of the following enrollment changes: Official withdrawal/cancellation from the University Withdrawing from a term in which aid was received may result in the required repayment of unearned aid. The amount of aid to be repaid depends upon the withdrawal date. Typically, if at least 60 percent of the term is completed prior to withdrawal, no aid refunds are required. Unofficial withdrawal/cancellation from the University Students who do not receive any passing grades in a term in which aid was received are considered to have unofficially withdrawn unless attendance is confirmed. If attendance cannot be confirmed, the repayment of unearned aid may be required. Adding/dropping courses before and after census Dropping classes before the end of the add/drop period, or census, may result in a reduction in aid previously disbursed in that term. Dropping classes after census will not impact aid provided the classes were attended. However, courses dropped after census are considered attempted but not completed and can impact Satisfactory Academic Progress. Aid from census-contingent funds is based on enrollment at census, so adding classes after census will not result in increased aid from these funds. The Pell Grant, NC Education Lottery Scholarship and UNC Need-Based Grant are the most common forms of census-contingent funds. Repeating courses Students may repeat a course that has previously been passed only one time without impacting aid eligibility. Aid is not funded for any additional attempts to repeat the same course.
