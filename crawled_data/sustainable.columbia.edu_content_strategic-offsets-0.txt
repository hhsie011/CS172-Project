In partnership with faculty, students, and administrators, Columbia has developed a set of criteria to guide the University’s future purchase of carbon offsets to neutralize emissions that cannot be reduced and eliminated. Using the campus as a living lab, one of the Earth Institute's capstone courses examined this as part of their coursework. The below offset standards serve as guidance for choosing offset projects that: Are high-quality offsets, and Align with Columbia’s sustainability mission and environmental justice principles The offsets must: Have been vetted and verified by a third-party entity Be proven to result in no negative externalities Result in the permanent, quantified and veritable sequestration of carbon with no leakage Result in additional carbon reduction or sequestering Align with local environmental justice principles Ideally, the offsets should: Be local, in and around the New York area Local projects are desirable because they provide co-benefits to Columbia’s immediate surroundings and community. However, international projects can provide co-benefits such as clean water and air to the most vulnerable communities worldwide. A combination of local and international projects may thus be explored with recognition that monitoring to ensure no adverse environmental or cultural impacts is especially important and challenging. Offer some social, environmental, and economic co-benefits to the local community Back to Plan 2030 About Plan 2030 Executive Summary Introduction Progress to Date Climate Leadership Trajectory to Net Zero Emissions Measuring Progress to Net Zero Commitment Areas Campus Energy Sustainable Transportation Responsible Design and Construction Culture Change and Campus as a Living Lab Responsible Materials Management Water Conservation and Capture Appendix Acronyms and Definitions Strategic Offsets Environmental Justice Senior Sustainability Advisory Committee (SSAC) and Working Group Members Sustainable Columbia423 West 120th Street, Suite 7, Mail Code: 3607 · New York, NY 10027 Phone 212-854-7046 Contact Us [email protected] Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
