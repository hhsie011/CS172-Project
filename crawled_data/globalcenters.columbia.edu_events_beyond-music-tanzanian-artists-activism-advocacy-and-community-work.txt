It can help in healing, in breaking down barriers and borders, in reconciling, and it can also educate. As a cultural right, music can help to promote and protect other human rights (civil, political, economic or social). It has a huge impact on what we think and how we view the world, especially now that it is so easily accessible and transferable via social media and streaming platforms. There are many amazing examples of music being used around the world as a tool for learning and social change as well as build movements. Still, few artists are actually taking advantage of the prodigious influence they have. "Beyond the Music" is a discussion series moderated by a community activist that will dive into deep conversations with artists who believe in the power of advocacy and activism in music.
