Film shapes the way we view a culture. What our Film Studies Program hopes that students take away from a study of cinema is an understanding of the cultural, artistic and humanistic perspectives that have gone into the creation of the best films in the repertoire since the inception of the artistic form. The Film Studies Program helps students find his or her own niche and interest in film. Many students immerse themselves in film production. They learn to make short films early on in Filmmaking I and then move on to more developed story-telling in Filmmaking II. In Filmmaking III, each student writes, shoots, and edits his/her own short film. Then, at the end of the semester, each film is projected for an audience at an on-campus screening. Cinematography courses and Adobe Premiere editing capabilities assist students who wish to become more involved in semi-professional filmmaking. Students who take Film Studies courses go on to pursue a number of careers. Some become documentary filmmakers, producers or film editors. Others go into film marketing and advertising. Some work in industries such as television or media production houses. On occasion, a film student works with museum education and outreach staff as a videographer. Some students are accepted into graduate programs such as those at USC, UCLA, NYU, BU, Emerson, etc. Other students study and make films for the sheer passion of doing so while they pursue other disciplines. Internships are available to help students discern what avenue of the media world they would like to pursue. Here at BC, the Film Studies Program helps students take advantage of the very successful Eagle Internship offerings of stipends for unpaid film internships. The Jacques Salmanowitz grants program has provided a means for students to make international documentaries relating to social justice issues to share with the BC community at the annual Arts Festival.
