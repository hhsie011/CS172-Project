The Combined Residency Training Program in Pediatrics, Psychiatry, and Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (otherwise known as "Triple Board") trains physicians who integrate the clinical knowledge and skills of pediatrics and psychiatry to provide uniquely specialized clinical care for children and their families. Brown's five-year Triple Board Program, one of the original six in the country, has trained residents for over thirty years. The residency includes: 2 years of pediatrics 18 months of general psychiatry 18 months of child and adolescent psychiatry Opportunities throughout training for the integration of the three specialties Graduates of the Triple Board Program are board-eligible in all three disciplines and are prepared to practice in any one of them; many pursue careers that cross the traditional boundaries between specialties within the field of child health. The Brown Triple Board Program, along with Brown University’s Warren Alpert Medical School and the Departments of Pediatrics and Psychiatry, makes an ongoing commitment to advancing social justice, structural competence, cultural humility, and anti-racism throughout our training programs, hospitals, and community. The Brown Triple Board Program is dedicated to ensuring the cultivation of these skills and values in our trainees, as well as empowering them to be advocates and forces of change.
