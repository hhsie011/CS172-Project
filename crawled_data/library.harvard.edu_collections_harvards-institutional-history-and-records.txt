Harvard University Archives The collections document the significant moments in Harvard history, but they also reveal compelling stories that are recorded in everyday operational records, adding rich dimension to the over 380 years of documented life at Harvard. Harvard’s records document the University’s evolution from a small college to a modern research university of international scope. They encompass all facets of University life, from teaching and learning to dining services, residential life, building construction, and fundraising. In addition to providing a comprehensive record of Harvard’s internal operations, these collections record the University’s involvement in local, national, and world events. More broadly, the University’s records reflect the emergence of higher education in the United States — tracing the development of academic disciplines, pedagogical trends and institutional finances. They also highlight the history of intellectual life and social and political change at and beyond Harvard. Conjectural restoration of the Indian College, one of Harvard's earliest buildings, by H.
