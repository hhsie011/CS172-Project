The non-degree seeking status allows qualified applicants access to a streamlined process to take a limited number of credit courses. Enrollment for classes in a non-degree seeking status is on a space-available basis. Non-degree students are responsible for meeting any requirements for the class (pre-requisites, co-requisites, etc). Classes reserved for specific degree programs (as noted in the course listing) are not open for non-degree students. We are happy to assist with any questions students may have via email at umnondegree@miami.edu or via phone at 305-284-3889.
