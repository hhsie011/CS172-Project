In addition, we support the development of Florida’s space economy—civil, defense, and commercial. Since 1996, FSI has been an institute of the State University System of Florida. FSI is made up of researchers, educators, and staff from member universities in Florida. FSI research ranges from studying the Earth’s upper atmosphere to the origin of the planets and from the workings of asteroids to propulsion technologies for high-Mach aerospace vehicles. We’re involved in space missions as diverse as high altitude rocket launches, next-gen suborbital flights, the NASA Cassini mission to Saturn, and NASA’s Explorer program. FSI administratively houses the Florida Space Grant Consortium (FSGC) for NASA, and we operate the Space Research Initiative (SRI) for the State of Florida. We welcome your interest in FSI. Whether you are from NASA, a private company or institute, the public, or the scientific community, whether you seek to work with us, go to work for us, fund us, or team in projects, contact us to get started.
