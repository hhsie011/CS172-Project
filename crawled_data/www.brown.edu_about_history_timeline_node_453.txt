This procession of undergraduates in white dresses followed by seniors in cap and gown was an annual event at Pembroke College from 1902 into the 1940s. The tradition of Ivy Day began in 1897, when the graduating class planted a sprig of ivy, sent from Cambridge, England, next to the recently built Pembroke Hall.
