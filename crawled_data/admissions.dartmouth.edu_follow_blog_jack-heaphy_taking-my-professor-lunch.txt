My name is Jack and I am a Sophomore at Dartmouth. I currently plan to major in sociology modified with anthropology, all with a human-centered design minor. Outside of class, I enjoy performing and I'm currently involved in both a student dance group and acapella. I love hiking and running outdoors and have already explored a lot of Dartmouth's surrounding trails. I am also involved in Greek Life, the Student and Presidential Committee for Sexual Assault, and the Inter Fraternity Council.

First Year Click to Open FallOn Campus Favorite Class: SOCY 20: Sex, Death, and Migration This class was an overview on demographic trends across the world, and it's the course that got me interested in my current academic focus! I enjoyed the fact that this class was discussion based, so I was able to engage in conversations about different social factors and relationships that affect population changes in global societies. WinterBoston, MA Favorite Class: THEA 30: Acting 1 I never thought I'd enjoy doing theater online but this class fully exceeded all expectations I had in mind. I was able to learn new techniques and was forced to think about aspects of performance that I never had to worry about when on stage. The technological stage was definitely an interesting hurdle, but it strengthened my abilities as a performer overall. SpringOn Campus Favorite Class: ENVS 28: Global Environmental Health Beside it being my first in-person class at Dartmouth, I have enjoyed the case-based structure of this course. Professor Roebuck delivers the content in small units of environmental health problems, which are all applicable to specific cases and situations. This makes the material extremely interesting and thought-provoking, leading to an incredible class. SummerNew York, NY I spent my summer interning for a theater education company that offered technical skill sessions to teenagers, all taught by industry professionals. I learned a lot more about the ins and outs of the theater industry, due to the immersive setting of the position. Sophomore Year Click to Open FallOn Campus Favorite Class: EARS 14: Meteorology I originally took this class to fulfill my lab distributive requirement, but it ended up proving to be a super interesting course! I have always been fascinated by storms and weather, so learning the processes behind these phenomena and patterns was deeply interesting for me. While I am not planning on studying Earth sciences any further, this specific course was memorable for all the good reasons! WinterOn Campus Favorite Class: SOCY 16: Constructing Social Theory This class was a constant reminder of my love for sociology. Professor Kim was a genuine, kind, excellent professor and lecturer, and all of the material was deeply interesting. Some past classes that are reading-heavy have fallen short in finding invigorating readings that I was actively excited to explore, and I enjoyed every single article and discussion for this course. Exploring contemporary theorists' works, this class was a 10/10. Â« All Posts by this Blogger Taking my Professor to Lunch! Hello everyone, hope you are all doing well. I'm feeling swell after a great Green Key weekend with friends, sitting on a couch in The Cube, one of our student study spaces and resting my legs after a multitude of concerts and fun events. Besides our annual spring weekend celebration-of-music tradition, another highlight of the past week has been a lunch that I went on with my computer science professor. Through Dartmouth's Take A Professor to Lunch program, I was able to enjoy a free meal at a delicious Hanover restaurant while getting to know a prominent figure in my academic life outside the context of a classroom. The program allows for each student to have one free meal a term and is extremely simple. After scheduling a time with the professor of choice, students can get a voucher for the free meal from the Undergraduate Dean's Office. The hardest part of this process for me was having to actually choose which professor to ask for a meal with; I had multiple I was choosing between. I really have liked both my computer science and sociology professors from this term, and I have a long list of all the faculty members that I wanted to talk to during my freshman year, when this program wasn't in operation because of COVID. I ultimately chose my computer science professor, because I felt like her career path was similar to new developing hopes that I have for my own life. After making this decision, I reached out, and the plans were set. The meal itself was immensely more inspiring and engaging than I expected. We sat outside in perfect weather, enjoying the delicious food and getting to know each other on a personal level. I got to hear all about her education, the multitude of positions she's held throughout her career, her entire motivation for teaching at Dartmouth. It was such a unique experience, seeing her in a completely different context. I felt like I was chatting with an acquaintance, catching up about each other's lives. I told her about Charlottesville, my hometown, my interests, hopes, even aspirations. Yet, the most exciting part of the conversation was a discovery that our personal philosophies were much more aligned than expected. I learned that we have similar priorities, motivations, even outlooks on life. This conversation created a newfound bond between the two of us, one that I hope will last for a long time. After the meal, class with this professor felt different. I felt naturally more comfortable and engaged, which was another unexpected outcome. Overall, this experience was incredibly fulfilling and yet another reminder about how the faculty here are so special. Never would I have ever thought that a random professor would care enough about a random student to sit down for an hour and a half and hear about his life, let alone make connections to her own. It's such a supportive feeling, and will definitely be a meal that I will remember for years to come.
