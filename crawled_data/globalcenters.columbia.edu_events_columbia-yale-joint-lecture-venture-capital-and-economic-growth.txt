Date and time: Tuesday, June 30, 2015 at 18:00 Venue: Columbia Global Centers | Istanbul Address: Sıraselviler Cad. No:49 Yeni Hayat Ap. K:2 D:5 Beyoğlu - İstanbul RSVP: Gülden Çolakel, [email protected] Investments in venture capital have plummeted during the recent economic crisis. In the short term, that has made it more difficult for entrepreneurs to raise money, but will it also have longer-term effects on the economy? Professor Sorenson will discuss the critical role that a local venture capital community plays in enabling entrepreneurs, creating jobs and raising incomes. Olav Sorenson is a Frederick Frank '54 and Mary C. Tanner Professor of Management at Yale School of Management. His research interests include economic geography, economic sociology, entrepreneurship, organizational ecology, the sociology and management of science and technology, and business and corporate strategy. His most extensive line of research examines how social networks affect transactions, thereby shaping the geography and evolution of industries. Although Professor Sorenson has investigated these issues in a wide variety of settings, including banking, biotechnology, and footwear manufacturing, he has most extensively studied the entertainment industries and venture capital.
