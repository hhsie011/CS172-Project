This small and intimate service features a special sermon for undergraduate candidates and their guests. The service lasts approximately one hour. Seating in McFarlin Auditorium is limited; therefore, candidates may request two guest tickets. Extra tickets not requested for Baccalaureate are distributed on the stairs in front of McFarlin Auditorium at 4:00 p.m. Please see Request Weekend Tickets for more information. The ceremony is simulcast in the Hughes-Trigg Theater or can be viewed at smu.edu/live. One of the University's most symbolic traditions is Rotunda Passage, which includes both a processional and a recessional. The processional occurs the day before students' first day of classes as new students. Students process through the back of Dallas Hall, through the Rotunda and onto the quad as a new member of the SMU student body. This tradition is concluded with the Rotunda Recessional following the Baccalaureate Service during Commencement Weekend. Undergraduate candidates, led by faculty and alumni marshals, march through the front doors of Dallas Hall, through the Rotunda and around to the quad. Rotunda Recessional is a symbolic departure from campus and serves as a welcome to the newest members of the SMU alumni family. Alumni who are parents of graduating seniors are welcome to participate as marshals for Baccalaureate. Please contact Matt Hunt at mehunt@smu.edu. Guests with limited mobility attending the Baccalaureate service on Friday, May 13 may park behind McFarlin Auditorium in the M Lot. A current state-issued disabled parking placard and/or license plate is needed. Otherwise, guests may be dropped off by McFarlin Auditorium on Boaz Lane and drivers can park in any SMU parking garage. Residential Commons Graduation Receptions Residential Commons Graduation Receptions Saturday, May 14 All celebrations for graduating seniors, both those residing in the commons or alumni of the commons, are held immediately following the All-University Commencement outside their respective Residential Common.
