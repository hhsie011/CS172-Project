The Clemson TIGERS Advance program is the result of a comprehensive institutional assessment of the barriers that hinder the recruitment, advancement and retention of Clemson’s women and other underrepresented minority faculty; a thorough assessment of Clemson’s history, culture and climate; an extensive review of lessons learned from other ADVANCE institutions around the country; and the tight integration of social science research with project activities to inform and support institutional transformation.
