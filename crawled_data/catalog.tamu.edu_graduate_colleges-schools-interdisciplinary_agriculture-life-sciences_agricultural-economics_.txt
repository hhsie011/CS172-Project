Nayga, Jr., PhD Graduate Advisor: D. J. Leatham, PhD The Department of Agricultural Economics engages people in the use of economic analysis for making decisions involving agribusiness (including food and fiber production, supplying inputs, processing products and marketing), natural resources and communities. Students are taught to develop their leadership, analytical and communication skills. Disciplinary research and graduate education enhance the use of economic principles and research methods in solving economic problems facing society. Applied research programs emphasize the analysis of business and public policy issues. In planning a student’s program, the need for broad training, rather than narrow specialization, is recognized. Students (regardless of their primary interests) are encouraged to take not only advanced courses covering various fields within the department but also essential supporting courses in other departments. Students are expected to acquire a knowledge of economic theory, its application to contemporary agricultural production, agribusiness and resource problems, and the ability to employ analytical techniques in making policy and business decisions. The teaching and research activities are grouped broadly as follows: agribusiness management and finance, production economics, markets and trade, policy analysis, and resource economics. The present and expanding program of research in the department affords the student a wide choice and capable guidance in thesis or dissertation research. Master of Science (MS) and Master of Agribusiness (MAB) degrees are offered. MS students may choose between the thesis option (recommended for those students who plan to go on for further graduate studies) and the non-thesis option. Students who choose the MS non-thesis option take a greater number of courses. The Master of Agribusiness degree program is non-thesis, interdisciplinary and jointly administered by the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and the Mays Business School. This professional curriculum is designed to provide a broad preparation for economic, financial and marketing analysis of agribusiness, food and fiber industry decisions. The PhD program concentrates on the theory, quantitative tools and methodology required of the professional applied economist. Field areas offered within the PhD program include: Markets and Information Economics, Resource and Environmental Economics and Policy and Trade. A PhD in Agribusiness and Managerial Economics is also offered by the Intercollegiate Faculty of Agribusiness. No foreign language is required for students pursuing any of our PhD programs. For more information about program requirements and employment opportunities, contact the department’s graduate office.
