Magazine Outreach Ways to Give Clemson Home College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences Current: Students Student Enrichment Beyond the Classroom The skills needed for the future go beyond what is learned in the classroom. It's about developing ideas, problem-solving, communicating, and working with a diverse group of individuals and talents. Whether you want to work with engineering simulations, participate in app development, or join a professional development organization, there are many opportunities to get involved. Clubs & Organizations Leadership Programs intro-arrow Study Abroad Clemson engineering students have a variety of opportunities to travel abroad and be exposed to unique cultures and customs. In addition, ongoing projects allow students to apply practical knowledge to hands-on experiences while making contributions to the living conditions of those who don't have access to things we take for granted. We encourage all CECAS students to accept the challenge and make a difference by getting involved and growing through these rewarding international project opportunities. CECAS Abroad Global Engagement Research The University has adopted an academic plan that identifies eight areas in which it will conduct innovative research and encourage economic development. As a result, Clemson is a thriving place for research, building nationally recognized programs in advanced materials, automotive and transportation technology, biotechnology, biomedical sciences, family and community living, general education, information and communications technology, leadership, and entrepreneurship, and sustainable environment.
