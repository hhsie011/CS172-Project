What is Black Feminist Thought? Why Black Feminist Thought? And just whom is Black Feminist Thought for? This course considers the disciplinary formations and political happenings of Black Feminist Thought in the United States—from its role in the university department to its presence on the ground. Highlighting interlocking issues related to gender, sexuality, race, and economics, we will mine political speeches, visual art, live performance, literature, and theoretical discourse. Period: L; Dist:SOC; WCult:CI; Remote, with synchronous content. WGSS 66.06 Bodies and Technologies in Asian American Popular Cultures with Professor Najwa Mayer. From film, TV, and social media to the fringe punk scenes in between, this course explores the popular cultures of contemporary "Asian America." By centering the bodies/embodied practices and technologies that produce Asian American popular cultures, we will ask historical questions about representation, power, and access, all with close attention to moving categories of race, gender, sexuality, class, and trans/nationalism. Ultimately, popular cultures—the critical, the joyful, and the terrible—will be our guide. Period: ARR; Dist:ART; WCult:CI; Remote, with synchronous content.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Program in Women's, Gender, &amp; Sexuality Studies Undergraduate Overview Major Modified Major Minor Honors Program Honors Thesis Guidelines Past Honors Theses Courses Previous Terms Associated Courses Independent Study Transfer Credit Alumni Stories Tell Us Your News Research Overview Gender Research Institute at Dartmouth Resources News & Events News & Events Annual Stonewall Lecture Past Lecture Series People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
