Graduate Programs Minors Faculty The Department of Agricultural Economics at Oklahoma State University offers programs of study leading to the BS, MS, MAg and PhD degrees in Agricultural Economics and the BS and MAg degree in Agribusiness. Agricultural economics and agribusiness curricula study the economic relationships among individuals, firms and service agencies in agriculture and between the agricultural sector and other sectors of the economy. The department’s courses emphasize the economic issues and concepts associated with producing, processing, marketing, and consuming agricultural goods and services and those used in the industry. Undergraduate programs in Agricultural Economics and Agribusiness combine instruction in technical agricultural sciences with education in the application of economic and business management principles and tools. The agricultural economist or agribusiness person draws upon the physical and social sciences to outline, understand and solve economic problems created by agriculture’s dynamic operating environment. Curricula in the Department of Agricultural Economics emphasize the decision-making and problem-solving skills used in the management of agricultural production and marketing firms. Study in agricultural economics or agribusiness prepares students to excel in many challenging careers. Many graduates work to improve food production and processing throughout the world. Other graduates work with government policies that affect the food and fiber sector. Others assist rural communities to adjust and thrive in the rapidly changing world. Graduates also help protect and maintain natural resources and the environment for the greatest benefit of society. Many graduates choose career paths that lead them far from the farm; and others choose to return to family businesses. Agricultural Economics The Agricultural Economics BS degree trains students to analyze problems and make decisions using a solid framework of economic, business, mathematical and statistical principles. Students may tailor study to a wide variety of career interests. The Agricultural Economics degree plan emphasizes in quantitative studies including calculus and statistical methods. The degree prepares students for graduate study in agricultural economics or related fields or for a variety of employment opportunities at competitive salaries in private industry and government agencies that require more quantitative skills. Agribusiness The Agribusiness BS degree trains students to analyze problems and make decisions using a solid framework of economic and business principles. In addition, the agribusiness degree targets the skills needed for careers in agribusiness firms, including all areas of food and fiber production, processing and marketing. Students may choose from nine degree options: Farm and Ranch Management, Crop and Soil Science, International, Pre-Law, Pre-Veterinary Business Management, Natural Resources, and Community and Regional Analysis, or a double major with Agricultural Communications or Accounting. Agribusiness students also may develop a minor area of study or other double major by selecting various course electives.

Both thesis and non-thesis options are available at the MS level. PhD students complete a teaching practicum in addition to the research thesis as a part of the degree requirements. The graduate program stresses development of superior professional competence, suited to the demands of the modern business, academic, government and research environments. Advanced courses concentrate on economic analysis applied to problems of production, distribution and consumption of agricultural products. Courses in economic theory, econometrics, mathematical programming and statistics are an integral part of the program. Primary data analysis, natural resource use, international trade, planning, policy and development are also important topics included in graduate courses. The faculty provide direction and individual guidance to student research in marketing, production, management of agricultural enterprises, demand and price analysis, land and water use and development, non-market valuation, rural development and planning, agricultural finance, international trade, farm appraisal, agricultural policy, econometrics and experimental economics. Students specialize through course electives and research topics. In addition, an advisory committee guides each student in preparing the program of study to ensure that the student's background, graduate coursework, and research program together lead to the desired depth and breadth of proficiency. Admission Requirements Prerequisites to advanced training in agricultural economics are: the desire to understand and solve the complex and changing economic problems faced by agriculture and rural society, and the desire and ability to learn methods of rigorous logical analysis. In addition, differential calculus, statistics and intermediate macro- and micro-economic theory constitute a minimum background for advanced study in agricultural economics. In certain cases, a student can take part of this work after admission but the work will not count toward a graduate degree. Acceptance by an advisor in the department is not required prior to admission to the departmental graduate program. GRE test scores are required for admission to the program.
