Student Resources Spring 2020 Hours (Jan 21 - May 14) *In light of the changes made on campus, KNES Academic Advising has also made steps to safely administer advising. Starting March 17th, we will NO LONGER ACCEPT APPOINTMENTS and IN-PERSON ADVISING. We have temporarily disabled our scheduling system. We highly encourage students to take precautions to receive advising virtually, so you may still contact your advisor via email with questions. Emailing Advisors: Email YOUR DESIGNATED ADVISOR ONLY! We will have a large influx of emails, so emailing 2 advisors will severely delay our responses. Last names starting in A - M: Email Julia Cappelli at jcappelli@fullerton.edu Last Names starting in N - Z: Email Sarah Hamamoto at skhamamoto@fullerton.edu A TDA MUST BE ATTACHED to your email. NO TDA, NO RESPONSE. Be clear, concise, and detailed with your questions. If you wish to have a more in-depth conversation, please email us to set up a phone appointment. Please follow Steps 1-3 above and then include your phone number and best times to call. We are currently working on launching our Youtube Channel with quick videos to address more common questions for your convenience. Because no one wants to write an email if they don't have to....stay tuned!
