Education Specialist, Miami University M.S. School Psychology, Miami University B.S. Psychology, Ohio University A little about me... Hi! I was born and raised in Athens, Ohio. I started my studies in Athens at Ohio University where I completed my bachelor’s in psychology. Then, I completed graduate school at Miami University where I studied school psychology. School psychology is a blend of education, mental health, and various other factors related to student support in K-12. Prior to joining the UHP team at the University of Cincinnati, I was a school psychologist at a nearby school district. I transitioned into higher education to gain new perspective and become part of a student-oriented department focused on individualized learning, reflection, and growth. I’m excited to witness that growth in and outside of the honors program. If you’re one of my students, I can’t wait to hear about who you are, what brings you to UC, and where you want to go! In my free time, I love to tap into my creative side and work with clay. I also enjoy quality time with my family and friends. For fun, I enjoy baking, coffee shops, reality tv, walks with my dog, and going anywhere by the ocean. I am currently advising students in the Linder College of Business. Please stop by to say hello! I’d love to hear about how you’re doing and how I can support you. Ask me about... My dog, Jax Creating earrings with clay My current go-to coffee order What podcast I’m listening to Self-care The same light you see in others is shining within you, too.
