The department also sponsors graduate programs leading to the Ph.D Degree in Sanskrit track, and (jointly with the Department of History) Ancient History. Classics faculty teach courses at all levels in the cultures of ancient Greece and Rome, ranging from the beginnings through the medieval and Byzantine periods, as well as in Sanskrit and Modern Greek. Since Classics is an inherently multi-disciplinary field, students are encouraged to take courses in related areas of study, such as Art History,Archaeology, Comparative Literature, Egyptology and West Asian Studies, History, Philosophy, Political Science, and Religious Studies, and in related programs such as Early Cultures and Medieval Studies.
