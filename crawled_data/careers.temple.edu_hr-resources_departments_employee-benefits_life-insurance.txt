The insurance plan includes basic life insurance, additional life insurance, survivor insurance, and accidental death and dismemberment. Basic Life Insurance The university provides a no-contributory basic life insurance plan. The plan amount varies, depending upon the employee’s job classification and/or any applicable collective bargaining agreement in effect. Additional Life Insurance Eligible employees may elect additional life insurance in the amounts of 1.5, 2 or 3 times their annual base salary. The aggregate total amount of basic and supplemental life insurance is subject to a maximum value. Employees pay the full cost of this additional insurance with rates based on age. If additional life insurance is elected within 31 days of date of hire, there is no requirement to produce medical evidence of insurability. Election of additional life insurance after the 31 days require evidence of medical insurability. Survivor Insurance Employees enrolled in additional life insurance may also enroll in survivor insurance. The plan provides additional income to the spouse and children in the event of the death of the employee. Accidental Death and Dismemberment Eligible employees may elect to enroll in accidental death and dismemberment (AD&D) insurance coverage. AD&D coverage amounts range from $10,000 to $150,000, and employees may enroll or change coverage elections effective the first of any month, with no medical evidence required. Coverage is available for employees only or employees plus their dependents. If dependent coverage is elected, the employee’s spouse is covered for one-fifth of the face value of the policy; children are covered for one-tenth.
