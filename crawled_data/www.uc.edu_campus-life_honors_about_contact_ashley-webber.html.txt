Criminal Justice, Xavier University B.S.B.A. Management, Xavier University A little about me... Hello! I advise students in the College of Education, Criminal Justice and Human Services. In addition to advising, I manage our advising team and oversee the Gateway curriculum and implementation for first year and transition students. Please make an appointment via My Bearcat Network or stop by to let me know what is going on in your life and how I can help. Born and raised in Cincinnati, I received my undergraduate degree from Xavier University and my master’s degree from the University of Cincinnati. After working at a non-profit in Northern Kentucky, I became part of Lindner Career Services in the Lindner College of Business. I spent several years in this role helping students showcase their accomplishments and teaching them how to articulate their personal brands to receive co-ops, internships and full-time work experiences. Some of my greatest teachers came from outside of the classroom and I hope to be in that same position for students here at the university. Away from work, I spend time with my husband and two children, travel, and read. Ask me about... My children, Parker and Blair My passion for college football and basketball What book I recently read How to leverage your honors experiences on a resume or in an interview You can never be overdressed or overeducated.
