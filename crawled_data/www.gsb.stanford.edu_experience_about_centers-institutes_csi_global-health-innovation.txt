But tackling the needs of patients and health care providers in underserved communities – in the United States and around the world – is especially difficult. The idiosyncrasies of the health care sector, the contextual barriers found in resource-constrained environments, and the already difficult-to-implement innovation process make entrepreneurship in this sector time-consuming, expensive, and risky. The COVID-19 pandemic underscored and exacerbated these challenges. From India, to Africa, to parts of the US, lower-resource communities were deprived of adequate access to essential health technologies including diagnostic testing, oxygen therapy, and vaccinations. Reimagining global health has never been more important. To support the efforts of entrepreneurs from around the world to improve the health of the world’s poor in this critical moment in time, we are highlighting the work of Stanford’s Global Health Consortium for Innovation, Design, Evaluation, and Action (C-IDEA). Funded by NIH grant 1 RC4 TW008781-01, researchers at Stanford spent ~18 months capturing lessons in global health innovation. The resulting case studies, organized into six interrelated categories focus on the successful design and commercialization of healthcare innovation products and services.
