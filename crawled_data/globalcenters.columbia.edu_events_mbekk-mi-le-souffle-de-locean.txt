Production: France. Filmed in Senegal. Languages: Wolof and French. Subtitles in French and English. Mbëkk mi, two words of Wolof which evoke clandestine emigration. The expression echoes like the pirogues which hurl themselves against the ocean waves and which are often wrecked at the end of their journey. If these young Senegalese men in their prime pit themselves against so many perils, it is in the hope of finding a better life. But what happens on the other side of this disaster? The “wretched of the sea” leave their loved ones behind— their wives, their mothers, their sisters. It is their unique, moving and dignified voices, which are heard in this intimate documentary: women’s voices that we never hear. Part of the film series : "Filmer à la frontière : migrer vers l'Europe aujourd'hui" MBËKK MI, le souffle de l'océan (un film soutenu par Images en Bibliothèques) Un documentaire écrit et réalisé par Sophie Bachelier. 67 minutes, 2013. Production: France. Filmé au Sénégal. Langues: wolof et français, sous-titré en français et anglais. SYNOPSIS FR Mbëkk mi, deux mots wolof qui évoquent l’émigration clandestine. L’expression claque comme ces pirogues qui se cognent aux vagues de l’océan et se fracassent souvent au bout de leur errance. Si ces jeunes Sénégalais dans la force de l’âge affrontent mille périls, c’est dans l’espoir d’une vie meilleure. Mais que se passe-t-il de l’autre côté du désastre ? Les "damnés de la mer" laissent derrière eux des êtres chers. Des épouses. Des mères. Des soeurs. Ce sont leurs voix singulières, bouleversantes et retenues que l’on entend dans ce documentaire intime, des voix de femmes que l’on n’entend jamais. Mbëkk Mi a reçu la mention spéciale du Jury Anna Politovskaïa du festival de films de femmes de Créteil et du Val de Marne, 2013,un film soutenu par Images en Bibliothèques RSVP Upcoming Events Columbia Global CentersAmman / Beijing / Istanbul / Mumbai / Nairobi / Paris / Rio / Santiago / Tunis Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
