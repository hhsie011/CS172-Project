Agriculture Animals Applied Economics Biology Climate Change Communication Environment Food Global Development Health + Nutrition Plants Breadcrumb Home Diversity & Inclusion Department and Unit Efforts Department and Unit Efforts Leaders for Diversity and Inclusion As of August 2020, every academic department and many programs within CALS have appointed Leaders for Diversity and Inclusion (also called LDIs) to ensure that diversity, equity and inclusion activities are centered in all unit activities. The LDIs work closely with other unit leaders to review unit processes for faculty hiring and graduate admissions to ensure best practices as established by the CALS Office for Diversity and Inclusion. The LDIs are tasked with developing strategic plans for diversity and inclusion for their departments, forming diversity committees and leading those in the process of developing goals and action plans with appropriate monitoring and impact evaluation. Service by a Leader for Diversity and Inclusion counts significantly toward tenure and promotion and those individuals are included as key members of unit leadership groups. The Diversity Leads Council supports training in diversity, equity and inclusion and builds a network for communication and collaboration across the college. Below, see the LDIs for each CALS unit and related diversity, equity and inclusion department and unit webpages.
