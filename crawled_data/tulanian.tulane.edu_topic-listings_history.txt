In his story, Isaacson writes about his experience being in a clinical trial for the COVID-19 vaccine, how the COVID-19 vaccines by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech were developed and the role of mRNA. “The plague year of 2020 will be remembered as the time when these traditional vaccines were supplanted by something fundamentally new: genetic vaccines, which deliver a gene or piece of genetic code into human cells,” he wrote.https://tulane.it/walter-isaacson-time-2021 history Walter Isaacson, history professor “By shining a light on gene editing, the Nobel committee is bringing a needed awareness of the wonders of nature — and of the technology that will increasingly determine how nature works.”https://tulane.it/Walter-Isaacson-nyt-2020 history Andy Horowitz, History Professor “Most accounts of Katrina begin when the levees broke and conclude not long after.

The result can be either efficient immigration processing or a prolonged, confined and traumatic experience,” said Lipman.https://tulane.it/refugee-camps-time history Bibi Gaston: Landscape Architect & Author Bibi Gaston’s (NC ’81) love of nature led her down one path: After Tulane, she studied landscape architecture at the University of Virginia. history Deep Dive in the Jazz Archive New Orleans jazz is a living, breathing, evolving force, but its origins in the early 20th century require special preservation.
