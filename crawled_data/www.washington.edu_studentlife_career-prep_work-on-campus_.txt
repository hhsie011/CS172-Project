Where to find student jobs Handshake is a recruiting platform enabling students and alumni to connect with a network of employers searching for employees and interns. Other departments post positions on their own websites. Check out the Student Employment handout for a listing of common campus employers. Making the most of your student job How will you talk about your student work experience? We created the Husky Experience Toolkit for Student Employees to help you articulate the value of your on-campus job, so you can learn how to effectively share out your skills. What qualifies me to work on campus and how many hours should I expect? In order to work on campus, you need to be an undergraduate enrolled in at least six credits, a graduate or professional student enrolled in four credits or a Ph.D. candidate working on a dissertation (two credits). Students 18 years of age and older are limited to working 19.5 hours per week when classes are in session, and may work more than 19.5 hours per week during school breaks. Learn more about official UW policy on student employment. Are you a manager of student employees? You can find more information about working with student employees on our Resources for Managers of Student Employees page which includes a tool-kit of templates and guides to support you.
