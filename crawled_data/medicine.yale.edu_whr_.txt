Precise, effective medicine focuses on each individual’s biology, psychology, and medical history. This means understanding our unique needs to develop more inclusive treatments. Women’s Health Research at Yale incorporates the study of women and the influence of sex and gender in science and medicine. We bring together Yale faculty from diverse fields. We respond to health questions women face and discover sex/gender differences that benefit all. We train the next generation of researchers and clinicians committed to improving the health of women. And we collaborate in advancing health policy. Learn more about how we're shaping the future of research.
