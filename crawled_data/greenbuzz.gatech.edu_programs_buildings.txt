This document is unique to the Institute and guides architects and engineers in the process of designing new buildings, building additions, and renovations to existing buildings, and incorporating utility and transportation infrastructure improvements. Many buildings have visible sustainability features: The Clough Undergraduate Learning Commons is topped with more than 300 solar panels and a green roof garden and the Campus Recreation Center boasts a large photovoltaic solar array. Out of sight, a network of underground cisterns captures water to flush toilets in both Clough Commons and the Engineered Biosystems Building. Georgia Tech also boasts an award-winning Green Cleaning Program for its campus facilities and initiatives that engage students within the Department of Housing.
