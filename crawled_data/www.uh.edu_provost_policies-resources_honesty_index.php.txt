Academic Honesty Policy Overview Instructor Role in the Process Waiver of Departmental Hearing Departmental Hearing Process College Hearing Process Resources Overview High ethical standards are critical to the integrity of any institution, and bear directly on the ultimate value of conferred degrees. All UH community members are expected to contribute to an atmosphere of the highest possible ethical standards. Maintaining such an atmosphere requires that any instances of academic dishonesty be recognized and addressed. The UH Academic Honesty Policy is designed to handle those instances with fairness to all parties involved: the students, the instructors, and the University itself. All students and faculty of the University of Houston are responsible for being familiar with this policy. The official University of Houston Academic Honesty Policy appears in the Undergraduate and Graduate Catalogs.
