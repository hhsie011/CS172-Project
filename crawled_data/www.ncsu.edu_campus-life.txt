Gorgeous, traditional architecture meets leading-edge, futuristic structures. (It’s a combination you won’t see at any other university in the area.) See where our students spend their time. When it’s time to hit the books, our students head to one of the coolest — and most high-tech — college libraries in the nation: Hunt Library. With an innovation studio, a data experience lab, a makerspace and more, D.H. Hill Jr. Library on our main campus is all about hands-on learning. Our Centennial Campus is one of the premier public-private research parks in North America, so you’ll learn alongside world-leading companies and in cutting-edge research labs. Located on Centennial, the College of Engineering’s Fitts-Woolard Hall is set to become one of the world’s most dynamic research and education environments. Our 82,000-square-foot Wellness and Recreation Center houses indoor and outdoor training areas, a climbing center, teaching kitchens and state-of-the-art equipment. (And it’s free to all NC State students.) The physical and emotional health of our students matters to us. If you need a checkup or a check-in, Student Health Services and our Counseling Center provide accessible and affordable care on campus. Our community comes together at Talley Student Union. It’s the ultimate destination for snacks, study sessions and events. And there are five stories of workspaces and student organizations to explore.
