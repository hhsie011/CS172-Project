As the central office of language assessment and language instruction at the University of Cincinnati, the Center for English as a Second Language (CESL) is responsible for assessing the oral English proficiency of international visiting scholars and providing them with language instruction. There are two components in the Oral English Proficiency Test for Visiting Scholars (OEPT-VS): conversational and professional sections. Conversational section consists of questions that can stimulate daily English language use (all applicants need to complete this section) Professional section has two options for applicants to choose from based on the focus/purpose of their visit: research focus and teaching focus (applicants can complete one of the options within this section based on their professional requirement) For each component of the test, candidates will watch a video with the prompt and instructions to prepare for their responses. Candidates need to video record their responses. It is suggested that candidates should not read or recite from the script. Evaluation: The evaluation of applicants video responses will follow a standardized rubric for assessing oral English proficiency and conducted by professionals with expertise in language assessment. There will be three types of evaluation results: Passing - applicants achieving a score of 3 or above (out of 4) of the test are eligible to visit Conditional Passing - applicants achieving a score between 2.5-2.99 (out of 4) of the test are eligible to visit on condition that they must register for an assigned ESL course during their visit Denying - applicants achieving a score below 2.5 are not eligible to visit OEPR-VS Score (out of 4) Result 3-4 Pass Eligible to visit 2.5-2.99 Conditional pass Must take ESL7011 WHILE VISITING 2.49 or below Fail Not eligible to visit Score Report: Applicants' video responses will be evaluated by two trained evaluators based on the above rubric. The result will be sent to the applicants and their host department as the English proficiency documentation for applicants' J-1 application. How Do I Pay For The Test?
