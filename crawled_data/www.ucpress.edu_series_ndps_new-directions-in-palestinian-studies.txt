Works that integrate comparative and global perspectives are especially welcome. The series is open to a wide range of approaches to the study of Palestine and the Palestinians including, but not limited to, the fields of history, anthropology, literature, political economy, sociology, religious studies, international relations, post-colonial studies, environmental studies, visual culture, and media studies. The series does not accept unrevised doctoral dissertations or awards contracts in advance of submission of a completed manuscript. SUBMISSION PROCESS: We are currently accepting submissions for this series on a rolling basis.

ABOUT THE SERIES: New Directions in Palestinian Studies is a new series to be published through UC Press’s open access platform, Luminos, and in conjunction with the New Directions in Palestinian Studies research initiative of Brown University’s Middle East Studies Program. Books in the series will be made available as free e-books as well as an affordable paperback edition. Luminos is University of California Press’s open access publishing program for monographs. With the same high standards for selection, peer review, production and marketing as our traditional program, Luminos is a transformative model, built as a partnership where costs and benefits are shared. Over the past generation, the field of Palestine and Palestinians studies has grown rapidly, attracting some of the best and brightest scholars. NDPS, launched in 2012 by Beshara Doumani, promotes innovative and rigorous knowledge production in this field with a focus on emerging scholars through an annual thematic workshop, an endowed post-doctoral fellowship, this book series, and the Mahmoud Darwish Chair in Palestinian Studies.
