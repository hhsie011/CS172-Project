Post-baccalaureate applicants to the Cullen College of Engineering must meet the transfer admission requirements for students who have earned 30 or more semester hours of college credit. Current UH Students If you are currently enrolled or have recently graduated within the past 13 months, submitting an admissions application is not required for a Post-Baccalaureate program.
