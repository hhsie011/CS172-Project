Instructional activities include courses taught, research completed, advising, administrative support and public service. FAS data is reported to the Florida Board of Governors and is also used for internal processes including the annual faculty Teaching Incentive Program (TIP) awards. Each UCF department is assigned to a designated contact who is responsible for entering all relevant data on behalf of the employees in their department. If you are a departmental contact that needs access to FAS or would like to request training, please contact fassupport@ucf.edu.
