The university enrolls more than 28,000 students across five campuses, including the KU Medical Center's three locations, and fulfills it mission in conjunction with affiliate organizations such as Kansas Athletics, KU Endowment, and KU Alumni Association. KU Revenues Twenty years ago, state appropriations made up 34 percent of KU's revenues. Since then, state funding for higher education has declined dramatically, and today state funding comprises only 18 percent of KU's revenues. This has created upward pressure on tuition and fees, which are now KU's largest source of revenue.
