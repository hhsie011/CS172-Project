We wanted to see if something in people’s conversations reveals when they click,” says first author Emma Templeton, Guarini ’23, a graduate student in psychological and brain sciences. “Our results show that the faster people respond to each other, the more connected they feel.” Quote Our results show that the faster people respond to each other, the more connected they feel. Attribution Emma Templeton, Guarini ’23, graduate student in psychological and brain sciences The research consisted of three studies. The first examined response time and social connection between strangers. Sixty-six participants took part in 10 conversations—each with a different conversation partner of the same gender. They could discuss any topic of their choosing and their conversation was videotaped. After it was over, participants watched the video playback and rated how connected they felt moment by moment throughout the dialogue. Conversations with faster response times correlated with feelings of greater social connection. To determine if this result also applied to close friends, members of the first study and their close friends were invited to have conversations in a second study. Although close friends rated their conversations more favorably overall than strangers, the response time data were similar—faster response times in friend conversations also predicted moments of greater social connection. Do outside observers also use response times to infer when two people “click?” To test this, respondents from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, a crowdsourcing workforce marketplace, listened to audio clips of conversations for which the response times had been manipulated to be faster, slower or the original speed, the control condition. Consistent with the results from the earlier two studies, outside observers thought two speakers were more connected when their conversations contained faster, rather than slower, response times. Because these conversation clips were identical except for response times, the study demonstrates that response times alone are a powerful signal of social connection, according to the senior author of the study, Thalia Wheatley, the Lincoln Filene Professor in Human Relations. “It’s well-established that, on average, there’s about a quarter of a second gap between turns during a conversation. Our study is the first to look at how meaningful that gap is, in terms of connection,” says Wheatley, the principal investigator of the Dartmouth Social Systems Laboratory. “When people feel like they can almost finish each other’s sentences, they close that 250-millisecond gap, and that’s when two people are clicking.” Luke Chang, assistant professor of psychological and brain sciences; Elizabeth A. Reynolds ’18; and Marie Cone LeBeaumont ’22, a research assistant in the Dartmouth Social Systems Laboratory, served as co-authors of the study.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences Undergraduate Overview Psychology Major Minor Major & Minor FAQs Honors Honors FAQs Neuroscience Major Minor Major & Minor FAQs Honors Honors FAQs Curriculum Transfer and AP Credit Courses and Syllabi Introductory Intermediate Topics Labs Independent Research Course Syllabi (ID login required) Permission Courses Request Form Fall 2022 Winter 2023 Spring 2023 Resources Graduate Graduate Program in Psychological and Brain Sciences Research Areas Coursework and Curriculum Mentoring Toolkit Resources Current Graduate Students Graduate Admissions Admissions FAQs Our Graduates Recent Dissertations Research Overview Recent Research Findings Facilities Undergraduate Research Post-Doctoral Fellows Post-Doctoral Opportunities Participate in Experiments 2021 Honors Student Thesis Presentations (ID Login Required) 2022 Honors Student Thesis Presentations (ID Login Required) Community Diversity Suggestions For Current PBS Community (ID Login Required) News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
