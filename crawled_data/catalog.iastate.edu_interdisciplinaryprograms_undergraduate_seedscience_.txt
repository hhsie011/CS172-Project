Seed Science must be taken as a secondary major in conjunction with a primary major. The seed science program is designed for students with career interests in one or more aspects of the seed industry. Areas of study focus on seeds including production, conditioning, pathology, physiology, quality control, marketing, and seed plant designs. Student Learning Outcomes Upon graduation, students should be able to: Demonstrate understanding of the science and principles of seed production systems, including seed quality assessment and conditioning, and clearly communicate the importance of seeds to our society. Articulate the opportunities in the seed industry for seed-related careers. Apply seed science and technology knowledge for solving seed quality and production problems encountered in the seed industry.
