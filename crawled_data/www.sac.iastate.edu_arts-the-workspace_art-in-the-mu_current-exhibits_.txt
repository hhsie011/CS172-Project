In her Artist’s Statement McGinnis explains, “I find great freedom in using the visual language of shape, form, color, and line to create a composition independent from visual references in the world and completely free to interpretation.” An exhibit reception will be held on Sunday, June 12 from 2-4pm with an opportunity to meet the artist. Experience improvisational interpretations of McGinnis’ paintings by Mike Giles, Professor of Saxophone and Director of Jazz Studies at Iowa State, as you stroll through the Gallery. The Iowa State Memorial Union is located at 2229 Lincoln Way in Ames on the ISU campus and paid parking is available in the ramp adjacent to the building. The Art Gallery is located on the 1st floor and has free admission. Hours are Monday through Friday from 10am-2pm and Sunday from 1-4pm. Connect with us!
