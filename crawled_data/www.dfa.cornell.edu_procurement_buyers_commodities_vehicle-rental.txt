For this purpose, the university has established pricing agreements with the following suppliers for the rental of passenger vehicles. All corporate pricing includes collision and liability insurances as required by Cornell Risk Management and Insurance for all vehicle rentals. The agreements are also available for personal use with applicable sales taxes added. Note: The collision and liability insurance coverage applies only to Cornell business travel. When using the Cornell discount for personal travel, you are responsible for purchasing insurance as the Cornell collision and liability insurance does not cover personal travel. Cornell has negotiated rates for hybrid vehicles with our rental suppliers, and Cornell Fleet Services has hybrid cars available for rental. Rule of thumb is that business travel that exceeds 100 miles should incorporate renting a car versus using your own car. Insurance is included in the rate. For insurance coverage on international vehicle rentals, please check eligibility with the Cornell University contract administrator. Certain countries are excluded from contract coverage. For additional questions regarding this contract, or for help in placing and processing orders with following suppliers, contact Jay Porter.

Non-Preferred Car Rental Vendors If the Cornell vendors are not available – or a lower rate is available – other car rental agencies may be used for corporate rentals, but the Cornell corporate card must be used, and liability insurance must be accepted. The renter should consult with Cornell Risk Management first to find what other insurances should be accepted.
