Rankings Virtual Visit About Us PACE Curriculum What does it take to have a meaningful career in business? Our graduates in executive positions at leading companies say that success is primarily driven by who you are and how you act. Accordingly, we focus on the development of each student's Professionalism, Academics, Character, and Engagement (PACE), to ensure they can successfully pursue the personal and career goals they are passionate about. At Lindner, business is more than a major. It's a behavior. Professionalism Team meetings. Video conferences. Emails. Presentations. The modern workday demands that employees navigate many types of communication and interaction. Real-world learning opportunities like the Lindner Fast Track and Lindner Professional Experience ensure that our students learn the professional communication skills they need to excel in the conference room and the boardroom, virtually or face-to-face. Lindner's emphasis on professionalism benefits students in a variety of ways: Lindner co-op students earn an average of $41,000 before graduation. Lindner students who intern or co-op full-time earn an average salary of $9,728 per semester. Our students go on to fulfilling careers at organizations ranging from Procter & Gamble to the United Way to their own entities. Academics Our students are distinct individuals with unique goals and interests. That's why our curriculum ensures that students have a foundational understanding of the key business functions, but the majority of each student's academic plan is fully customizable. We have a breadth of majors and minors to choose from, and students can augment in-class learning with cooperative education, internships, and international study experiences of their choosing. The Lindner College of Business has repeatedly been named one of the best business schools in the United States by U.S. News & World Report, Bloomberg Businessweek, and The Princeton Review. For more rankings information, visit our rankings page. Character Character means having the strength and conviction to lead and work with teams made up of people with diverse backgrounds and differing viewpoints. Lindner students build these skills through hands-on, collaborative projects, often working with Cincinnati businesses. Business is global, and learning from diverse cultures is vital. At Lindner, study abroad is a top priority. Our international options range from week-long programs to entire terms abroad, with multiple options in between. Explore Latin America, Asia, or Europe, or visit a different continent each year. It's your choice, and we want you to take full advantage. The Lindner student body also includes students from over 40 countries around the world. A Lindner education prepares students for the moments when philosophical questions become real-world dilemmas through ethics seminars, global experiences, and leadership opportunities. Engagement Your life and your career will be comprised of more than just work. Community service, citizenship, and organizational involvement are all key components of personal growth. We empower students to get involved in the things they care about via the 20-plus student organizations within the Lindner College of Business, the 300-plus organizations within the University of Cincinnati, and ongoing partnerships with service organizations like the United Way of Greater Cincinnati.
