Rani Elwy is Founding Director of the Implementation Science Core in the Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior. She is also Co-Director of Implementation Science in the Biomedical Informatics Core of the Advance Clinical and Translation Research (Advance-CTR) at Brown. In these roles, Dr. Elwy provides consultation on implementation science proposals, develops and conducts seminars and workshops each semester on critical topics in dissemination and implementation science, and serves as PI/Site PI or Co-Investigator on a variety of grants funded by NIH, PCORI, VA and CDC. She also serves as Implementation Scientist in the Biobehavioral Sciences Core of the Providence/Boston Center for AIDS Research (CFAR). Dr. Elwy is an active mentor to many PhD students, postdoctoral fellows, and early career faculty members seeking to build careers in implementation science. In 2021, Dr. Elwy was elected to fellowship in the Society of Behavioral Medicine. Dr. Elwy serves as Multiple Principal Investigator (MPI) on a newly-funded Evidence, Policy, and Implementation Center (EBP 22-104), which is tasked with building capacity for moving evidence into practice across the VA healthcare system. She is also MPI of the Bridge QUERI (implementation science) Program (QUE 20-017), a 5-year P30-like grant, supported by 4 Cores, consisting of three Hybrid Type 3 effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trials taking place across 18 sites, which aim to improve health outcomes associated with mental health and substance use disorder by expanding access to and engagement in overdose prevention, treatment, and supportive services for Veterans most impacted by social determinants of health. Dr. Elwy leads the Bridge QUERI Implementation Science Core, and co-leads the Mentoring Core and Rapid Response Team (RRT). In 2021, the RRT supported the VA's vaccination efforts through rapid cycle quality improvement to understand and address vaccine hesitancy among Veterans and VA employees. This work led to Dr. Elwy becoming involved with a WHO Global Vaccine Implementation Workgroup and a White House Office of Science and Technology Policy workgroup. Dr. Elwy’s research (VA HSR&D SDR 11-440) has also led to the “Disclosure Support Program”, funded continuously by VA Clinical Operations since 2015 (after research funding ended), to assist VA facilities with creating communication plans for disclosures of large-scale adverse event, unanticipated events that occurred during the course of Veterans’ care. This work is featured in the journal Healthcare, in a special issue focused on embedded research. Dr. Elwy leads dissemination efforts for the VA Complementary and Integrative Health Evaluation Center (VA PEC 16-354), which includes guest editing two journal special issues on CIH effectiveness and implementation research, and founding and managing the bi-monthly VA CIH Cyberseminar series.
