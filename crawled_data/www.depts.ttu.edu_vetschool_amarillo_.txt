It's easy to get around, there's no major rush hour to speak of, and there's a good chance you'll always run into a neighbor at the grocery store. Of course, it's important to have fun too, Amarillo is home to the Don Harrington Discovery Center, a new AA baseball stadium named Hodgetown, Wonderland park (the fourth largest amusement park in Texas), the Palo Duro Canyon (the second largest canyon in the United States), and many fun, family-centered events and venues.
