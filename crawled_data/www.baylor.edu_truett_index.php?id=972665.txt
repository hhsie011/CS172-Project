About Dr. Howell Jenny Howell serves as the Director of the Theology, Ecology, and Food Justice Program at Baylor University's Truett Seminary. After earning a BA from the Honor's Program at Texas A&M University, Howell went on to receive her MDiv (Duke Divinity School) and PhD in Theology and Ethics (Baylor University). Her scholarship focuses on the doctrine of creation. Howell also serves as the Theologian in Residence at the World Hunger Relief Farm, where all her classes are offered. She believes that teaching her courses on site at a flourishing regenerative farm allows seminary students the opportunity to more fully integrate the rigor of theological education with an informed love of place that Christians are called to tend and nurture. * Curriculum Vitae About Greetings from the Dean Who We Are History What We Believe Vision for Life Together Statement of Common Faith Women in Ministry Accreditations & Affiliations Statement of Educational Effectiveness (2021) Campuses Houston Tuition & Financing Campus Visits Meet Our Students & Alumni Mahcoe Mikel Alyssa Carter Meet Our Director Connect with Truett Continuing Education San Antonio Tuition & Financing Meet Our Director Faculty Jared E.
