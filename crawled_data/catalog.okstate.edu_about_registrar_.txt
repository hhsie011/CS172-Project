Evans, MS—Associate Registrar Bobby Jenkins, MA—Associate Registrar Paula Barnes, MS—Assistant Registrar, Certifications Trent Davis—Assistant Registrar, Registration Services J. Blake Myers—Assistant Registrar, Technology Amber Todd—Assistant Registrar, Academic Records Campus Address and Phone 322/324 Student Union Stillwater, OK 74078-1013 Phone: 405-744-6876 Website: registrar.okstate.edu E-mail: registrar@okstate.edu Student Enrollment Students must be admitted to the university before they can enroll for classes. Enrollment initiates the creation of an academic record and incurs a financial obligation (see the "Bursar" section of this Catalog). The registration process is introduced to new freshmen and transfer students during new student orientation. After meeting with their academic advisor to select courses appropriate to their degree plan, students enroll online via Self Service at my.okstate.edu. An overdue account with the University or other registration holds will prevent registration until these holds have been cleared. Continuing students register for summer and fall classes during the latter part of the preceding spring semester and for spring classes during the latter part of the preceding fall semester. Continuous Enrollment An undergraduate student who is enrolled for every fall and spring semester is considered continuously enrolled. A fall or spring semester with no enrollment is considered a break in enrollment. A graduate student with no break in enrollment or with a break in enrollment of less than one year is considered continuously enrolled. See the Graduate College section of this catalog. Readmission to the university is required if a student does not maintain continuous enrollment. Priority Enrollment In order to facilitate access to courses required for timely degree completion, a student's priority for enrollment generally follows academic class level, with graduate students and seniors having the highest priority. Some exceptions to this basic priority may be necessary to accommodate bona fide student needs, such as students with physical disabilities, for those committed (by a scholarship or full-time employment at the University) to perform a service for the University on a schedule specified by the University, for graduate students and students in the Honors College. Academic Affairs determines enrollment priorities, and enrollment schedules are published in the Enrollment Guide which can be found on the Office of the Registrar's website registrar.okstate.edu each semester. Full-time OSU staff may utilize priority enrollment to help ensure they are given an opportunity to identify classes at a time that is least disruptive to their work schedule. This benefit of priority enrollment is extended to full-time (100% FTE), regular staff members. Late Enrollment Students are allowed and encouraged to enroll well before the beginning of a given term. Students whose initial enrollment for the term occurs on or after the first day of the class will be charged a late enrollment fee. A student is permitted to add classes after initial enrollment without a late enrollment fee during the first two weeks of a 16-week semester or through the fifth day of an eight-week summer session or during proportionate periods for block or short courses (see additional restrictions for Adding Courses below). See the "Tuition, Fees and Cost Estimates" section of the Catalog for the current late enrollment fee amount. Adding or Dropping Classes Adding Classes Approval from the student's academic advisor is required for adding a class. The sixth day of a regular semester, or the third class day of an eight-week summer session, or proportionate periods for short courses is the last day a class may be added (nonrestrictive). With instructor approval, a class may be added during the second week of classes of a regular semester, or the fourth or fifth day of an eight-week summer session (restrictive). During the restrictive period, students must obtain their instructor's and advisor's signatures on a drop/add card and submit it to the Office of the Registrar to add a new class to their schedule. Dropping Classes Dropping refers to the dropping of one or more classes while remaining enrolled in at least one other OSU course for a given semester. Classes may not be dropped without the approval of the student's academic advisor. Enrollment changes, such as dropping classes, are the responsibility of the student. Failure to attend classes or nonpayment of tuition and fees does not constitute dropping a class. General drop periods are provided in the table below. The Academic Calendar provides specific dates for each term. Exceptions to these deadlines may be considered by petition due to documented extraordinary circumstances and committee approval. The Retroactive Drop/Withdrawal Petition and the Petition for a Refund of Tuition and Fees are available on the Registrar’s website (registrar.okstate.edu). Periods for Dropping Full-Semester (16-week) Courses Periods for Dropping Full-Semester (16-week) Courses Semester Time Period Course Grade Course-Related Tuition/Fee Refund Before term begins No transcript record 100% refund First 6 days No transcript record 100% refund Days 7-10 No transcript record Partial refund Weeks 3-12 "W" No refund Weeks 13-14 "W" or "F" as assigned by instructor No refund Weeks 15-16 No drop option - Final grade as assigned by instructor No refund *Summer classes, intersession classes, and other classes that do not follow the standard 16-week semester follow proportionate drop/refund periods. A student may not drop any class in which a violation of academic integrity is pending against the student. If the student admits responsibility for a violation meriting a grade of “F” for an assignment or examination, the instructor or Academic Integrity Panel may permit the student to drop the class with a grade of “W.” If the student is found not responsible for the violation, he or she may drop the class with either a “W” or “F,” (according to the drop grade policy) appearing on the academic record. If the student is found responsible for the violation, the instructor may assign an appropriate sanction, including assigning the grade “F” for the assignment/examination or “F!” for the class. (See Policy and Procedures Letter 02-0822). International students need to consult with International Students and Scholars (ISS) before dropping classes or withdrawing for the semester. Under reporting regulations required by the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), dropping below full-time can put a student’s visa status in jeopardy. Cancelling Enrollment and Withdrawing from the University Enrollment cancellation occurs when a student drops all classes before classes begin, that is, before the applicable semester or session begins. Student requests to cancel enrollment must be received by the Office of the Registrar before the first day of classes for the term. Enrollment changes, such as cancelling enrollment or withdrawing from the University, are the responsibility of the student. Failure to attend classes or nonpayment of tuition and fees does not constitute notice of cancellation. Withdrawing from the University occurs when a student drops all classes after classes begin, that is, after the applicable semester or session begins. The withdrawal process is initiated with the student’s academic advisor or in the student’s academic student services office. International students must also consult with International Students and Scholars (ISS) before dropping courses or withdrawing for the semester. Under reporting regulations required by the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), dropping below full-time can put a student’s visa status in jeopardy. General cancellation and withdrawal periods are provided in the table below. The Academic Calendar provides specific dates for each term. Exceptions to these deadlines may be considered by petition due to documented extraordinary circumstances and committee approval. The Retroactive Drop/Withdrawal Petition and the Petition for a Refund of Tuition and Fees forms are available on the Registrar’s website (registrar.okstate.edu).

Leave of Absence for Active Military Duty Per Oklahoma State law (SB 1830), OSU offers a military leave of absence (MLOA) to students who are members of the active uniformed military services of the United States who are called to active duty. An MLOA allows a student to be absent from the University for active duty without penalty to admission status or grade-point average and without loss of institutional financial aid. It also allows the student to be eligible for withdrawal from all or some classes with a full refund of tuition and fees or to be eligible for incomplete grades in classes for which he/she has successfully completed at least 50% of the coursework at the time of leave, if the student intends to complete the classes upon return from active duty. MLOAs shall not exceed a cumulative five years. Graduate student LOAs are for a period of one year with annual extensions possible up to the five-year cumulative limit. Students apply for MLOA by submitting the appropriate form and supporting documentation. See OSU Military Leave of Absence FAQs on the Registrar website (registrar.okstate.edu) for more information. Veteran Benefit Services Oklahoma State University maintains a full-time office of veteran benefit services for the convenience of veterans and their dependents. OSU offers courses which are approved for students to receive education benefits by the Oklahoma Department of Veteran Affairs (ODVA) State Approving Agency. Information and assistance is available for completion of appropriate forms necessary to apply for education benefits. A student who is eligible for educational benefits through the Veterans Administration must adhere to the following: Changes in Enrollment/Drops/Adds, or Withdrawal from University After enrollment information has been submitted, any increase or decrease in credit hours must be reported to the VA. These changes may result in a change of benefit amount received and possible overpayment debts incurred by the student. It is the student’s responsibility to immediately notify the OSU VA office of any changes in enrollment. Should overpayments occur due to a change in student’s initial class schedule, the student is responsible to make repayment arrangements with the university. Veteran education beneficiaries are required to have all previous credit evaluated including military training. To establish military credit, students must submit a copy of their JST (Joint Services Transcript) and/or a DSST transcript to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions for evaluation. Degree/Major Declaration Upon enrollment at OSU, a student may remain undeclared for no more than 2 academic semesters. At that time a degree program must be declared. An OSU degree plan will be selected and only courses or prerequisites which lead to that degree/major will be certified to the VA for payment/benefits. Any changes in the degree requirement sheet must be documented by the student's academic advisor and approved before certification can be completed and transmitted to the VA. Non-Standard Academic Terms VA pays education benefits for the actual enrollment dates of the term. The VA pays for the number of degree applicable credit hours taken within a defined period of enrollment. Intersession and non-standard term enrollments will be certified for payment according to the actual published dates of those classes. Please contact a school certifying official regarding full-time status reporting to the VA as full-time status is determined based on dates of enrollment for non-standard terms and not cumulative hours for the term. Unsatisfactory Progress VA regulations state that satisfactory attendance, conduct and progress must be maintained. If you do not maintain the academic standards set by the university, the OSU VA Office is required to notify the VA of your status. Repeat Courses VA WILL NOT PAY for repeat courses that were successfully completed and letter grade received - regardless of when the course was completed or who paid for the course. Letter grades of A, B, C, or D are considered successful for VA purposes. The only exception is when a higher grade is required to meet the degree requirement. Payment of Education Benefits You must submit an advisory form each semester that you wish to receive education benefits. Any supporting documentation - course substitutions/deviations, change of major, etc., must be received BEFORE enrollment certification can be completed for the term. The VA cannot issue benefit checks until the certification process has been completed by the OSU Veteran Services office. Responsibility of Payment to the University Applying for VA Education benefits does not prevent late payment penalties. Students receiving benefits under Chapters 31 (Veteran Readiness and Employment benefits) and Chapter 33 (Post 9/11 - awarded percentage from VA for tuition/fees only) will not be penalized due to delayed payment by the VA (i.e., restriction of enrollment, late fees, requirement of alternative/additional funding or denial of access to school resources available to other students). In all other instances, you are responsible for payment of tuition and fees by published payment deadlines. Non-receipt of benefits from the VA to the student will not prevent late payment penalties from applying to your Bursar account. Any change in enrollment status may adversely affect payments received by the VA, and students will be held liable for any overpayment the VA issues on their behalf. Contact a veteran’s representative in the Office of the Registrar, 322 Student Union, for more information.

Official Records Six-Week (Midterm) Progress Reports Faculty report six-week (midterm) progress grades for all students (regardless of classification) enrolled in 1000- and 2000-level classes. This will normally occur during the seventh week of classes. Student athletes will have all six-week grades reported, not just 1000- and 2000-level. Progress reports are made available to students and to the students' advisors through Self Service. Grade Reports Final grades for all students are compiled and released shortly after the end of each semester by the Office of the Registrar. Final grades are made available electronically to students, students' advisors and students' deans through Self Service. Official Transcripts All OSU official transcripts of student academic records are prepared and released by the Office of the Registrar. The official transcript includes the complete academic record (undergraduate, graduate and professional) as well as the signature of the University Registrar and the official seal of the University. OSU official academic transcripts may be ordered in the following ways: Current students - online via Student Self Service; Former students - online via the Registrar's transcript ordering site. Students with transcript holds (such as holds due to outstanding financial obligations to the University) will not be granted an official transcript until the hold has been cleared with the appropriate University officials. Copies of transcripts from other institutions cannot be furnished. Students' Rights to Privacy The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA, also known as the Buckley Amendment) was designed to protect the privacy of educational records, to establish the right of students to inspect and review their educational records in all offices, and to provide guidelines for the correction of inaccurate or misleading data through informal and formal hearings. An OSU student has the right to: Inspect and review information contained in his or her educational records within 45 days of the day that the University receives a written request from the student. Challenge the contents of the educational record. Have a hearing if the outcome of a challenge is unsatisfactory. Submit an explanatory statement for inclusion in the educational record, if the outcome of the hearing is unsatisfactory. Secure a copy of the institutional policy, which includes the location of all educational records. Prevent disclosure, with certain exceptions, of personally identifiable information from the educational record. File a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the University to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the office that administers FERPA is: Family Policy Compliance Office, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW, Washington, D.C. 20202-5901. Withholding Disclosure of Information Currently enrolled students may withhold disclosure of directory information. A student may file a written request with the Office of the Registrar to not release personally identifiable information, including directory information. Such requests will be honored until revoked by the student. The University assumes that failure on the part of any student to specifically request the withholding of directory information indicates individual approval for disclosure. Access to Records Students may inspect and review their educational records by making a written request to the office that maintains the records (see Location of Records below). No non-directory information regarding students' educational records may be disclosed to anyone without written consent of students, except for selected purposes as authorized by federal law, such as: To "school officials" who have a "legitimate educational interest" in the student. Upon request to another institution to which a student seeks or intends to enroll or is already enrolled if the disclosure is related to the student’s enrollment or transfer. In response to a lawfully issued court order or subpoena. In connection with financial aid if the information is necessary to determine aid eligibility or to enforce the conditions of the aid. To accrediting organizations to carry out their accrediting functions. To organizations conducting studies for or on behalf of the school in order to develop, validate, or administer predictive tests, administer student aid programs, or improve instruction. To authorized representatives of the U.S. Comptroller General, the U.S. Attorney General, the U.S. Secretary of Education, and to State and local educational authorities in connection with an audit or evaluation of an education program or for compliance with Federal legal requirements related to those programs. To appropriate officials in connection with a health or safety emergency. Final results of certain disciplinary proceedings related to an alleged perpetrator of a crime of violence or a non-forcible sex offense. To parents of a student regarding the student’s violation of any Federal, State, or local law or of any rule or policy of the school governing the use or possession of alcohol or a controlled substance if the school determines the student committed a disciplinary violation and the student is under the age of 21. Parental Access to Records At the postsecondary level, parents have no inherent rights to inspect their son's or daughter's educational records. Information regarding educational records is best obtained by direct communication between the parent and the student. Students may consent to release their educational records to parents, legal guardians, or other individuals by providing access using the Proxy feature in Self Service or completing the appropriate form in the Office of the Registrar. Such consent should be given in an uncoercive environment. Parents of a dependent student may challenge denial of access to educational records by producing the most current copy of Internal Revenue Form 1040. Definitions "Educational Record" refers to those records which are directly related to a student and are maintained by an educational institution. "Directory Information" includes: student's name (including chosen or preferred first name); local and permanent address or hometown; telephone number; year of birth; major field of study; weight and height of student participating in officially recognized sports; dates of attendance at Oklahoma State University; degrees, honors, and awards granted or received and dates granted or received; academic classification such as freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, etc.; institutional electronic mail address; most recent educational institution previously attended; dissertation or thesis title; advisor or thesis/dissertation advisor; participation in officially recognized organizations, activities, and sports; parents' names and addresses (city and state only). "School official" is defined as an individual currently serving as a member of the Oklahoma State University Board of Regents or classified as faculty, administrative, or professional, and the staff such school officials supervise; the President and CEO of the Alumni Association and President and CEO of the Oklahoma State University Foundation and the staff they supervise; the National Student Clearinghouse; and contractors, volunteers, and other non-employees performing institutional functions as school officials with legitimate educational interests. "Legitimate educational interest" A school official has a "legitimate educational interest" if a review of a student’s record is necessary to fulfill the official’s professional responsibilities to the University. School officials may have legitimate educational interests both in students who are currently enrolled and in those no longer enrolled. Location of Records Several offices share responsibility for maintaining and releasing information pertaining to student education records. These include, but are not restricted to: the Office of the Registrar for academic records, the Office of Student Judicial Affairs for disciplinary records, the Office of the Bursar for billing and payment records, the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid for scholarship and financial aid records, the Human Resources office and Career Services office for employment/placement records, and the Communications Service office for directory information.
