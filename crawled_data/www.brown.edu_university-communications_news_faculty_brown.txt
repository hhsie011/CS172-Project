Our team of writers and strategists develops and disseminates news, features and multimedia content on a daily basis – and the News from Brown website serves as our primary platform. The news, features and multimedia content posted to the News from Brown website feeds much of the activity on the Brown homepage and our social media channels. Our content also serves as the basis for our ongoing, outbound interactions with the external news media as we facilitate positive news coverage of the University. And each Friday, the News and Editorial team compiles and distributes a News from Brown e-newsletter – anyone with an interest in Brown news is welcome to subscribe. As we unearth compelling content from across the Brown campus – with a particular focus on “distinctively Brown” stories centered on academics, research and leadership initiatives supporting students – we invite and rely upon collaboration from our faculty and staff colleagues. Our team works via a beat structure with dedicated writers for the life sciences; physical sciences; humanities and social sciences; and University initiatives and campus life. We welcome and encourage story ideas and news tips at any point.
