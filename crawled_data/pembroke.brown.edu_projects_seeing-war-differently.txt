The Pembroke Center hosted seminars, public lectures, conferences, performances and film screenings that re-examine war from a broad range of disciplinary perspectives. The scholarship on modern war has broadened the scope of analysis from the battlefield to consider questions such as the relationship between civilian societies and their military engagements, practices of commemoration, modes of representation, global politics of security and humanitarianism, the value of human life, and the militarization of disease. This project also engages with critical discourses in such fields as gender studies, postcolonial studies, and the studies of race and ethnicity that have helped us rethink the "we" of the war experience. In attending to the ways that analyses of war have expanded possibilities for thinking about the subject, we learn that the subject itself, war, has expanded as a category of analysis. It is that expanded category—war as a grid, a concept, an organizing framework, or an archive of knowledge—that will form the object of our critical explorations.
