with Chilean Scholars and Scientists Santiago Opportunity for Joint-projects with Chilean Scholars and Scientists August 25, 2017 Opportunity for Joint-projects with Chilean Scholars and Scientists Chile’s National Commission for Science and Technology (CONICYT) launched a call for proposals targeting young Chilean researchers who obtained their Ph.Ds. between 2010 and 2017, aimed at supporting collaborative projects with foreign counterparts across all scholarly areas, with funding up to USD$28,000. This opens opportunities for Columbia scholars and scientists to team up with Chilean colleagues to develop joint-research projects, access scientific and technological equipment, organize stays and internships in both countries, and conduct collaborative workshops and seminars in Chile. The submission closes on September 14, 2017. The application is open only for Chilean researchers or foreign researchers that reside in Chile permanently, so we encourage Columbia faculty and researchers to contact their colleagues in Chile and apply to this call.
