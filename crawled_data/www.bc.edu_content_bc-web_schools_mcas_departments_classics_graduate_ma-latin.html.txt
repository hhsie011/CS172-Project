Requirements The M.A. in Latin requires ten courses (30 credits) in Latin at the graduate level, completion of an independent reading list, demonstration of proficiency in a modern foreign language (usually French or German), and comprehensive written and oral examinations. Get Started Request Info Apply Now Course Work Four courses a year are normally available to graduate students. Students who follow this track either supplement their coursework by taking courses at consortium universities (BU, Brandeis, Tufts), or pursue the degree part-time over three years. Consortium courses are covered by tuition benefits, but must be approved by BC faculty. Modern Language Proficiency is demonstrated by a one-hour translation test, in which the use of a dictionary is allowed. This test does not form part of the comprehensive exams. It may be taken at a student's earliest convenience, the sooner the better. Comprehensive Exams These include a two-hour exam in Latin poetry, a two-hour exam in Latin prose, and an oral exam. Each written exam requires the translation of three passages and the composition of an essay about one of them; the essay asks a student to identify the passage in its literary context and the author in his historical context. Written exams are based on the reading list and on a student's course work. Use of a dictionary is not allowed. The oral exam is open-ended, testing whether a student can keep a conversation going for an hour on the topic of Latin literature in its historical context. A supplementary reading list suggests books on political, social, and literary history. Summary of Requirements 30 credits of coursework (may include three or six credit thesis) Proficiency test in a modern foreign language Two-hour written examination on Latin poetry Two-hour written examination on Latin prose One-hour oral examination Reading List The list contains options as well as requirements. Each student will be expected, before taking comprehensive exams, to submit an individualized list. For print purposes see Reading List in pdf format.

Many are available. This list contains suggestions, but feel free to make substitutions. Harriet Flower, Roman Republics Colin Wells, The Roman Empire Ronald Syme, The Roman Revolution Roman social history: e.g. Robert Knapp, Invisible Romans; Potter & Mattingly, Life, Death, and Entertainment in the Roman Empire (esp. good on religion, demography, & spectacles); Michael Peachin, ed. The Oxford Handbook of Roman Social Relations; T. Wiseman, Catullus and His World For literary history, the standard reference work is now the Cambridge History of Classical Literature, (Vol. I = Greece, Vol. II = Rome). The articles on individual authors are, in general, state of the art and the bibliographies are ample (up-to-date to 1982). Copies are available in the reference section in O'Neill Library. For shorter articles and bibliography (to c. 1996) on authors, genres, historical figures, mythology, etc., see the Oxford Classical Dictionary, 3rd edition, available in the Classics Department office and in O'Neill Library. Affordable in paperback and still useful for reference are H. J. Rose's Histories of Greek and Latin Literature; for mythological references the most convenient guide is Edward Tripp, The Meridian Handbook of Classical Mythology.
