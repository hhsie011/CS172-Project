There are medical tests for most STIs, but not all of the tests are reliable. Often, a physical examination, in combination with diagnostic screening tools such as Pap smears, is needed to make an accurate diagnosis. Columbia Health believes that high-quality care for STIs also includes education about typical symptoms, the reliability of the test, treatment options, and STI transmission. Guidance for testing for HIV and other STIs and general education related to sexual health matters are offered through Gay Health Advocacy Project (GHAP). Connect with GHAP at drop-in hours or email [email protected] to request an appointment with an advocate. If you think you have been sexually assaulted, the Sexual Violence Response team can provide resources for confidential STI testing. Cost HIV testing at Columbia Health is available at no additional cost for all students. Students on the Columbia Student Health Insurance Plan pay no additional cost for STI tests performed with a Columbia Health provider. Students on an alternate health insurance plan may speak with a GHAP advocate about other options, including free testing in sites around New York City. All services are provided in a confidential environment that respects privacy. How do I get tested for sexually transmitted infections (STIs)?

Preventing STIs Some important recommendations to prevent STIs include: Know your sexual partner(s). Before you become intimate, have a discussion about STIs, sexual history (yours and your partners), and be honest. Use a condom. If you or your partner think you might have symptoms of an STI, make an appointment to see a Medical Services provider. Know which sexual practices put you at greater risk of STIs. Recognize that substance use increases risk of STIs. Free Condoms and Lube The map below provides an overview of locations at Columbia where safer sex supplies can be found.
