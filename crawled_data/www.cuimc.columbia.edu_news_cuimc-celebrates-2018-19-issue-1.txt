CUIMC IN THE NEWS Trapped Thai Boys Being Closely Watched for Health Problems Associated Press | July 11, 2018 The boys were malnourished and weak, and doctors are probably worried that they could be susceptible to germs spread by family members or other visitors, said Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, a Columbia University infectious diseases expert.… Lipkin said more likely risks are tetanus bacteria that could infect a wound, diarrhea-causing bacteria that could have contaminated the cave waters, and inhalable fungal spores that could cause breathing problems—including pneumonia. Sleep Habits: Even Mild Sleep Problems Can Raise Blood Pressure Newsweek | June 27, 2018 A study from Columbia University Irving Medical Center shows that women who have mild sleep problems—including those who slept for seven to nine hours a night—are significantly more likely to have elevated blood pressure, according to the findings published in the Journal of the American Heart Association. … “That’s concerning, since studies have shown that sleep deprivation and milder sleep problems may have a disproportionate effect on cardiovascular health in women,” said Brooke Aggarwal in a statement. Aggarwal is a behavioral scientist in the Department of Medicine at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and the lead author of the study. The Medical/Dental Clinic Repertoire Magazine | June 18, 2018 “The College of Dental Medicine was founded 100 years ago with the disruptive idea that dentistry should be taught and practiced within the context of the whole body,” Christian S. Stohler, DMD, DrMedDent, dean of the College of Dental Medicine and senior vice president for Columbia University Irving Medical Center, said at the time of the center’s opening. “The Center for Precision Dental Medicine gives us the capacity to realize this founding vision in the information age.” Why Does Sweetness Taste So Good?
