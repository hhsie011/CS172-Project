Sciences, MS Comparative Biomedical Sciences, PhD Veterinary Medicine, DVM Home/ About the University/ University Police Services University Police Services Providing a safe campus is a primary goal at Oklahoma State University. The OSU Police Department provides a full range of police resources, including patrol, investigations, crime prevention, facilities security analysis, event planning, training and more. The OSUPD was the first agency in Oklahoma to receive accreditation from the Oklahoma Association of Chiefs of Police. The OSUPD also has a 24-hour 911 dispatch center on campus, connecting our campus community with the resources they need when they need them. SAFETY RESOURCES FOR OUR CAMPUS COMMUNITY RAVE Guardian: As part of the Oklahoma State University’s commitment to campus safety, the campus has adopted Rave Guardian, a free mobile app that turns any smartphone into a personal safety resource for students, faculty and staff — anyone with an Oklahoma State email address. Users can use the app to communicate with dispatchers, send anonymous tips, set a safety timer, access important links and more. Cowboy Alerts: OSU also has the ability to communicate with the campus community in the event of an emergency. In a situation deemed an emergency, OSU officials will send a message via text or phone call to members of the OSU community with information regarding the event and how they should proceed. SafeWalk: The SafeWalk program employs and trains students as public service officers to escort anyone from one campus location to another from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m., seven days a week. Need a SafeWalk outside the hours of 9 p.m. to 2 a.m.? Request one. The OSUPD has officers on duty around the clock. They’ll be happy to walk with you to your next on-campus destination or to Greek housing, but the timing could depend on the call volume at the time. To request a SafeWalk, call 405-744-6523 or use the Rave Guardian app, your personal safety resource. Blue Phones: OSU has more than 75 emergency “blue phones” around campus. These phones, which can be used to request immediate help from the police, have been in operation since 1979. Security and Access Control It is OSU's policy to lock the doors of buildings that are not in use, although some buildings on campus are rarely locked, since students study and work on projects all hours of the day and night. During non-open access hours for OSU’s residence halls, all doors are locked except the front desk entrance for halls with a staffed front desk. Community Policing The OSU Police Department is a leader in community policing, of breaking down the barriers between law enforcement and the people officers serve. We are on a path of continuous improvement and increased integration within our community. Core Campus Division: The Oklahoma State University Police Department’s Core Campus Division embodies the philosophy of community policing. Officers are assigned to the heart of campus, areas with the highest concentration of students, faculty, staff and guests. Stationing officers in the heart of campus — in areas not easily accessible by roads — has also reduced call response times. The Core Campus Division includes a substation on the second floor of the Student Union (225), where officers can fill out reports, meet with students and be a calming and welcoming presence. Community Liaisons: The OSUPD is aiming for a new level of community engagement with tailored service to build bridges with specific campus populations. The liaison program pairs officers with athletics teams, OSU’s Residential Life and campus community groups that represent underserved or marginalized populations. The goal is to build relationships and foster dialogue between law enforcement and these communities. The liaisons coordinate with the teams, Residential Life and campus groups to offer insight into law enforcement, promote available resources and offer support by being a known point of contact with the OSUPD. In the end, it’s all about relationships. Crime Prevention and Education The department is committed to reducing crime with thoughtful education and innovative programs to improve the culture and dynamics on campus. Recent efforts include: The transformative work in progress through a grant from the Office of Violence against Women and the Department of Justice to reduce domestic/dating violence, sexual assault and stalking on campus with a focus on underserved and underrepresented groups. Training: OSUPD offers trainings across campus in active shooter response, training on drug and alcohol abuse awareness and the Rape Aggression Defense system, a comprehensive course that begins with awareness, prevention and risk reduction and avoidance and then progresses to the basics of hands-on self-defense training. Crisis Intervention Team: The OSUPD has partnered with the Stillwater Police Department to create a two-person Crisis Intervention Team. This multi-jurisdictional response unit responds to calls possibly involving mental health across Stillwater. They conduct follow-up visits to connect individuals in need or crisis with helpful resources, hopefully before the situation reaches a crisis. Crisis Negotiations Team: The OSUPD is part of the Stillwater Multi-Jurisdictional Special Operations Team that includes crisis negotiators. Two OSUPD officers have completed the training and respond county-wide when there is a need to diffuse a situation in hopes of a peaceful resolution.
