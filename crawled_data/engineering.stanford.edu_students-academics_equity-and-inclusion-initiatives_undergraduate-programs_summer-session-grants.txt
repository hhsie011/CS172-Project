Grants are for undergraduate students majoring in engineering, or for students who are on track to declare in an engineering major. The program assists undergraduate students in completing coursework required for an engineering major during the summer quarter at Stanford or other accredited colleges and universities. Courses include engineering requirements (fundamentals, science, chemistry, CME, math), other degree requirements like WAYS and foreign language, or other courses that would alleviate a high-unit quarter during the academic year. Funding Grant requests cannot exceed the cost of the summer course(s), and a maximum of $5,000 per student will be granted regardless of total tuition cost. Students who receive financial aid may be eligible to request an advance (see flowcharts under “Application Details”). Eligibility Undergraduate students must be declared in an engineering major or have taken significant coursework that will be applied toward an engineering major. Priority will be given to students who have not received SSG funding in the past. Students must plan to complete courses during the summer quarter and use them toward graduation requirements. Please note that the grants are intended primarily for students who may be minoritized in engineering fields (womxn, non-binary students, all spectrums of gender identity and sexual orientation, first generation and/or low income, first in their family to study engineering, or coming from under-resourced schools or environments with limited exposure to engineering curriculum). Application Details There are two paths for SSG funding; Stanford classes and off-campus courses. Please see the following flowcharts for application, reimbursement, and deadline information. On campus application flow chart (PDF) Off campus application flow chart (PDF) Your application will not be considered complete until you have uploaded in PDF format: a four-year plan, and description of the equivalent course at Stanford (including college, course number, and description). NOTE: An incomplete application WILL DELAY a timely response to your request. Apply here!
