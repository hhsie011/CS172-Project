We will work together to foster your academic success, enhance your personal and professional development, and support your civic engagement by providing exciting opportunities to learn, to grow, and to make a difference. The study and practice of communication is foundational to every human endeavor, with relevance to a variety of academic subjects and professional practices. This has never been more true than in our current networked, global society. Studying communication within the SoC in Miami offers a valuable path toward gaining essential and relevant expertise, through a combination of rigorous coursework and inspiring experiences. Whether you are pursuing one of our nine undergraduate, or one of our seven graduate degrees, you will have access to our considerable talent and resources, such as film and media production facilities, broadcast studios, smart classrooms, and computer labs. The breadth and depth of our curricula is matched by that of our renowned faculty, who bring a wealth of professional and scholarly experience in areas such as communication and strategic communication studies, cinema studies, interactive media, journalism, and media management. The Center for Communication, Culture & Change exemplifies how we leverage our talent for social change. Our SoC combines academic excellence with contemporary relevance and global impact. As a global city, Miami serves as an exciting base for our programs, with connected campuses and programs around the world to enrich your educational experience. We celebrate and appreciate diversity within our community, integral to our perspectives, our purpose, and our potential. Whether you are returning, new to SoC, or considering our school, we invite you to join us in our academic programs, student organizations, school events, special projects, and more. We encourage you to share your skills and your passions. And we look forward to your helping us create positive change in our communities.
