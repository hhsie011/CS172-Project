New in the 2019-20 academic year, the Goldner Mini-Fellowship program is designed to help facilitate involvement in Department of Theater productions. PreviousNext ABOUT The Department of Theater recognizes that work study or other job requirements can constrain a student's ability to commit to being a part of a theater production. In order to help alleviate this problem and facilitate student participation in our productions, the department is currently offering term-long mini-fellowships of $1000 each. Students receiving a mini-fellowship are expected to decrease their work hours accordingly (by approximately 10 hours/week) in order to help free up their schedule for rehearsals and/or production work.** Please note that only students who are currently receiving financial aid from the College are eligible to apply for a mini-fellowship. Funds will be disbursed in two payments of $500 each over the course of the term. The mini-fellowship is designed to facilitate preplanned involvement in the department over the course of an entire term; students must thus apply for it in advance of the start of each term. Students who wish to perform as part of their fellowship term should be aware that a role in a department production is not guaranteed. Similarly, students wishing to apply for a student production slot should know that selection for a fellowship term is not a guarantee that their production proposal will be approved. If the audition process does not yield a role, or if the application for a student production slot is not successful, we will work with the fellowship student to develop a rewarding alternative that will expand the student's theatre experience in useful ways. Please note that the Goldner Mini-Fellowship is designed to facilitate extracurricular involvement in the department; it is not intended to facilitate credit-based or course-based activity such as those related to an honors thesis, THEA 40, or an independent study. It can, however, facilitate the completion of production credits that are not connected to an academic course. 2021-22 DEADLINES For the 2022 academic year, we are able to offer two mini-fellowships each term (except summer). Application deadlines: For fall term fellowships: September 17, 2021 For winter term fellowships: January 17, 2022 For spring term fellowships: April 15, 2022 Please note that future funding for this program is not guaranteed; yearly opportunities will be dependent on available funding. TO APPLY Fill out the Goldner mini-fellowship application form and the financial aid disclosure form. Following the submission of your application, you may be contacted by the Chair or Director of Theater for an informal interview. Applications will be evaluated by the Department Chair, the Director of Theater, and the Production Manager, with additional outreach to faculty and staff as necessary. As part of the evaluation process, we will prioritize those students who have demonstrated a sense of commitment and dedication based on their involvement in our classes or productions. Students who have not received a mini-fellowship in a previous term will also be prioritized. We will also take level of financial need (high, medium, or low, as reported by the Financial Aid office) into consideration. A student's level of financial need will be kept strictly confidential; it will be shared only with those evaluating the applications, as part of the decision-making process. Questions may be directed to Jamie Horton, Director of Theater.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Theater Undergraduate Overview Equity and Inclusivity Peer Advisors and Student Representatives The Major Major Requirements Honors Thesis The Modified Major Modified Major Requirements Modifying another Major with Theater The Minor Minor Requirements Courses: offerings by term Course Descriptions Instructor Permission Courses Independent Study Off-Campus Exchange National Theater Institute For Prospective Students Onstage Overview Get Involved Performing and Auditions Directing and Designing Playwriting Stage Managing The Scene Shop The Costume Shop Now Onstage: Upcoming Productions Season Archives: Past Productions Production Photos About Student Productions Workshops and Full Productions Studio Lab: Exploring Theatrical Boundaries YourSpace: Performance Spaces for Creative Minds Student Work in the time of COVID About MainStage Productions Opportunities Overview Summer Theater Lab: Cultivating New Work VoxLab Frost and Dodd Play Festival New York Theatre Workshop Residency The VOICES Program Experiential Learning with Northern Stage Testimonials Student Funding Opportunities Kingsdale Fund Need-Based Funding Goldner Mini-Fellowship Other funding opportunities Funding for Graduate Studies Internships, Fellowships, and Graduate Programs The Neukom Institute Literary Arts Award in Playwriting Foreign Study News & Events All News and Events MainStage Production News Student Production News Honors Thesis Productions Summer Theater Lab News Faculty News Student News Visiting Artist News Alumni News People Faculty and Staff Visiting Artists Alumni Tell Us Your Story Theater and Performance Studies My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
