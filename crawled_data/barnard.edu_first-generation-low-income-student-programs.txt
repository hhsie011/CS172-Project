The Student Success program here at Barnard is invested in your development both inside and outside of the classroom. We provide ongoing workshops and panels on various topics, professional development workshops, networking opportunities with faculty and administrators, and much more! Through the Student Success Program, the First-Generation/Low-Income Program (FLI) at Barnard is committed to providing resources and support to all students who identify with the first-generation and/or low-income college experience. Our goal in executing the FLI program is for students to use our office resources to find the support and enrichment they need to achieve academic success and discover their own capabilities in accordance with the College’s mission statement. FLI Partnership Library The Barnard FLI Partnership Library provides textbooks and other course materials for first-generation and/or low-income students. Student Success Blog For more information, spotlights on Barnard’s first-generation students, faculty and staff, and resources available for our FLI students, visit the Student Success Blog. If you’d like to be spotlighted as one of Barnard’s first-generation students, faculty, and staff on the Student Success Blog, email jgedeon@barnard.edu. Jemima Gedeon Meet the Associate Dean for Student Success FLI Student Advisory Board We have named seven student representatives to our First-Generation/Low-Income Student Advisory Board. Peer Academic Leader (PAL) Program PALs seek to assist first-year, first-generation students with the transition to college through weekly meetings and “advising” sessions. Spelman College Exchange Program Barnard College is pleased to offer students the opportunity to participate in a domestic exchange program with prominent historically black college Spelman College. Beyond Barnard Beyond Barnard supports all students and alumnae as they identify, pursue, and achieve success in their careers and communities. Beyond Barnard is available to first-generation students from their first day on campus, throughout their matriculation, and even after graduation. At Beyond Barnard, first-generation/low-income students can schedule appointments on career exploration (regardless of whether you know exactly what you want to do or are just starting to think about it!), student jobs, funding for internships, graduate and professional school, competitive fellowships, and more. Log into Handshake to get started exploring our resources. Whether you need resume and cover letter advice, interview strategies, or want to talk through how to connect with Barnard’s amazing network of alumnae — many of whom are themselves first-gen — we encourage you to visit us.
