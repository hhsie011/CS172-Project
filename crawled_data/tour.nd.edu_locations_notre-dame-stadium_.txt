Legendary coach Knute Rockne designed the stadium but coached only one season there before his tragic death in a plane crash. The stadium was expanded for the 1997 season and now has a capacity of 80,795 fans. Students are guaranteed tickets to all home games, and they enthusiastically express their solidarity with their classmates on the field, as well as the parents, alumni, and other supporters who come out for a game day celebration. Tradition swirls around this simple, elegant symbol of sportsmanship. On the way to your seat in the stands, you will pass banners and statues celebrating countless great memories and men from Notre Dame’s football history. No college football program has had more Heisman Trophy winners (7) or national championships (11).
