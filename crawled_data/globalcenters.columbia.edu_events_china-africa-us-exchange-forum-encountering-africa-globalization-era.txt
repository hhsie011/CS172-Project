The development of Africa has become one of the key components of global economic and social development. Columbia Global Centers | Beijing and Global Education Connection, Ltd. will co-host China-Africa-US Exchange Forum themed as “Encountering Africa in the Globalization Era”, aiming to increase the awareness of African development among young people in China and the US through dialogues and communication around African development potential as well as cultural and education exchanges, etc. The forum will promote young generation of various backgrounds to better understand the role of Africa in economic development and global governance from the perspective of globalization, and drive young students’ enthusiasm on field research and African studies. At the same time, the forum will also establish a communicative platform on various levels to help young people involve in international development and communication through scientific methodologies and well-round practical experiences. As the first young Columbia alumni initiated exchange forum focusing on economic collaboration and cultural understanding among China, US and Africa, we will invite influential and intellectual participants including former Chinese ambassadors to African countries, international organizations officers, experts and professors, and young leaders who care about African development from China, Africa and the US. Participants will discuss and come up with the best pathway to release the potential of young people for African development, and increase Africa’s competitiveness in the new global order and create more opportunities for African development.
