She received a Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering from Princeton University, Magna Cum Laude in 1982, followed by a PhD in Applied Mechanics from the California Institute of Technology in 1986. She immediately joined the faculty in Engineering at Brown as a member of the Mechanics of Solids and Structures group, doing research in the mathematical issues in the behavior of solids undergoing large deformations. She has taught engineering courses at all levels of the graduate and undergraduate curricula in the School of Engineering, and is perhaps most known for teaching the introductory engineering courses. Professor Blume has received the Philip J. Bray award for Excellence in Teaching in the Physical Sciences, 1997, the School of Engineering Dedicated Faculty award, 2009, and the Karen T. Romer Prize for Excellence in Advising, 2011.

Full Text PubMed Research Research Overview Professor Blume's research focuses on mathematical aspects of solid mechanics. Questions of existence and uniqueness of solutions to systems of partial differential equations that arise in continuum descriptions of solid behavior are considered. Recent work in this area is concerned with finding the circumstances under which a given rotation field can be generated by a continuum deformation of a solid. Research Statement Professor Blume's research focuses on mathematical aspects of solid mechanics. For example, questions of existence and uniqueness of solutions to systems of partial differential equations that arise in continuum descriptions of solid behavior are considered. Recent work in this area is concerned with finding the circumstances under which a given rotation field can be generated by a continuum deformation of a solid. Such existence conditions are a useful guide to interpretation of experimental measurements of rotation fields. Funded Research NSF DMR-9632534 “Micro-- and Nano--Mechanics of Materials, (W.
