Home / Equity / Institutional Equity Institutional Equity What Is Equity? Equity is the fair treatment, access, opportunity, and advancement for all, while at the same time striving to identify and eliminate barriers that have prevented the full participation of some groups. Improving equity involves ensuring fairness within the procedures and processes of our institution. "Interaction Institute for Social Change | Artist: Angus Maguire." Our Purpose Institutional Equity is dedicated to advancing Tulane’s commitment to fair and equitable treatment of all members of the university community in employment and educational opportunities by providing consultative, investigative, and educational services. Increasing diversity on campus and maintaining a harassment free environment are our top priorities. We have embarked upon a transformational journey to establish a new approach to fostering a diverse and inclusive community for all Tulanians. We will accomplish this through innovative educational programs, by introducing a conflict resolution program, as well as offering a higher level of service as we continuously improve the processes that promote diversity and help ensure our environment is discrimination, harassment and retaliation free. Education & Training Programs The Institutional Equity team provides educational programs available to staff and faculty, as part of Tulane’s commitment to fostering and maintaining a diverse working and learning environment. We are offering new and innovative programs on a broad range of topics including diversity in recruiting, civil treatment education, unconscious bias, as well as sexual harassment and discrimination prevention education to learn how to recognize, respond and report incidents. Learn more. Conflict Resolution Program Tulane is committed to building a cohesive, collaborative environment which fosters mutual respect and understanding between individuals and is enriched by our differences. Our conflict resolution program offers consultation and training as an alternative approach to resolving conflict in an informal manner. The process is impartial, objective and aims to address conflict at the earliest opportunity. Affirmative Action Program & Recruiting for Diversity Tulane values diversity in recruiting. As a federal contractor, one way we demonstrate our support is through compliance with the Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action regulations issued by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), including identifying job groups where underutilization occurs, establishing affirmative action goals for those job groups, and making good faith efforts to achieve those goals. Investigation Process The Institutional Equity Team is dedicated to ensuring that the Tulane community is discrimination, harassment and retaliation free. Tulane enforces a robust policy prohibiting discrimination, harassment, or retaliation. Students, staff, and faculty are strongly encouraged to promptly report concerns or allegations of discrimination, harassment, and/or retaliation so that appropriate action can be taken to address the concern. When a concern is reported, it is thoroughly investigated. We have an experienced investigation team who is here to inform, educate and support all participants through this process.
