Flynn '86, P'20, P'20 and Julie A. Flynn P'20, P'20, the lecture series enriches undergraduate humanities culture at Brown University. The series brings high-profile speakers to the campus and creates opportunities for undergraduate students to learn from exciting visitors. Each visit includes a public lecture and a separate seminar-style meeting with undergraduate students. We welcome nominations from undergraduate students and faculty. Potential course tie-ins should be mentioned, and we are especially interested in visitors who are known beyond academe (high profile writers, journalists, and public intellectuals, for example). Please submit speaker nominations through this form. We welcome nominations throughout the year. Nominations submitted before April 6, 2022 will be reviewed by faculty and students affiliated with the Cogut Institute in the spring.
