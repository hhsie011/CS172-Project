The astronomy division offers undergraduate and graduate degrees; the plasma division offers a graduate degree. The Department also has an active postdoctoral research program. We are a diverse and vibrant community of faculty, research staff, and students who work on a wide range of topics in astronomy and astrophysics. As a community, we take pride in creating an inclusive and equitable department climate. We have strong links to neighboring groups in the Department of Physics, the Institute for Advanced Study, and the Center for Computational Astrophysics at the Simons Foundation, and we run monthly observing events for the public photo credit: Chang-Goo Kim Latest University Information Related to COVID-19 Upcoming Events HSC+PFS+Rubin Science Discussions (102 Broadmead) Mon, Jun 13, 2022, 2:00 pm – 3:00 pm Juneteenth Fri, Jun 17, 2022 HSC+PFS+Rubin Science Discussions (025) Mon, Jun 27, 2022, 2:00 pm – 3:00 pm View All Events News FACULTY AND STUDENT AWARD: Greene and Dalal receive inaugural Best of Access, Diversity, and Inclusion (BADI) Awards from The Graduate School of Princeton University May 4, 2022 FACULTY HONOR: Ostriker, Stone, Binney elected to National Academy of Sciences May 3, 2022 View All News Footer Department of Astrophysical Sciences Peyton Hall, 4 Ivy Lane Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544 171 Broadmead Street Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08540 Facebook Administrative Inquiries: 609-258-3801; lipman@princeton.edu Undergrad/Grad Programs: 609-258-3803; pstrauss@princeton.edu Fax: 609-258-8226 Click map for directions.
