The minor enables students to study the dynamics of landscape and environmental topics within the department. Landscape studies address urgent challenges of coupled human and environmental systems at the threshold of profound environmental change. Exploring landscape as an eco-cultural artifact provides useful insights into a culture's relationship to nature. Minor Admission Details Applying to the Minor Minor Application Undergraduate students interested in pursuing the minor must fill out the Minor Application form. Please contact the Department for this form. Requirements for the Minor The minor requires 15 credits in landscape architecture.
