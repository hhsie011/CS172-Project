See the the Electronic Classrooms site to discover which rooms on campus are eClassrooms - registrar scheduled classrooms equipped with audiovisual control presentation systems. The program presenter will need a UC 6 + 2 to log into the classroom computer. A VGA cable is also supplied, for use of a personal computer. Students may borrow equiptment from the Langsum Library. If you plan to use the audiovisual in Zimmer Auditorium, you must notify Electronic Classroom Support Services (ECSS) at ecss@uc.edu or by calling 513-556-1977 at least 2 weeks prior to the event. Security Please contact Public Safety at 513-556-4923 to determine if security is necessary for your event. If Public Safety determines that security will be required for your event, you will receive an email advising you of the approximate cost and number of officers to expect. Account information will be requested before the event, but will not be processed until after the event so an exact total can be determined. Request a cost estimate for security. Locked Classrooms Public Safety is NOT responsible for opening classrooms rooms for an event unless an officer is assigned to the event. Public Safety’s responsibility is to insure that the exterior building doors leading to the classrooms are open; you will need to make other arrangements to open the classroom door. If you are faculty/staff, you can bring your ID to the Keys & Badges office and get a general classroom key. The other option to unlock classrooms is to call on the day of your event, 513-556-1111 [non-emergency], to request the door be unlocked. As long as you have a copy of the scheduled event, the officer should unlock the door for you. Note that the response time can vary depending on other emergency and non-emergency requests ahead of yours. Unlocking classroom doors is a very low priority for the officers. You or the event holder must have the confirmation from Conference & Event Services with him/her to have the door unlocked. Tables Students must supply their own tables inside or outside of the classroom. If you do not have access to tables, you can rent tables, chairs and other items Conference & Event Services (CES). If we are unable to rent, you can rent from a commercial rental company.

In labs, lab monitors enforce the policy. The policy is in the student handbook as well. Food at events must be placed outside the classroom, and it is your responsibility to notify our office so this detail can be noted in the event reservation. The sponsoring organization is responsible for cleaning up, so that the next use of the classroom is free from debris and trash. Organizations that fail to clean up are responsible for cleaning charges. Classroom Rental Rates The cost for using a classroom for your event depends on its type. Review the definitions of the event types to determine your cost. Programs scheduled outside of standard building hours will be assessed an hourly fee. Building hours change per academic schedule. Rental rates for classroom spaces by occupancy or type, and by type of event as described on the link to Event Policies above Room capacity University Event Rate UC Co-Sponsored Event Rate Non-University Event Rate Classroom for less than 100 $150 $225 $300 Classroom for more than 100 $250 $325 $500 Conference & Event Services 513-558-1810 Tangeman University Center, Suite 265 2766 UC MainStreet Cincinnati, OH 45221-0031 event.services@uc.edu UC Tools Canopy & Canvas One Stop Email Catalyst Shuttle Tracker IT Help UC VPN Bearcats Landing About Us Maps & Directions Jobs News Diversity Governance & Policies Directory Events Calendar University of Cincinnati | 2600 Clifton Ave. | Cincinnati, OH 45221 | ph: 513-556-6000 Alerts | Clery and HEOA Notice | Notice of Non-Discrimination | eAccessibility Concern | Privacy Statement | Free Speech | Copyright Information © 2020 University of Cincinnati Conference & Event Services 513-558-1810 Tangeman University Center, Suite 265 2766 UC MainStreet Cincinnati, OH 45221-0031 © 2020 University of Cincinnati scroll up to the top
