6:30 PM Zoom 09:30 AM (New York) 3:30 PM (Tunis) 4:30 PM (Amman) 5:30 PM (Istanbul) Among the world’s millions of refugees, there is concern that many may be excluded from their host countries’ national vaccine programs or face added barriers to access due to a shortfall of COVID-19 vaccine supplies. Even in host countries that have started vaccinating refugees, those who are undocumented may remain sidelined. Failure to include vulnerable populations in their coronavirus response will undoubtedly undermine a global recovery from the pandemic. This webinar brings together experts who will discuss the perils of vaccine nationalism. They will investigate what the international community needs to do to improve vaccination coverage for migrants and forcibly displaced people, and what is required to bring an equitable vaccine allocation process in refugee-hosting countries.
