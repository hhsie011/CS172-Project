The department maintains world-class facilities that enable scientific inquiry almost without limitations. In many cases, faculty, post-doctoral fellows, graduate and undergraduate students collaboratively pursue interdisciplinary research within the Chemistry department. The impact of the research is enhanced by the partnerships with colleagues in the medical school, biology, geology, physics, or engineering divisions. The Chemistry Department offers A.B., Sc.B. and Ph.D. degrees for excellence in scholarship and research.
