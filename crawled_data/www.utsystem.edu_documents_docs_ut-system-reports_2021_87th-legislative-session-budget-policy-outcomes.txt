However, the Comptroller released a revised revenue estimate in January 2021 that provided a more optimistic outlook for the current and 2022-23 biennium. Rather than the significant decrease in funding many had predicted in the early days of the pandemic, the new estimate anticipated that state general revenue funding would remain flat. As a result, UT institutions ended the session in a stronger financial position than initially anticipated.
