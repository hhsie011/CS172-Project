About Kevin Richardson Kevin Richardson was as a member of the group known as “The Central Park Five”, five Black teenagers who were arrested as suspects in the brutal attack of jogger in New York City's Central Park in 1989. Richardson was charged and sentenced to serve five to ten years in jail. After serving seven years for a crime he did not commit, Richardson was put on three years of probation, had to register as a sex offender, and was released from prison. In 2002, the convictions for the five men were overturned, and the City of New York agreed to pay them restitution for the time they spent wrongfully incarcerated. The 2019 Netflix series, “When They See Us”, chronicled the journey of Richardson and the other four. Richardson is now a strong advocate for the reformation of the criminal justice system and works tirelessly with The Innocence Project. Event Information This event is free and open the public.
