It anticipated the current boom for interdisciplinary research linking neuroscience with the humanities and the social sciences by several years, both at Columbia and elsewhere. Since 2001, the Academy has developed seminars and public events designed to spread word of the newest scientific advances and to bring together researchers in the sciences and the humanities; view videos in each event box (below). The Academy also supports researchers doing ongoing studies (see the Art, Humanities, and Neuroscience Fellowships page), and the Academy's Director, Prof. Freedberg, teaches a course assessing the potential of the cognitive neurosciences to illuminate critical problems in the humanities and the history of art and images ("The Work of Art in the Age of Digital Reproducibility").
