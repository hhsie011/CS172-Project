Degree Requirements Sample Curriculum GENERAL NOTES The Foundation Studio is required and is a prerequisite for the program. All students may petition to waive degree requirements by demonstrating equivalent study in any of the required course areas. ADVANCED STANDING The program grants advanced standing to qualified candidates up to two semesters. Students with advanced standing typically complete their degrees in 2 or 2.5 years. Qualified applicants are subject to review by the admissions committee, and must complete prerequisites, a mid-program portfolio review and 60 credits or more as prescribed in the Program-of-Work. The Program-of-Work considers the student’s previous college work as shown in transcripts, portfolio, statement of intent, and references. PROFESSIONAL ELECTIVE Professional electives are ‘guided’ electives in subjects integral to study of the discipline. Professional electives provide advanced study in Visual Communication, History or Theory, and Natural Systems. These electives allow students to select courses that best reflect their interests and curricular pursuits while meeting the requirements for a professional degree in landscape architecture. These courses ensure mastery, hone research skills, and encourage independent research. Professional electives are not taken as credit/no credit. The Graduate Adviser and the Landscape Architecture Graduate Studies Committee (LAGSC) identify qualifying Professional Electives before the start of Academic Advising each semester. FREE ELECTIVE Free electives must meet the enrollment requirements as specified in the Graduate Catalog and cover any field of study. PORTFOLIO REVIEW The Portfolio Review is required for all First Professional Degree Candidates. The Portfolio Review follows the third semester core studio LAR 694T and occurs during the Fall Semester Exam Week. Students produce and submit a portfolio of work that demonstrates their academic progress and mastery of the core course material to date. A panel of LAGSC members meet with each student to assess the student’s strengths and weaknesses, areas for improvement, and discuss their work in context of the student’s academic and professional objectives. Students must participate in the Portfolio Review before enrolling in LAR 695 or at the end of their first semester for any 60 credit hour students. The purpose of the portfolio review is primarily advising. In case of unsatisfactory progress toward completion of degree, the LAGSC, at their discretion, specifies a course of action, including course and design studio selection. The LAGSC re-reviews all students not making satisfactory progress during the exam period of their fourth semester.
