It is the official repository of articulation for California's public colleges and universities. Access the assist.org website and begin by selecting an institution. Steps to use Assist.org : Select Institution: Institution you would like to take a course at/completed course(s) at, and the Academic Year: The academic year refers to the catalog year you plan to enroll into/completed the course at the college/university Under Agreements with Other Campuses: Select California State University, Fullerton. We recommend searching utilizing the "By Department at: California State University, Fullerton" drop-down menu Wait for the page to refresh with results. Use the CSUF course name (Department and Number) to determine if there is an equivalent course or courses. If there is no articulation, there is no equivalent course at this college/university. Be sure to submit official transcripts from any and all completed transfer coursework to CSUF Admissions and Records, located in University Hall 114. *Note: You must apply at the institution and be admitted in order to be eligible to enroll at the college/university. * This site is maintained by Academic Advising Center.
