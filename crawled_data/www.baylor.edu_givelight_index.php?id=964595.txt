During the Give Light Campaign, the Honors College will focus their fundraising efforts in the following ways: Capital support to renovate and expand the Honors Residential College. Endowment support to fund scholarships for students, providing the best and brightest unfettered access to the College’s special brand of rigorous academic programming. Endowed faculty positions and programmatic support to broaden and deepen academic opportunities and prepare tomorrow’s academic leaders. The following are the Honors College’s highest priority fundraising projects that are being highlighted in the current phase of the Give Light Campaign. As these projects are funded, the College will bring forward other opportunities for the Baylor Family to support our talented students and faculty. Honors Residential College The Honors College is home to many of the brightest minds at Baylor University. The College must garner further support from alumni, parents and friends to grow its scholarship endowment, ensuring that those students who are drawn to Baylor by the promise of a faith-based approach to the highest levels of higher education are not limited in their acceptance due to financial concerns. Post-Doctoral Fellowships In keeping with a rich tradition of excellence in teaching, the Honors College is seeking funding to establish a Post-Doctoral Fellowship program to prepare the next generation of leading scholars to translate their research into compelling teaching. This program would allow the Honors College to recruit top researchers, providing them with an intensive experience in learning how to teach well and engage with students. Faculty Endowment Support The Honors College holds its faculty to the highest standards in scholarly discovery and innovative and compelling teaching. As we look to the future, the Honors College has identified increasing its faculty endowment as a fundamental to growth. The endowing of faculty positions serves the mission of the College, as it provides resources for faculty research, while also creating an attractive recruiting tool for scholars at the tops of their fields. A named, endowed position is an attractive and prestigious opportunity for faculty. Further support through endowed excellence funds provides the Honors College with faculty support in the form of equipment and research funds, as well as flexibility in providing support for student travel to conferences and competitions.
