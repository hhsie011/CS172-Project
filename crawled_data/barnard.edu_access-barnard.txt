Access Barnard seeks to bridge the gaps that first-time undergraduates often face as they transition into college. Access Barnard Resources Navigating Barnard Workshops Peer Mentoring Program Cohort Based Advising Sessions Supplemental Academic Support Application (SASA) Access Barnard Lending Library Laptop Loan Program AB Student Advisory Board Peer Academic Advisors (PAA’s) SASA Dashboard SASA Application The Supplemental Academic Support Application provides students with a single point of access to request funds for academic needs to support their educational progress during their time at Barnard. This includes support from the institutional Safety Net (a Barnard Annual Fund giving option). SASA Eligibility SASA Funding is available to all Barnard students. The committee reviews each application on a weekly basis. Scope of Awards Supported, in part, by the institutional Safety Net Fund, (a Barnard Annual Fund giving option), SASA grants can range from $25-$400. There are one-time grant exceptions based on student circumstances. The support provided through SASA is also a way to help connect students with resources at Barnard or Columbia. Additionally, SASA connects students with non-financial resources such as laptops or specialized advising. So even if students are unsure of how their request fits, we encourage them to apply and will work to connect them to the right place. The SASA committee meets every week to review requests. How To Apply The SASA application is available through your Barnard portal which can be found at portal.barnard.edu. You will be prompted to log in. Once logged in look under finances and you will see the SASA application listed.

Peer mentoring has been shown to enhance students' sense of belonging and satisfaction with their college experience and enhance psycho-social belonging. For students new to the college experience, peer mentors have been shown to be indispensable to the transition particularly for first-generation students. Currently, Opportunity Programs and the FLI program have each developed versions of peer mentoring. Access Barnard is enhancing this existing model to address a range of ways peer mentors can be utilized to support all first-year and transfer students as they navigate their experience at Barnard. Access Barnard mentors will: Peer mentors will provide specialized support such as first-year mentors, alum mentors and mentors in majors.
