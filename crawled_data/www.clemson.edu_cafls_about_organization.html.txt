Clemson PSA safeguards the health and safety of livestock, poultry and companion animals and protects the food supply and public health of South Carolinians through its Livestock Poultry Health division, while PSA’s Regulatory Services division ensures the safe, effective use of fertilizers and pesticides, and the quality of seeds and plants grown in the state and conducts programs that prevent agroterrorism. Clemson PSA works collaboratively with Clemson’s College of Agriculture, Forestry and Life Sciences for research and outreach through the Clemson Experiment Station and Cooperative Extension Service. Clemson PSA outreach and research facilities also include the Clemson Experimental Forest and South Carolina Botanical Garden, and a host of centers and institutes whose missions support and advance South Carolina’s agribusiness and forestry industries while also developing solutions to sustainability manage the state’s natural resources. Livestock Poultry Health The role of Clemson Livestock Poultry Health (LPH) is to protect animal health through control of endemic, foreign, and emerging diseases in livestock and poultry and to protect the health of S.C. consumers by providing a comprehensive inspection service to ensure that meat and poultry products are safe, wholesome and accurately labeled. LPH serves as South Carolina's animal health authority, state meat and poultry inspection department, and the state's veterinary diagnostic center in fulfilling its role. LPH Home Regulatory Services Regulatory Services protects the state from exotic and invasive species, ensures that pesticides are used safely, regulates the structural pest control industry, verifies that fertilizer and lime meet standards and labeled guarantees, conducts programs for seed and organic certification, provides diagnosis of plant pests, and ensures readiness to respond to a catastrophic event impacting the state's agriculture. Regulatory Home Partnerships Greenwood Genetic Center A partnership with the Greenwood Genetic Center allows graduate students to conduct basic research in human genetics. Physicians and scientists at Greenwood direct the research in collaboration with Clemson faculty from the Department of Genetics and Biochemistry. Greenwood Genetic Center Sonoco Products Company Sonoco Products Company has funded the purchase of equipment for the Sonoco Packaging Science Laboratory, provided funding for packaging science scholarships and employed undergraduate packaging students as co-ops and interns. Sonoco Products Company Cryovac Cryovac endowed a chair in packaging science and provides adjunct faculty for both packaging science and food science. Cryovac employs many Clemson graduates from all three departments and also hires undergraduates as interns and co-op students. Cryovac Pate Foundation The Wallace F.
