This diverse research footprint, which we call Energy@UT, is pioneering novel ways to enable energy sustainability – from state-of-the art technology for mitigating methane emissions to next generation anode materials for battery storage to radically smarter management of water resources in energy production. Fueling a Sustainable Energy Transition Over the next several years, the Energy Institute (EI) is funding a series of interdisciplinary projects to support the most promising global energy transition research at UT. The projects funded so far include 53 faculty members and researchers from nine schools across the university — from the Moody College of Communication and the Jackson School of Geosciences to the School of Architecture and the Cockrell School of Engineering. Interdisciplinary collaboration was a key criterion for award of EI funding, and the selected teams reflect different approaches from departments and disciplines throughout the university. From developing the next generation of battery packs and new solar-powered water purification systems to designing and optimizing techniques for carbon capture, these EI-funded projects attack a broad range of key issues that are critical to a sustainable energy transition.
