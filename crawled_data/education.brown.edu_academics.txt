Rigorous coursework, real-world experience and a particular focus on urban education are all at the forefront of Brown’s graduate and undergraduate education curricula. Both inside and outside the classroom, students learn how they can make a positive impact on the American education system through teaching, research or policy, creating urban schools that prioritize inclusion and celebrate diversity. Thanks to carefully forged partnerships with schools, civic leaders and non-profit organizations in Providence, students at the graduate and undergraduate levels have ample opportunity for practice-based experiences in classrooms and boardrooms — making for a more rigorous, meaningful and engaging learning experience.
