Sponsored by the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&U) and directed by Caryn McTighe Musil, Core Commitments was supported by a grant from the John Templeton Foundation. The PSRI was developed in 2006 by L. Lee Knefelkamp, Teachers College, Columbia University, who consulted with Richard Hersh, Council for Aid to Education, and drew on the research assistance of Lauren Ruff. The PSRI was refined in cooperation with Eric L. Dey and associates at the University of Michigan's Center for the Study of Higher and Postsecondary Education and refined after Dey's death by Robert D. Reason at Iowa State University. In 2011, Iowa State University began hosting the PSRI under the direction of Robert D. Reason. The PSRI is housed at the Research Institute for Studies in Education (RISE), a unit of the School of Education. RISE was formed in 1974 to conduct comprehensive, integrated research and evaluation studies that enhance PK-20 education locally, nationally, and globally. RISE promotes the integration of evaluation, research, and policy through partnerships with schools, colleges and universities, federal and state education agencies, and private agencies and foundations. AAC&U is the leading national association concerned with the quality, vitality, and public standing of undergraduate liberal education. Its members are committed to extending the advantages of a liberal education to all students, regardless of academic specialization or intended career. Founded in 1915, AAC&U now comprises 1300 member institutions--including accredited public and private colleges, community colleges, research universities, and comprehensive universities of every type and size.
