The UW campuses serve as living laboratories for a broad range of projects that address challenges and opportunities in operations, education and research. This exhibit was first displayed at the Bullitt Center as part of the SustainableUW Festival, and the displays are available for display by campus partners in whole or in part. The exhibit features posters detailing work by programs including the Campus Sustainability Fund, the Green Seed Fund, UW Sustainability's Green Certification Programs, UW Bothell and UW Tacoma, as well as collaborations between the UW's Master of Landscape Architecture Capstone Studio and the Capitol Hill EcoDistrict; Seattle City Light and the UW, and a UW multidisciplinary research team working with a grant from the National Science Foundation's Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation (EFRI). The exhibit also includes a timeline of sustainability at the University of Washington, and information on the Bullitt Center.
