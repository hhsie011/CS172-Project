A colorful block of houses in Copenhagen. (Courtesy of Professor John Campbell.) PreviousNext Because housing in Copenhagen is in short supply, it is likely that students will be notified about the specifics of their housing situation only 2-4 weeks before their departure to Denmark. Students should apply to the University of Copenhagen for housing as soon as possible after being accepted into the program. The University of Copenhagen has only a very few dormitories and no dining halls. Students should not expect the same level of amenities that Dartmouth offers its students in the dorms (e.g., high-speed internet access, free long distance telephone, etc.). Nor should students assume that they will necessarily be living with other Dartmouth students. Rental Agreements: Students will very likely be required to pay for housing for a longer period of time than they will actually be in Copenhagen. The typical rental agreement runs from mid-July through the end of January. Students can use the University of Copenhagen Housing Foundation to offer their rooms to other students for the end of the rental period (not the beginning) but Copenhagen cannot guarantee that another student will accept the offer. For their own financial reasons the Housing Foundation must work with fixed rental periods that correspond with the University of Copenhagen’s semester system, which unfortunately does not coincide with Dartmouth’s quarter system.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Sociology Undergraduate Overview Majors Minors Honors The Thesis Proposal Past Honors Theses Courses Course Schedule by Term First Year Seminars Introductory Courses Methods Theory Lower Division Upper Division Culminating Experience Prizes & Awards Research Awards Transfer Credit Careers Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story What is Sociology?
