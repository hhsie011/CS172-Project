Green space, athletic facilities and eclectic architecture ranging from the historic Temple Performing Arts Center to the state-of-the-art Charles Library form a vibrant residential setting. Main Campus is home to a variety of meeting, event and housing options for your program. The Student Center, Mitten and Morgan Hall, and most of our academic buildings may be used for groups of 1000 participants or more, including residential facility use during the summer months. Smaller conferences and events may be held year-round with limited residential options available. We are also a short ride on the subway, bus or regional rail to the heart of downtown, Old City and the sports complexes. Access detailed information about these spaces.
