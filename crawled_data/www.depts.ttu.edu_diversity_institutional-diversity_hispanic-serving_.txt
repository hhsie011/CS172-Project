In the Fall of 2020, Texas Tech boasted an undergraduate Hispanic student population of 29.7%. While HSI status is determined based on an undergraduate student body that is above 25% Hispanic, Texas Tech offers a comprehensive series of programs, services, initiatives, and organizations to underrepresented students, students of color, and first-generation students, many of whom are Hispanic. Additionally, Texas Tech focuses recruitment of future and potential students on rural areas of the state, resulting in the admission and retention of higher numbers of economically marginalized, first-generation, and rural students, including many underserved populations. Programs & InitiativesDevelopment, Resource & Professional Affiliations As a Hispanic Serving Institution, Texas Tech University fully understands the importance of and is committed to the support and promotion of diversity, equity, and inclusion in higher education. Such efforts, however, are not limited to any one culture, race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, ability or disability, economic status, age, or citizenship. With tremendous progress being made on issues of equity and inclusion at the national and state levels, it is vitally important for institutions of higher education to illuminate both the inequities and the opportunities that exist in our society. As a major university in one of the fastest growing states of the Union, Texas Tech University is uniquely positioned to positively influence the attitudes and opinions of Texans of the future, the majority of whom will be underrepresented students of color. To that end, Texas Tech will continue to expand efforts such as the ones listed above to carry out its promise to prepare leaders for challenges of the future.
