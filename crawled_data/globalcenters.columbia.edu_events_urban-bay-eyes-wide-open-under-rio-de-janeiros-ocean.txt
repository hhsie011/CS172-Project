4:45 PM Columbia University Urban Bay from Trailer of Urban Bay by Ricardo Gomes | UNDP RIO+ Centre Transcript Produced in partnership between the UNDP RIO+ Centre and Brazilian marine biologist/documentarist Ricardo Gomes, Urban Bay examines the marine life that exists under Rio de Janeiro’s iconic Guanabara Bay, a bay that has been shadowed in negative global attention during the Olympic Games in 2016 in Rio de Janeiro. Despite popular thought that the bay is inhospitable, Ricardo Gomes shows that there is a diverse world of marine life in Rio de Janeiro’s bay, although we do not know how long this resiliency will last. Directed and produced by Ricardo Gomes Supported by UNDP World Centre for Sustainable Development (RIO+ Centre) © 2017 Ricardo Gomes Contact information: [email protected] / + 55 21 3534 5122 In coordination with the United Nations Ocean's Conference - June 5-9 in New York City - the Columbia Global Centers I Rio de Janeiro, Columbia Engineering‎ and Rio+ UNDP World Centre for Sustainable Development will host the world premiere of URBAN BAY, a documentary by Ricardo Gomes. The film highlights the marine life that live closest to urban coastal areas. By demonstrating that life still exists in the waters closest to cities, this documentary brings a renewed motivation and inspiration to the proper management and conservation of oceans – which is also the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goal 14: “Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development.” See the full program here.
