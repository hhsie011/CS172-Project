In this presentation, Dr. Ravina Aggarwal, will draw from her extensive fieldwork in the Himalayan borderlands of Ladakh to provide insights on ethnography as a method of historical knowledge production. She will outline the strategies, tools, and ethical challenges of doing research in a place where historical truth is deeply contested and the very identity of a social group is at stake. The lecture will be followed by a participatory exercise. This program will inaugurate the 'Historical Methods Seminar Series' co-hosted by the Columbia Global Centers | Mumbai and the South Asia Institute at Columbia University in partnership with the Mumbai History Teachers Academy.
