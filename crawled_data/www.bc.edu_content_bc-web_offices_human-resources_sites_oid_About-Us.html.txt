A community that truly values and fully utilizes its diversity creates a climate where diverse perspectives can coexist and thrive. In keeping with the social justice imperatives inherent in our Jesuit, Catholic heritage, Boston College extends its welcome in particular to those who may be vulnerable to discrimination on the basis of their race, ethnic or national origin, religion, color, age, gender, marital or parental status, sexual orientation, veteran status, or disability. We support the University's Strategic Plan and Four Strategic Directions. Our vision is to create an inclusive environment that motivates us to be fully engaged in our community and that enables each of us to make the maximum contribution possible to the University. The ultimate success of this endeavor requires the proactive involvement of leadership and the entire community.
