When using the quick search, it is best to search by catalogue terms such as artist’s name, title, media, date, etc. Please note that a search for 1980, will yield those objects that were created in 1980, as well as works that were acquired in 1980, artists that were born in 1980, etc. For a more exact search of dates, please use the advance search. We are in the process of digitizing the collection, therefore, not all works are illustrated.
