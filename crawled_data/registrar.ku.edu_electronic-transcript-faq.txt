FAQ Electronic Transcript FAQ Transcript Key Records Forms University Seal Electronic Transcript FAQ Vendor Used by the University of Kansas to Send Electronic Transcripts The University of Kansas uses the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC) located in Herndon, VA, to send electronic transcripts. Sending a Transcript Electronically: Electronic Transcript Exchange (ETX) and E-mail (Secure PDF Transcript) Electronic Transcript Exchange (ETX): This system enables the University of Kansas to exchange transcripts with participating educational institutions and organizations. The information is exchanged through the NSC’s secure network. E-mail (Secure PDF Transcript): Transcripts are sent to a specific email address that is provided by the requestor. Sending a Transcript to an E-mail Address If a transcript is sent as a Secure PDF Transcript to an e-mail address, the transcript recipient will receive one email from the National Student Clearinghouse to access the transcript. The email will contain a link to a secure Internet page where the recipient can retrieve the official transcript. How Long Will the NSC Link be Active to View the Transcript The transcript link sent in the email is only accessible for 30 days from the date the transcript was originally sent. A local copy of the transcript on your computer can be saved and opened indefinitely. However, we do recommend saving the transcript as an Independent PDF Document immediately after opening for future viewing. How to Save a PDF as an Independent Document There are different methods that can used to save a transcript as an independent document that may be specific to your own computer/administrative software. If the options below do not work, you may need to consult the maker of your own computer/administrative software to identify available methods to convert a PDF into a word file/unprotected file. Use the print screen function on the computer keyboard and save each page of the transcript to a word document, save to your computer and use this file as your own independent (unofficial) copy. Print out the document from your order, scan it, save it to your computer, then use this file as your own independent (unofficial) copy. If the Transcript is Blank or Has Errors Issues described as blank pages or failure to open load or reload is a result of your computer not using Adobe as the default PDF reader/viewer. Note from NSC: For best viewing experience we recommend using the latest version of Adobe Acrobat. Adobe Reader will need to be set as the default PDF Viewer or you can open the transcript PDF file directly from Adobe Reader. The PDF viewer settings can be adjusted on your computer by locating “Devices and Printers” on your computer and setting “Adobe” as your default PDF viewer.
