RUL05.67.24 was originally developed upon the merger of the Department of Entomology and the Department of Plant Pathology in AY 2016-17. A departmental Governance Committee composed of elected Entomology and Plant Pathology faculty members developed the current RPT Rule for the merged Department of Entomology & Plant Pathology (DEPP) by combining the two separate RPT Rules for both former departments. The DVF in DEPP have found the current RUL05.67.24 to be too restrictive in its expectations and challenging in its interpretations by faculty members and RPT Committees at all levels. The current RPT Committee in DEPP reviewed other RPT Rules available in the college and developed a draft revised RUL05.67.24 based upon rubrics of college RPT Rules that all agreed were less restrictive and more straightforward to interpret. The draft revised RUL05.67.24 was then provided to the full DEPP faculty for their review and input, and a final revised RUL05.67.24 was produced in consultation with college and university administration that has been approved by the DVF and Department Head of DEPP as presented here.

Third, we made changes to better align our college rule with university rules (e.g., language regarding SFRs and removal of “Teaching” in the titles to allow for professional faculty with other designations such as “Clinical” or “of the Practice”).

The removal of this language was initiated due to a concern that the designation of broad categories of courses as not requiring final exams could conflict with needed final exams in certain courses under these broad categories. The exemption process is maintained and can be utilized for these course categories (and others) moving forward. (2) Final exams are shortened from three hours to two and a half hours.

Adjusting the exam period to five days will eliminate future fall terms in which the time between grades due and the beginning of winter break is too short to adequately fulfill student centric administrative functions that occur between terms.

REG 02.20.07 – Course Syllabus 2020-05-27 Revised - The Division of Academic and Student Affairs seeks revision to REG 02.20.07, Course Syllabus. The revision is being sought in order to: (1) realign the review of syllabi to ensure that they meet the syllabus regulation. The review currently takes place in UCCC. Under the proposed edits, this responsibility would shift to the college level, and each college would be required to certify (through the electronic course software) that the syllabi fulfill REG/POL 02.20.07 (Course Syllabus). Rationale: the syllabus reflects how a specific university approved course will be taught by a specific faculty member. Syllabi can include additional departmental or program-level requirements in addition to the University requirements (provided they are not in conflict with the REG). In this context, the programs and colleges are best equipped to review syllabi to ensure compliance with University regulations and department or program requirements. The proposed change in location of the syllabus review is a result of a curriculum review process discussion initiated by the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs group in consultation with the Office of Courses Curricula and Academic Standards, Registration and Records, and the Office of the Provost, that resulted in an agreed upon set of best practices for curriculum review at the college level. The best practices have been reviewed by the curriculum committees in each college as well as the University Courses and Curricula Committee (UCCC), the Council on Undergraduate Education (CUE), and the Graduate Council; (2) modify the elements to be included in the syllabi; (3) reflect the SACS requirement that colleges, departments, and programs maintain a copy of all course syllabi; (4) reflect changes in curricular processes that have taken place since the last revision to this policy; and (5) reflect changes to make the regulation inclusive of both graduate and undergraduate structures.

Removal of Section 3.2 regarding a five-year goal or plan. UNC Policy 400.3.3 is clear that career and development plans are only required in cases where an individual does not meet expectation on a post tenure review. Add Section 3.3 requiring timely completion of college-level processes by end of Spring semester. In Section 5.6, specify the faculty has 5 business days to respond to department assessment. This is consistent with the RPT process. In Section 5.11, eliminate requirement that all post-tenure evaluators review the UNC General Administration modules.

REG 04.20.07 – Adverse Weather and Other Emergency Conditions 2018-12-18 Revised - Updated to include clearer designations for mandatory personnel for adverse weather and/or other emergency conditions at the University There is a need to distinguish between adverse weather events and other emergencies.

REG 02.30.01 – Academic Honors 2018-10-30 Revised - We have removed references to Phi Eta Sigma and Alpha Lambda Delta honorary societies. NCSU has not been active in either since the late 2000’s. Deleted section 1.3: Valedictorian, Salutatorian, and Highest Ranking Scholar in a College. This provision is dated and causes a great deal of confusion, particularly for transfer students who feel they should be recognized even if they only bring less than 100 hours to NC State. Very few campuses do this, and it is nearly meaningless, given that we give A+ grades which result in large numbers of students with a 4.00+ GPA. Louis Hunt and I have agreed that Latin Honors, as stipulated here, are much more meaningful, and are consistent with best practices nationwide. RUL 05.67.400 – Department of Communication Reappointment, Promotion and Tenure Standards and Procedures 2018-09-19 Revised - Rationale: Largely editorial; clarified language regarding non-refereed publications; eliminated statements that were out of sync with current university policy on reappointment, promotion and tenure.

(2) In regards to Reasonable Suspicion Testing, give more flexibility to test for behavioral concerns; (3) Create an Evaluation Period that allows for testing to occur while the student-athlete is receiving counseling. This process acts as verification of progress in the program without undue penalties. A coach may enforce additional sanctions within this time for violation of team rules. (4) Create a new correctional measure category for Positive Tests for THC/Marijuana. This new category adds an intermediary step between the first violation and the second violation. This additional step evokes a suspension period of 10% of the NCAA Championship season. (5) Change the Violation Reduction for compliance from 24 months to 12 months. (6) Clarify the Evaluation Period for Self-Reporting & Assessment Testing.

At the request of Faculty Senate Executive Committee, a section was added to allow for waiving repayment in extraordinary circumstances (see 4.4.2). Human Resources also updated language related to retirement contributions and payroll and removed references to compensation at less than half salary (not our standard practice and can be problematic in meeting retirement/benefits deductions).

Since the MOU serves only as a statement of intent for the parties to engage in the proposed activities, and time-sensitive issues or the need for a short turn-around can present challenges for the execution of the MOU, the Provost’s Office desires to sub-delegate signature authority for such agreements to the Senior Vice Provost for Global Engagement. --The ORIED seeks to revise section 4.2 of the regulation to (1) reflect the revisions to UNC Policy Manual 500.4, effective 11/14/17, which no longer requires Chancellors to request delegation of signature authority for sponsored programs from the UNC Office of the President (2) to update changes to position titles and provide sub-delegation of signature authority for sponsored programs agreements to appropriate SPARCS senior staff, and (3) to provide a mechanism for SPARCS to sub-delegate signature authority for proposals in limited circumstances to additional university administrators (e.g. College Research Office directors).

REG 02.40.01 – Membership in the Graduate Faculty 2018-01-23 Revised - The changes to this regulation largely reflect the shifting expectations for tenure-earning faculty in conjunction with updating the current, anachronistic approach to one more in line with what is done nationally and among NC State’s peer institutions. Given the expectations that tenure-earning faculty will be mentoring graduate students, including, where relevant, PhD students from the onset to their careers, the existing structure of Full and Associate levels no longer reflects the realities of the institution’s expectations. Therefore, the change in this Regulation entails the removal of Associate status resulting in a single Graduate Faculty status, and the creation of an Affiliate status for those who will only serve on committees and/or teach. There are also numerous other editorial changes that clarify various aspects of the Regulation.

As a result, the policy has been adjusted to increase the cap on the amounts of certain non-salary compensation (the amounts were out of date) that could be approved by the Chancellor (or designee); to refine what is included and exempted from the definition of non-salary compensation; and to make other changes which would allow for more flexibility with respect to the authority to approve certain nonsalary compensation at the campus level.
