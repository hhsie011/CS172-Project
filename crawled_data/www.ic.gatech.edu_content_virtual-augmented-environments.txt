Research into virtual incorporates most aspects of computing, especially computer graphics, human-centered computing and computer vision. In the College of Computing, we are particularly interested in how virtual environments are designed, built and used. Examples of virtual and augmented environments research include: Augmented reality games. How do we design compelling multiple games that create new kinds of social experiences for their players? Mobile augmented reality interfaces. How do we present 3D information to mobile users, and how do they make sense of it, organize it and interact with it? Mixed-reality environments for distributed collaboration. Can a combination of virtual worlds and mixed reality serve as a foundation for new approaches to heterogeneous distributed collaboration? Natural interaction. By capturing human motion, can we develop more natural and intuitive forms of interaction with 3D worlds and games? Visual coherence. Can both photorealistic and non-photorealistic graphics algorithms be developed that seamlessly blend virtual content with our view of the physical world?
