It makes the case for phasing out fossil fuels, addresses imperatives and challenges regarding Africa's energy planning and financing, and outlines recommendations for immediate implementation. The study proposes and highlights 4 encompassing ideas in its vision for Africa's future in energy; The world's economy is going to decarbonize. This will impact pending oil and gas projects in Africa. However, Africa's potential in renewable energy sources such as solar and hydro energy will attract increased investments. Africa will need to focus its investments in green electrification and digitization. This includes adopting strategies that encourage less borrowing and more focus on achieving key SDGs such as quality education. Under the guidance of the AU, the international community should increase the capacity of African banks, such as the African Development Bank, to increase investments in infrastructure. Africa should use its vast resources such as minerals, manpower and biodiversity to build and increase its renewable energy production, including scaling up strategic mineral mining and African supply chains for photovoltaics, electric batteries, hydrogen and other green fuels, electric vehicles, and digital services. WEBINAR GOALS AND OBJECTIVES Columbia Global Centers - Nairobi will host the Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment (CCSI) in a presentation of their working paper on the Roadmap to Zero-Carbon Electrification of Africa by 2050 – The Green Energy Transition and the Role of Natural Resource Sector (Mineral, Fossil Fuels and Land). The program will bring together experts and policymakers in Africa from both the private and public sectors to discuss this report's proposed recommendations. Some of which include; Scaling up of investment in zero-carbon electrification, digital access and education. Aiming for 100% scale-up of zero-carbon electrification for African households by 2030. Promoting urbanization as part of the overall Africa development strategy in a bid to lower the cost of providing electrification, digital access and education. Increasing zero-carbon electricity from Africa's vast renewable resources, including solar, wind and geothermal. Setting up strong electricity laws, policies, regulations and institutions to ensure the sustainability of renewable energy programs. You can access the working paper in its entirety here.
