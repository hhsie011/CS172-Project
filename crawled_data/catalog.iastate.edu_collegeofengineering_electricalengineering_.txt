The Electrical Engineering program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org. The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECpE) at Iowa State University provides undergraduate students with the opportunity to learn electrical and computer engineering fundamentals, study applications of the most recent advances in state-of-the-art technologies, and prepare for the practice of electrical engineering. The student-faculty interaction necessary to realize this opportunity occurs within an environment that is motivated by the principle that excellence in undergraduate education is enhanced by an integrated commitment to successful, long-term research and outreach programs. The electrical engineering curriculum offers a number of emphasis areas at the undergraduate level, including control systems, electromagnetics and nondestructive evaluation, microelectronics and photonics, VLSI, electric power and energy systems, and communications and signal processing. Students are required to choose at least one course sequence that focuses on one of these areas; therefore graduates have substantial depth in specific areas to complement the breadth obtained in the required curriculum. Students also may take elective courses in computer networking, security, computer architecture, digital systems, and software. Student Learning Outcomes: Graduates of the Electrical Engineering curriculum should have, at the time of graduation: an ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics an ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences an ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions an ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies. Program Educational Objectives: The program objectives for the electrical engineering program describe accomplishments that graduates are expected to attain within five years after graduation. Graduates will have applied their expertise to contemporary problem solving, be engaged professionally, have continued to learn and adapt, and have contributed to their organizations through leadership and teamwork. More specifically, the objectives for expertise, engagement, learning, leadership and teamwork are defined below for each program. The objectives of the electrical engineering program at ISU are: Graduates, within five years of graduation, should demonstrate peer-recognized expertise together with the ability to articulate that expertise and use it for contemporary problem solving in the analysis, design, and evaluation of electrical and electronic devices and systems. Graduates, within five years of graduation, should demonstrate engagement in the engineering profession, locally and globally, by contributing to the ethical, competent, and creative practice of engineering or other professional careers. Graduates, within five years of graduation, should demonstrate sustained learning and adapting to a constantly changing field through graduate work, professional development, and self study. Graduates, within five years of graduation, should demonstrate leadership and initiative to ethically advance professional and organizational goals, facilitate the achievements of others, and obtain substantive results. Graduates, within five years of graduation, should demonstrate a commitment to teamwork while working with others of diverse cultural and interdisciplinary backgrounds. As a complement to the instructional activity, the ECpE department provides opportunities for each student to have experience with broadening activities. Through the cooperative education and internship program, students have the opportunity to gain practical industry experience. Students have the opportunity to participate in advanced research activities, and through international exchange programs, students learn about engineering practices in other parts of the world. Well-qualified juniors and seniors in electrical engineering who are interested in graduate study may apply for concurrent enrollment in the Graduate College to simultaneously pursue both the Bachelor of Science and Master of Science, the Bachelor of Science and Master of Business Administration, or the Bachelor of Science and Master of Engineering degrees.

Graduate Study The department offers work for the degrees Master of Engineering, Master of Science, and Doctor of Philosophy with a major in electrical engineering and minor work to students with other majors. Minor work for electrical engineering majors is usually selected from a wide range of courses outside electrical engineering. Master of Engineering degree is coursework only. It is recommended for off-campus students. The degree Master of Science with thesis is recommended for students who intend to continue toward the Doctor of Philosophy degree or to undertake a career in research and development. The non-thesis Master of Science degree requires a creative component. The department also offers a graduate certificate program in power systems engineering. The normal prerequisite to major in graduate work in electrical engineering is the completion of undergraduate work substantially equivalent to that required of electrical engineering students at this university. Because of the diversification in the electrical engineering graduate program, however, it is possible for a student to qualify for graduate study in certain areas of electrical engineering even though the student’s undergraduate or prior graduate training has been in a discipline other than electrical engineering. Supporting work, if required, will depend on the student’s background and area of research interest. Prospective students from a discipline other than electrical engineering are required to submit, with the application for admission, a statement of the proposed area of graduate study. The department requires submission of GRE General test scores by applicants. All students whose first language is not English and who have no U.S. degree must submit TOEFL examination scores. Students pursuing the Doctor of Philosophy must complete the department qualifying process. The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering is a participating department in the interdepartmental Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy degree programs in bioinformatics and computational biology. Students interested in these programs may earn their degrees while working under an advisor in electrical and computer engineering. Well-qualified juniors or seniors in electrical engineering who are interested in graduate study may apply for concurrent enrollment in the Graduate College to simultaneously pursue both the Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees, the Bachelor of Science and Master of Business Administration, or the Bachelor of Science and Master of Engineering degrees. Under concurrent enrollment, students are eligible for assistantships and simultaneously take undergraduate and graduate courses.
