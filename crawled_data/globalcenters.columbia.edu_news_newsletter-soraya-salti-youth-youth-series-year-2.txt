Four young leaders from the MENA region were hosted during the first year of the program, from November 2016 to May 2017, who spoke and interacted with fellow youth who stand to benefit from positive role models. December 31, 2017 Talks featured personal success stories on diverse issues, and provided insights into practical applications to complex challenges. The second year of the series, which was launched on September 26, 2017, by Nadine El Asmar, Lead Facilitator and Coach and Managing Director of NADAL Consulting and Contracting, has focused more on social entrepreneurship. Nadine delivered a talk and led a workshop that addressed how gaining self-awareness, choosing to take proactive perspectives of optimism, and managing one’s own emotions allows the youth to connect their daily choices with a sense of purpose and create value in society. The second event of the year took place on December 2, 2017 with Samar Dudin, a leading social entrepreneur and the Regional Director and Head of Programs for Ruwwad Al Tanmeya. Dudin led a workshop, The Impact of Community Led Campaigns (The Ruwwad Experience), which addressed social movement theory and shed light on a number of community organizing practices that help create meaningful and impactful community action. Columbia Global Centers | Amman launched the Soraya Salti Youth for Youth Series in November 2016 with the support of Mr. Waleed Al-Banawi, Founder and Chairman at JISR Venture Partners. The series, which is taking place over the course of five years, honors the incredible work and achievements of the late Soraya Salti, former President and CEO for Middle East and North Africa at INJAZ Al-Arab, in the field of youth education and entrepreneurship. The program established a speaker and workshop series by youth, and for youth, which focuses on themes of gender equality, entrepreneurship, innovation, and leadership, among others.
