A fleet of 24 meteorological towers dubbed StickNet and 2 Ka-band mobile Doppler radar trucks are deployed by the TTUHRT to gather pertinent wind and thermodynamic measurements. A list of deployments conducted by the TTUHRT can be found on our new webpage, along with information about our instrument suite. Mission: TTUHRT is dedicated to mitigating the effects of landfalling hurricanes on life and property. To learn more, this link will connect you with stories featuring TTUHRTs efforts in this area of research and study. Also featured will be stories related to the National Wind Institute (NWI).
