Description The course includes lectures about how entrepreneurship is changing the world, how students can be a part of that change, and meetings with successful entrepreneurs sharing their lessons as master innovators. The course encourages students to put their skills to the test by working in teams to design ventures and present them at the conclusion of the program. Students are asked to bring their ideas, energy, questions and to get ready for a jam-packed week of engaging with talented youth from across Nairobi all interested in making the world a better place. Objectives In our interconnected and rapidly advancing society, innovation and entrepreneurship are becoming increasingly important. Building Blocks seeks to respond to these new dynamics by inspiring the next generation of entrepreneurs. Specifically, Building Blocks looks to collaborate with Columbia Global Center | Nairobi to introduce high school students to social entrepreneurship. Facilitators Current and former members of the Columbia Organization of Rising Entrepreneurs (CORE) will lead curriculum development and course facilitation, with the possibility of additional student founders who are experienced in social entrepreneurship.

At Columbia, she served as the 2018-2019 president of CORE, published research with the Columbia Earth Institute, and worked with accelerators and startups. Upon graduation, Irene will be working as a product manager. She plays racquetball and enjoys raising awareness about Korean culture in her free time.

Intended audience The intended audience for this workshop is approximately twenty (20) 9 - 12th-grade students who are interested in learning more about social entrepreneurship and are fluent in English. Format Our workshop incorporates both online and offline learning and collaboration, reflective of industry discussions of “future of work.” Our workshop incorporates flipped teaching, with recordings of course content and online sessions. Prior to online sessions, instructors provide students with taped and published course content through a private classroom portal. Online sessions consist of activities, brainstorming, and collaboration exercises to add dimension to students’ understanding and engagement. For the duration of the workshop, there will be two hours of online sessions on each day. Instructors provide regular office hours, chats with guest speakers on ecopreneurship, and feedback on students’ work. To check students’ understanding and mastery of the material, there are short assignments and quizzes, and every student presents their idea through a pitch deck to a wider audience.
