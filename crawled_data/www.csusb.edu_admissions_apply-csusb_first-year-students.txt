We welcome all undergraduate, first year, and transfer students to contact us for assistance. Pre-Application Appointment Preparing to Apply As you begin thinking about College and choosing a major, developing a good set of study skills and setting a high standard for the grades you learn are important factors in being admitted as a First-Year Student. With no standardized tests being utilized by the CSU for this academic year, it is even more important to participate in programs or clubs available at your school to support students who are interested in going to college. (AVID, Future Leaders, etc.) This is also a critical time to begin saving for college expenses and learning about Financial Aid and Scholarships. Take the opportunity to do your best in the Early Assessment Program (part of the CAASPP/Smarter Balanced Assessment) in the 11th grade. It’s results, along with your GPA, higher level courses during the 12th grade, affect your placement in English and math courses in College. Additional planning tools can be found at Cal State Apply. Admission Requirements California State University, San Bernardino is an impacted CSU campus for Undergraduate First-Year and Transfer students. This means that, CSUSB receives more eligible applicants during our initial application filing period than can be accommodated in the incoming class. Our campus is impacted at both the Campus and Program Level. As part of campus level impaction additional admission standards have been set for students graduating from California high schools outside of our defined local area. Additional information about CSU Impaction, and how it can effect you can be found at the CSU, Chancellor's Office website. CSUSB information, including Campus and Program Level Impaction can be found on our First-Year Impaction Criteria website. First-Year applicants must meet the following eligibility requirements: Graduate High School: All applicants must be a High School Graduate or Equivalent GPA: Earn a qualified "A-G" grade point average (GPA) as described below A-G courses: Complete the 15 unit comprehensive "A-G pattern with a grade of C- or better by high school graduation Grade Point Average Requirements As an impacted campus, at the first-year student level, San Bernardino will use Multi Factor Admission Score for all programs for California residents and graduates of California high schools earning a 2.50 or greater “a-g” GPA and Non-California residents may be eligible for admission to the CSU by earning a 3.00 or greater “a-g” GPA. CSU San Bernardino may also review applicants with an “a-g” GPA between 2.0 and 2.49 using supplemental factors. Local Area Applicants: First-Year non-impacted major applicants graduating from a high school within CSUSB’s defined local area will be required to meet a minimum 2.50 GPA to be reviewed for admission. A list of local area High Schools can be found on our impactions criteria web site. Students whose GPA’s are between 2.00 - 2.49 will be considered as space is available after a review of the overall applicant pool. A Multi Factor Admission Score (MFAS ) may be used to determine eligibility for admission to the campus and major you are applying for. Out of Local Area Applicants: The minimum qualifying GPA for first-year non-impacted major applicants graduating from a High School outside of the defined local area will vary depending on the number of qualified applicants received at the end of the priority application filing period and enrollment limits. The minimum qualified GPA will vary each term. A list of local area High Schools can be found on our impactions criteria web site. A Multi Factor Admission Score (MFAS)may be used to determine eligibility for admission to the campus and major you are applying for. Out-of-state/non-resident applicants: First-year non-impacted major applicants graduating from a High Scholl outside of California will be required to meet a GPA of minimally a 3.0 to be required for admission. Students whose GPA’s are between 2.5 - 2.99 will be considered as space is available after a review of the overall applicant pool. A Multi Factor Admission Score (MFAS) may be used to determine eligibility for admission to the campus and major you are applying for. Multi Factor Admission Score CSU campuses will be utilizing a Multi Factor Admission Score beginning in the Fall 2021 term. This MFAS score is a combination of your GPA in A-G coursework, and additional applicant attributes such as work experience, and participation in educational programs, veterans status, etc. The combination of GPA and attributes will provide a score that will determine whether you are eligible for admission to the campus and major you are applying for. The SAT or ACT is no longer required for the Fall2021/Fall 2022 term and will not be utilized as part of the Multi Factor Admission Score. A critical component of the MFAS is completion of the A-G college preparatory pattern of courses with grades of “C-” or better: Comprehensive A-G Pattern The CSU requires a minimum 15-unit pattern of courses for admission as a first-time freshman. Each unit is equal to a year of study in a subject area. A grade of C- or better is required for each course you use to meet any subject requirement. For more information on the A-G Pattern, visit the CSU Freshman: Admission Requirements website.
