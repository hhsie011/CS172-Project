Graduate Student Fellows Nicole Sintetos CSREA Interdisciplinary Opportunity Graduate School Fellow, 2021-2022 Ph.D. candidate in American Studies, Brown University [email protected] Nicole Sintetos is a Ph.D. candidate in American Studies at Brown University, where she is also an affiliate at the Institute at Brown for Environment and Society (IBES). Her dissertation, “Reclamation: Race, Labor, and the Mapping of Settler States,” is a long durée environmental history of Tule Lake Segregation Center. Over the course of five chapters spanning chronologically from the 1873 Modoc War to the passage of the Environmental Protection Act in 1970, the dissertation reads global processes through the space of the local in order to make legible the entanglements of race, labor, and settler colonial technologies that formed in the wake of shifting Bureau of Reclamation policies. Her teaching and research sit at the intersection of relational ethnic studies, critical geography, science, technology and society studies, and environmental history. In 2021, she will serve as the co-PI alongside Erin Aoyama for an NPS-funded digital humanities initiative, the Japanese American MemoryscapeProject.
