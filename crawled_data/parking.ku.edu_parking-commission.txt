The Commission is comprised of students, faculty, unclassified and university support staff appointed by the Provost. Each year, the Parking Commission sends rules changes to the Provost for final administrative approval. Changes generally go into effect on August 1. More information about the Parking Commission can be found in the University Senate Code. Contact University Governance at 785-864-5169 if you are interested in serving on the Parking Commission. Commission Meetings The Parking Commission usually meets once per month, September through May. Special meetings may be called by the Chair or at the request of four members of the Commission. In addition, the Parking Commission hosts two public meetings each year, usually in October and March. An email will be sent out two weeks in advance of the forum date to all students, faculty and staff advising them of the time/date. Please contact KU Parking for information about future meeting dates and for meeting agendas and minutes.
