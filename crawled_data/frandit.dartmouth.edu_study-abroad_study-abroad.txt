Currently, eight term-long programs take place annually: five in France and three in Italy. *Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some study abroad opportunties have been altered. Please consult the Guarini Institute's website for the most current information.* Paris FSP Toulouse LSA+ Rome LSA+ Lyon LSA PreviousNext Program Options Language Study Abroad programs (LSA) allow students with the equivalent of two terms of college French or Italian to complete their Dartmouth language requirement while living with a French or Italian host family and taking courses in grammar, literature and civilization. Advanced Language Study Abroad (LSA+) is offered to students who have completed the Dartmouth language requirement and wish to advance their language skills while living with host families and taking courses in language, literature and art history. Foreign Study Program (FSP) is our most advanced program and offers students the opportunity to further enhance their language skills and cultural understanding while living with host families and taking courses in language, literature and French civilization. The Full Immersion Rome Experience (FIRE) provides students with an opportunity to immerse in the language and culture of Rome and other areas of Italy. The program fulfills two-thirds of the Dartmouth language requirement. Locations The Italian LSA/LSA+ in Fall term, LSA+ in Winter term, and Full Immersion Rome Experience (F.I.R.E.) in Summer term, all take place in Rome. The French LSA/LSA+ takes place in Lyon in Winter term and in Toulouse in Spring term. The French FSP takes place in Paris in Fall, Winter and Spring terms. Faculty Student groups are always accompanied by a Dartmouth faculty member, who teaches one of the on-site courses. Other courses are taught by local French and Italian faculty associated with area universities. The total linguistic and cultural immersion inherent to LSA, LSA+, FSP and FIRE is a crucial element of their success. How to Apply Applicants must apply online at the Off-Campus Programs website.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of French and Italian Undergraduate Overview Placement Information & Exams Transfer Credit Areas of Study & Course Descriptions French Language Courses French Upper Level Courses French and Italian in Translation Italian Language Courses Italian Upper Level Courses Course Schedules 2023-2024 French Courses 2022-2023 French Courses 2021-2022 French Courses 2022-2023 Italian Courses 2021-2022 Italian Courses Majors French Italian Romance Languages French Studies Italian Studies French or Italian as a Modifier Minors Honors Thesis Program The Thesis French Timeline Italian Timeline Endowed Research Grant Study Abroad Overview French LSA/LSA+ Toulouse FSP Paris Italian Full Immersion Rome Experience (FIRE) Italian LSA/LSA+ Rome Opportunities Overview Apprentice Teacher Info Co-Curricular Opportunities Affinity Housing/Global Village French Language Program Italian Language Program Job Opportunities Director's Assistant Positions in Rome Student Awards and Prizes Arianna Pagani ’93 Memorial Prize In French And Italian Bruno Tollon Prize In French Studies Cloise Appleton Crane Prize In French And Italian François Denoeu Memorial Prize French Consulate Prize George E.
