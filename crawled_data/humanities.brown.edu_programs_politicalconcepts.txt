Political Concepts enhances critical questioning of the political in the widest sense of the notion. Participants operate under the assumption that our era urgently needs a revised political lexicon that would help us better understand the world in which we live and act, and that the humanities at large can and should contribute toward such a revision. Some have proposed revisions of "key" political concepts (including their status as "key concepts"), others showed the political work done by terms and common nouns that are not usually considered “political,” and yet others invented new concepts, trying to capture and explicate what has hitherto been unnoticed or unaccounted for. The Initiative has two components developed in collaboration with colleagues from Columbia University, CUNY, NYU, and The New School: a series of annual conferences and workshops and the online journal Political Concepts: A Critical Lexicon. Political Concepts: A Video Lexicon Conference 2022 February 25 – 26 Online Schedule and abstracts Events The initiative hosts an annual conference at the Cogut Institute in addition to ad hoc reading groups.
