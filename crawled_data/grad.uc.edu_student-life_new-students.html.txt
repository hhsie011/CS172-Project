News GradCURRENTS Archive Student Handbook Policies & Forms Forms/Petitions Grievances Welcome New Students Congratulations on becoming part of the University of Cincinnati community! The Graduate School staff wants to help you get oriented to the UC campus and your new graduate program. Below, you'll find a short guide to the most important information you'll need as a new graduate student. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact us online or call 513-556-4335. Campus Life Resources Campus Maps Get to Know Cincinnati Learn UC Lingo Safety Services After You're Admitted Make sure you have received your UCID ("M-number") and Central Login username ("6+2"). Follow the instructions to change your default password. Then log in to your UC email account. All official university information, including registration dates, financial aid information and graduation deadlines, is sent to your UC email address. Be sure to check your email regularly as you prepare to start your program. UC offers limited official housing for graduate students, so apply as early as possible if you want to live in a UC apartment complex. Houses and apartments are also available for rent from outside landlords throughout the area. The UC student government partners with a rental company to provide listings for many of these options. If you are an international student, you can reach out to UC International for help with getting settled in Cincinnati. Check out their Life at UC page for good advice on adjusting to UC and American campus life. Before You Start As the start of your program approaches, contact your academic advisor to discuss the classes you would like to take. If you don't have an advisor, your program's director or staff member can point you in the right direction. Once you are ready to register for classes, you will use Catalyst, the student information system. You should also make sure all of your financial information is correct, because bills are due five days before the term begins. Contact the One Stop Student Service Center at 513-556-1000 or onestop@uc.edu with any questions. Finally, you should check into your options for health insurance. When you register for six or more credit hours, you are automatically enrolled in UC Student Health Insurance, a gold-tier plan with on-campus healthcare providers. If you will be a graduate assistant, you may be eligible for the Graduate Student Health Insurance (GSHI) award, which covers 70% of the insurance premiums. However, if you already have insurance coverage, you can waive the student insurance fee through Catalyst. Arriving on Campus If you will be on campus this semester, take a few minutes to get familiar with the UC campus map. As a new UC student, one of the first things you should do is get your UC ID card. UC ID cards are managed by the Keys & Badges office, located in 4 Edwards Center. You can submit a photo for your UC ID card online (although they will need to see a copy of a government-issued photo ID, such as a driver's license or a passport, to authenticate your photo). Your ID card can double as a "Bearcat Card," which is a debit card system accepted for purchases on and around campus. If you will have a car at UC, you can purchase parking permits at Parking Services, also in 4 Edwards Center. If you won't have a car, or simply don't want to deal with parking, UC offers an excellent shuttle system around campus and the surrounding community.
