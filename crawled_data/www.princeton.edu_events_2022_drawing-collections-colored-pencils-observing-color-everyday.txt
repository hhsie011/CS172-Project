Weekly classes are taught by artist-instructor Barbara DiLorenzo over Zoom. Each week’s lesson is inspired by a work in the Museum’s collections. This live art-making class is inspired by Odilon Redon’s Vase of Flowers. By 1890, Redon was concentrating exclusively on the lyrically suggestive possibilities of color, creating atmospheric pastels of imaginary floral arrangements and sleeping figures. In this session we will explore how to achieve a range of colors by layering them. We will create lush flowers with two or three layers of color.
