You may be noticing you are feeling more stressed, anxious, irritable, or may have a hard time concentrating and getting tasks done. You are not alone. Prior to COVID-19, you may have had ways to manage your stress- often known as coping mechanisms. This may have included going to a MindBody Lab on campus, grabbing a coffee with your friends, or knocking on your friend’s door to chat. You may notice an increase in your level of stress while some of your coping mechanisms are not currently accessible. How to use this guide Below you will find a list of mindfulness and stress reduction activities you can do at home to help manage your emotional well-being. Please note that some of these techniques may work better for you than others and that’s okay. Explore and find what mindfulness and relaxation techniques work best for you.
