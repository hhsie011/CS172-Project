The thesis experience allows a student to get to know, and work closely with, a faculty member. The MCM Honors Program is intellectually demanding and time-consuming; students should be willing to devote a substantial part of their senior year to the thesis. Students work under the guidance of a department faculty advisor and second reader. Where appropriate, the advisor or the reader, but not both, may be in another department. 6th semester (April Deadline)—Submit letter of intent 7th semester—(During Pre-Registration period) Register for MCM1980 7th semester—(First day of semester) Submit Honors Proposal 8th semester—Register for MCM1990 NOTE: Students enrolled in the Brown | RISD Dual Program have the choice to which year (year 4 or 5) they would like to pursue honors. Students carefully consider whether working on a thesis at Brown and a degree project at RISD would compliment each other if done simultaneously or if they'd be best pursued in different years.
