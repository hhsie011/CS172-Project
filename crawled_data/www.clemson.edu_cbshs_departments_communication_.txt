A Brief History The history of Clemson University’s Department of Communication dates back to the 1980s when Communication courses were taught in the Departments of English and Performing Arts in the College of Liberal Arts. A Department of Speech and Communications was created in 1995 in the College of Architecture, Arts and Humanities, a new college created after a comprehensive university reorganization that same year. In the early 2000s, the department was renamed the Department of Communication Studies and, over the next 15 years, the department added new faculty, launched a new undergraduate degree in sports communication, opened a Social Media Listening Center, reinvigorated the debate program, and launched a new master’s degree program. During an academic college reorganization in 2016, the newly renamed Department of Communication joined the new College of Behavioral, Social and Health Sciences. Approximately 40 faculty (14 tenured/tenure-track, 17 full-time non-tenure-track, and several adjunct faculty), 325 undergraduate majors, 300 undergraduate minors, 20 graduate students (nearly all on funded assistantships), and three staff members study and work across the department’s programs and engage through its facilities and co-curricular initiatives.

Skye Assistant Professor of Communication vwingat@clemson.edu TV News Partnerships WYFF 4 and Clemson University have established an academic partnership that will allow members of Clemson student media to work alongside industry professionals in a satellite news bureau located on Clemson’s campus. The partnership makes Clemson the only university in South Carolina to feature an on-campus news bureau occupied by an outside media organization. WYFF 4 is the top station in South Carolina’s largest media market. The station houses the news bureau alongside Clemson’s student media organizations in the Hendrix Student Center. The station set up its news bureau in the Hendrix Student Center alongside Clemson’s student media organizations. The academic partnership will provide valuable experiential learning opportunities for students interested in a wide range of careers in media. The directory of the Department of Communication says the partnership also brings the communication department more in line with the makeup of those in the country’s top research universities. Clemson students get a view of the current media landscape that no other institution in the state can provide. The student media experience at Clemson is now much richer with seasoned professionals reporting right from our campus on breaking and general news across the state. The news bureau places reporters on Clemson’s campus where they can be close to faculty experts and breaking news at the university. Space set aside in the student media suite also allows reporters to go live from campus whenever necessary. WYFF 4 reporters and Clemson students work in tandem with the nearby Anderson bureau to more effectively cover news in the Upstate region. The opportunities for student involvement include reporting and videography, producing, promotions, marketing, directing and more. Our students gain the kind of experience departments, schools and colleges of communication across the nation will no doubt envy as they gain resume building experience as communicators.
