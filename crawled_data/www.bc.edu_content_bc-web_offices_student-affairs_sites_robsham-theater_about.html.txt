As part of the Division of Student Affairs, the RTAC facilities (The Robsham Main Stage, the Bonn Studio, the Brighton Dance Studios, and 300 Hammond Pond Parkway) are the primary venues for theatrical, dance, music, cultural, and lecture presentations for the University community. We are a nexus for learning and formation at Boston College, as the arts are a crucial element of educating the whole student in the Jesuit Catholic mission of higher education. The Robsham Theater Arts Center instructs and guides students in the presentation of their art, culture, and ideas to a broad audience in a professional manner, creating an environment in which students will grow intellectually and spiritually by participating in the presentation and observation of new ideas. Additionally, the Robsham Theater Arts Center enhances classroom learning by teaching students workplace practices they will need in their professional careers.
