Each quarter, you may add and drop classes with no restrictions until the end of the second week of the quarter (the Unrestricted Drop period). Between weeks 3 and the last day of instruction you have two options for dropping classes: 1) You may drop one course per quarter using your self-serve Quarterly Drop via MyUW. 2) To drop more than one class during the Late Course Drop period, you may use the Adviser-Assisted Drop Process.
