You are here: Home / Workplace Violence Workplace Violence Your actions may help calm a potentially violent situation, or they may escalate the problem. Behave in a manner that helps calm a situation. Stay calm and don’t be in a hurry. Be empathetic. Show you are concerned. Try to have the person and you sit down; sitting is a less aggressive position. Try to be helpful, for example, schedule an appointment for a later time. Give positive outcome statements, such as, “We can get this straightened out.” Give positive feedback for continued talking, such as, “I’m glad you’re telling me how you feel.” Stay out of arms’ reach and leave yourself with a clear exit path. Have limited eye contact. Take notes. Avoid exacerbating behaviors: Do not patronize. Do not yell or argue. Do not joke or be sarcastic. Do not touch the person If someone becomes agitated: Leave the scene immediately, if possible. Call the police at 911 (or on the Ithaca campus call Cornell Police at 607 255-1111 from a cell phone) from a safe place. Or, call a co–worker, using an agreed-upon code word to indicate trouble. Practice preventive measures: Avoid scheduling appointments for times when no one else is in the area. Remove sharp and blunt objects from desks. Try to avoid working alone after hours. If you have to work late, advise a friend or family member. When working after office hours, keep doors locked and do not open the door unless you are expecting someone. Do not leave money or valuable belongings lying around. Purses should be locked in a desk or cabinet. Lock your office and/or lab doors when they are not in use, even when you are leaving for “just a moment.” Always walk in well-lit areas and know your surroundings. If you think you are being followed, do not go home; go where there are other people. Call the police at 911 (or on the Ithaca campus call Cornell Police at 607 255-1111 from a cell phone) as soon as you are in a safe place. Report any strange or unusual activities immediately to your supervisor and the police. Report any locks, windows or lights that are in need of repair to your building coordinator.
