A student is eligible to receive the Herff Engineering Merit Scholarship for a maximum of 8 semesters. This includes the initial award year (2 semesters) and 6 additional semesters. A student may petition the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and Administration to put their award on hold for a maximum of 2 semesters. 2. The scholarship will be terminated if the student changes to a non-engineering major. 3. A student awarded a Herff Engineering Merit Scholarship must make progress toward an engineering degree during the academic year (Fall, Spring). This requirement varies depending on major, but in general, implies that you are on track according to the standard curriculum plan of your program (see the catalog). If you have questions, contact the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and Administration. You may petition the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and Administration to count courses taken in the summer toward this requirement. No scholarship money will be allocated for summer courses. A student must be full-time during each of the regular semesters (Fall, Spring). Failure to make adequate progress toward degree may result in the termination of the Herff Engineering Merit Scholarship. 4. During the first two semesters, a student must maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.00 or higher. Thereafter, the student must maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.25 or higher. If the student’s cumulative GPA is below the specified target for any single semester, the scholarship may be terminated. In subsequent semesters, if your GPA achieves the minimum, you may appeal to the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and Administration to have your scholarship reinstated. It is the student’s responsibility to initiate this appeal. 5. Your award amount may be adjusted based upon your total award package, and financial aid guidelines. 6. Recipients of the Herff Engineering Merit Scholarship are ineligible to apply for other Herff Engineering private or departmental scholarships, unless they receive permission from the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs and Administration. 7. The specific scholarship fund from which your award is made may change from year-to-year.
