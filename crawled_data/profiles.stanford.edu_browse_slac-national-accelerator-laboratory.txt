Prof. Abel's group explores the first billion years of cosmic history using ab initio supercomputer calculations. He has shown from first principles that the very first luminous objects are very massive stars and has developed novel numerical algorithms using adaptive-mesh-refinement simulations that capture over 14 orders of magnitude in length and time scales. He currently continues his work on the first stars and first galaxies and their role in chemical enrichment and cosmological reionization. His group studies any of the first objects to form in the universe: first stars, first supernovae, first HII regions, first magnetic fields, first heavy elements, and so on. Most recently he is pioneering novel numerical algorithms to study collisionless fluids such as dark matter which makes up most of the mass in the Universe as well as astrophysical and terrestrial plasmas. He was the director of the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology and Division Director at SLAC 2013-2018.

He is leading a research team that focuses on developing an understanding of the factors determining the catalytic properties at the interface between gas/solvent and solid surfaces and to apply these insights to processes and catalysts of importance for energy transformations and for sustainable chemical production. His research takes advantage of computer facilities at SLAC and Stanford to gain the necessary understanding and to link these simulations to experiments where new catalyst synthesis methods are developed, and the catalyst materials are characterized both in terms of performance (activity, selectivity, durability, etc.) and in terms of geometrical and electronic structure. The underlying philosophy of his research is that by having a fundamental understanding of the way surfaces catalyze a chemical reaction we can make a quantum leap in our ability to make predictions for new catalysts and processes. This requires the development of a theory of heterogeneous catalysis, including electrocatalysis, based on computational and experimental results. Dr Abild-Pedersen has extensive experience with simulations and modeling of chemical reactions. His work began with the derivation of energy correlations in catalysis that have helped speed up screening for active, selective and stable catalysts for energy conversion as a graduate student working with Professor Jens K. Nørskov at the Technical University of Denmark. He moved to SLAC in 2010 as a staff scientist and helped build up SUNCAT and define research directions in the field of heterogeneous catalysis.
