There is no need to interrupt work and family to move to a college or university campus and no loss of pay and benefits while you earn graduate credits. No distinction is made on the transcript indicating that a course or program of study was completed in a distance learning mode. The FSU College of Education is fully accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). Each course has a fully qualified and experienced instructor who has earned a doctoral degree. Some programs incur the extra expense of providing course mentors as a student support service. You control time commitments to meet course requirements. There are no classes to attend on a structured schedule and study is self-paced within a learning module format. You learn how to collaborate in an online learning community, as much as you might in a true “learning community.” Courses are designed with a theory-to-practice outcome; class members strive to become “scholar-practitioners.” Learn more about our online offerings at the links below: Athletic Coaching (Master's Degree; Graduate Certificate) Autism Spectrum Disorder (Master's Degree; Graduate Certificate) College Teaching (Graduate Certificate) Curriculum and Instruction (Master’s Degree) Educational Leadership/Administration (Master’s and Specialist Degrees; Modified Certificate) Educational Leadership and Policy (Doctoral Degree) Educational Psychology: Learning and Cognition (Master’s Degree) Human Performance Technology (Graduate Certificate) Institutional Research (Graduate Certificate) Instructional Design and Technology (Graduate Certificate) Instructional Systems and Learning Technologies (Master’s Degree) Learning Design and Performance Technology (Doctoral Degree) Measurement and Statistics (Master's Degree) Online Teaching and Learning (Graduate Certificate) Program Evaluation (Graduate Certificate) School Counseling (Master’s/Specialist) Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) (Master's Degree) Visual Disabilities (Master's Degree) Tuition and fee information for online programs can be found here.
