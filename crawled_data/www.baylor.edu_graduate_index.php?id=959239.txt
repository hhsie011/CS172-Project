All of the information you will need to prepare your dissertation or thesis for submission to the Graduate School can be found through the links provided on this site. Also, be sure to attend one of the Formatting Workshops (see below) offered each fall and spring semester. Forms and Signatures for Defense As students prepare for online defenses, we have been getting a lot of e-mails on how to complete signatures. Here are instructions regarding the e-signature process for forms related to dissertation and thesis defenses. Signatures can be electronically signed through Adobe Acrobat Reader. All Baylor students, staff, and faculty should have free access to Adobe Acrobat Reader, with the "Fill & Sign" feature. To download, click here: https://www.baylor.edu/helpdesk/index.php?id=972716. After the defense, students will upload these supplemental pages into the dissertation and thesis submission system. The Signature Page Download from the box file: https://www.baylor.edu/graduate/index.php?id=959242 If you have trouble opening the file after you download it, try opening the file from your "Downloads" folder in your computer's File Explorer. Be sure to submit your completed signature page along with your dissertation or thesis draft for the preliminary review. Convert the document into a sign-able form by selecting "Print as PDF." This will take away the fill-able sections. For further instructions on how to sign the document in Adobe Acrobat Reader, see: https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/signing-pdfs.html If you have questions after reviewing these documents, please contact Sandra Harman in the Graduate School office. Helpful Links Why Formatting? All dissertations and theses are archived digitally in BearDocs and may be made available internationally via ProQuest Dissertation Services. Baylor dissertations are requested roughly 21 times a month through this service. (You have the option to restrict access to your work, if desired.) The quality of these works reflects the standards of Baylor University, the Graduate School, your department or institute, and the professors who work with you on this project. The responsibility for both the content and format of your dissertation/thesis rests solely with you and your advisory committee. The Graduate School is here to assist you in doing the job effectively and efficiently. Note: The Guidelines are reviewed each semester and may be revised. Be sure you are working with the current version.
