In his screenprints, They're Everywhere and Tattooed Blue, Fudge digitized and manipulated the images of a toy anime robot and a reclining nude. The printed images unfold as deconstructed fields of color with a dizzying kaleidoscopic effect yet retain moments of surprisingly recognizable forms. In Tattooed Blue a female figure with cascading hair crouches and weeps while in They're Everywhere a robot with a glove-like hand reaches out over the width of the print. The screenprint technique highlights the flat intense color relationships further fragmenting the artist's compositional surface. In much of his recent work, Fudge draws on a variety of source material including Japanese animation and uses digital technology to manipulate and obscure his source into abstracted forms. Fudge (b. 1962, England) attended Brighton Polytechnic in Sussex from 1985 to 1988. He continued his studies at the Kansas City Art Institute in 1987 and at the Tyler School of Art in Philadelphia from 1988 to 1990. Fudge exhibits widely in the United States and abroad. He has had solo exhibitions at Bernie Toale, Boston, MA; The Print Center, Philadelphia, PA; Ronald Feldman Fine Arts, New York, NY; and a survey of his prints at Deutsche Bank, New York, NY. Fudge has taught at Columbia University, the Tyler School of Art and the Rhode Island School of Design. His work is in the collections of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, MA; Brooklyn Museum of Art, NY; Denver Museum of Art, Colorado; Whitney Museum of American Art, NY among others. He works and lives in New York.
