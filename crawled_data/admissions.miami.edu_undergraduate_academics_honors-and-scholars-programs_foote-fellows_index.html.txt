Foote Fellows have distinguished themselves both inside and outside of the classroom at their previous schools, are self-motivated, and think independently. Admission is by invitation only. Academic freedom Within the curricular framework of their school or college, Foote Fellows enjoy unmatched freedom and flexibility to explore a multitude of educational resources. Many Foote Fellows leverage this opportunity to take additional majors and/or minors as well as to study abroad. Focused advising At each of the 9 undergraduate schools and colleges at the University of Miami, a dedicated advisor helps Foote Fellows chart their academic path and attain access to distinctive learning opportunities, such as special school-based seminars, faculty-mentored research, networking opportunities, and off-campus internships. Fellows also receive focused advising on post-baccalaureate distinguished fellowships and awards. Books That Matter Foote Fellows are invited to enroll in the Books That Matter course, a rigorous seminar in nonfiction reading that is offered in sessions for first-year students. The Foote Fellows Honors Program reflects the educational vision of former University of Miami President Edward T. Foote, who retired in 2000 after serving the University for 20 years.
