Her research has explored mobile phone use in public spaces, emerging norms on mobile social networks, and the privacy and surveillance implications of location-based services. Her recent scholarship tries to historicize social media into a broader context of communication practices. Often using qualitative field methods, she focuses on how people integrate communication technology in their everyday lives in order to facilitate identity management and social interaction. She received her BS in Communication from Cornell University and received her MA and PhD from the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. Outreach and Extension Focus As a member of the Dept. of Communication's Outreach committee, I work closely with the Alumni Advisory Board in order to seek real-world and industry feedback on such things as student support, programmatic direction, connections for research, placement of graduates, and department visibility. I also present at various Cornell Cooperative Extension events and programs about the role of social media in outreach efforts.
