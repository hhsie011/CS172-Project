How will the transition to net zero affect business strategies? What will be the impact on asset values and share prices? And, most importantly, how will the transition by companies to net zero change the trajectory of emissions to avoid the most dramatic impacts of climate change? This conference — a joint effort by the Tamer Center for Social Enterprise at Columbia Business School and Columbia Climate School — brings together climate scientists and business leaders to understand how new advances in research and practice can inform investments in specific sectors of the global economy. The forum explores topics that address the value and opportunity of using a science-based approach to inform and guide business and investment decisions.
