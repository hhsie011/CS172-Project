To confront this reality, peace missions, rebuilding operations, and international law have been developed as tools to help create stability and peace after conflict. This is very impressive indeed, but the road to sustainable peace is arduous and troublesome. The exhibition The Good Cause not only gives insight into the complexities of dealing with post-conflict situations, it also shows through case studies what reconstruction could look like if it were designed with an eye for local structures. Vocabulary of Hospitality is dedicated to the asylum seekers and refugees in Istanbul and looks into the (spatial) language of hospitality. The exhibition investigates the cultural, legal and social insinuations of the word ‘guest’ and their signs in the city. The complexity inherent in the relationship between the ‘guest’ and the ‘host’ includes several obligations and tensions: When are the guest and the host strangers to each other, yet when become visitors? In which context do they become enemies to each other, or hostages? How does the guest become visible or invisible? The Good Cause: Architecture of Peace is an international project initiated by Archis (Amsterdam) with multiple partners. The Good Cause exhibition is curated by Lilet Breddels and Arjen Oosterman and co-produced by Studio-X. Vocabulary of Hospitality is conceptualized by Merve Bedir based on Derrida’s texts on hospitality, with works of Banu Cennetoğlu, Artıkişler Collective, Abd Nova, Basem Nabhan, Auguy Lufuluabo, Metehan Özcan, Ülkü Oktay, Alican İnal and others. This project is funded by Creative Industries FundNL and Dutch Embassy in Turkey (Ankara) Opening: March 6, 2015 at 19:00 Venue: Studio-X Istanbul Address: Meclis-i Mebusan Cad. 35A Fındıklı For the Facebook event link of the exhibition please click here. The exhibition will also host the panel "Prioritizing Women: Adapting Refugee Health Services for 21st Century Health Challenges" that will take place at Studio-X on March 7, at 14:00.
