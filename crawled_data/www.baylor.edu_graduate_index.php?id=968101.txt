Effective Monday, Feb. 21, Baylor University has updated its policy to optional facemasks in academic classrooms and labs – other than when requested in private offices. Masks remain required in the Baylor Health Center and at the COVID testing location and vaccination clinic in the North Village Community Center, on BUS shuttles (federal requirement) and in accordance with the University's Isolation and Quarantine Procedures for Spring 2022 after an individual has tested positive for COVID-19 or is quarantined due to exposure. Vaccinations: COVID vaccinations/boosters and flu shots available Thursday-Friday in the NVCC vaccination clinic. See the schedule & how to make an appointment here. Masks are required in the clinic. Optional COVID testing: Testing is available from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday-Friday at the North Village Community Center for students, faculty and staff and employee dependents at no cost. Masks are required in the testing center. Monitor daily for symptoms. If symptomatic: Students: Schedule an appointment through the Health Portal for testing in the Health Center. Faculty and staff: Contact your personal healthcare provider for testing. As we navigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Graduate School staff aims to provide both grace and flexibility while maintaining our admissions standards. Please review the information below, which will be updated as needed, and contact GraduateAdmissions@baylor.edu with any questions. Application Process Visit the How to Apply page for application instructions and access. The majority of our residential program deadlines fall between November and February, so we will be monitoring the situation and adjusting as needed. Individual programs may adapt admission requirements, so please contact the department to which you are applying to confirm any changes. Testing Scores GRE requirements are being reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Any waivers must be requested by the Graduate Program Director and approved by the Graduate School. For a list of programs making the GRE optional, please see the Exceptions section of our Submitting Test Scores Page. Baylor University Graduate School Admissions does accept the GRE and TOEFL at-home option for testing. At-home testing is available in the U.S. and Canada, as well as a growing number of other countries. Please note the system requirements. For more information, please see https://www.ets.org/s/cv/gre/at-home/ and https://www.ets.org/s/cv/toefl/at-home/. Transcripts For applicants to most programs, an unofficial transcript -a copy uploaded by the applicant- is sufficient for application review. For admitted students or those sending official transcripts: We highly recommend sending your transcript electronically. We have accounts with National Student Clearinghouse, Escript-safe via Credentials Solutions, Parchment, World Education Services, and Educational Credential Evaluators. Paper mail is delivered to our office around 11:30 am each morning. Please allow time for transcripts sent via regular mail to be sorted, delivered, and processed before being uploaded into your application records.
