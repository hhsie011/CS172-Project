It is also an option as a 5th-Year Master's Degree for Brown undergraduates and for Brown PhD students as a doctoral certificate or a ScM degree through the Open Graduate program. Data Science options for undergraduates includes a Certificate in Data Fluency, designed for students who are not concentrating in computer science, math or applied math, statistics, or computational biology. For students in those concentrations and others looking for more in-depth data science work, the Data Science Fellows program trains undergraduates to collaborate with faculty to build more data science into course curricula. The Data Science Initiative is also in the process of starting a Departmental Undergraduate Group (DUG) for undergraduate students.
