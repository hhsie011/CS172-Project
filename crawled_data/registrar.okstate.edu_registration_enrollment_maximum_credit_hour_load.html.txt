Academic overload is defined as the number of semester-credit-hours 25 percent or more than the number of weeks in the applicable academic term. See the "Graduate College" section of the Catalog for graduate student enrollment information. Students may petition to exceed these limits by completing a Petition to Enroll in Excessive Hours. Enforcement: For most academic sessions, the registration system prevents students from enrolling in more than the maximum number of credit hours. However, some sessions (including the winter intersession and summer sessions) are monitored manually by the Registrar’s Office. Students who have exceeded the maximum credit hour load will receive notification via their OSU e-mail account, and they must either promptly reduce their course load or submit an approved Petition to Enroll in Excessive Hours. The information below indicates the maximum number of credit hours in which students can enroll in a given session without a Petition to Enroll in Excessive Hours: Fall and Spring Regular 16-week Semesters Maximum Credit Hour Load Undergraduate Students Spears School of Business Graduate Students All other Graduate Students 19 16 12 Summer Sessions Maximum Credit Hour Load Part of Term Session Description Undergraduate Students Graduate Students Pre-Session (part of term 4) May Session 4 3 Full 8-Week Term (part of term 1) Full 8-Week June/July Session 12 9 First 4 Weeks (part of term A05) June Session 6 4 Second 4 Weeks (part of term A06) July Session 6 4 All summer sessions combined 12 9 Intersessions Maximum Credit Hour Load Part of Term Session Description Undergraduate Students Graduate Students Pre-Session (part of term 4) August Intersession 3 3 Pre-Session (part of term 4) Winter Intersession 6 4 Back To Top Back To Top Office of the Registrar 322/324 Student Union Oklahoma State University Stillwater, OK 74078 (map) (405) 744-6876 | Contact Us Follow US Social Media Directory Facebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn Snapchat Oklahoma State University Campus & Parking MapsAll OSU InstitutionsCareers @ OSUHire OSU Grads© Oklahoma State University.
