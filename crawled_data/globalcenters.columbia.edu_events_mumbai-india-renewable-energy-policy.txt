This session will focus on India’s energy policy and feature a conversation between Columbia University experts and Sumant Sinha, Chair and Managing Director of ReNew Power, and author of ‘Fossil Free: Reimagining Clean Energy in a Carbon-Constrained World’. About the Book Climate change is already hitting us hard, through adverse effects on global food availability, biodiversity, rising sea levels and extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and floods. In the last decade, a major transformation — the transition to clean, affordable and sustainable energy from the sun and the wind — is beginning to address these challenges. Fossil Free provides a concise introduction to the challenges, realities, and complexities of the global and local energy industry, as well as the trends and forces driving the energy transition. It explains how improved electricity infrastructure, decentralized smart grids, electric vehicles, energy storage, and market design are already providing clear pathways for the transition towards green, efficient, affordable, and secure renewable energy across the energy-use chain: extraction, conversion, transmission, distribution, and end-use. About the Author A leading first-generation entrepreneur, Sumant Sinha is the Founder, Chair, and Managing Director of ReNew Power, one of India’s largest clean energy companies. Sumant founded ReNew Power in January 2011, with a vision to transform the way energy is produced and consumed in India. Since then, under his leadership, the company has grown exponentially and is today one of India’s premier renewable energy companies. Sumant is an alumnus of Columbia University’s School of Internal and Public Affairs (SIPA). He is a passionate advocate for solutions related to climate change and sustainable development and has spoken at various thought leadership platforms, such as World Economic Forum at Davos, Climate Week NYC, CERA Week, and other forums organized by Financial Times, ORF as well as leading global universities. He has written more than 150 opinion articles in leading global and Indian publications on the pressing issues of climate change, renewable energy, and sustainable economic growth. For over a decade, Sumant Sinha has had a ringside view of the energy scenario. His understanding of the global energy landscape and climate change brings a unique, holistic perspective on energy. With Fossil Free, Sinha shares his vision for energy that is not only clean but also practical and affordable.
