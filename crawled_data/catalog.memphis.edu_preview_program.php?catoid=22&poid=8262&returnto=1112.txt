Students are equipped to offer substantive legal support services to firms and agencies or to continue their education in law school. The core curriculum emphasizes four correlated disciplines: (1) theory, process, application, and ethics of law; (2) legal and administrative research and investigation; (3) law-related technologies, and (4) professional decorum and communication skills. Only licensed attorneys are permitted to practice law, but well-trained paralegals and support staff are indispensable to any office that faces critical issues in law, regulatory compliance, or policy. The unique skill sets of Legal Studies graduates are vital not only to law firms but also to corporations, government agencies, courts, law enforcement, health care organizations, non-profits, educational institutions, and a wide range of other professional settings. General Education (35-41 hours) See University General Education Program for the University General Education Program requirements. Students who have completed one year of American History in high school are exempted from the six credit-hour History General Education Program requirement; otherwise, students will have to meet the History requirement.

College Requirements (9 hours) Thematic Studies (6 hours) College of Professional & Liberal Studies thematic studies course(s) are designed to broaden a student’s knowledge of significant themes in social, political, and religious history. Review a complete list of courses: https://www.memphis.edu/cpls/resources/thematic_studies.php Senior Project (3 hours) The senior project is a student’s culminating experience or capstone designed to synthesize and integrate the content of a student’s program of study. The senior project is intended to fuse the two or more academic areas that comprise the student’s coordinated study (major) into an academically-relevant example of scholarship. Students will complete a thesis, task-based, or artistic project on a topic of their choice with approval of their senior project instructor. The senior project is completed during a student’s final semester. Students will be assigned to a specific section based on their concentration. Please note that the Legal Studies Senior Project does not involve the same materials and assignments as the Senior Project for students in other fields of study. Instead of an academic research paper, Legal Studies students analyze a case file and conduct independent legal research to draft a full-length trial brief that is suitable for attorney signature and filing with the court. For more information about the Legal Studies section of Senior Project, please email legalstudies@memphis.edu. For permit and registration information, please contact your academic advisor or the Senior Project Coordinator. UNIV 4995 - Senior Project** Credit Hours: (3) (completed during the final semester) General Electives (16-22 hours) May be chosen to bring the total number of hours to 120 with a minimum of 42 upper-division hours.
