Many types of federal aid, such as the Federal Pell Grant, are not available to graduate students. However, the Federal Stafford Loan has extended loan limits for graduate students and is available to most students regardless of income. US citizens and eligible non-citizens can apply for the Federal Stafford Loan by completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The suggested deadline to apply is April 1 for the following Fall semester. Graduate students accepted into a degree program may borrow funds to cover their established cost of attendance, less any fellowship stipends or fee waivers, up to $18,500* per year. Further information and application forms are available from the Office of Student Financial Aid, G-01 Sikes Hall, Box 345123, Clemson, SC 29634-5123.
