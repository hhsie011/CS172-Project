Karen T. Romer Undergraduate Teaching and Research Awards (UTRAs) support Brown students collaborating with Brown faculty on research and teaching projects during the summer or the academic year. Named for the dean who launched the program in the 1980s, UTRAs provide students with valuable academic experience that prepares them for graduate study and that contributes directly to course development at Brown. For more information on UTRAs, including application deadlines and answers to common questions please visit the UTRA site. Recent UTRA Projects in Engineering Students interested in the UTRA program are encouraged to reach out to faculty members to discuss potential projects and the applications process.
