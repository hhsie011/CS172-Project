Favorite Class or Professor My time at HDS has been filled with meaningful classes and teachers. As I go, I am hopeful that seeds from certain classes will be especially productive—"Coloniality, Race, and Catastrophe" with Mayra Rivera, "Literary Theory and Criticism" with Jesse McCarthy, "Poetics of Difficulty" with Amy Hollywood, "The Sacramental Imagination" with Matt Potts, "Teresa of Avila" with Stephanie Paulsell, and "Black Church Burning" with Todne Thomas. I am thankful to the teachers and the other students who have pressed me to think more critically and more generously over these past three years. Message of Thanks Thomas, thank you for the weekly coffee and conversation. Turner and Brandon, thank you for late-night phone calls these last three years and for many more years of companionship. Mom and Dad, for supporting all my endeavors, thank you. Kathryn, thank you for eating ice cream on the floor and inviting me to think about the nature of time that fall that you were home after leaving Mercer. And Sarah, for being my partner in all of this and for so much more, I am forever grateful. I love you. Future Plans In June I will be moving with my wife to Birmingham, Alabama.
