Since 2005, this important prize is granted to entrepreneurs that are working to address social or environmental problems through innovative approaches. Alarcón, in association with other SIPA alumni, created Laboratoria, a tech social enterprise that aims to empower underprivileged women with sustainable tools so they can join the workforce as computer programmers and web designers and thus break the cycle of poverty. Laboratoria operates in Mexico, Peru, and Chile. It has been so successful that upon graduation, more than 70% of its students are already working in the web development industry.
