He has served on the pastoral staff of two churches in Birmingham, Alabama, and he is frequently invited to speak, supply preach, and help as interim pastor for various churches. After living and studying in Scotland at the University of St. Andrews, he taught for two years at Seattle Pacific University. He came to Truett in the Fall of 2007, where he teaches a required course in early Christian studies, as well as other electives in historical theology. He has written four books, over 30 articles and essays, and he has helped edit numerous research projects. His primary work has been in ancient African Christianity and more generally in the development of early Christian theology. He is currently co-authoring a three volume work on early Christology, focusing on how the early Christians understood Jesus’ pre-existence and how he was the one appearing in the scriptures as “LORD.” He and his family stay busy at their "suburban paradise" taking care of the vegetable garden, a dog, a cat, a rabbit, a bearded dragon, and a small flock of laying hens. In addition to anything involving the outdoors, Dr. Wilhite is currently trying to learn to play the blues on his guitar autographed by Waylon Jennings.
