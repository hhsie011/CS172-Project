Employees using Remitted Tuition benefits for themselves receive a full tuition waiver. Employees may transfer their benefits to a spouses or same sex domestic partner for a tuition waiver of 85 percent.

The University’s policy regarding refunds on courses that are dropped while using Remitted Tuition can be found in the Bursar’s Tuition, Fees, and Related Policies Bulletin. Credit Hours Granted Link Employees using Remitted Tuition benefits for themselves receive a full tuition waiver up to the number of credit hours available. The number of credit hours available to you depends upon your employment status: Full-time employees receive 12 credit hours annually. Part-time employees receive 9 credit hours annually. Eligible retirees receive the number of credit hours they were eligible to receive at the time of retirement. RTB credits are awarded in mid-July each year for use during the fall, spring or summer semesters immediately following. Credits do not carry over from year to year; any credits not used are forfeited. Credit hours may not be borrowed from a future year to be used in a current year. Credit Hours Available upon Hire Link Eligible Syracuse University employees are awarded Remitted Tuition benefits in their first year of employment according to the following schedule. Benefits are adjusted based on any changes in benefits eligibility status, e.g. moving from full- to part-time employment.

A spouse/same sex domestic partner receiving tuition credits must have either a United States-issued Social Security number or an individual tax identification number. To transfer Remitted Tuition credits to an eligible spouse/same sex domestic partner, the employee must complete a Remitted Tuition Credit Transfer Authorization [PDF] form and submit it to Human Resources. A new form is needed only if the employee wishes to make a change in the number of credits assigned, or to transfer the credits back to himself or herself. Tax Implications Link For information on remitted tuition taxability rules, including how the University’s Educational Assistance Plan affects such taxation, please refer to the Comptroller’s Office.
