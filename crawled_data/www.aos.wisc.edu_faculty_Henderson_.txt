Atmospheric conditions impact food, safety, health, the economy, and everyone’s day to day life, making weather and climate predictability a forefront when I approach a new research question. My research interests largely focus on subseasonal timescales. This time period contains a gap in predictability, extending beyond the memory of synoptic weather systems and occurring within seasonal climate patterns such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). My research goal is to close this predictability gap by understanding the atmospheric processes that occur in subseasonal timescales, including but not limited to the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) and atmospheric blocking, and how they interact with weather and climate patterns across different timescales. I use a variety of tools and methods, including observational analysis and numerical and statistical modeling.
