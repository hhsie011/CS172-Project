Whatever project, cause or cohort inspires you to give, the odds are that the University of Washington has a giving opportunity to match it. Better yet, by endowing your gift you can make an impact that will be felt year after year, generation after generation. How does it work? Endowed gifts are invested, with the generated income used to fund the program you chose. This means that the principal gift continues to grow over time and generate a steady, reliable source of income in perpetuity. For this reason, many donors choose to name endowments: to honor a family member, an influential professor, or mentor; preserve the name of their family foundation; or create a personal legacy. An individual’s lifespan is limited, but institutions like the UW endure for generations. Endowments help to ensure that adequate provision is made for the students, faculty and facilities of today and tomorrow. Fund management Endowment gifts are invested in the University’s Consolidated Endowment Fund, which combines assets for investment purposes. Each named endowment retains its own purpose and account (budget number), by which the UW tracks growth in principal and distributions.
