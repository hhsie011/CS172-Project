When you make a gift to Syracuse University, you provide the students of today—and tomorrow—with unique educational experiences and the tools they need to succeed in a world that’s ever more complex. Here are just a few of the ways you can show your support. Accordion Section Support SU in LA Programming It’s easy to see the advantages a Los Angeles learning experience brings to Syracuse University students. Opportunities to learn from the world’s leading experts, interaction with the world-renown entertainment industry, visits to diverse cultural institutions, the challenges of living in a major metropolitan environment—all of these give students unique real-world insights that simply can’t be gained anywhere else. You can make such experiences possible by designating your gift toward the SULA Semester experience or immersion programs that place students in the heart of Los Angeles, where they receive hands-on, experiential learning opportunities to support their professional pursuits. Most of these activities rely on ongoing funding. Your gift can be a source of crucial support for these programs and other Los Angeles-based initiatives in Syracuse University’s schools and colleges. Learn more about Los Angeles immersion experiences. Support Syracuse University Campus Programs If your passion lies on the Syracuse University campus or in any of Syracuse University’s other regional or international centers, you can direct your gift accordingly. Whether you decide to support the dean’s fund in your school or college, student scholarships, faculty recruitment and retention, academic programs, facilities, or research, your gift will make a real difference to Syracuse University students.
