The Clemson University Honors College welcomes students that are transferring to Clemson from other university Honors programs or Honors colleges. The Honors College Transfer Student Application is separate from, and in addition to, the Undergraduate Admissions Transfer Application. Students hoping to transfer to Clemson Honors from another university or college Honors program or Honors College must complete the following steps: Step 1. Apply as an Undergraduate Transfer Student Before students will be accepted into the Honors College, students must complete and be accepted by Clemson University Undergraduate Admissions. You will be asked to express interest in applying to Clemson Honors when you complete the undergraduate application. If you select "yes," you will be given access to apply online to Clemson Honors after you complete your application submission. Students may complete and submit their Honors application before they are accepted as a Clemson undergraduate student, but will not receive a decision from Honors before they are accepted to Clemson University. Step 2. Complete the Clemson Honors Transfer Student Application Honors application requirements include: Unofficial transcript Cumulative GPA of a 3.5 or Higher Recommendation Letter from the Honors College Dean or Director of your current institution Essays demonstrating you are a member in good standing of an honors program or honors college at your previous institution You need a Clemson University ID number and Clemson University email address to complete the Honors application. You will receive these identifiers when you complete your undergraduate application in Step 1. Access the Honors student transfer application and review important transfer application dates. Step 3. Upload Your Final Transcript Students must upload a final copy (official or unofficial) of their current institution transcript to their Applicant Portal prior to the final transcript deadline. Your transcript must show all of your grades, including the final grades from your last semester. For example, if you are applying for Fall admission, your final transcript must include your final Spring grades. Applicants that are not members of an Honors Program or Honors College at their previous institution are encouraged to apply as a continuing student during their first semester at Clemson to hopefully gain admission to the Honors College for their second semester.
