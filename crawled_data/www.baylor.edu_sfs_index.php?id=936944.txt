Any student identified as using automated systems to perform registration or add/drops may be barred from the registration system. Summer of Discovery Adding/Dropping Classes Courses taken at Baylor in the Summer are discounted from regular tuition.** As a part of the Summer of Discovery program, students receive greater discounts as the number of classes taken increases. This creates a tiered charging system such as the following: Incoming Freshmen Summer I and/or Summer II Only Tuition (Per Credit Hour) Number of Hours Tuition Cost 1-6 Hours $1,392 per semester hour 7-9 Hours $1,000 per semester hour 10 or more Hours $750 per semester hour Undergraduate Continuing Students All Summer Terms (Minimester, Summer I, Summer II, and Full Summer) Tuition (Per Credit Hour) Number of Hours Tuition Cost 1-6 Hours $1,392 per semester hour 7-9 Hours $1,000 per semester hour 10 or more Hours $750.00 per semester hour **Please be aware that adding or dropping Summer of Discovery classes may impact your charges in unexpected ways. Due to the discounted rates for Summer, your bill may increase if you drop hours since lower hours have a higher cost per hour. Dropping Classes Dropping a class or classes is not considered a withdrawal. The term "withdrawal" refers to dropping all classes through the Paul L. Foster Success Center and leaving the University for that term. Beginning the first class day of each term, students will not be able to go online and drop all of their classes. Remember: Flat tuition rate students are not penalized for adds and drops as long as they remain at 12 or more hours. Dropping a class results in the following refund of tuition and fee charges. Refunds will be computed as follows: Undergraduate/Graduate/Seminary Class Days Fall/Spring Refund 1-5 100% 6-10 75% 11-15 50% 16-20 25% 21 or later 0 Class Days Summer I or II 1-2 100% 3-4 75% 5-6 50% 7 25% 8 or later 0 Class Days Full Summer 1-3 100% 4-7 75% 8-11 50% 12-14 25% 15 or later 0 Class Days Minimester 1 100% 2 75% 3 50% 4 25% 5 or later 0 Law School Class Days 1-5 100% 6-7 75% 8-10 50% 11-13 25% 14 or later 0 Online MBA Class Days 1 90% 2 70% 3 50% 4 30% 5 or later 0 When a student drops and adds an equal number of credit hours during the 100% refund days, it is considered an even exchange. Beginning on the sixth class day of the Fall or Spring semesters, the third day of Summer I or Summer II, the fourth day of Full Summer, the second day of Minimester, or the sixth day of the Law Quarter, a student is refunded according to the schedule above for a dropped class and is assessed 100% of tuition and related fees for adding a class. The only exception is if the student adds and drops sections among the same course. These are considered an even exchange. Appeals Students or parents who believe they have individual circumstances warranting an exception to published refund policies may appeal the application of the policy. To appeal based on these circumstances, the student or parent should contact the Paul L. Foster Success Center for withdrawal appeals or the Dean's Office having oversight of the class for add/drop appeals.
