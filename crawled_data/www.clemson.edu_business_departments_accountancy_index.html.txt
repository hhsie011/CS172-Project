Students who graduate from our program are prepared to begin careers in corporate accounting and auditing, or pursue graduate study. Students who pursue our Master of Professional Accountancy (MPAcc) program are prepared for careers in public and private accounting. From the moment you step into our classrooms, we'll begin training you to take an organization's finances and create a sound structure that allows it to make the most impact with its resources. Accountants are idea-and-solutions people. Their work is varied, dynamic and challenging — your classes will be the same. Our students graduate with a thorough understanding of the financial aspects of business along with good presentation and people skills. While accountants frequently hold management positions in larger organizations, many also start their own businesses. Many pursue their CPA certification. Still, others pursue a law degree or a career in federal law enforcement. No matter the direction you wish to take, accounting is a sound place to start.
