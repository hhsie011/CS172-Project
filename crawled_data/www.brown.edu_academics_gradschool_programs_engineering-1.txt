In research groups, engineers of all types team together with non-engineers to tackle some of the biggest problems facing engineering and science today. Since this range of topics is so broad, prospective students are strongly encouraged to browse the engineering website to further explore individual research activities. Students usually identify an advisor during the early stages of graduate study and are often involved in independent research from the start of the program. Each student, in collaboration with their advisor, develops a unique program of study that includes both coursework and independent research, and prepares the students for careers in academia and industry. Additional Resources As well as distinct master's degree programs in Master of Arts in Design Engineering (MADE), Innovation Management and Entrepreneurship (PRIME) and Biomedical Engineering, the School of Engineering includes the following research areas: The Chemical and Environmental Engineering (ChEE) applies chemical and engineering sciences to emerging technologies and their impacts on human health and the environment. Specific research thrusts include environmental remediation, biotechnology, biotransport processes, chemical nanoscience, carbon–based materials, and thermal and electrochemical energy conversion. The Electrical and Computer Engineering group is divided into solid state and quantum electronics (SSQE) and computer engineering. Research topics include projects in experimental laser sciences, semiconductors, optoelectronics, condensed matter physics, nanoscience and technology, biophotonics, and bioengineering. The computer engineering group has topics in multimedia signal processing, medical imaging, computer vision, 3D photography, speech processing, image understanding, design and test of digital integrated circuits, computer architecture, physical integrated circuit design, and nanoscale system design. Research in the Fluids and Thermal Sciences group focuses on a broad range of disciplines and applications including fundamental fluid dynamics and heat transfer, micro– and nanoscale fluids, complex fluids, biotechnology, acoustics, thermodynamics and energy sciences. The Materials Science focuses on a fundamental understanding of the different types of materials and the interrelationship between processing, structure, and materials properties. The Mechanics of Solids group fosters a balanced program that integrates the perspectives of continuum mechanics, structure of matter, and materials science.
