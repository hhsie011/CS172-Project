Check out our admission options below to see how you can become an OSU Cowboy. Comprehensive Review At Oklahoma State University, ALL STUDENTS are encouraged to apply because we individually review each application through our holistic and alternative admission programs. We consider many factors, including: high school GPA, ACT or SAT scores, responses to application essays, academic letters of recommendation, leadership experience, community involvement and accomplishments. Test Optional Students have the option to apply to OSU without consideration of a test score. Students may indicate on their application for admission that they would like to be considered as test optional and submit their high school transcript for review. This also applies to home school, private, parochial, or other non-public high schools which are not accredited by a recognized accrediting agency. Currently, consideration for most university scholarships requires an official test score from ACT or SAT, and we encourage students to provide us their test scores as soon as they are available for complete scholarship consideration. Assured Admission Criteria Students qualify for assured admission if they meet ONE of the following criteria: 3.0 GPA or better unweighted cumulative AND top 33.3% rank in high school graduating class, OR 3.0 GPA or better in 15-unit core AND 21 ACT/1060 SAT or better*, OR 24 ACT/1160 SAT or better* *OSU will accept the official superscore provided directly from ACT for both admission and scholarship consideration. Assured Home School Criteria Graduates of a private, parochial, or other non-public high school which is not accredited by a recognized accrediting agency, are eligible for admission to the university if: The student has graduated from high school or a home study program, AND The student has attained an ACT composite score of 24 or higher*, or a total SAT composite score of 1160 or higher*, AND The student has satisfied the high school curricular requirements as certified by the school official or, if home study, the parent. *Home school students are eligible for test optional admission 15-Unit Core Curricular Requirements: 4 units of English (Grammar, Composition and Literature); 3 units of Mathematics (Algebra I, Geometry, Algebra II and above); 3 units of History and Citizenship Skills (Must include 1 unit of American history and 2 units from the subjects of history, Economics, Geography, Government, Civics and/or Non-Western Culture); 3 units lab science (Biology, Chemistry, Physical Sciences, Physics or any lab science certified by school district) and 2 units of other courses selected from any of the sections above or computer science or foreign language. Students who have been denied admission may appeal one time by submitting the Freshman Admission Decision Appeal Petition. Students are strongly encouraged to submit all updated academic information, including final high school transcripts, letters of recommendation, and any additional ACT or SAT scores, before completing the petition. The appeal petition and other application materials will be evaluated by the Admissions Review Committee, and the student will be notified of the outcome within three business days.
