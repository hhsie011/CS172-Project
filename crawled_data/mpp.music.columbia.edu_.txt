A Note from the Director Program Director Dr. Magdalena Stern-Baczewska [BaCHEVska] Welcome to Columbia University's Music Performance Program, where students' academic excellence meets musical prowess and passion. High-caliber music-making is an integral part of Columbia's campus life. Our student-musicians participate in a variety of activities, such as chamber music, jazz, world music, and orchestra, chorus, and individual instrumental instruction. New York City is their stage - the performances have taken our students beyond the Columbia campus, to such venues as Carnegie Hall, Alice Tully Hall, and Symphony Space. The Music Performance Program allows the new generation of future artists, politicians, scientists, and entrepreneurs to cultivate their talent and love of music through learning from world-class musicians. While thriving academically, our students keep an important place for music in their lives, and continue to make music relevant in the world around them. If you would like to be informed about the MPP activities, please join our mailing list. You may also support our performers by giving or joining us for upcoming performances. *Music Performance Program is a part of Columbia University's Department of Music, an academic department. We have no connection to Miller Theatre, which operates as a professional concert presenter independently of the academic departments.
