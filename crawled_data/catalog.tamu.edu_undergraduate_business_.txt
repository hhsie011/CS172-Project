Duane Ireland, PhD Interim Associate Dean - Shannon Deer, PhD, CPA Director of Academic Services - Peter K. Drysdale, MS General Statement Mays Business School’s vision is to advance the world’s prosperity. To advance the world’s prosperity means providing a better future for generations who follow, including quality of life, environment and economic systems. To fulfill this vision, Mays' mission is to be a vibrant learning organization that creates impactful knowledge and develops transformational leaders. Mays is a comprehensive business school that equips students with a holistic view of an enterprise, a business mindset, functional area expertise and the full range of required technical skills that exist across all areas of business. Diversity, inclusion, and engagement inform decisions and actions at all levels of the organization. Best-in-class business education goes beyond the standard business functional areas—accounting, finance, management, marketing, management information systems, and supply chain management—to deliver an integrated, high-impact, career-launching set of experiences. The business curriculum has a dual emphasis: a broad-based education in the foundation disciplines of the liberal arts and the sciences; and a focused development of business knowledge and behavioral skills. Lower level business majors learn and practice broad skills in core curriculum areas: American history; communication; creative arts; mathematics; political science; language, philosophy and culture; life and physical sciences; and social and behavioral sciences. They simultaneously take introductory business courses.. Upon successful completion of this broad-based foundation coursework, the student will begin to focus on a major field of study and a full range of business courses. The major field is chosen from accounting, finance, management, management information systems, marketing, and supply chain management. Students admitted to Mays Business Honors pursue an interdepartmental degree in business honors. This combination of a broad educational foundation and more specialized study produces graduates uniquely prepared for entry-level, career launching organizational positions. Requirements for Graduation Requirements for graduation are listed in the Texas A&M University Student Rules and this catalog. Courses taken to satisfy degree requirements must be taken for letter grades, with the exception of general elective requirements. Students in Bachelor of Business Administration degree programs must complete with a 2.0 GPA or greater all courses included in the Core Business Knowledge. Students must complete the Writing requirement. The requirement may be met by taking two writing (W) courses or one W course and one oral communication (C) course. See an academic advisor for additional information. Students must complete the International and Cultural Diversity (ICD) and Cultural Discourse (CD) requirement. For the ICD requirement students must take one course (3 credit hours) from a list of approved courses. Students in BBA degree programs satisfy the ICD requirements by taking 3 hours of coursework from an approved list of BBA international elective courses that also simultaneously fulfill the university's ICD requirement. See an academic advisor for additional information. For the CD requirement students must take one course (3 credit hours) from a list of approved courses. If a course approved as CD also satisfies a Core Curriculum requirement, it can be use to satisfy both requirements. See an academic advisor for additional information. Transfer of Credits Acceptance of transfer of credit for business courses will generally be limited to those courses taught in the freshman and sophomore years at this institution. Unless otherwise pre-approved by the dean, transfer credit is not offered for upper-level (junior- and senior-level) business courses. Bachelor’s Degrees and Departments of Instruction There are five departments of instruction in Mays Business School: Accounting, Finance, Information and Operations Management, Management, and Marketing. The Bachelor of Business Administration degree is offered in each of the following seven majors: Accounting, Business Honors, Finance, Management, Management Information Systems, Marketing, and Supply Chain Management. A Bachelor of Science degree in University Studies with concentration in business (USBU) is offered. Bachelor of Business Administration The degree of Bachelor of Business Administration is offered in these seven majors: accounting, business honors, finance, management, management information systems, marketing, and supply chain management.

The first major must be business honors. The Business Honors student must satisfy all University and Business School requirements and complete all curriculum requirements for each major. This option leads to the granting of one BBA degree with two majors. Additional restrictions may apply. Double Degree Approval of double degrees (BBA with BA or BS) is granted by exception only. A written appeal for a double degree may be submitted; the appeal should reflect an excellent academic record, support from the BA or BS granting college, and a compelling justification. Second Degree Postbaccalaureate admission to Mays is severely restricted and granted by exception only. Applicants for a postbaccalaureate business degree may present a case for an exception to this enrollment restriction in the essay of a complete Texas A&M admission application. Generally, eligible applicants are denied postbaccalaureate admission but may be encouraged to apply, instead, to an appropriate graduate degree program.

Most are open to all BBA majors, and some are designed for specific majors who wish to specialize in a particular area in the major field of study.
