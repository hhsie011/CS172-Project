You will learn conceptual frameworks and analytical techniques for evaluating technologies, markets, and commercialization strategies. Additionally, you will learn how to attract and motivate the resources needed to start a company (e.g. people, corporate partners and venture capital), prepare business plans, structure relationships, refine product-market fit, and create and grow enterprise value. EGR 498 / ENT 498 Special Topics in Social Entrepreneurship Professor/InstructorMartin P. Johnson A growing number of entrepreneurs are solving social and environmental challenges by creating private 'nonprofit' organizations and projects. This course will explore the challenges and opportunities they face. While the course will cover the styles and competencies that successful nonprofit managers tend to exhibit, it will explore system-wide changes needed to improve the sector's outcomes, including key ways that funders, government, businesses and the beneficiaries of nonprofits can help.
