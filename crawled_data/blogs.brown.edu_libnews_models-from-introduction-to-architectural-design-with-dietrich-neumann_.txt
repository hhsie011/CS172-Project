The Library is now on instagram. You can follow us @brownuniversitylibrary. A new exhibit is on view for summer 2013 in the tall cases of the Laura and David Finn Reading Room featuring student projects from Dietrich Neumann’s Spring 2013 course “Introduction to Architectural Design.” Over the semester, students learned basic concepts of space, materials, functions, structure, and light. After a number of initial exercises, each student designed a small house for an open space on East Street in Fox Point. Students responded to the plot’s geographic location and neighborhood. Stop by if you’re on campus this summer to see more of these models. This entry was posted in Uncategorized by Amy Atticks. Bookmark the permalink.
