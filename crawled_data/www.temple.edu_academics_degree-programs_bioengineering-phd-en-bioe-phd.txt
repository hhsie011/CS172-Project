Develop the expertise to uncover new insights, innovate new products or expand the leading-edge of knowledge in the field of bioengineering. The program is defined by a strong emphasis on translational medicine—always pushing to ensure evidence-based conclusions reach the clinical testing stage and, if confirmed, added to treatment protocols. The college offers you many research areas to explore, pivoting around advances in biological imaging, biomaterials and injury biomechanics, neuroengineering, stem- and cancer-cell engineering, synthesis and properties of biomaterials, targeted drug delivery, tissue regeneration, and more. Doctoral candidates have pursued their research with collaborators Temple’s Fox Chase Cancer Center, Katz School of Medicine, Kornberg School of Dentistry, and College of Science and Technology. Your progress is fostered by state-of-the-art lab facilities and the support of a small engineering community with an intimate learning atmosphere. Most courses and lab work occur during the day, but you may take evening classes to complete the program’s didactic coursework. Completion Requirements Completion requirements depend on whether you enter the doctoral program with a master’s degree. If you have a master’s degree, you must complete 15 credits of PhD-level didactic coursework and 15 credits of PhD exams and dissertation research, for a total of 30 credits. If you only have a bachelor’s degree, you must complete 45 credits of master’s- and PhD-level coursework and 15 credits of PhD exams and dissertation research, for a total of 60 credits. See the Admissions section below for more information. Between didactic coursework, dissertation research and examinations, the PhD can take four or five years, depending on your trajectory and project interests. You have up to seven years to complete your degree. There are three major pieces of culminating work for the PhD. Preliminary examination: This exam evaluates your communication, information-synthesis and research skills. Dissertation proposal: Research and write your proposal, and present it at an open college seminar. Dissertation writing and defense: Present and defend your dissertation in front of a dissertation committee. Classes & Curriculum The coursework you complete will be selected in consultation with your research advisor and doctoral advisory committee and follow the outline of your plan of study.
