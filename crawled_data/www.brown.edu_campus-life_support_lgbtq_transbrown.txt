We are working quickly to update the information but if you have a question during our updates please contact [email protected]. Trans Resources at Brown Trans is an umbrella term that includes, but is not limited to, the following identities: transgender, a person of trans experience, genderqueer, androgynous, third gender, agender, non-binary gender, two-spirit, and any other non-normative gender identity. Some people also like to use Trans* as an umbrella term. Because there are varied views and some disagreements on the inclusivity of the asterisk we are currently choosing not to use it but we recognize and respect all of the different terminology that people like to use. Brown University is committed to supporting trans students, staff and faculty and the LGBTQ Center is here to help provide our campus community with information, education, support and resources. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive list of resources on our site and we will continue to update our site as changes develop. If you would like more information, you have questions about the content or you would like additional support please contact our Program Director, Kelly Garrett, via email at [email protected] or by phone at (401) 863-3062.
