Justice has been met in this case, but it cannot erase the decades and centuries of injustices to Black people. Our collective awareness of this harsh and continuing reality seems—sadly and shockingly—to ebb and flow. If we learned anything from the Civil Rights Movement centered around the Supreme Court’s unanimous decision in Brown v. Board of Education, it is that only persistent and painstaking efforts will bring true and comprehensive justice. I have waited for legal judgments before, but none has been more important than this one today, in a state court in Minnesota, to recommitting the society to removing the practices of invidious discrimination against Black Americans.
