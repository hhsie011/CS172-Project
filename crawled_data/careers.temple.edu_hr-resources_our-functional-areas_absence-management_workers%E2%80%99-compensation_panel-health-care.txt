During the first 90 days of treatment, employees MUST seek treatment with one of the designated healthcare providers. Employees seeking treatment from a nonpanel healthcare provider during the first 90 days will jeopardize reimbursement by Temple University. If during the 90-day period, an employee wishes to change healthcare providers, they may do so provided the visit is to another panel healthcare provider.
