These ranges, and the guidelines described below, should be used in determining the salaries for the upcoming year for officers of research throughout the University. Human Resources will send you separate instructions on research support staff. Postdoctoral research fellows, postdoctoral research scientists/scholars, and associate research scientists/scholars who have completed either their first year or their second year of appointment must receive at least a 2.5 percent increase as of July 1, 2022, either on their reappointment or their anniversary date, as per the contract with the Columbia Postdoctoral Workers-UAW Local 4100. The average salary increase for the other officers of research must be at least 3 percent as of July 1, 2022. Individual increases, of course, will depend upon the availability of funding and the performance of the officer. As a result of the reclassification of staff officers of research, minimums and review points have now been established for each of the ranks. These new minimums are effective July 1, 2022. If possible, officers of research (excluding postdocs) should be reappointed for the academic year (July 1-June 30), and their appointments should not be for less than six months. Postdocs should be reappointed on their anniversary dates to keep track of their limited appointments. Salaries should be reviewed at the time of reappointment. If an officer's salary is within the approved range and the increase meets the guidelines provided above, you only need to submit the appropriate personnel transaction. Starting salaries that exceed the review point will require the prior approval of my office for Morningside appointments and the Office of the Executive Vice President for Health and Biomedical Sciences at CUIMC. Similarly, we will review salary increases in those units that exceed our guidelines. In those cases, you should provide a written explanation of the reasons for the salary or salary increase you are requesting. In the Arts and Sciences and Engineering, such requests will require the approval of the Executive Vice President or Interim Dean before they are forwarded to my office. We would appreciate your cooperation in implementing these policies. If you have any questions or concerns about them, on the Morningside campus you should contact Pearl Spiro, Associate Provost for Academic Appointments, at [email protected]; at CUIMC please contact Anne L. Taylor, Vice Dean for Academic Affairs, at [email protected]. With best wishes, Mary C.
