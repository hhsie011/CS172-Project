Texas Tech University Directory Raiderlink A-Z Index Financial Aid Menu Search TTU Financial Aid Home College Access Loan The College Access Loan Program provides alternative educational loans to Texas students who are unable to meet the cost of attendance. The CAL may be used to cover part or all of the student's Expected Family Contribution (EFC). Students do not have to demonstrate financial need. However, the amount of federal aid for which you are eligible (regardless of whether actually accepted) must be deducted from the cost of attendance in determining the CAL loan amount. Educational Loan Priority Deadline The FAFSA and all supporting documents are required for the College Access Loan (CAL). The CAL is awarded based on the requirements set by The Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB) (www.hhloans.com) and the availability of funds. The CAL is awarded only to Texas residents. The CAL is a student initiated process. The application process includes the application, credit check, and self certification. (www.hhloans.com) The credit decision is good for 90 days.

Loan funds are generally sent to TTU in 10-14 business days after the Loan Approval Disclosure has been accepted. To check the status of your CAL go to www.hhloans.com click log in. Loan money from the CAL, private, or BOT will be applied to the student's billing account at TTU and any refund will be sent to the student via direct deposit or paper check.
