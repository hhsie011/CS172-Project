May 5, 2022 Research at Brown Professor Hongjie Dong receives a mid-Career Research Achievement Award Professor Hongjie Dong is a recipient of a mid-Career Research Achievement Award. Professor Dong is a leading expert in the field of partial differential equations which help to analyze the laws of physics and engineering. He has developed novel tools to analyze elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations, and applies his expertise to the theories of composite materials, fluid dynamics and kinetic theory. April 20, 2022 American Mathematical Society Big Math in Little Rhody The smallest state in the country has two centers of world-class mathematics. The American Mathematical Society (AMS) and the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics (ICERM) are both located in Providence, RI. The AMS publishes many research journals, and maintains an electronic database called MathSciNet, among many other services. ICERM's mission is to solidify the relationship between mathematics and computation.
