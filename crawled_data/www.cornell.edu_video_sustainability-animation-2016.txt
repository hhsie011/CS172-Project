It's not just using more efficient light bulbs and recycling. It means attacking the problem from every angle, from basic science research to real-world applications, to recruiting the best minds in their fields across a wide range of disciplines and facilitating collaboration. Cornell researchers are working on drought conditions and water supplies; agricultural systems; biodiversity, both on land and in our oceans; food insecurity; climate change; urban development and community planning; alternative energy sources like biofuels and powerful new batteries; even sustainable fashion. Our campus is a living laboratory where we develop and demonstrate solutions, like the world's first high-rise Passive House residential building at Cornell Tech in New York City and a potential geothermal heat system that would harness natural heat below the earth's surface to heat our Ithaca campus. We don't stop there. We're impacting communities by sharing research results, teaching, fostering entrepreneurship, conducting fieldwork, informing public policy, and forging external partnerships. Our outreach extends around our state, around the nation, and around the world so that sustainability at Cornell helps to achieve sustainability beyond Cornell.
