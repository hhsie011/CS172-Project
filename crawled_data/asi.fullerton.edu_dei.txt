About ASI Anti-Racism and DEI Initiatives One Book One CSUF The One Book, One CSUF program is in its second year at Cal State Fullerton. The Titans Together: Striving for Justice, Equity, and Inclusion initiative introduced this program to campus in 2020 in order to foster discussion, challenge perceptions, and promote a sense of unity on campus, utilizing stories that celebrate or highlight themes of diversity, equity, and inclusion. ASI encourages its staff and students to add their voices to the conversation by participating in the various programming and educational opportunities developed by Titans Together, the ASI Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion team, and ASI Student Programs and Engagement. This year, Cal State Fullerton chose They Called Us Enemy by George Takei. They Called Us Enemy is a graphic novel that tells the story of George Takei’s life from the time he was in internment camps all the way until the present day. They Called Us Enemy tackles many themes, including resiliency, fear racism, the power of language, collective and personal trauma, and shame, while exploring historical aspects of American democracy and civic engagement. Several of these themes will be discussed throughout the Spring 2022 semester in ASI’s Book Discussion groups.
