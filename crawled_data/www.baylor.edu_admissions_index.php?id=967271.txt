So, to save you some time in researching, we've broken out the trending financial-related questions students are asking this time of year. General: Q: What additional financial aid options can I explore to supplement my award package? A: This website has all the information you need to know about the types of financial aid and scholarships available to you. Who to contact if you're stuck: Financial Aid (for specific questions about your current award package) or Admissions (for general questions). Q: Regarding the noncustodial parent agreement on the CSS Profile: I don’t have a relationship with my noncustodial parent. Can you process my package, or can I get a waiver so they don’t need to submit the CSS Profile? A: Both parents need to complete an application representing their households. However, if you have a special circumstance, you can submit a CSS Profile Noncustodial Parent Waiver Request along with supporting documentation. You must read the form carefully and only submit it if you think your situation qualifies based on the criteria. This waiver does not need to be completed by the FAFSA/CSS Profile November 1 deadline. Who to contact if you're stuck: Financial Aid or Admissions. Q: My parents' financial situation has changed since 2021 and I believe my Estimated Financial Contribution (EFC) should be lower. A: Learn more about our Special Circumstance Appeal form. If after reading through the information, you feel you may qualify for a Special Circumstance Appeal, you may submit your Special Circumstances Appeal form using the links on the Special Circumstance Appeal webpage. Once all requested documentation has been received, your appeal will be reviewed by the Appeal Committee and you will be contacted after their review concludes. Who to contact if you're stuck: Financial Aid or Admissions. Q: I am unable to submit my forms. What should I do? A: Make sure all required fields are populated and that you are using the correct parent and student PINs. If this still does not work, you can select "I do not consent to submit electronically" and print the forms. Both student and parent will sign each one (if student is a dependent) and send to us at www.baylor.edu/sfs/contactus or fax to 833-969-0184 for processing. Who to contact if you're stuck: Financial Aid or Admissions. Q: I'm confused about verification and conflicting information. A: It’s important to read all tabs/instructions thoroughly as each form will have specific directions outlined to aid with form completion. Who to contact if you're stuck: Financial Aid or Admissions. BearWeb: Q: What is BearWeb? How do I log in? A: BearWeb is used to communicate with you about your financial aid application status, including any needed information. If you are a financial aid applicant, it is important that you check BearWeb often for updates. To log in, use your Bear ID (listed in goBAYLOR) and the same password you have used for goBAYLOR. Who to contact if you're stuck: Financial Aid or Admissions. PIN: Q: I have not received my PIN. What should I do? A: You will not get a PIN until you have been accepted to Baylor. Once accepted, your PIN will be sent to the address and email address submitted with the FAFSA. If the address or email address provided has changed, you will need to contact the Financial Aid office to update your information. The PINs are sent by USPS mail and by email to the parent and student. Students can also access their PIN in BearWeb. Just click Student Financial Services, then Financial Aid, then Student BU Financial Aid PIN. Who to contact if you're stuck: Financial Aid or Admissions. Q: I need to reset my PIN. A: Student PINs can be reset through BearWeb. Just click Student Financial Services, then Financial Aid, then Student BU Financial Aid PIN. Parents should contact Financial Aid or Admissions to have their PIN reset. W2 Form: Q: You’re asking for my student W2 form 2021, but I didn't work. What do I do? A: If you did not work, please indicate you received $0.00 in wages on the Student Wage document. Once processed this will also satisfy the W2 requirement. Who to contact if you're stuck: Financial Aid or Admissions. Q: The student wage document is requiring that I enter an employer, but I didn't work. What do I do? A: Enter “N/A” in the "employer" and "type of work" fields and "$0.00" in the "amount earned" field. Who to contact if you're stuck: Financial Aid or Admissions. Still Have a Question?
