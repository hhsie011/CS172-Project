We seek financial support through annual gifts, capital campaigns, planned giving and other ongoing fund-raising programs. We manage and disburse assets prudently within a policy that encourages the enhancement of the resources of the Foundation. We are governed by a Board of Directors consisting of Clemson alumni and friends who share in the pride of the University's history and who are committed to its promise in the years to come.
