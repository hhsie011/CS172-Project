Study culminates in the Ph.D. in Pathobiology. The Pathobiology program at Brown is interdisciplinary and devoted to defining and understanding mechanisms of disease through the application of molecular biological, biochemical, genetic and immunological methodologies. The program has four major research themes: toxicology and environmental pathology, immunology and infection, aging, and cancer biology. Additional Resources All graduate student research is carried out in faculty research laboratories located on the Brown campus on College Hill, at the Molecular Medicine Research Laboratories in downtown Providence and in the nearby affiliated hospitals. In addition to basic research equipment, tools and facilities, there are several major shared facilities. Current facilities include the following: a microscope facility that houses two high-resolution transmission electron microscopes, a scanning electron microscope, a confocal microscope and image analysis with processing software; professionally staffed animal-care facility fully equipped for animal maintenance, large animal surgery and experimentation; molecular pathology core facility; DNA and protein core facility; hybridoma laboratory; fluorescence-activated cell sorter; molecular modeling center. The 14-story Sciences Library houses approximately 4,000 current periodicals, many also in electronic format; 530,000 bound volumes; electronic database search facilities; and study space for 300 students.
