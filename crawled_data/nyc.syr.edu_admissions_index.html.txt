Undergraduate admissions Graduate school Academics Student life Visit campus Apply to Syracuse University Admissions in NYC Syracuse University in NYC has an admissions office at Lubin House for your convenience. We also sponsor a wide range of activities for students and parents, including programs by individual colleges, financial aid workshops, auditions and portfolio reviews, information sessions, interviews, and parent workshops. While none of these can take the place of a campus visit-which is really the best way to learn about Syracuse University-they do offer you firsthand information about Syracuse University. Since space is limited, please make your reservations at least one week in advance. Personal interviews are available for high school students in the fall of their senior year. An interview is not required, but may strengthen your candidacy. For you, it is a chance to talk with a member of the Admissions Committee and share your goals, interests, and academic information. Interviews are conducted from mid–September through December and must be scheduled in advance on our website. We hold required portfolio reviews and auditions for students applying to the architecture, art and design, acting, musical theater, and design/technical theater programs. Typically, transfer students audition or have portfolios reviewed on the main campus in Syracuse. However, you should call the Office of Recruitment and Admissions in the College of Visual and Performing Arts at 315.443.2769 to see if it is possible to present your portfolio or audition at Lubin House. Please call ahead to make an appointment for portfolio review or audition. Financial aid workshops provide financial aid information and assist families in completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and the College Scholarship Service Profile (CSS Profile). To learn more about any of these events and activities, contact one of our admissions staff or call Lubin House at 212.826.0335.
