We support each individual’s path of meaning-making. We strongly encourage interfaith understanding and partnerships. We also provide opportunities for community service, constructive social action, religious literacy, pastoral counseling, immersion in sacred arts, and much more. We strive to create educated seekers who are spiritually mature, articulate, and compassionate citizens for a pluralistic and complex world, women and men who will engage the great issues of justice and meaning in our time.
