Civil & Environmental Engineering Labs Electrical & Computer Engineering Labs Mechanical Engineering Labs Research Facilities Student Research Graduate Research Competition 2020 The mechanical engineering department works to provide an excellent educational experience. Students leave with technical and communication skills, experience with working on teams and a passion for life long learning that will be needed to succeed in their careers, rise as leaders in their fields and to be active contributors to society through their area of expertise. Undergraduate program produces work-ready engineers set to start their professional practice of engineering and/or entry into graduate school. The ABET accredited Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering offers courses in fundamental engineering and a diverse set of technical electives ranging from biomechanics and energy systems to automotives and robotics. The curriculum places a heavy emphasis on critical thinking, mathematical and scientific approaches to solving engineering problems and design applications for mechanical systems. The challenging, yet rewarding experience is capped with an integrated design experience in the form of a senior project. High-achieving students can also continue study with the +1 Bachelor to Master's Accelerated program. At the graduate level the Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in Mechanical Engineering is organized into areas of study in alternative and renewable energy, biomechanics, dynamical systems and control, material science and thermal and fluid science. Students are mentored by an entrepreneurial and talented faculty, have opportunities to engage in advanced research in the College's labs and centers, and have the flexibility in the course of study to allow for multidisciplinary learning and reasearch with a large selection of courses offered in their area of specialization. Research expenditures and faculty appointments have been growing rapidly as the student body has tripled in size over the last decade. The department is dedicated to progress and ingenuity in discovering new insights and innovations and strives to bring the most up-to-date research into the curriculum, including new courses that will both challenge and prepare students for excellence in the field of engineering and applied sciences.
