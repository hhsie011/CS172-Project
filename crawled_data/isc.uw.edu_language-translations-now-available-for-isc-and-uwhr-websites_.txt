Employees can select their preferred language by using the Select Language drop-down menu found at the upper right of this site as well as UWHR’s website. We hope these language translations help make essential information and important how-to guidance easier to understand and more accessible to all and that our employees find these translations useful. Please be aware that, as translations are done by machine, they may not always be perfect; because of this we can only verify the validity and accuracy of the information provided in English and, therefore, the English version of the website is the official text.
