In addition, schools and departments may request to update a CIP code based on changes to a discipline as it evolves. Any such change must be approved unanimously by three offices: the Registrar's Office; the International Students and Scholars Office; and the Provost's Office. Also note that the New York State Education Department (NYSED) assigns a classification code to each program when it is launched, called a HEGIS code. The HEGIS and CIP codes should be consistent with one another. Therefore, if a CIP code change is requested, there must also be a request to NYSED to update the HEGIS code. A CIP code change can be processed only after receiving NYSED approval for the corresponding HEGIS code change. To learn more about CIP codes, visit the NCES website: https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cipcode/ Departments may submit a request to change a CIP code for an existing program by completing the online request form: https://www.cognitoforms.com/ColumbiaUniversity3/CIPCodeRequestForm Privacy Rights (FERPA) Central Administration of Academic Programs Codes for Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) Retention of Student Education Records Standard Transcript Notations Registrar Highlights Academic Calendar 2020-2021 Directory of Classes Vergil FERPA and Personal Information Graduation and Diplomas Grades and Exams SSOL Office of the University Registrar | 210 Kent Hall, MC 9202, 1140 Amsterdam Avenue, New York, NY 10027 | [email protected]
