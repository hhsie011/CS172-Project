Testimonials “The Guildhall gave me the opportunity to work on a very wide range of systems. In less than 2 years, I worked on all kinds of core technologies — rendering and animation, audio, physics, spatial partitions, game entities, etc. That experience provided me with a broad base of knowledge and competency about all aspects of game development, and there is no other way I can imagine learning so much so quickly. The final team game projects were similar and relevant experience to being on a professional team, with all the challenges and dysfunction that professional teams sometimes endure. The opportunity to take a leadership role on that project gave me confidence that I could manage a team in my professional career as well. ” David Pittman (C5 ) Minor Key Games Featured Alumni Drew Murray Design Director at The Initiative (Microsoft) View Details Grace Liu Lead Environment Artist at Airship Syndicate View Details Apply to SMU Guildhall SMU Guildhall Game Changers Shaped Here 3100 McFarlin Blvd., Suite 306 Dallas , Texas 75275 (214) 768-4278 © SMU Legal Disclosures Site Index Working at SMU Apply to SMU Guildhall x
