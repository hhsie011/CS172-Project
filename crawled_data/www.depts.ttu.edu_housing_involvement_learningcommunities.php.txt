Most Learning Communities (LCs) require students to have been accepted into particular majors, minors, or programs consistent with the focus of the LC. Students select their desired Learning Community when they sign up for housing online. Spaces in Learning Communities are limited and assignments are made on a first-come, first-served basis. What are Learning Communities? Learning Communities (LCs) are unique and transformative communities where students seeking similar academic goals can live, learn, and socialize together. Texas Tech currently has 18 Learning Communities where over 4,000 Red Raiders (about 1/2 of our population) reside. Each Learning Community has designated residence hall floors led by Community Advisors (CAs) who offer tailored programming for students' specific academic and personal needs. CAs are usually members of the same academic program too! Learning Community programs and events are planned and designed each semester by faculty and staff, including CA student staff. Why Participate in a Learning Community? Living in our LCs can help increase a student's chance for academic success, and offer the opportunity to share an intellectual experience with their peers.
