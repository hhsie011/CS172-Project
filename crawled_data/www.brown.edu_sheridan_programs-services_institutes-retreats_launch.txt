During this program, participants will be able to recognize evidence-based practices in course design and see themselves as a member of the teaching and learning community at Brown. Launch will convene via Zoom from August 2-4, 2022. By the end of Launch, participants will: Apply evidence-based practices in course design to their syllabus Meaningfully implement technology into course activities Build community with new instructors at Brown Incorporate peer feedback to develop their syllabus over time Engage with teaching and learning resources that enhance their confidence in course design (or teaching at Brown) Develop an awareness of the Brown culture and environment Critically reflect on their teaching practice View tentative schedule Feedback from past participants “I developed an understanding or reverse course design, which has provided a really nice framework for me to evaluate potential assessments and learning activities. I have gotten really valuable feedback on my own syllabus and made connections to other faculty and Sheridan Staff that will help me fill in the gaps that I identify in the future. All of that is really valuable stuff!” - 2019 Participant “This is huge for feeling welcome in a new community and feeling that I have resources to draw on later in the term.” - 2019 Participant Registration To participate in Launch, please register here by Tuesday, July 19th at 12:00 PM (ET).
