Within our extensive network of Centers and Institutes, UW researchers, staff, and students work across disciplines to extend the boundaries of knowledge. eScience Institute All across our campus, the process of discovery increasingly relies on researchers’ ability to extract knowledge from vast amounts of data. In order to remain at the forefront, UW must be a leader in advancing these techniques and technologies, and in making them accessible to researchers in the broadest imaginable range of fields. This is the mission of the eScience Institute. Institution of Translational Health Sciences ITHS’ goal is to improve the health for people in Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho. ITHS provides opportunities for partnerships between scientists, clinicians and communities needed to tackle complex health issues. Limited Submissions Many federal agencies and foundations offer grants, awards and fellowships that limit the number of applications that can come from one institution. In order to increase the chances of the UW succeeding in such ‘limited submission opportunity’ applications, the Office of Research has established a procedure to review pre-proposals in a timely fashion. Libraries Research Commons Through a partnership with the Graduate School, workshops on citation management, co-authoring, academic publishing, writing and literature review searching are provided on an ongoing basis that foster interdisciplinary activities. ITHS Resource Directory The ITHS Resource Directory connects researchers with tools, technologies, laboratories, and services offered by institutions and organizations throughout the five-state WWAMI region. This centralized directory allows you to quickly search for resources that were previously scattered across numerous different websites.
