Accredited CME, developed and implemented by the University of Louisville, is rooted in evidence-based medicine and seeks to enhance patient care. Expected results of the University of Louisville CME program are to improve the professional competence of physicians and other healthcare team members which ultimately improves performance and improved medical outcomes in patient care. Approved by the CME & PD Advisory Board, 5/30/2017 CME & PD Purpose A cornerstone educational purpose of the University of Louisville School of Medicine is to "provide high quality continuing medical education in an environment of lifelong learning." Further, the School of Medicine has a "mandated statewide mission to meet the educational, research, and patient care needs of the Commonwealth of Kentucky and an urban mission to meet the needs of Louisville..."* CME & PD, in collaboration with our medical community which includes UofL Physicians, the School of Medicine clinical and biomedical science departments, the UofL Hospital, Jewish Hospital, the Robley Rex Veteran's Administration Hospital, Ireland Community Army Hospital, and the Area Health Education Centers of Kentucky, seeks to identify and address professional clinical practice gaps and life-long educational needs. CME & PD offers consultation for the design, delivery, and evaluation of CME programming, and will accredit and document those continuing medical education activities in support of physician life-long learning requirements. Further, CME & PD will provide services as a joint-provider for national and international entities that pursue similar goals of meeting physician CME learning opportunities. * Statement from the UofL School of Medicine LCME database document, 2012-13, referring to the School of Medicine educational objectives.
