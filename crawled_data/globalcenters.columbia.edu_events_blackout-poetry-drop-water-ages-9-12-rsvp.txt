About No Boundaries: Columbia Global Centers, in partnership with the No-Boundaries Committee, have launched the No-Boundaries International Art Exhibitions to foster global awareness and social responsibility in young citizens around the world. The exhibitions aim to build an international art and educational platform by connecting young artists without boundaries of nationality, languages, or culture. Their art will be shown in galleries open to the public in the host cities Paris, Nairobi, New York and Rio de Janeiro. Each city will exhibit selected artwork of children locally and from the other sites, and display a digital representation of all the artwork from children worldwide.
