In order to acquire, preserve and sustain access to materials and resources for all Libraries users, external funding to the Libraries is essential. Gifts to the University Libraries are investments, not only in the future of the Libraries, but in the future of our entire University and community. Such gifts can come in many forms, including annual contributions, gifts of endowment, gifts of personal holdings and planned gifts. In addition, numerous naming opportunities are available within McWherter Library, that allow you to leave a lasting affirmation of your support while providing critical assistance to the Libraries. University Libraries are pleased to accept gifts-in-kind of library materials, provided the materials are appropriate for the library's collection, not duplicative of currently held materials, and in suitable condition for circulation. Gifts-in-kind are handled by the Collection Development area of the Collection Management department. To make a gift please fill out a Donation of Library Materials Form.
