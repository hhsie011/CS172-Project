Our work is directed toward understanding biological systems at the individual, population, and community levels of organization. Major conceptual areas pursued by our department include functional morphology, foraging ecology, the adaptive significance of animal behavior, sexual selection, insect mating behavior, population genetics, phylogenetics, marine community ecology, theoretical population and community ecology, and ecosystem ecology. We study a wide variety of organisms, including plants, insects and spiders, ungulates, reptiles, birds, primates (including humans), marine invertebrates, algae, bacteria, and viruses.
