Our program has served as a helpful "bridge" between undergraduate and doctoral education for many domestic and international students. Applicants are admitted on the basis of: Undergraduate record at an accredited college or university. Scores on the GRE (preferred) or GMAT examination. Letters of recommendation. Admission essays.
