Applications & Assignments Roommates What to Bring (and What to Leave at Home) Important Dates Be prepared for COVID-19 and emergencies: Assemble an emergency supply kit that includes cash, a first aid kit, and a flashlight Face masks A thermometer Prepare a two weeks' supply of snacks, medicine, or other necessities in the case you are required to quarantine or move to isolation housing. What is provided in your room? Student rooms are furnished with the following items: Extra-long twin bed and mattress (39"x80") some beds at 110th St. College Residence are standard twin size Desk & Chair Clothing storage (dresser/drawer space and a closet or wardrobe space) Furnishings vary from room to room, so unfortunately we are not able to provide furniture sizes. You can see photos of sample furniture on each residence hall page at Housing Options. Windows will have a shade or blinds. Students may use a tension bar to hang curtains if they wish, but curtain rods cannot be installed. Window sizes vary from room to room, so unfortunately we are not able to provide dimensions before you move in. Note: the College no longer supplies mirrors in student rooms (although mirrors still in place have not been removed). If your room does not have a mirror, you can use one with "over-the-door" hooks (example photo). Mirrors cannot be nailed or screwed into the walls, etc. What should I bring with me? Recommended items for all students: Bedding (extra-long twin sheets, 39"x80"), blankets/comforter, pillows, towels Flip-flops & shower caddy Laundry items (basket, detergent, iron*) Note: only irons with an automatic shut-off feature are permitted Emergency kit (see below) Renter's Insurance: if your family homeowner's or renter's insurance does not extend to cover you while away at school, we strongly encourage you to look into purchasing renter's insurance. The College accepts no responsibility for the loss of or damage to a student’s personal property, including (but not limited to) fire, theft, water damage, and the elements. [More Information] Listed below are some additional items you may want to bring with you to make your life in campus housing more comfortable. Bring only what can fit in your room -- the residential communities have no storage space for your personal belongings. We encourage students to pack lightly so they don't bring too much with them (you can always get more stuff later if you have room). Only electrical items that are UL-Listed Bathrobe, towels (hand towels, wash cloths, bath towels), shower shoes Book bag or knapsack Computer/laptop, printer, USB drive Fan (most residence halls do not have AC and neither window nor portable AC units are permitted) First Aid kit Refrigerator if living in the Quad or Elliott maximum allowed capacity size is 3.5 cubic feet "microfridges" with a built in microwave are prohibited Surge protector power strip (regular extension cords are not permitted) American power adapters (if bringing appliances from other countries) Suggested Emergency Kit Items The safety of our students while on campus is always our primary concern. Should a natural disaster, severe weather conditions, or other unforeseen emergency occur, it may be necessary for students to be self-sufficient for a short period of time. To that end, all students should bring an emergency supply kit to meet their personal needs. The kit should be stored in your room where you can grab it if needed during an evacuation. Recommended Items to Include in a Basic Emergency Supply Kit: Large backpack to hold your supplies Battery-powered or hand crank radio or a NOAA Weather Radio with tone alert and extra batteries for both Flashlight and extra batteries First aid kit Dust masks to help filter contaminated air and plastic sheeting & duct tape to shelter-in-place Moist towelettes, garbage bags and plastic ties for personal sanitation Sturdy hiking boots or other shoes Extra clothes, including rain gear Emergency phone numbers for your family & friends Packaged/non-perishable snacks/food Reusable water bottle Additional Items to Consider Adding to your Emergency Supply Kit: Cash (small bills) Copy of medical insurance card Map of the city/region Prescription medications and glasses Sleeping bag or warm/emergency blanket Personal hygiene items Emergency reference material such as a first aid book or information from www.ready.gov Paper and pencil Books, cards, non-electric games, puzzles or other activities to pass the time For more information, please visit the NYC Emergency Management website. What to Leave at Home All of your books and notes from high school Your entire wardrobe Ethernet cords (all rooms campus has WiFi) Quarters (the cost of laundry is included in your room price) There will be limited space in your room, so we encourage you not to overpack.
