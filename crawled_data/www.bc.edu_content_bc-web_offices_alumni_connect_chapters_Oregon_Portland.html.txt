Why did you get involved in your local chapter?: I wanted to continue being part of the BC community and make connections with other alums. I also want to support future Eagles and foster community even if we are on the other side of the country! What are your local favorites in your city?: My favorite brunch place is Babica Hen in Lake Oswego, but for food generally you can find me anywhere on 23rd, in a food pod (BGs food cartel in Beaverton or Asylum on Hawthorne), or finding local treasures around the Westside (Decarli, Antojitos House, Syun Izakaya, and the list goes on). Of course there's the gorge and the coast, but locally I enjoy walking the Beaverton powerline trail, Wildwood Trail, and Tryon Creek.
