Catch the BMB trailer here! | Take a tour | BMB members share some research highlights Kim A. Sharp, PhD Chair The BMB Graduate Group has more than 100 world class faculty in the schools of Medicine, Arts & Sciences, Engineering, Dentistry, and Veterinary Medicine, and the affiliated institutions Children's Hospital of Philadelphia & the Wistar Institute. The faculty are passionate about Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, and passionate about sharing their knowledge with the next generation of Ph.D's and Ph.D/MD's. Our mission is to produce the next generation of scientists, scholars, educators and leaders in biomedical sciences. The BMB Graduate Group strongly encourages applications from under-represented minorities and students with disabilities. We partner with the School of Medicine and the University of Pennsylvania at large to provide a welcoming and supportive environment for these students. With the help of the university and medical school offices of diversity we built community, provide networking, peer support and mentoring, host annual symposia, and engage in outreach. With the help of Penn`s Office of Student Disabilities Services we provide extensive support for navigating Penn`s campus, providing accommodations, provide physical resources at the Weingarten Learning Center, and host an annual disability symposium, amongst other initiatives. The BMB Graduate Group offers interdisciplinary training through a rigorous but flexible curriculum, exposure to cutting edge research and unmatched laboratory and research instrumentation facilities. The graduate group draws support from its 'home' department of Biochemistry and Biophysics and the office of Biomedical Graduate Studies which runs admissions and helps administer BMB and the six other Ph.D programs centered in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.

He will be located on the 10th floor of Stellar-Chance. His lab combines computational modeling and wet-bench experiments to study protein dynamics and the functional impact of sequence variants. Lijun Zhou, PhD Lijun Zhou will be joining us January 1, 2023 as a new Assistant Professor in the department and a member of the new Institute for RNA Innovation. Her lab will be located on the 3rd floor of CRB. Lijun studies RNA enzymology in lipid membranes, non-natural RNA chemistry and the interaction of RNA with lipids and proteins. BMB Faculty Spotlight Cornelius Taabazuing, PhD Cornelius Taabazuing's lab is interested in the molecular mechanisms of pyroptotic and apoptotic cell death and how cell death impacts immunogenicity. Kara Bernstein, PhD Kara Bernstein is moving from the University of Pittsburgh with her lab, arriving Summer 2022. She is a leader in the field of DNA damage. Aaron Timperman, PhD Aaron Timperman Research Interests: Nanotechnology, Proteomics, Lab on a Chip. His lab is on the 10th floor of Stellar-Chance.
