Students also gain opportunities to work with faculty whose research is focused on this topic from a variety of perspectives, and participate in thinking about how knowledge is connected to social justice issues that include and go beyond issues related to this group. Programs include sponsorship of speakers, events, and student activities. For more information about the program, please contact the director Min Hyoung Song.
