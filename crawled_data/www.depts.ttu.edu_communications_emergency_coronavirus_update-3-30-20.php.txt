This week, Governor Abbott issued an Executive Order requiring all individuals who travel to Texas through airports in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, or Louisiana to self-quarantine for 14 days. Yesterday, the Governor extended the order to include all road travel from Louisiana and air travel from California, Washington, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, and Florida. Those who arrive in Texas through one of these airports are required to complete a travel form on the Texas Department of Public Safety website. This order is in effect until further notice. Yesterday, Lubbock Mayor Dan Pope issued a Stay At Home Order. This Order requires all Lubbock residents to stay at home allowing travel for essential activities or to obtain essential goods and services only; no public or private gatherings of any size outside a single household; any person who is sick or experiencing COVID-19 symptoms or who has tested positive for COVID-19 must stay at home other than necessary medical or emergency care, and no visits to nursing homes, retirement or long-term care facilities unless to provide critical assistance. Today, in compliance with the Mayor's Stay At Home Order, the Texas Tech University essential designated staff will again be reduced. Only those individuals who have written approval by the President, Provost, or CFO as of today will be allowed to remain on campus; this supersedes any previously given approvals. Supervisors may access the Designated Essential Employee Approval Form. All other faculty, staff, and student employees must begin working from home immediately.
