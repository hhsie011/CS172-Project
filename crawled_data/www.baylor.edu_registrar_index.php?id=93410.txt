The cap does not include housing stipends or books and supplies stipends.For students that are 100% eligible under the Post 9/11 GI Bill®, the VA's current tuition and fees cap for the 2021 - 2022 academic year is $26,042.81. The tuition and fees cap of $26,042.81 is for the entire academic year, NOT semester, and is based on each student's eligibility percentage. The VA's academic year runs from any term starting after August 1st through July 31st. On August 1, every year, the cap resets for the next academic year. NOTE: The amounts below are not split evenly between semesters or quarters. The VA will pay as much of the certified tuition and mandatory fees as possible in the fall semester and then the balance remaining under the cap will be paid in the spring semester. i.e. Baylor fall tuition & mandatory fee charges = estimated $25,200 and spring tuition & mandatory fee charges = estimated $25,200 then the VA fall payment would be $25,200.00 leaving $842.81 for the VA to paid toward the spring semester (based upon 2021 - 2022 figures). Tuition specific scholarships such as academic scholarships, graduate assistantships, and athletic scholarships will be applied toward tuition first. The VA will pay the difference up to the student's specified annual tuition and fee cap payment. For Undergraduate students who meet eligibility requirements, tuition and mandatory fees not covered by the VA cap may be covered through the Yellow Ribbon Program.
