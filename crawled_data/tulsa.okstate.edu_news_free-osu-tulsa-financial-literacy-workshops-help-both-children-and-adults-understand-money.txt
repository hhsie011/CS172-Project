The upcoming April 23 workshop is designed for elementary school students. This fun and interactive lesson will teach younger children the basic principles of money. Ramona Rogers, success coach and author of the children’s financial literacy book “Buck and Penny,” will facilitate the workshop. A continental breakfast will be provided. The April 30 workshop is designed for adults and features Christopher Elmore, wealth manager with Smiley Elmore & Associates, as the presenter. Topics for this workshop include why credit matters, developing a spending and saving plan, understanding investments and recognizing financial responsibility. Registration for the April 23 and April 30 workshops is required. For more information contact Alnetta Morris at 918-594-8305 or alnetta@okstate.edu.
