Our featured courses page highlights a few of them as an introduction, and here we offer some suggestions on how to dig deeper using MyPlan. Sustainability reaches much further than the environment. In 2015, we identified more than 4,000 courses at the UW which are connected to sustainability, using search terms in the economic, social and environmental spheres. We have provided some of the search terms below as suggestions to help you find sustainability courses which work for you. You can use these terms to search MyPlan and find courses. You can also look through the UW course catalog and time schedule for more course information. KeyWords List: Environmental adaptation biodiversity biomass carbon climate conservation eco endangered energy envir food security global health greenhouse gas hazardous pollution radioactive restoration solar steward sustain toxic waste water wind Social activism behavior change civil society community cooperation cultural democracy discrimination diversity domestic violence equitable fair labor gender equality human rights inclusion indigenous lgbt minority native peace solidarity underserved weapons mass destruction wellness Economic consumption corruption globalization governance innovation/innovative modernization policy poverty supply chain welfare SRI social enterprise tradeoffs wealth To arrive at the number of sustainability classes, using the Earth Charter, we identified 30 search terms for each of the spheres of sustainability (economic, social, environmental) for a total of 90 search terms. We queried the UW course catalogue using these search terms. Original result produced over 8,000 courses. 700 were excluded for being non-related to sustainability, approximately 3,500 were identified as duplicates resulting from courses identified by multiple search terms. This left approximately 4,800 courses. These courses were then reviewed and identified as either sustainability-focused or sustainability-related. Courses such as "Topics in...", "Survey on...", "Special Topics", capstones, research, etc. were identified as sustainability-related. After all the courses were identified, we reduced our list to the smallest number of keywords that produce the same results. The table of these keywords is below. To find sustainability focused and related courses, search MyPlan with these terms.
