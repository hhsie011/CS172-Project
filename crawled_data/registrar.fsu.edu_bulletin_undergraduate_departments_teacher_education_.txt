FSU-Teach Program in Secondary Science or Mathematics Teaching Website: https://www.fsu-teach.fsu.edu/ Co-Directors: Dr. Sherry Southerland (College of Education), Dr. Ellen Granger (College of Arts and Sciences); Associate Director: Dr. Robin Smith; Core Faculty: Andrews-Larson, Granger, Jaber, Tekkumru-Kisa, Smith, Southerland; Clinical Faculty: Chalfant, Dyar, Kelso, Rose Jointly developed by the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Education, the FSU-Teach program offers a fully-integrated undergraduate curriculum with concentration areas in middle and secondary science or mathematics education. The FSU-Teach program is directed by Dr. Ellen Granger in the College of Arts and Sciences and Dr. Sherry Southerland of the College of Education; contact Dr. Granger at granger@bio.fsu.edu or Dr. Southerland at ssoutherland@fsu.edu for further details. The program is a double-major only curriculum requiring students to complete a primary major in one of the sciences (biology, chemical science, computer science (BA), environmental science, geosciences, or physical science) or in mathematics in addition to a second major in Secondary Science or Mathematics Teaching (SSMT). Each of the discipline areas has special tracks (designated by “/FSU-Teach”), enabling students to complete both of the majors in four years (120 hours), or they may complete the normal discipline area track and the SSMT major with the understanding that they may exceed the excess credit-hour threshold and be subjected to the excess credit surcharge (https://registrar.fsu.edu/records/excess_hours/). Students may begin taking courses in the program as soon as they matriculate at FSU. After completion of the first two prerequisite courses, SMT 1043 and SMT 1053, during the semester of enrollment in the first early core course, students will purchase LiveText, an assignment-tracking platform. Students with a 2.5 cumulative GPA who have 1) completed the first two prerequisite courses (SMT 1043 and SMT 1053) and the early core coursework (before SMT 4301), 2) earned 18 hours of the FSU Liberal Studies curriculum, 3) passed the all sections of the General Knowledge portion of the Florida Teacher Certification Exam, and 4) have been certified to upper division, must apply for formal admission to Educator Preparation and the required second major (SSMT). Juniors or seniors will apply once adequate progress in courses in the primary major is achieved. Application deadlines are November 1 and July 1. At formal admission to Educator Preparation, students will have completed or achieved: SMT 1043 and SMT 1053, the common-course prerequisites for the respective content-area major, and a passing score on all four sections of the General Knowledge portion of the Florida Teacher Certification Exam (FTCE). Note that FSU-Teach majors are exempt from the statewide pre-education common core of EDF X005, EDG X701, and EME X040. Application for the student teaching internship is submitted upon achievement of passing scores on the appropriate Subject Area Exam and Professional Education portions of the FTCE. The program is structured to allow matriculation at multiple entry points for students at different stages of their undergraduate enrollments (freshman through senior). The program encourages all students with qualifying science or mathematics coursework to explore teaching by taking the SMT 1043 and SMT 1053 prerequisite courses and have their in-state tuition reimbursed with a course grade of “C–” or better. The following courses are ALSO required for graduation: HIS 3505, ISC 3523C, and MAT 3503 (for mathematics majors). In summary, graduation from the FSU-Teach program requires successful completion of a semester-long student teaching internship in a Florida public school, completion of both sets of coursework requirements for the double-major curriculum, achievement of passing scores on the appropriate Subject Area exam and Professional Education portions of the FTCE, and retention of a cumulative GPA of 2.5 or better in both majors. Computer Skills Competency All undergraduates at Florida State University must demonstrate basic computer skills competency prior to graduation. As necessary computer competency skills vary from discipline to discipline, each major determines the courses needed to satisfy this requirement. Undergraduate majors in Geosciences/FSU-Teach and Environmental Sciences/FSU-Teach satisfy this requirement by earning no less than a “C–” in ISC 3523C. Undergraduate majors in Biology/FSU-Teach satisfy this requirement by earning no less than a “C–” in BSC 2010L or ISC 3523C. Undergraduate majors in Chemical Sciences/FSU-Teach satisfy this requirement by earning no less than a “C–” in CHM 3120L or ISC 3523C. Undergraduate majors in Mathematics/FSU-Teach satisfy this requirement by earning no less than a “C–” in COP 3014 or ISC 3313. Undergraduate majors in Physical Science/FSU-Teach satisfy this requirement by earning no less than a “C–” in COP 3014, ISC 3313, or PHZ 4151C. Undergraduate majors in Computer Science-Math satisfy this requirement by earning no less than a “C-” in COP 3014 or COP 3363.

This test is required for certification and is part of the Florida Teacher Certification Examination. Curriculum for Teachers of Secondary Social Science Students preparing to teach secondary school social science must complete between thirty-six and thirty-nine semester hours as follows: six semester hours of economics, three semester hours of geography, six semester hours of American government, nine semester hours of American history, six semester hours of world history, three semester hours of public speaking (this can be exempted based on speaking work completed in high school), three semester hours of history at the 3000/4000 level, and a three-semester hour course in a non-European history. The thirty-nine semester hours may include courses in history and social science taken for liberal studies and those taken to meet the state of Florida common program prerequisites for admission to the upper division major. All courses must be passed with a minimum of a “C–” grade. Professional education requirements and prerequisites for student teaching are available online at https://undergrad1.its.fsu.edu/academic_guide/guide-display.php?program=social-science-education. Prior to admission to student teaching, students must achieve an overall GPA of 2.5 or higher and earn a grade of “C” or better in each of the social science education (SSE) courses. The state of Florida requires that all school districts initiate a level II (FDLE and FBI) criminal background check on all adults who work in schools. Courses in Social Science Education have a required school component. Thus it is not possible to pass these courses if the student is blocked from entering Leon County Schools. While enrolled in Educator Preparation programs, the student is expected to demonstrate behaviors and dispositions that conform to the “Code of Ethics” (State Board of Education Rule 6B-1.00, FAC) and the “Principles of Professional Conduct in Florida” (State Board of Education Rule 6B-1.006, FAC). The programs reserve the right to refuse or discontinue enrollment of any student who violates these expectations or in the judgment of a majority of the program faculty does not meet the program standards. Progression to Upper-Division Students may make application to upper-division upon completion of all minimum requirements. Applicants should submit a completed program application to the Office of Academic Services and Intern Support, 2301 Stone Building. Students affected by this policy are advised to work closely with an advisor to plan completion of Liberal Studies for the 21st Century requirements and program prerequisites. All applicants must have fulfilled the common program prerequisites, specific program prerequisites, and have satisfied all other criteria for admission to Educator Preparation programs prior to their first semester in the program, including achievement of a passing score on the General Knowledge portion of the Florida Teacher Certification Examination. See the section entitled Planning Guide to Educator Preparation Programs under the “College of Education” chapter in this General Bulletin. Computer Skills Competency All undergraduates at Florida State University must demonstrate basic computer skills competency prior to graduation. As necessary computer competency skills vary from discipline to discipline, each major determines the courses needed to satisfy this requirement. Undergraduate majors in all middle and secondary education programs except FSU-Teach satisfy this requirement by earning no less than a “C–” in EME 2040. State of Florida Common Program Prerequisites The state of Florida has identified common program prerequisites for this University degree program.
