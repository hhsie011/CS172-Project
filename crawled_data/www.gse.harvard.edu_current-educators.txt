Instagram Current Educators The Harvard Graduate School of Education is committed to engaging with current educators — supporting them in their professional development, connecting them to research and best practices, and sharing the voices and new perspectives of leading practitioners, scholars, and thinkers in the field of education. We invite educators to explore our offerings. Usable Knowledge Usable Knowledge is an online resource from the Harvard Graduate School of Education that aims to make education research and best practices accessible to educators, district and network leaders, policymakers, members of the media, nonprofit leaders, entrepreneurs, and parents. Usable Knowledge translates research by Harvard faculty and other leading scholars and practitioners, creating vibrant, easy-to-understand stories and videos for sharing on our website, in our email newsletter, and in social media. We aim to be a trusted source for powerful, actionable insights into what works in education — to put smart, trustworthy, and useful information directly into the hands of practitioners, who can use it to make a difference in their classrooms, schools, districts, universities, and communities. Educators can sign up to receive our free monthly newsletter and follow along on Twitter, or add your comments to our Facebook stories.
