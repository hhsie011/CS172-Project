Just technology knowledge can only go so far. You have to understand how people are going to use them to be truly successful." Ozzie Fallick '14, Software Engineer, Google Linguistics "Cross-cultural communication is one of the most important skills that I learned at ARHU, and I use it to engage and inform the community in Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean about our events, exchanges and any other information that supports our key policy priorities in the region. ARHU gave me the tools to understand why in diplomacy, it’s as much about what you say as how you say it." Krystle Norman '08, Foreign Service Officer, U.S. Department of State Spanish and Portuguese "I had always loved art, but I never knew you could make a career out of it until I studied abroad in Rome. There, I took a full course load of art courses and learned all about the factors of being an art professional. It was life-changing. Now I feel lucky that I’m doing something that I’m so passionate about." Laura Sheridan Raiffe '09, Regional Account Manager, Christie's Fine Arts Art History and Archaeology "One of the most important things I got out of my ARHU experience is my ability to parse arguments, think critically and see multiple sides of an issue. Being in law school, it’s important to do that—it’s a skill I use every day. Not a class goes by, not a case gets read that this skill doesn’t come into play."
