Dr. Austin made a call-to-action to address the opioid crisis and develop potential strategies that maximize the special capacities at each CTSA Program hub and of the overall CTSA Program network. In response, the Irving Institute began an extensive internal environmental scan and brainstorming process and in December 2017, convened a group of over 60 Columbia University experts across the spectrum of opioid research ranging from the mechanisms of pain to community interventions, drug abuse treatment research, neuroscience, implementation research, and education. Multiple schools and departments throughout Columbia University have been engaged including engineering, nursing, dentistry, social work, psychology, business, and chemistry, as well as Columbia University Irving Medical Center, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, and New York State Psychiatric Institute. Four working groups developed through the brainstorm and a steering committee was formed and convened in 2018. These efforts have fostered new collaborations among researchers, industry partners, and the community to address the opioid crisis. These new partnerships will facilitate response to future funding opportunities and implementation of new strategies. Read our white paper for more details on how we are responding to the opioid crisis. Current Work Starting in 2020, the Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, along with other Columbia University researchers, the School of Social Work and the New York State Psychiatric Institute’s Division on Substance Use Disorders launched the new Center for Healing of Opioid and Other Substance Use Disorders-Enhancing Intervention, Development and Implementation (CHOSEN). This multidisciplinary center will combat the growing crisis of opioid and other substance use disorders in New York City and across New York State. Visit the CHOSEN website to see all current work being done in this area. Dr. Muredach Reilly, Director of the Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, and Co-Director Dr. Harold Pincus have joined the leadership team. Funding Initiatives NIH's HEAL initiative has numerous funding opportunities. For more information and to subscribe to its listserv, visit NIH Heal Initiative Funding Opportunities. Federal and Non-Federal Opportunities in Opioid Research contains additional opportunities, updated in real-time, from Pivot, a funding opportunity database.

Past Events Columbia Opioid Brainstorm – December 21, 2017 On Thursday, December 21, 2017, the Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research hosted a brainstorm session about the opioid crisis. Experts were convened from across Columbia University (CU), New York-Presbyterian Hospital (NYP), New York State Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI), and northern Manhattan community organizations. Columbia University experts represented the spectrum of opioid and pain research ranging from the mechanisms of pain to community interventions, implementation research, and education for pain and opioid addiction. The brainstorm was held from 11:30am – 2:00pm and featured a pre-meeting lunch (11:30am-12:00pm), an introduction and overview (12:00 – 12:05pm), brief talks from six experts (12:05 – 12:35pm), four individual breakout group sessions (12:40 – 1:30pm), a discussion session integrating all breakout groups (1:30 – 1:50pm), and a closing summary (1:50 – 2:00pm). Brainstorm Summary Columbia Opioid Symposium – June 22, 2018 On June 22, 2018 the Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research hosted a symposium to stimulate collaborations among researchers, industry partners and the community to advance new efforts to address the opioid crisis. More than 200 attendees gathered for the Columbia Opioid Symposium titled “New Collaborations Towards New Solutions”. The day began with plenary talks and presentations from across several domains including local efforts from Commissioner Mary T. Bassett, New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and national efforts from Carlos Blanco from the National Institute for Drug Abuse (NIDA) to address the opioid crisis, as well as research updates from Columbia faculty. A networking lunch followed where attendees, including researchers, community leaders and members of industry organizations were able to collaborate and connect. The day ended with two concurrent networking sessions – one focused on business synergies and the other on community engagement. Both of these sessions included presentations from each field and a panel discussion. The community session was co-hosted by the Irving Institute’s Community Engagement Core Resource (CECR), NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia School of Social Work and the Washington Heights Corner Project. The industry session was co-hosted by the Columbia Business School Healthcare and Pharmaceutical Management Program and Columbia Technology Ventures.
