They receive a liberal arts education, learning from professors who have distinguished themselves in disciplines including anthropology, biology, and medicine; the arts, literature, and languages; and theology, philosophy, and political science, among others. Faculty members care for students’ academic success and their personal formation as well. Members of the Honors College, through study and conversation, learn, grow, and challenge one another. We are inspired by St. Anselm who famously said, “credo ut intelligam” or "I do not seek to understand in order that I may believe, but rather, I believe in order that I may understand.” As one example of the nationally celebrated intellectual leadership and life the Honors College embodies, check out our 100 Days of Dante project. Background, media release for launch of the project, and an invitation to join are available here. To learn more about our vision and opportunities for students, take a look at our viewbook below!
