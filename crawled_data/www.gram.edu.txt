We appreciate your continued support and patience as we work through this unprecedented time. Mask Requirement Lifted Grambling State University will adhere to UL System guidelines and follow the recommendations of state and local health officials as much as reasonably possible to continue to reduce the spread of COVID-19. To that end, all faculty, staff, students, and others present on campus are expected to follow the same guidelines and recommendations set by the UL System and state and local health officials. While subject to change, everyone is expected to adhere to the following: Face masks and coverings may be worn on campus but are not required. Students, faculty, and staff on campus should practice frequent handwashing. If you are feeling sick, have tested positive for COVID-19, or have been in direct contact with a person who has COVID-19, you should follow the University’s protocols found here. The mask policy and COVID-19 protocols remain for students or employees who have been exposed or tested positive for COVID-19. This includes the requirement that masks must be worn for five days following a COVID-related quarantine. Learn more about COVID-19 Isolation and Quarantine protocols. The university will continue to monitor COVID-19 rates and may, if necessary, reinstate the mask requirement on campus.
