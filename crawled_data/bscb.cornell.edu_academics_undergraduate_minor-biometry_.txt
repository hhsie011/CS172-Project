Statistics is concerned with many aspects of scientific investigations: developing and studying the design and measurement aspects of investigations, executing investigations and collecting numerical information, summarizing the data obtained, and making inferences from the data. Students learn how to use statistics, mathematics, computing, and other methods to solve problems in diverse fields, from the life and social sciences to business and finance. Students enter the Biometry and Statistics major as freshmen or as transfer students. A strong background in mathematics is highly recommended for students considering a major in Biometry and Statistics. Students currently enrolled as freshmen or sophomores at other institutions who are considering transferring to the Biometry and Statistics program are encouraged to satisfy as many of the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS) distribution requirements as possible before transferring. Major Minor Transfer Major in Biometry and Statistics Bachelor of Science (B.S.) Biometry and Statistics majors have many career opportunities and possibilities for graduate study. Career choices are as varied as the fields of application of statistics. Collecting and using data effectively are vital activities in many organizations. Recent research in Biometry and Statistics includes discovering human genes and modeling the evolution and domestication of dogs. Admissions Requirements CALS seeks students who maintain a rigorous high school curriculum and demonstrate an outstanding record of academic achievement. 4 Units of English 4 Units of Mathematics (including calculus) 3 Units of Science (biology, chemistry and physics recommended) Also recommended: an additional unit of science Major Requirements Biometry and Statistics major requirements for students entering the major in: Fall 2021 or Spring 2022 Fall 2020 or Spring 2021 Fall 2019 or Spring 2020 Fall 2018 or Spring 2019 Fall 2017 or Spring 2018 All courses satisfying the major requirements must have a letter grade of C- or better.

Explain and apply the fundamentals of applied statistical methodology. Use modern statistical software and a programming language. Effectively communicate the results of a statistical analysis. Students in the statistics concentration should be able to: Demonstrate knowledge of specialized statistical methods Students in the statistical genomics concentration should be able to: Apply statistical and computational methods for genomic data Minor in Biometry and Statistics The Minor in Biometry and Statistics is designed to provide students with basic knowledge of statistical techniques and the mathematics necessary to understand and use them. To obtain a Minor students must take the required courses and three elective courses from the electives list. Students may petition to have other courses that are not listed as electives. Courses taken at other institutions may be credited towards the minor, but a minimum of three elective courses must be taken at Cornell.
