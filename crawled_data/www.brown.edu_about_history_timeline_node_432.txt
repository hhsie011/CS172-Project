The resourceful Harris borrowed some drums stored on campus by the Navy after World War I and led the band in their first parade to the Stadium (following its dedication in 1925), in which they enthusiastically played the one song they knew, on repeat. Within just a few years, the band was playing at football, hockey and baseball games, as well as community concerts, the welcoming of first year students and campus sings.
