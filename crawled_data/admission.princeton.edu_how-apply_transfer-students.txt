Our transfer admission program involves a highly individualized holistic review of each applicant’s achievements, talents and potential to contribute to learning at Princeton, with the expectation that admitted students are prepared to thrive in our diverse and rigorous learning environment. Transfer students, like first-year students, will be able to enroll in the fall term only. Most students will be expected to begin in their sophomore (second) year. However, in some cases, they may begin as juniors, or be required to enter as first-year students. In all cases, this standing is determined by Princeton faculty and college deans after an evaluation of transfer credit. Additional information about the transfer program is also available through the Office of the Dean of the College's Emma Bloomberg Center for Access and Opportunity. For questions about the transfer admission process, please contact uatransfer@princeton.edu.
