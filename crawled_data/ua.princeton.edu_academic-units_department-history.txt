Program Information Information and Departmental Plan of Study The plan of departmental study encourages the student to gain further knowledge of the major developments in (and problems of) history, spanning a broad range of time and place. Students also develop more focused expertise through independent historical research and writing. Through coursework and rigorous independent research, the history concentration emphasizes both depth and breadth. The department's website, describes the program and requirements in detail. Prerequisites Before they enter the department, students (beginning with the class of 2023) are required to take and pass one (1) 200-level course from the list designated as prerequisites. Prospective concentrators who have not fulfilled the 200-level prerequisite should consult with the director of undergraduate studies and plan to take one of the appropriate courses in the fall of the junior year. Program of Study Course Advising Before preregistration each term, each history student must consult with one of the department's designated undergraduate advisers. Departmental Distribution Requirements University regulations stipulate that undergraduates may not take more than 12 departmental courses. Departmental regulations stipulate that undergraduates must pass at least 10 courses, including HIS 400, in order to receive the A.B. degree. History courses taken in the first year and sophomore years are numbered among the 10 to 12 required for graduation. Starting with the class of 2023 students must take at least one course in each of the following four thematic areas: Knowledge & Belief (KB), Power & Conflict (PC), Pre-Modern, pre-1700 (PM), Race & Difference (RD). See the Distribution Requirements for a list of courses satisfying each of these areas. Many courses carry more than one designation. A single course may satisfy only one thematic requirement. In addition to the thematic areas at least two (2) courses must also fulfill the Geographical Distribution Requirements that are principally focused on Africa, Asia, Latin America, or the Middle East. These courses may double count with the thematic courses *Students who entered the concentration in the spring of 2020, took a gap year, and joined the class of 2023 should consult with the director of undergraduate studies about the new requirements. Cognates The Department allows students to take courses in other departments that will add depth and variety to their study of history. When taken during the junior and senior year, up to two (2) such courses may be counted as departmental courses i.e., cognates, provided they contribute significantly to the student's field of concentration and/or independent work, and are substantially historical in their content. Cross-listed courses, such as CLA 217 and NES 201, are not cognates; they are automatically considered departmental courses. The designation of a course as a cognate must be approved by the director of undergraduate studies. The designation of a cognate course as a departmental should take place during the enrollment/advising period but no later than the University's "deadline for 'free course' change" (approximately two weeks after the beginning of the semester). Courses cannot be declared cognates retroactively nor can they be changed later to non-departmentals. Cognate courses do not satisfy distribution requirements; however, they count in the determination of departmental standing and honors. History of Science Students should have an understanding of the history of science, technology, and medicine at various times and in various places and be able to address questions concerning the conceptual and institutional development of these activities in relation to the societies that pursue them. History majors wishing to concentrate in the History of Science are required to meet thematic requirements (4 courses) and geographic requirement (2 courses, which can overlap with the thematic) among their ten to twelve courses. They must also take courses that satisfy the following requirements: Two courses in science, engineering, or mathematics in addition to those used to fill the university's science distribution requirement. Four of the following courses (With the permission of the director of undergraduate studies, one of these courses may be replaced by a cognate course from another department, for example, in philosophy or sociology of science). These specific courses can and almost certianly will also serve to at least partially meet the geographic and thematic requirements: 277 Technology and Society (see EGR 277) 290 The Scientific Worldview of Antiquity and the Middle Ages 291 The Scientific Revolution and European Order, 1500-1750 292 Science in the Modern World 293 Science in a Global Context: 15th to 20th Century 294 What is the Scientific Revolution? 295 Making America: A Technological History of the United States 297 Transformative Questions in Biology (see STC 297) 391 History of Contemporary Science 392 History of Evolution 393 Race, Drugs, and Drug Policy in America 394 History of Ecology and Environmentalism 395 History of Medicine and the Body 396 History of Biology 397 Medicine and the Mind: A History of Psychiatry from the Asylum to Zoloft 398 Technologies and Their Societies: Historical Perspectives 399 In the Groove: Technology and Music in American History, from Edison to the iPod (see AMS 399) 452 Magic, Matter, Medicine: Science in the Medieval World 472 Medicine and Society in China: Past and Present 489 The Scientific Self 493 '1, 2, 3, Testing,'. . . in the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine 495 Alchemy: Art and Science 494 Broken Brains, Shattered Minds 495 Alchemy: Art and Science 496 History of Neuroscience 497 Eating, Growing, Catching, Knowing: Historical Perspectives on Food, Science, and the Environment 498 History of Pseudoscience 499 Things The independent work and comprehensive examination requirements are the same as for all other departmental majors. Independent Work Junior Year In the fall term of the junior year students are required to enroll in HIS 400 Junior Seminars. Work in the junior seminars involves exercises in defining a topic for historical research and in identifying and evaluating a body of historical literature. Each student may expect to gain experience in the use of the library and bibliographical sources, to learn the correct technical form for presenting evidence clearly, and to develop a historical presentation convincingly. Students in HIS 400 will have the opportunity to choose from a number of seminars devoted to historical events or themes of wide importance, such as "Irregular Warfare," "Space History," "Comparative Revolutions," The United States and Latin America," or "The Political Uses of American Streets." In the spring term of the junior year, in consultation with his or her adviser, the student selects a topic and writes a research paper on an independent basis. Written work equivalent to that submitted in the first term is required. The two semesters of junior independent work must be focused in two different geographical fields and in two different time periods. Students should consult their advisers about this requirement. Senior Year The independent work consists of writing a thesis on an approved subject of the student's choice. The thesis usually relies on research in original source materials, but it may also involve reinterpretation of familiar materials. Senior Departmental Examination The senior departmental examination in the department consists of an oral examination based on the senior thesis and related topics. Study Abroad NOTE: All semester abroad opportunities will be contingent upon a number of factors, including health and safety conditions abroad, domestic and international travel restrictions, program-specific protocols related to COVID-19, and the guidelines for sponsored travel as outlined by the University (for further information, consult the Office of International Programs). The department has the following policies: Sophomores intending to major in history may count one history course taken abroad toward the requirement to enter the department. The course cannot be used to substitute for the 200-level prerequisite (see above). Juniors majoring in the department may receive credit for up to four courses in history taken while abroad for either a full year or semester. These courses will require the prior approval of the director of undergraduate studies, and to secure that approval, students will be expected to produce some evidence of the work load and the material covered by the courses. The department's spring HIS 400 junior seminar will be open to sophomores intending to go abroad in the fall of their junior year, thus enabling them to do their first junior paper in the spring of their sophomore year and preparing them to write the second while abroad or in the resident semester of their junior year (if they elect to spend only one semester abroad). Students who meet the requirements of junior independent work while at Princeton will still be expected to undertake a full course load while abroad. Moreover, to take full advantage of the international experience, study abroad should include some research work, and we urge students to take seminars that include a research component. Interdepartmental Programs Interdepartmental programs of particular interest to history department students are the Programs in African Studies, African American Studies, American Studies, Asian American Studies, Classics, East Asian Studies, European Cultural Studies, Gender and Sexuality Studies, Hellenic Studies, History and the Practice of Diplomacy, Judaic Studies, Latin American Studies, Medieval Studies, and Near Eastern Studies. Students should consult the director of undergraduate studies and the director of the relevant program. Courses HIS 201 A History of the World Fall CDHA An overview of world history.
