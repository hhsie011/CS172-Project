In accordance with the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), Cornell University provides up to 12 weeks of unpaid family and medical leave (FMLA) for eligible employees If your need for the leave is foreseeable, please request the leave from your supervisor at least 30 days in advance. A request for Personal Medical Leave must be supported by a health care provider verification form. Employees are responsible for ensuring that verification is provided within 15 calendar days from the day Medical Leaves receives the tentative approval letter. What you need to know Staff utilizing Personal Medical Leave may choose to use accrued vacation or health and personal leave to supplement all or part of the leave. Staff on paid leaves during a holiday will receive holiday pay and will not be required to use sick leave or vacation time on that day. Staff on unpaid leaves are not eligible for holiday pay. If you are on an approved leave and are using intermittent time away from work, you need to let your department know as far ahead of time as possible regarding the day sand times you will need off. You also need to follow your department’s rules and regulations regarding call-in procedures. Ex. If you take a day off to care for a Family member, you would need to let your department know that you are taking the day off for the care of your family member. If you just call in sick, then your department will count that as a sick day. If you do not understand the call in procedures please check with your department. Employees may continue their existing health insurance coverage during these leaves provided they continue to pay their share of the premiums. If you do not return to work after the leaves then you may be responsible for the health insurance premiums at the full cost. It is your responsibility to read Cornell University Policy 6.9 Time Away from Work and its accompanying guidelines for your further understanding of the condition and requirements of the leave.
