Columbia University’s Food Systems & Climate Symposium will explore how global practitioners are working to resolve these issues to transition towards low-carbon, nature-positive, efficient and just food systems. Organizations and groups from all sectors are engaging with solutions to finance sustainable agricultural practices, support the rights and economic development of smallholder farmers, enhance resilience to climate change and ensure that our food system can continue to provide us nutritious and plentiful food now and in the future. Led by a group of graduate students from the School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA), the symposium will convene a series of panels and case studies in a hybrid modality on Friday, April 1st, 2022. 9:00am - 10:00am | Introduction and Keynote Speech 10:15 - 11:15 | Panel 1 - Nutrition and Food Security in the Climate Crisis 11:30am - 12:30pm | Panel 2 - The present and future of smallholder farming 12:30pm - 1:30pm | Lunch break 1:30pm - 2:30pm | Panel 3 - Innovating Finance for Resilient Food Systems 2:45pm - 3:45pm | Panel 4 - Shifting Consumer Preferences 4:00pm - 4:30pm | Event closing and final words 5:00pm - 7:00pm | Social Event Speakers Include Dr. Ruth Defries Dr. Glenn Denning Dr. Jessica Fanzo - Johns Hopkins University Dr. Pamela Koch - Columbia University Teacher’s College Dr. Molly Brown - Natural Resources Institute, University of Greenwich Dr. Lewis Ziska - Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health Dr. Jason Evans - Jownson & Wales University Jeffery Potent - Columbia University Julie Kunen - Oatly Dr. Marleen Onwesen - Wageningen University Steve Sands - Performance Food Group Dr. Matthew Hayek - NYU/Food Climate Partnership Contact Information Morgan Elizabeth Booher [email protected] Upcoming Events Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory61 Route 9W · Palisades, NY 10964 Phone 845-359-2900 Contact Us [email protected] Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
