UTS Series #2 – Pitching 101: How to Present Your Startups and Technology Innovation to Potential Funders November 2, 2021 — 12:00 pm - 1:00 pm Free « CTL IP Series #1: Understanding the Technology Transfer Process OUP Webinar: Ask a VC webinar » For CTL second University Technology Startup (UTS) series, Margalit Haber and Ajay Rayasam at Osage University Partners (OUP) will focus the session on how an entrepreneur, or a faculty-entrepreneur can develop and deliver a pitch to gain interest and commitment from potential investors. Pitching an early-stage science- and technology-based startup to potential funders can be intimidating. Learning how to tailor your presentation and understanding what motivates funders to say yes, or at least not give you an outright no, are important aspects of preparing for your initial pitch. This talk will be structured around OUP’s many years of experience in hearing pitches and reviewing pitch decks to provide insight on creating and presenting an initial startup pitch to funders.
