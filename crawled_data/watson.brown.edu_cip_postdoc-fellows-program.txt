Central to this mission is the Watson Postdoctoral Fellows Program, which supports young social scientists conducting research related to the Institute’s three core thematic areas: development, governance, and security. Participants in this program will join an interdisciplinary community of scholars engaged in theoretically and substantively important research addressing the most pressing global issues of our time. How to apply The application for the Watson Institute Postdoctoral Fellows Program 2022-2024 has now closed. We will open the application for 2023-2025 in September 2022. Qualifications: The fellowship competition is open to candidates from across the social sciences on issues that can be understood in a comparative global context. The selection process, open with regard to nationality and geographic area of research, is highly competitive and typically generates over 500 applications for 4 or 5 places. Scholars who have received their PhDs within two years of the application deadline are eligible to apply. Individuals who are currently – or have previously been – postdoctoral fellows in other programs are not eligible to apply. Fellows receive two years of support, with the expectation that they will pursue research and participate fully in the intellectual life of the Institute. Fellows will also teach one course per year in the Institute or in an affiliated Brown University social science department, and are required to be in residence during the academic year.
