These sessions will explore non-verbal and experiential healing techniques, self-calming tools, and guide participants in incorporating mindfulness into your daily lives. The Voice Journey workshop guides participants to experience the intrinsic power of their voices through simple, accessible, and liberatory practices of creativity and sound, including toning, chanting, singing, and sound-making. The Voice Journey approach emphasizes not only strengthening vocal technique, but expanding where you can take your voice, while also increasing awareness of the powerful nature of vocal vibration as it relates to physical, mental, and emotional states, exploring where your voice can take you. With continued practice, the concepts introduced open pathways for each participants unique "voice journey" to unfold and become an integrated element of self-care, healing and growth. No singing experience necessary.
