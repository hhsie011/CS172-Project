This war had a dramatic effect on the psychological, political, and aesthetic landscape of Europe and North America. Although it is sometimes overshadowed in twentieth-century history by the second World War, the first World War inspired doubt, cynicism, and nostalgia that has resounded to the present day in musical works. This exhibit takes a look at a few pieces with content that was directly inspired by the events of the war. There is work by Joan Littlewood, Kevin Puts, Alban Berg, John Foulds, and Igor Stravinsky. Location: Orwig Music Library Date: September 2014—January 9, 2015 This entry was posted in Exhibits & Events by [email protected]. Bookmark the permalink.
