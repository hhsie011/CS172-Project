It is designed for students with a strong interest in big data and other quantitative approaches to biology. The curriculum introduces students to experimental techniques for acquisition of large-scale quantitative observations of biological systems, and the interpretation of such data in the context of appropriate models. Examples of ongoing research include organizational principles of metabolic networks, quantitative modeling of cell biological processes, the genetic basis of complex behavior, comparative genomics of regulatory networks, quantitative analysis of gene-environment interactions, evolution of gene regulation, and circuitry driving aging. At the core of the curriculum is independent research initiated in the fall of sophomore or junior year, in which students participate in the design, execution, and analysis of experiments in a host laboratory of their choice. The required courses provide a strong background in modern methodologies in data analysis, interpretation, and modeling. A certificate in quantitative and computational biology is awarded to students who successfully complete the program requirements. Note that the Graduate Program in Quantitative and Computational Biology is distinct from this Undergraduate Program.
