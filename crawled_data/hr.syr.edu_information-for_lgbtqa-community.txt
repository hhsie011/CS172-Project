These benefits are available to eligible employees, their legal spouses, or same- or opposite-sex domestic partners and their children. Benefits include: Medical coverage for gender-confirming or affirming surgeries, mental health counseling, and hormone therapy for transitioning individuals; the Faculty and Staff Assistance program through Carebridge, which provides free, confidential telephonic or in-person counseling and online resources; Supplemental life insurance for same-sex domestic partners; Generous paid time off policies, such as funeral/bereavement and employee sick time, that may be used for family members, including domestic partners; and Adoption Assistance benefits to provide reimbursement for adoption-related expenses. All members of the Syracuse University campus community can set a Preferred Name in MySlice, which will display in many University software systems, including as their email display name. All students, faculty, and staff can also select their Pronouns in MySlice, which are being increasingly used across University software systems. Socially, personal pronouns are also to be used in a respectful manner upon learnings the ones a person uses. The LGBTQ Resource Center serves all Syracuse University students, faculty, and staff, providing resources and support to members of the LGBTQA community and allies. The University Senate Committee on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Asexual (LGBTQA) Justice and Advocacy focuses on improving the campus climate for students, staff, and faculty who hold historically marginalized genders and sexualities. The committee will advocate changes in university policy and practices, educate campus leaders and the university community about LGBTQA+ identities and needs, and facilitate public dialogue on intersectional queer and transgender issues. Academically, the LGBTQ Studies program offers opportunities to learn about LGBTQ experience, history, and scholarship. Eligible employees can utilize Remitted and Dependent Tuition benefits to access these courses.
