In 2006, Brown University became a founding member of the New England Higher Education Recruitment Consortium (NE-HERC), a free database of job openings at member institutions. In 2008, the Office of the Dean of the Faculty launched the Family-Friendly Policies and Programs for Brown Faculty website, which outlines University policies, procedures, and dependent care resources available to faculty. Among the policies included is the opt-out tenure-clock extension for parents of a new child and the Dependent Care Travel Fund, which provides support for dependent care expenses incurred in association with professional travel. In addition, University Human Resources implemented a Backup Care Program at Brown to assist with caring for dependents. The Mt. Hope Childcare center opened an infant room with priority placement for Brown faculty and staff in Fall 2009. ADVANCE at Brown promotes these policies as well as supplemental information including extensive local employment information and resources for academic leadership and policy makers.
