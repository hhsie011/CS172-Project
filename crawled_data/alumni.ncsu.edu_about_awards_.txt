The funding support for these awards comes from the North Carolina license plate program. When alumni purchase a specialized NC State license plate, a portion of the proceeds are returned to the Alumni Association to reward faculty. The Alumni Association is proud to use these dollars to honor hard-working faculty who create the ties that bind students to NC State for a lifetime and elicit their unending gratitude for an education that changed their lives. Nominations are made for these awards by deans, department heads, peers and students. Criteria are rigorous, numerous nominations are received and final selections are made by five different committees. Awards include: Alumni Association Distinguished Professorship Honors the “best of the best” in undergraduate and graduate instruction Undergraduate award established in 1968; Graduate award established in 1983 Honoree receives a $4,000 stipend Alumni Association Outstanding Research Award Honors faculty members who make significant advances in their fields and mentor other research faculty First presented in 1981 All winners are inducted into NC State’s Research Leadership Academy Alumni Outstanding Extension and Outreach Award Honors extension agents and specialists who make an outstanding effort to bring research and technology to the people and businesses of North Carolina and beyond Established in 1978 Honoree receives a $4,000 stipend Outstanding Teacher Award Recognizes six to eight of the faculty being inducted into the NC State Academy of Outstanding Teachers Honoree receives a $1,000 stipend Mathews Medal The highest non-academic distinction awarded to NC State students Established in 2006 Recognizes seniors who have made significant contributions to the university and created a lasting legacy Administered by the Alumni Association Student Ambassador Program Named after Walter J.
