April 2012 The Search display has been updated. When a phrase is entered in the regular or advanced search it will now pull back the first 50 items per page (instead of 10) to reduce page-to-page scrolling time for the user. Course pre-enrollment for Fall 2012 is underway. The 2011-12 catalog includes many courses that were added or updated throughout the academic year, and together with the Fall 2012 Course and Time Roster offers an accurate picture of what will be offered in the Fall of 2012. June 2011 In 2011, Cornell University redesigned the Courses of Study using the Acalog Academic Catalog Management System. The new content management system allows the university to better track and update courses including linking cross-listed courses. With the many enhancements available in the online system, beginning with the 2011-12 edition, the catalog will no longer be printed.
