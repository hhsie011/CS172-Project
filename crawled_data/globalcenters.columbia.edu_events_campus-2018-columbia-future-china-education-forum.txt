7:00 PM Cowin Auditorium, Teachers College, Columbia University About the Forum The 2018 Future China Education Forum will highlight the key question, “What comes first, a question or an opportunity?” The theme arose from the dramatic increase of innovative solutions to traditional problems in education that exists across many borders. The discussion of the issue could shed light on the hidden rationales behind many decisions, and explain the successes and failures found in the cases we selected. Through panel discussions, we aspire to provide opportunities for all participants to share, to learn, to think and to question. The Future China Education Forum was founded in 2017 to provide a platform that allows critical thinkers and problem solvers from China and the United States to discuss education- related issues and ways to potentially solve them. These issues are varied; some are common to many countries across the globe, while others are unique to China. The 2018 Forum is organized by Columbia University's Teachers College and the Chinese Students and Scholars Association at TC (TCCSSA), and is supported by Columbia Global Centers | Beijing.
