This incentive is open to all faculty, staff and full-time students who carpool at least three days a week. Below is an overview of the permit discount structure, which varies depending on how many people are in your carpool. Number of People Permit Discount Three-person carpool 50% off Four or more 75% off All carpool spaces are located in faculty/staff parking garages, so discounted rates are calculated from current faculty/staff garage permit prices. All carpoolers, regardless of classification, will be charged a discounted faculty/staff garage permit rate. Additional information: To participate and receive all carpooling benefits, all members of a carpool must join COAST. If you've already purchased a parking permit and want to carpool instead, you can return your permit for a prorated refund and join a carpool. If you lose a carpool member, notify Parking and Transportation within 48 hours and replace within 10 days. Each member receives a dozen full-day parking vouchers a year, for use should an emergency or scheduling conflict arise. The vouchers are valid for the visitor section of a garage.
