March 15, 2019 12:00 AM - 11:00 PM During the week of March 11-15, a group of graduate students from the Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation (GSAPP) joined by Associate Professor Malo Hutson and recent Urban Planning graduate and new Associate Maria Garces Marques, will embark on an educational journey to Chile. The scope of the trip is to gather relevant information about Chile’s successes and failures experienced while managing disasters and recovery processes, particularly about the 2017 wildfires experienced in the central regions. The students will have the opportunity to meet people and organizations from all sectors involved in recent post-disaster reconstruction processes, such as the National Emergency Office (ONEMI), the NGO Desafio Levantemos Chile and a series of academics working in related fields. The group will spend time in Santiago conducting key stakeholder interviews and then travel to Talca where they will meet representatives from the Housing Ministry (MINVU) in the Maule Region. A series of meetings and a focus group will take place in which professionals involved in the Santa Olga reconstruction process will present their experiences and lessons learned. The trip will finalize with a day trip to Santa Olga where the students will conduct field observations as well as participating in a round table where neighborhood leaders will share their experiences during and after the 2017 wildfires.
