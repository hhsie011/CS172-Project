We document and maintain policies and procedures related to all academic appointments (faculty and non-faculty) and appointment actions, including recruitment, hiring, onboarding, reviews, promotions, leaves, retirements, and the miscellaneous activities in and around those significant milestones. We track and analyze data, we seek to provide valuable professional development opportunities and resources to complement the University’s and our departments’ offerings, and to ensure our academic appointees are as well-positioned for success as they can be. In this work, we are first and foremost committed to the School’s values of equity, diversity, inclusion, and belonging throughout the life cycle of each academic appointment. We provide guidance on fair and unbiased search processes, salary equity, and review processes; receive and address Title IX complaints and other grievances and help to support individuals and teams as they attempt to collaborate, coauthor, and coexist effectively within the School’s physical, intellectual, and financial footprint. 90 Smith Street, 1st Floor / Boston, MA 02120 617-432-1047 / 617-432-4711 (fax) facultyaffairs@hsph.harvard.edu Give us your feedback!
