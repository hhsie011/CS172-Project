History A student initiated the International Mentoring Program in 1999 to offer peer support to incoming international students at Brown. The students in the program also helped create International Orientation. IMP had changed throughout the years as the international student community and applicants grew at Brown. In 2006, international orientation became an extension of orientation with international students arriving several days ahead of the start of general orientation. In 2011, IMP supported approximately 220 new internationals and expanded to a four-day program.
