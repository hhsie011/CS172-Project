Students in applied physics may pursue research in any one of several broad areas, including nanoscience, advanced materials, condensed matter physics; renewable energy; quantum information and photonics; biological physics; astrophysics and plasma physics. The Ph.D. program in the graduate field of Applied Physics (AP) is a flexible, research-oriented doctoral program tailored to individual interests. AP combines a core physics curriculum with research and study usually in one of the areas discussed above. Graduate students can engage in a wide range of cross-disciplinary research activities, bringing their expertise as an applied physicist to bear, often in a collaborative environment. Instead of a qualifying exam, students are expected take classes in a common core of physics subjects, being quantum mechanics, electrodynamics, statistical mechanics, and advanced laboratory techniques. The two-year Master of Science in Applied Physics program offers advanced study and training in the three cores of AP: Quantum Systems and Photonics, Nanotechnologies, and Biotechnologies. This program provides training and research/design project experience sought after by industry, government and R&D organizations. The professional Master of Engineering program in Engineering Physics prepares you for engineering design and development employment or further graduate work. You can broaden and deepen your preparation in AP, or prepare for professional engineering in quantum, photonic and optical technology, nanostructure science and technology, device physics, materials characterization, or computational physics and engineering.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
