Who Can I Recruit? Why Recruit Columbia Talent? Training at the Very Center of Business Student Body at a Glance Entrepreneurial-Minded Employment Reports Contact Us Beyond being high achievers, we train our students to be entrepreneurial minded. That means when they graduate, they leave our campus as leaders, ready to spearhead growth at even the most established organizations. “Columbia’s different from a lot of schools that teach entrepreneurship in that we don’t think about it from the perspective of who’s an entrepreneur and who isn’t,” says Keith Wilcox, assistant professor in the Marketing Division. “We think about how to teach people to think outside the box and how to develop innovative thinkers.” frameborder=&amp;quot;0&amp;quot; allowfullscreen&amp;gt; Sidebar Content Post a Job Log Into COIN Make a Gift Have a Question?
