There is a pressing need for leaders who have an in-depth understanding of the complexity of both medical and management issues. Innovative solutions will come from those professionals with interdisciplinary expertise of a high order—leaders trained in medicine and equipped with the skills of management. As health care evolves, there is a growing need for people with backgrounds both in medicine and management. The MD-MBA program at Dartmouth promotes clinical credibility while promoting managerial and administrative excellence. Two of the country's most distinguished and established educational institutions, Dartmouth's Geisel School of Medicine and Tuck School of Business offer a joint MD-MBA degree in medicine and management to health-care leaders. Both schools are noted for academic rigor, emphasis on teamwork, communication skills, and leadership development. Applicants to the MD-MBA program must be enrolled students in good standing at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth. Students apply to the Tuck School during their second year of medical school. The MD-MBA program admits up to 6 students per year and is typically completed in either five or six years.
