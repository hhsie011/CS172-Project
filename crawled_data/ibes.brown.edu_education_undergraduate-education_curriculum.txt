Studies of Pollution Research Methods 1 course, ENVS 1920 (Methods for Interdisciplinary Environmental Research) This course provides the skills needed to tease out specific questions from complex, multifaceted environmental problems and to develop independent research proposals that can meet these challenges. These skills are critical for success in academics, the non-profit sector, government and industry. Environmental Electives 3 courses These electives provide increased environmental expertise and further enhance a student’s ability to customize a course of study. Acceptable electives include any ENVS courses, classes with significant environmental content, and prerequisites for classes students take to fulfill requirements within their declared track. Capstone Requirement 1 course minimum The capstone is designed to provide an opportunity for students to integrate many aspects of their course of study, while introducing the opportunity to conduct independent or collaborative work oriented towards the discovery of new information and/or solving environmental challenges. This requirement can be met with a two-semester thesis (ENVS 1970 & ENVS 1971), one-semester research project (ENVS 1970 or ENVS 1971), or an approved capstone course. More information on each of these options is available on the Capstone Requirement web page. Policies AP Exams and Course Credit Students can meet listed core or track requirements, as follows: AP exam score of 4 or 5 in both Microeconomics and Macroeconomics in place of ECON 0110 AP exam score of 5 in Environmental Science in place of ENVS 0490 AP exam score of 4 or 5 on Calc AB in place of Math 0090; AP exam score of 4 or 5 on Calc BC in place of Math 0090 & 0100 However, AP exams cannot be used to meet any of the three electives required for the concentration. Independent Study Courses ENVS 1970 (Fall) and 1971 (Spring) are independent study courses designated for academic credit sponsored by IBES Faculty. One or both of these courses are often taken as part of the process of fulfilling the capstone requirement, but they need not be used exclusively for that purpose. Students taking these courses to meet capstone requirements should follow the process described for Capstones. Students not taking these courses to meet the ENVS capstone requirement should complete the following steps: Meet with the faculty sponsor and agree on the project's design and scope Complete the Project Proposal Form Register for the course after receiving an override code from the faculty sponsor It is the joint responsibility of the student-faculty pair to ensure that the student is intellectually involved in an original research project or course of study with expectations appropriate to their level of education and experience. Faculty should agree to be an independent study course sponsor if able to provide adequate mentoring and advising throughout the semester. ENVS 1970 and 1971 are formal courses, so students are expected to work a minimum of 180 hours on the project.
