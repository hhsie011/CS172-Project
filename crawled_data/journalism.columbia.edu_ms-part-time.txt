M.S. Part Time A Flexible Program for Working Professionals The Part‐Time M.S. program celebrated its 25th graduating class in 2018. Launched in 1991 by Dean Joan Konner, the program has graduated nearly 900 journalists, including two women who went on to win Pulitzer Prizes and many other distinguished graduates across media platforms. The program attracts working journalists who want to take their careers to the next level with new skills and career changers who want to learn the fundamentals of journalism and receive guidance as they transition into the industry. The Part-time Program is a more flexible, but no less rigorous, version of the M.S. degree program. Students in this program follow the same curriculum as full‐time students but complete their work over two years instead of 10 months. Jump to: Who Should Apply How the Part-time Program Works Program Schedule Explore Programs Contact Who Should Apply Applicants who can attend class and spend at least six to eight additional hours a week reporting and writing are eligible for the part-time program. Although some classes are offered at night and on weekends, this is not a night program. Applicants must have enough flexibility in their jobs to chase stories wherever the reporting takes them and attend extracurricular events at the Journalism School.
