By scanning different areas of the Lund jet plane, sensitivity to different physics effects can be enhanced, including quark mass effects. In this talk I will discuss the techniques and the measurement by ALICE (Nature 605, 440-446 (2022)) of the first direct signature of the dead cone effect in QCD. I will also discuss the problematics of the Lund plane in heavy ion collisions and prospects. There will be a luncheon with the speaker from 12-1 p.m. in WL-216. Lunch will be provided for people on a first-come, first-served basis for people who RSVP by 10 a.m. on Tuesday, May 31st: https://tinyurl.com/npa-signup Please email the host for the Zoom connection information.
