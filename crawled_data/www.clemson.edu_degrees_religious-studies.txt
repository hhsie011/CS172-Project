Skip to main content Clemson University Degrees Home Degree Programs MENU Religious Studies (B.A.) LEARN MORE ABOUT A recent study by the American Academy of Religion predicts that by 2050 80 percent of the world's population will identify with one of four religions — Christianity, Islam, Buddhism and Hinduism. Do you want to become a global thinker with a deeper understanding of the world's cultural, political and social differences? Clemson's religious studies major provides its students an interdisciplinary grounding in the histories, scriptures, rituals, mythologies, ethics and beliefs of world religious traditions as they have been situated in specific geo-political contexts through the millennia. Our students often double-major in a related field and go on to pursue graduate work and employment in the fields of law, medicine, politics, ministry, nonprofit and service-related industries. FAST FACTS Clemson has traditionally offered a minor in religious studies, but in 2014 began offering a Bachelor of Arts program. The number of students majoring in religious studies at public universities grew by 40 percent between 1996 and 2005. The Pew Research Forum finds that those who identify as highly religious know the least about their religion and about the religions of others. Religious studies is a quintessential interdisciplinary humanities discipline where philosophy, theology, sociology, psychology, ethics, economics, politics, anthropology and cultural studies meet. According to data from the Law School Admissions Council, religion/religious studies majors are among the strongest law school applicants, averaging a 155.95 score on the LSAT. More than 92 percent of philosophy or religious studies graduates were employed in the middle of the recent recession, according to a Georgetown University study. WHAT YOU'LL STUDY As a religious studies student, you'll take required courses in the Abrahamic religious traditions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) and, if interested, have the opportunity to study several other traditions, including Buddhism and Hinduism. In addition to courses in major faith traditions, you'll take a four-year sequence of courses moving from an introductory acquaintance with the world's religious traditions, to immersion in the methods and theories of the academic study of religion, to individualized research with faculty, to a senior capstone seminar. In this interdisciplinary program, our students take courses in Western history and philosophy and can take courses with faculty in other departments who have research interests in religion, including classes such as Religion and American Politics, Sociology of Religion, Ancient Near East, The Reformation, Medieval Conquests and Crusades and The History of the Middle East to 1800. Study Abroad: Beyond classes, you'll have the chance to study abroad as part of two religious studies trips. Encounter the material world of the early Christian church through a summer immersion experience in Turkey and Greece. Or visit archaeological sites, ancient basilicas and museums in Rome and Italy as part of our second faculty-led study abroad summer trip.
