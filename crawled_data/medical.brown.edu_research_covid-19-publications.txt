UPDATED UNIVERSITY POLICIES: NOVEL CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) Faculty experts in the media COVID-19: Publications Summaries of the latest pediatric literature and guidelines regarding COVID-19. The following summaries have been produced by medical students at The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University and reviewed by pediatric infectious disease specialists at Hasbro Children's Hospital. Pediatric Literature March 26, 2020 Can SARS-CoV-2 Infection Be Acquired In Utero? David Kimberlin, Sergio Stagno Editorial response to two articles in JAMA from separate research teams in China that present data on 3 neonates who may have been infected with COVID-19 in utero based on elevated IgM in blood drawn from neonates following birth Possible Vertical Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 From an Infected Mother to Her Newborn Lan Dong, Jinhua Tian, Songming He Case study of mother with COVID-19 and infant delivered on 2/22/20 in Wuhan, China 29 year-old 34 weeks 2 days of gestation diagnosed with COVID-19 by positive RT-PCR and ground-glass opacities in periphery of both lungs on 1/28/20 Infant was delivered by cesarean in negative-pressure room; mother wore N95 mask and did not hold the infant; neonate was immediately quarantined in NICU Infant had elevated IgG, IgM, IL-6, IL-10 , WBC at 2 hours of age with normal chest CT and 5 negative RT-PCR tests from 2 hours to 16 days of age Antibodies in Infants Born to Mothers With COVID-19 Pneumonia Hui Zeng, Chen Xu, Junli Fan Case study of 6 pregnant women with COVID-19 from 2/16/20-3/6/20 in Wuhan Pregnant women diagnosed by symptoms, chest CT, and positive RT-PCR All had cesarean deliveries in negative pressure isolation rooms; all mothers wore masks, and all medical staff wore protective suits and double masks; infants were isolated from mothers immediately after delivery All infants had negative RT-PCR results, 5 had elevated IgG concentrations, 2 had elevated IgM Authors conclude that data is not conclusive and does not prove in utero transmission IgM assays are prone to false-positive and false-negative results, cross-reactivity, and testing challenges IgM assays are less reliable than molecular diagnostic tests based on nucleic acid amplification and detection Authors suggest more definitive evidence is needed before findings can be used to counsel pregnant women #editorial #pregnancy #verticaltransmission March 25, 2020 Clinical and epidemiological features of 36 children with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Zhejiang, China: an observational cohort study Haiyan Qiu, Junhua Wu, Liang Hong, Yunling Luo, Qifa Sng, Dong Chen Retrospective cohort study of 36 children infected with COVID-19 in three hospitals in Zhejiang, China from Jan 17 to March 1, 2020 Symptoms: pneumonia with ground-glass opacities (19; 53%), fever (13; 36%), dry cough (7; 19%), asymptomatic (10; 28%) Labs: elevated creatine kinase MB (11; 31%), decreased lymphocytes (11; 31%), leucopenia (7; 19%), elevated procalcitonin (6; 17%) Management: all received interferon alfa by aerosolization 2x/day, 14 (39%) received lopinavir-ritonavir syrup 2x/day, 6 (17%) needed oxygen inhalation Mean time in hospital was 14 days (SD 3 days) and all patients had full recovery In the commentary to this article (COVID-19 in children: the link in the transmission chain, Alyson Kelvin, Scott Halperin) Authors point out that there is clear evidence that are susceptible to COVID-19 but often do not have notable disease Raises possibility of that children could be facilitators of transmission #retrospectivecohort #treatment March 24, 2020 Clinical Characteristics of Children with Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Hubei, China. Fang Zheng, Chun Liao, Qi-hong Fan et al. 25 hospitalized pediatric COVID-19 cases in Hubei province (Wuhan-centric) Demographics - 14 male/11 female.

Silva, Kent E. Pinkerton, Kunling Shen, Han Xiao, Shunqing Xu, Gary W. K. Wong Analysis of evaluated children infected with COVID-19 and treated at Wuhan Children’s Hospital (n=1391), 171 (12.3%) tested positive for infection Median age: 6.7 years, Male: 60.8% Symptoms: Fever in 41.5%, Cough in 48.5%, PNA in 64.9%, pharyngeal erythema in 46.2% 3 patients with comorbidities required ICU level of care, 1 death Most children appear mildly asymptomatic March 16, 2020 Epidemiological Characteristics of 2143 Pediatric Patients With 2019 Coronavirus Disease in China. Yuanyuan Dong, Xi Mo, Yabin Hu, Xin Qi, Fang Jiang, Zhongyi Jiang, Shilu Tong Children at all ages were susceptible to COVID-19, but no significant gender difference was found Clinical manifestations of pediatric patients were generally less severe than those of adults’ patients For the severity of patients (including both confirmed and suspected cases), 94 (4.4 %), 1091 (50.9 %) and 831 (38.8 %) patients were diagnosed as asymptomatic, mild or moderate cases, respectively, totally accounted for 94.1 % of all cases. Young children, particularly infants, were vulnerable to 2019-nCoV infection: the proportion of severe and critical cases was 10.6 %, 7.3%, 4.2%, 4.1% and 3.0% for the age group of <1, 1-5, 6-10, 11-15 and ≥16 years, respectively. As of 8 February 2020, of the 2143 pediatric patients included in this study, only one child died #retrospectiveanalysis In the commentary to this article (March 16, 2020, COVID-19 in Children: Initial Characterization of the Pediatric Disease, Andrea T. Cruz, MD, MPH1 and Steven L. Zeichner, MD, PhD2): Cruz and Zeichner point out that subpopulations of children are at increased risk for severe illness including younger age, existing lung pathology, and immunocompromised status Attributable risk for severe disease from COVID-19 in children is challenging to discern due to lacking data on co-infection Children may play a large role in community transmission: concerns include different symptoms than adults, asymptomatic patients, & fecal viral shedding No reports yet of vertical transmission #commentary #summarypaper March 7, 2020 Clinical characteristics and intrauterine vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection in nine pregnant women:a retrospective review of medical records Huijun Chen, Juanjuan Guo, Chen Wang, Fan Luo, Xuechen Yu, Wei Zhang, Jiafu Li, Dongchi Zhao, Dan Xu, Qing Gong, Jing Liao, Huixia Yang,Wei Hou, Yuanzhen Zhang No vertical transmission for mothers with virus Retrospective review of 9 patients with 3rd trimester C sections with +COVID #pregnancy March 5, 2020 Clinical and CT features in pediatric patients with COVID‐19 infection: Different points from adults Wei Xia MD Jianbo Shao MD Yu Guo MD Xuehua Peng MD Zhen Li MD Daoyu Hu MD Unlike adults, pediatric CT’s have consolidation with surrounding halo signs as well as elevated prolactin rates CT consolidation Early stage: consolidation with surrounding halo signs, ground-glass opacity Advanced stage: increased density Critical stage: white lung Recovery stage: absorbed, ground-glass, or residual fiber strip Retrospective study on non-contrast CT scans on 20 pediatric patients with +COVID nucleic acid test and 8/20 coinfected with another virus from 1/23/20-2/28/20 #radiology March 2, 2020 Clinical analysis of 31 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus infection in children from six provinces (autonomous region) of northern China Wang Duan, Ju Xiuli, Xie Feng, et al. Note: Article is in Mandarin Chinese. Abstract available in English. Retrospective study of 31 pediatric COVID-19 cases dx’d 1/25-2/21/20 Demographics: Mean age 7 yr, 1 mo; range 6 mo-17 yo. Epidemiology: 29% imported from other parts of country; 68% with confirmed adult COVID-19 contacts; 3% (1 case) with asymptomatic Wuhan returnees contact 90% family cluster cases Clinical severity: 13% asymptomatic; 42% mild; 45% moderate; no severe/critical Symptomatology Most common = fever (65% or 20 cases) - 1 high, 9 moderate, 10 low Duration of fever: 1-9 days; 15 cases ≤ 3 d., 5 > 3 d. Other common = cough (45% or 14 cases), fatigue (10% or 3), diarrhea (10% or 3) Lab trends Rare leukopenia (2/31), lymphopenia (“), thrombocytosis (“) Relatively more common elevated CRP (3/30 tested), ESR (4/21), procalcitonin (1/28), LFTs (6/27), muscle enzymes (4/27) Imaging - 14 with chest CT changes (9 patchy ground-glass opacities and nodules, predominantly BL lower lung lobe near pleura) Prognosis - 24/31 (77%) recovered and discharged; no deaths Time for viral nucleic acid to return negative = 7-23 days (25/31 cases) #retrospectivestudy February 22, 2020 Clinical strategies for treating pediatric cancer during the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus infection Chao Yang, Changchun Li, Shan Wang Letter to the editor from Chinese pediatric oncologists on treatment recommendations for balancing anticancer therapy and infection prevention based on data from adult cases Preadmission - Screen for COVID-19 in all patients, their family, and caregivers. T > 37.3 C should be screened in a fever clinic. If clinical suspicion, also obtain chest CT &/or nucleic acid testing with isolation precautions and supportive care. Strict infection control strategies to prevent hospital-acquired infection Chemotherapy - Stable disease = consider moderate chemo reduction or prolonged cycle interval. Normal physical status = individual risk/benefit decision. Conduct chemo at local hospital to minimize mov’t. Radiotherapy - Can continue RT as before for existing RT patients. Consider moderately delaying subsequent chemo and RT initiation for new patients. Surgery - Suspected/confirmed COVID-19 case - preop in isolation ward, special transport channels, disinfect OR after op. Can delay f/u if no urgent need. #lettertotheeditor #treatment #cancer February 14, 2020 Novel Coronavirus Infection in Hospitalized Infants Under 1 Year of Age in China Min Wei, Jingping Yuan, Yu Liu et al. 9 infected infants, 7 female/2 male, ages 1-11 mo. Symptoms - 4 fever, 2 mild upper respiratory sx, 1 no sx, 2 no info No ICU/mechanical ventilation/severe complications Epidemiology - all 9 had ≥ 1 infected family member (family cluster cases) #retrospectivestudy #infant February 5, 2020 Diagnosis and treatment recommendations for pediatric respiratory infection caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus Zhi-Min Chen, Jun-Fen Fu, Qiang Shu, et al Diagnosis - incubation 2-14 d. (average 3-7) Common symptoms - fever, fatigue, dry cough; also nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sputum production, diarrhea, headache. Can have no fever. Severe, progressive symptoms - dyspnea, cyanosis; systemic signs (malaise, restlessness, poor feeding/appetite, decreased activity) Severe complications - respiratory failure, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, bleeding/coagulotory dysfunction Suspicion should be raised by: Travel/residence in areas with persistent local transmission w/n 14 d of sx onset Hx of contact with patients w/fever or respiratory sx w/travel/residence in areas with persistent local transmission w/n 14 d of sx onset Hx of contact w/suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases w/n 14 d of sx onset Related to cluster outbreak Newborns of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 mothers (?) DDx - other viral respiratory infection, bacterial PNA, mycoplasma PNA Clinical classification Mild - asymptomatic, URI, mild PNA. Fever, cough, sore throat, fatigue, myalgias, headache. May have PNA signs on chest imaging. Severe - any of the following: (1) RR ≥ 70/min (≤ 1 yo) or ≥ 50/min (> 1 yo), (2) SpO2 ≤ 93% (< 90% if premature infant) or signs of respiratory distress (ex: nasal flaring, suprasternal/intercostal/subcostal retractions, grunting, etc.), (3) PaO2 < 60 mmHg, PaCO2 > 50 mmHg, (4) change in consciousness (ex: restlessness, lethargy, coma), (5) poor feeding/appetite/dehydration, (6) signs of end-organ damage (coagulatory abnormalities, heart damage, GI dysfunction, abnormal LFTs, rhabdomyolysis) Critical - (1) respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, (2) septic shock, (3) other organ failure requiring ICU level of care Prognosis - usually family cluster cases with good prognosis, mild sx, recovery 1-2 wks. after onset Lab trends - nl/low WBCs (lymphopenia), nl/increased CRP, nl procalcitonin Occasional elevated LFTs, CK, myoglobin, D-dimer esp severe cases Testing - nucleic acid test via RT-PCR or viral gene sequencing from throat swab, sputum, stool, blood sample Not widely available at publication: viral culture, viral Ag, viral Ab testing Imaging CXR - early - multiple small patchy shadows, interstitial changes, esp in periphery. Severe - BL ground-glass opacities, infiltrating shadows, pulmonary consolidation, rare pleural effusion Chest CT - BL ground-glass opacity, segmental consolidation esp in periphery. Management 4 principles - (1) early identification, (2) early isolation, (3) early diagnosis, (4) early treatment General treatment - bed rest, supportive, adequate calorie/water intake, maintain electrolyte balance, “strengthening psychotherapy” (?) Antivirals - nothing effective/evidence-based for children. Consider the following (off-label, no proven efficacy or safety): IFN-a2b neb 100,000-200,000 IU/kg (mild) and 200,000-400,000 IU/kg for severe BID x5-7 days Lopinavir/litonavir (7-15 kg) 12/3 mg/kg, (15-40 kg) 10/2.5/kg, (> 40 kg) 400/100 mg BID x1-2 wks Mild cases - avoid broad-spectrum abx and steroids Severe/critical cases - options include abx, steroids, IVIG, bronchoalveolar lavage, mechanical ventilation, blood purification, ECMO based on clinical judgment Discharge criteria - nl body temp ≥ 3 days, sig. Improved respiratory sx, ≥ 2 consecutive negative COVID-19 nucleic acid test.
