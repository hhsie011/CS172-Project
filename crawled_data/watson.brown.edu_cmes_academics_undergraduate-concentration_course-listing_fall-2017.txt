Course flyer MES 1300 Intellectual Change: From Ottoman Modernization to the Turkish Republic T 4:00-6:30 p.m. Professor Meltem Toksoz A critical survey of Ottoman intellectual history in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Modernization, formation of the modern state and issues of nationalism and other ideologies of the time will form the main framework, analyzing their political, social and cultural impact on intellectual and academic production in the Ottoman Empire and through the making of Republican Turkey. It is a history of mentalities organized around four thematic/chronological modules, each representing a set of concepts, ideas, movements as well as facts and problems, which will be compared to the larger world of modern state formation both in thought and practice. DPLL, WRIT Course flyer MES 1985 Understanding Modern Iran M 3:00-5:30 p.m. Professor Amir Moosavi This interdisciplinary course looks at the history of modern Iran through an examination of translated primary historical documents, secondary studies and various forms of cultural production. The course will begin with a broad historical overview and look at some attempts to give historical narrative to Iran in the modern era. We will then go back to the latter half of the Qajar dynasty (approximately 1850) and move forward until we arrive at the present day. Throughout the course, students will study topics such as modernist reform in the late-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, questions of Iranian identity, various attempts at political reform, the women’s movement and the country’s relationships with its neighbors and the West. The course will emphasize the debates and challenges that have occupied Iranian intellectuals and artists, broadly conceived, and will encourage students to think about how cultural representations of major historical events and socio-political changes contribute to and challenge historical narratives, as well as how contemporary history and politics affects cultural representation.
