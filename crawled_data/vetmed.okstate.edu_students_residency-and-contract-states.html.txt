The class is comprised of 58 Oklahoma residents and 48 non-residents. Applicants who are not Oklahoma residents when applications are submitted, but who expect to satisfy residency requirements prior to matriculation, may apply as Oklahoma residents. However, admission of such students will be provisional, pending certification of their Oklahoma residency status by the OSU Registrar's Office. In the event that an applicant who is provisionally admitted fails to provide certification of Oklahoma residency by the first day of August prior to the start of classes, the applicant will be denied admission and the deposit fee will be forfeited. It is the responsibility of the applicant to notify the Student Services Office if a change in residency is anticipated. Contract States The Oklahoma State University College of Veterinary Medicine has educational contracts for one seat each with Arkansas and Delaware to allow for substantial tuition-fee waivers if you are the top competing applicant from those states. These states provide access to veterinary medical education for their residents since neither state has a veterinary school. For specifics and necessary paperwork verifying your eligibility and residency for this state contracts, visit: the Arkansas Department of Higher Education website or the State of Delaware Department of Education website Oklahoma State University CAMPUSES CAMPUSES Stillwater Tulsa Center for Health Sciences Oklahoma City Institute of Technology Division of Agriculture Veterinary Medicine UNIVERSITY LINKS UNIVERSITY LINKS Campus Safety Diversity Research Extension & Engagement Alumni & Friends OSU Athletics America's Healthiest Campus ® News & Information RESOURCES RESOURCES Ethics Point EEO Statement Accessibility Trademarks Terms of Service Privacy Notice Webmaster CAMPUS MAP © - Oklahoma State University | All Rights Reserved ©
