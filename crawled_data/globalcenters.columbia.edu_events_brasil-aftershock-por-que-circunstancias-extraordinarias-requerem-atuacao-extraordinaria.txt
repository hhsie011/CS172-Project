12:00 PM Online Event "O governo precisa gastar dinheiro de qualquer maneira para atravessar a crise gerada como consequência da pandemia.” - José Scheinkman Governo deve dar apoio a três pilares: saúde, informais e pequenas e médias empresas. É assim que José Scheinkman, professor brasileiro de economia da Columbia University e professor emérito da Princeton University defende o crédito para micro, pequenas e médias empresas, que segundo ele precisam ter o máximo de agilidade, o mínimo de burocracia e custo compatível com um ambiente de parada súbita das atividades. Na próxima quarta-feira (24), em uma conversa em parceria com a Enap vamos debater sobre o papel do Estado brasileiro na superação da crise econômica e sanitária e como os diversos setores da economia podem reagir. Scheinkman irá falar também sobre como melhorar políticas públicas para a população neste momento e irá trazer a experiência de outros países diante da crise.
