The school provides an emotionally supportive and intellectually challenging learning environment that rewards both creativity and socially responsible behavior. We believe a person learns best in a supportive, but kindly firm, atmosphere where they are actively involved and have some control over what occurs. We know that each student is an individual, and therefore, we do not expect uniform educational results. Our low pupil-teacher ratio allows us to provide a great deal of individual attention to each of our students. Director Debra Price 2021-22 Enrollment Current enrollment totals 190 students*.
