Gaudet, Jr. Memorial Prize Share Bruno Tollon Prize In French Studies This award was created to honor Bruno Tollon who was the faculty coordinator and art history professor for Dartmouth’s off-campus program in Toulouse from its inception in 1973 until his retirement in 2010. Bruno Tollon A highly accomplished scholar of Renaissance art, Professor Tollon introduced thousands of Dartmouth students to France’s architectural and artistic wonders. He is especially known for the memorable excursions throughout France that he developed for the program, during which students hiked up to visit medieval fortresses in Périgord, visited Cézanne’s atelier in Arles, or explore hidden recesses of Paris’s art world. Professor Tollon's commitment to teaching, scholarship, and a deepening of Franco-American relations through the study of French language, history, art, and architecture has been exemplary and inspiring for generations of Dartmouth students. This award honors a graduating senior French major or minor who has exhibited exceptional talent in and passion for interdisciplinary studies in French.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of French and Italian Undergraduate Overview Placement Information & Exams Transfer Credit Areas of Study & Course Descriptions French Language Courses French Upper Level Courses French and Italian in Translation Italian Language Courses Italian Upper Level Courses Course Schedules 2023-2024 French Courses 2022-2023 French Courses 2021-2022 French Courses 2022-2023 Italian Courses 2021-2022 Italian Courses Majors French Italian Romance Languages French Studies Italian Studies French or Italian as a Modifier Minors Honors Thesis Program The Thesis French Timeline Italian Timeline Endowed Research Grant Study Abroad Overview French LSA/LSA+ Toulouse FSP Paris Italian Full Immersion Rome Experience (FIRE) Italian LSA/LSA+ Rome Opportunities Overview Apprentice Teacher Info Co-Curricular Opportunities Affinity Housing/Global Village French Language Program Italian Language Program Job Opportunities Director's Assistant Positions in Rome Student Awards and Prizes Arianna Pagani ’93 Memorial Prize In French And Italian Bruno Tollon Prize In French Studies Cloise Appleton Crane Prize In French And Italian François Denoeu Memorial Prize French Consulate Prize George E.
