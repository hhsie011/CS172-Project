Imagined as an extension of the design studio, the Making Studio is a resource open to all Columbia GSAPP students, providing material, technical, and design support for all modeling, building, and making endeavors at the school. Staffed primarily by students, the shops are a space for both productive hustle and experimentation, and are meant to be open and welcoming to all design students, regardless of prior fabrication or shop experience. Columbia GSAPP students have access to the workshops after the completion several safety/orientation steps; see the “shop access” tab for details. Please contact Josh Jordan with any questions or comments.

Sep 15, 2017 GSAPP Faculty and Alumni participate in the 2017 Chicago Architecture Biennial Opening on 16 September, the 2017 Chicago Architecture Biennial, Make New History, features contributions by many Columbia GSAPP faculty and alumni as well as events organized by the school in collaboration with the Biennial Artistic Directors Sharon Johnston and Mark Lee. Oct 4, 2016 Columbia GSAPP faculty, alumni, and students at the 3rd Istanbul Design Biennial Never Built New York Launched in Summer 2017 and opened at the Queens Museum in New York City that same September, Never Built New York is a collaborative exhibition curated by authors Sam Lubell and Greg Goldin and produced in part by the GSAPP Fabrication Lab. Students working with the Fab Lab explored a trove of archival drawings and models of designed-but-never-built projects in the history of NYC, an unrealized but fascinating series of architectural dreams. The project was threefold: 1) forensic reconstruction of digital models from historic drawings, often sketches with minimal information, 2) fabrication of 1:1200 scale models of over 200 buildings and architectural components, 3) installation and activation of the models in the New York City Panorama, a scale model of the entire five boroughs of New York at the Queens Museum. The Fab Lab’s contributions were featured in the New York Times, Wall St. Journal, and other publications. Students were given the wonderful privilege of walking on the Panorama model, fulfilling many urban planning dreams. Chicago Biennial “(Not) Another Tower” Exquisite Model Corpse The Making at GSAPP crew and collaborators are no strangers to frantic, super-dense urban conditions. We have no choice but to collaborate with our colleagues on whom we are, often literally, vertically stacked. Our entries for “(Not) Another Tower” pay tribute to these delirious delights of New York City: where extremely diverse scenes and programs are allowed to coexist shoulder-to-shoulder, where epic monuments and industries become background scenery for the normal everyday hustle, where bleeding-edge innovation is so saturated as to be taken for granted. In Summer of 2017, Tatiana Bilbao Estudio (TBS) invited dozens of GSAPP students to collaborate on this headlining installation at the Chicago Architecture Biennial. With the coordination and direction of the Fabrication Lab, students submitted models to fill almost 40 slots in the composite tower. Our team packed everything in a U-Haul and drove to Chicago to assist with the assembly of the tower.
