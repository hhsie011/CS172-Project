Graduates can easily be identified from all other veterinarians by the type of degree that follow their name. Penn awards its graduates the degree of Veterinariae Medicinae Doctoris (VMD). Penn Vet also considers the hundreds of clinicians who have trained as residents, interns, post-doctorates and fellows alongside VMDs as alumni. Today the School's alumni are working across the nation and around the world to better the health and welfare of animals and humans. Get in Touch!
