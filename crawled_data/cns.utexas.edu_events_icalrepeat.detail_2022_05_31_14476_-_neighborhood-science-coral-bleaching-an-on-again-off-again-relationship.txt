Carly Scott – “Coral Bleaching: An On-Again-Off-Again Relationship” You’ve probably seen photos of completely white – or bleached – coral reefs. This bleaching happens as sea temperatures rise and can be deadly for corals. However, coral bleaching is really the “break-up” between the coral animal and tiny algae partners that live within their cells. Who are these partners? What causes this relationship breakdown? Why are some corals more resistant to warming seas than others? Through this talk, we’ll explore the relationship between corals and their algae and how scientists assess which reefs are most at risk.
