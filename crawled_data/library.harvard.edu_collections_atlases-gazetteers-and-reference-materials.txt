Ortelius, Abraham. Theatrum orbis terrarum Abrahami Orteli Antverp: The theatre of the whole world. 1606. Harvard Map Collection The Map Collection holds more than 6,000 atlases, including current world, national, state, and urban atlases. The historical atlas collection includes several early works, including those of Mercator, Abraham Ortelius (the 1606 English edition is available online), and Ptolemy. Our earliest original atlas is from 1511 and is viewable online. The collection also contains many facsimiles of older works. The collection also maintains a large, non-circulating reference collection on map history and GIS as well as historical gazetteers.
