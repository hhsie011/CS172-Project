There are few locations on the planet that compare with the energy, entrepreneurial spirit, and opportunities per square mile New York City has. The New York metro area also has Syracuse University’s largest alumni base in the world, making it alive with Orange spirit and rich with a huge roster of events and experiences... both online and in-person. It’s no wonder that Syracuse University’s close and dynamic relationship with the city is unlike any other. What is it that has ingrained Syracuse University into the fabric of NYC? The vast network of Syracuse University alumni. More than 53,000 NYC alumni open doors for Syracuse University grads in the worlds of entertainment, the arts, finance, information technology, media, journalism, and more. The largest home base of Syracuse University students. Perennially the metro New York area boasts the largest number of undergraduates at Syracuse University. Immersive learning experiences. From semester-long programs, like the drama department’s Tepper Semester, Newhouse in NYC, and Syracuse Architecture NYC, to week-long trips to the city’s media empires and internships with prestigious companies, Syracuse University students get an intense, unvarnished look at what it takes to succeed in their chosen fields. A true “community of experts.” Syracuse University students benefit from the knowledge and expertise of alumni and friends who are leaders in their fields and in the NYC community, while collaborations with NYC-based firms provide unequaled opportunities for students to learn in real-world settings.
