They have not only the talent and intelligence to get into college, but also the courage to go somewhere and achieve a milestone for their family. FIRST provides a home away from home for first-generation students and gives them opportunities to interact with first-generation staff, mentors and faculty who will guide them toward reaching their full potential.” Barbara Speziale, Ph.D., Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies Home Mentors Summer Preview Programs, Services and Research Giving Contact Us Related Links Academic Calendar Academics at Clemson Academic Success Center Degrees Home Admissions Campus Life Academics Visit Outreach Research About Apply To Clemson Undergraduate Graduate Professional Online Education Employment Opportunities Policy/Terms of Use Text Version Web Accessibility Ethics/Safety Hotline Privacy Policy Site Information Copyright © 2022 Clemson University Clemson, South Carolina 29634 864-656-3311 Contact Clemson Stories for the Clemson Family Clemson University on Facebook Clemson University on Twitter Clemson University on LinkedIn Clemson University on Flickr Clemson University on Instagram
