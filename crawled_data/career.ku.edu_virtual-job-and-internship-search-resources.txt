Unfortunately, job scams are common for virtual opportunities posted on job boards. See tips on how to avoid scams in How to Assess Fraudulent Opportunities section below. How to Assess Fraudulent Opportunities Click to expand According to a CNBC article on Landing a Remote Job, for every one legitimate work-from-home job, there are approximately 60 to 70 work-from-home job scams, in other words, less than 3% of all work-from-home job listings are for legitimate jobs. Tips to Avoid Job Scam Be wary of chat-only platforms (e.g. Facebook Messenger, Yahoo Messenger) Know the red flags: unusually high pay grammatical and spelling errors in a job description a misspelled company name a vague job description with low requirements - everyone qualifies the job requires upfront expenses from you the potential employer wants you to deposit a check into your bank account you are asked for personal or financial information (e.g. social security number, birth date, home address, credit card or bank account information) early in the interview process or as part of your application you are offered a job without an interview, or reference checks the company doesn't have online presence the recruiter's contact information is not professional / the company email address is modified, or no contact information is provided Confirm contact information - scammers often use a personal email address (e.g. Gmail or Yahoo) or a modified email address with an added letter or swapped letters within an email - which is often hard to notice - always copy the last part of the email address after "@" to see if there is a corresponding website, and check the website to see if the site itself is legitimate (notice spelling and grammatical errors, design, phone number, and address) Google the company name, and call the company to verify the recruiter exists Watch out for common scams, which include secret shopping, general office, product testing, reshipping, or rebate processing Do not share personal or financial information via email or chat Search the Better Business Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission websites to verify company information, and search the company name on a search engine with the word “scam" Report scams immediately - if you’ve been targeted by a job scam, file a complaint with the FTC Virtual Job Search Assistance Click to expand Resume Dropbox – quick feedback on your resume by UCC staff by email Impress Online Mock Interview Tool – a job interview simulation tool that allows students to practice interview questions and receive feedback from UCC career coaches Online Appointments – schedule a virtual appointment with a career coach to discuss your internship or job search Campus Career and Networking Resources Click to expand UCC Career Events – upcoming career events for KU students and graduates – all career events are virtual for Spring 2021 KU Career Communities – events, workshops and info sessions, resume samples and job postings for specific interests and skills Beyond KU – employer panels to help take your passion and make it your purpose, no matter your major – all BeyondKU events are virtual for Spring 2021 Mentoring KU – connect with KU alumni and professionals to discuss specific career and/or industry topics;
