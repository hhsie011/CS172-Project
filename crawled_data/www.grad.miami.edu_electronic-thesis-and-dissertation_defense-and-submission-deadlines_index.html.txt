All students must notify the Graduate School of the defense date by filling out the Defense Notice Form and submitting it to the Graduate School before the day of defense. Defenses can be in-person only, virtual only, or hybrid (in-person and virtual). The Defense Notice Form should clearly specify whether the defense will be in-person, virtual, or hybrid (in-person and virtual). Students defending after the above noted last date to defend are not eligible to graduate in that semester. Exceptions for a late defense will be considered by the Graduate School only by formal appeal and only if the formal request is made before the deadline to defend date. Formal requests should include reasons for the late defense date and the specific date the later defense will be held. Formal requests should be sent to grad.dissertation@miami.edu and the student's main advisor and Graduate Program Director must be cc'd on the message. NOTE: Even if a late defense date request is approved by the Graduate School for a given semester, the graduation date will move to the next semester if any of the remaining ETD deadlines for that semester, i.e., deadline to submit the full draft for formatting review; deadline to produce the final PDF; and deadline for ETD completion are missed. 2 Deadline to Submit Full Draft for Formatting Review: By the date noted in the above table, the student must submit to the Sr. Editor of the Graduate School for review the full draft of a thesis, dissertation, doctoral essay, or lecture recital essay draft consisting of (1) unnumbered front matter; (2) lower-case Roman numeral page number front matter; and (3) chapters, references, appendices, etc., formatted per Graduate School formatting guidelines. The main content of the full draft due on this day should be close to final. Students may continue to make minor revisions to the draft after this date, but no new data or sections should be added at this stage. The graduation date for students who do not submit a full draft to the Graduate School for review by the date noted above will move to the next semester. 3 Deadline for Producing Final PDF & 3 Required ETD Forms: The formatting review must be completed; final PDF produced; and the three required ETD forms, i.e., the Certificate of Defense Approval Form, the ETD Final Content Approval Form and the ETD Availability Agreement Form, must be submitted to the Graduate School by the date noted in the above table. The Graduate School must receive all three required forms fully signed for the student to receive permission from the Sr. Editor to upload the final ETD in the Scholarship@Miami ETD repository. The graduation date moves to the next semester for students who do not complete the formatting review with the Sr. Editor; produce the final PDF; and submit the Certificate of Defense Approval Form, ETD Final Content Approval Form, and the ETD Availability Agreement Form to the Graduate School by the date noted above--no exceptions. 4 Deadline for Completion: By the date noted in the above table, students expecting graduation in a particular semester must have uploaded the final PDF in the Scholarship@Miami ETD repository; confirmed that the required Certificate of Defense Approval Form, ETD Final Content Approval Form, and ETD Availability Agreement Form are submitted to the Graduate School; and completed online items, if required. The graduation date moves to the next semester for students who have not uploaded the final PDF in the Scholarship@Miami ETD repository; confirmed submission of the three required ETD forms to the Graduate School; or completed online items, if required, by the date noted in the above table--no exceptions. The above deadlines are set to help students with planning ahead, however, students can begin the final formatting review process with the Sr. Editor any time before the posted deadline dates. Inquiries should be sent to grad.dissertation@miami.edu .
