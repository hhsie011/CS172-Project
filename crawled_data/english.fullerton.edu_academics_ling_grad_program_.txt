It seeks to answer questions such as: What is the structure of human language? How much can languages vary from another? How can children acquire language so easily when language learning is so difficult for adults? How and why do languages change over time? Linguists are also concerned with the social and cultural aspects of language, investigating issues such as in what way our social identities are encoded in our languages and how social and economic power relations are encoded and reproduced in language. Finally, linguistics plays a role in developing human/computer interface systems that tech companies employ in natural language processing, including text to speech processing and natural language understanding.
