This page summarizes access for the complete standard sets the NC State University Libraries buys or has free access to. The NC State University Libraries buys online access to current and active standards from ASME and UL through the IHS Engineering Workbench database. (IHS users are required to access the IHS platform through a registered account. To register, you must provide your name and email address, as well as a password of your choosing. Your email address will serve as your username. If you need assistance with registering, contact IHS Customer Care at https://www.ihs.com/CustomerCare). Withdrawn or inactive standards and standards from other organizations will not be available online via IHS Engineering Workbench (you will see purchase prices for them). They can be ordered individually, at no cost to the patron, via the Standards form in Tripsaver (this service available only to current NC State faculty, staff, students, and university affiliates).
