We value the perspective gained through military experience and the benefits for our campus community when veterans become students. A medium-sized university with undergraduates studying academic disciplines within the Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences, Carroll School of Management, Lynch School of Education and Human Development, and Connell School of Nursing as well as the Woods College of Advancing Studies, Boston College undergraduates take advantage of our campus's close proximity to the educational, social, research and professional opportunities found in Boston. As a Jesuit, Catholic University, Boston College educates students to become Men and Women for Others. Saint Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Jesuits, was a soldier before his spiritual conversion led him to the priesthood. Commitment to community, servant leadership and ethical decision-making remain core tenets of Jesuit education. Many Boston College alumni are veterans. They represent a network of support for servicemen and servicewomen transitioning to college and beyond. Thank you for your service and sacrifice for us.

This partnership reflects BC's commitment to increasing the number of student veterans enrolled in undergraduate programs at the University. Service to School's (S2S) mission is to prepare transitioning servicemembers and veterans for their next chapter of leadership by helping them gain admission to the best college or graduate school possible. BC undergraduate Enmanuel Cabrera '23 was recently featured on the S2S website. Are you looking to participate in the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) while in college? Boston College has long offered ROTC opportunities in multiple branches of the armed forces. The Air Force ROTC program is offered at Boston University, but enrolls students from 10 Boston area schools, including Boston College. Army ROTC at Boston College is part of the Liberty Battalion based out of Northeastern University, but most training and coursework for BC students takes place on Boston College's campus. Navy ROTC at Boston College is part of the Boston Consortium based out of Boston University. Feel free to explore the links provided. Contact information can be found on each branch's page. Please visit the Boston College Veterans page to learn more about the many ways in which BC welcomes and supports those who have served and continued to serve our country. There you will learn more about the Boston College Veterans' Advisory Group, Student Veterans Association, Veterans Alumni Network, and Faculty/Staff Affinity Group. This serves as a great resource for those interested in understanding the possibilities for veterans at Boston College. Members throughout the entire BC community are valued partners to these important organizations. Boston College acts as a liaison with the US Department of Veterans Affairs for students who may qualify to receive veterans' education benefits. In addition, Boston College is proud to participate in the Post-9/11 GI Bill Yellow Ribbon Program, signifying BC's commitment to providing educational assistance to veterans who have served our country.
