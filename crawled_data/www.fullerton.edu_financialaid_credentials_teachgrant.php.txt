The Grant is available for select programs and requires you to agree to fulfill certain teaching obligations – or risk having the grant converted to an unsubsidized loan. To be considered for the TEACH Grant, you must have filed a FAFSA, and be fully admitted in an eligible program. TEACH Grant Initial and Subsequent Counseling TEACH Grant Initial, and Subsequent Counseling acquaints the student with the TEACH Grant Program and the TEACH Grant service obligation. Agreement to Serve (ATS) Each award year, a TEACH Grant recipient must sign an Agreement to Serve (ATS) that explains that the recipient must teach full time for a total of four years within eight years of completing (or ceasing) enrollment in a TEACH Grant eligible program as a full-time highly qualified teacher in a low-income elementary or secondary school or educational service agency in a high-need field. The grant will convert to an unsubsidized loan in the future if contracted teaching obligations are not met. If this happens, interest accrual will be effective as of the date of the first TEACH disbursement. The TEACH grant is not included in financial aid offers but can be offered retroactively to eligible students during the award year. Specific eligible education programs have been determined in conjunction with the College of Education. Check with the College of Education on whether your credential program meets the criteria for the TEACH Grant. How to Apply for the TEACH Grant Once you have completed the FAFSA, follow these steps to apply for the TEACH Grant: 1. Complete the CSUF TEACH Grant Application 2. Complete the Online TEACH Grant Counseling 3. Complete the Agreement to Serve (ATS) Once these steps have been completed, the Financial Aid Office will review your eligibility and process your request. Funds from the TEACH Grant are not released until after Census, once your enrollment for the semester has been finalized. Please note, TEACH Grant disbursements will be prorated for less than full-time enrollment. This site is maintained by Office of Financial Aid.
