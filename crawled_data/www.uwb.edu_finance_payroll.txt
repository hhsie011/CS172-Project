If you are a new employee and need training on the ISC system, please contact the UWB Workday Support Team. Professional Workers: Professional workers do not submit timesheets, however, must submit all leave requests and record holidays in Workday. Add the ISC website to your favorites for easy access. Holidays (Calendar, Eligibility, Credit and Use Deadlines) All Classified and Professional Workers: Workday defaults a University holiday as "time worked." Most workers have the holiday off. For workers that did not work on the holiday, workers need to enter "Holiday Taken Time Off" into Workday on the holiday. (Note: Do not use Holiday Credit Time Off). There are some exceptions: If you worked on the holiday: Code your time in Workday as regular hours worked. No additional action needed. If the holiday was already your scheduled day off (you worked your full week's hours independent of the holiday): No additional action needed. Holiday credit will remain with your leave balances. Student Employees Information for Students: Integrated Service Center (ISC): Submit timesheets in Workday. Timesheet Due Dates: Timesheets are due at noon on the 1st and 16th of each month.

Visit the UW Bothell Center for International Education's page on social security numbers. All Foreign National employees are entered into Glacier – a Nonresident Alien Tax Compliance Software for UW Employees This is a secure web-based system that enables the foreign national student, staff, or faculty member to track their visa, passport, entry dates, country of residence, country of citizenship, US address, foreign address, Social Security number or ITIN. Based on this information University of Washington is able to know if the individual is eligible for any tax treaties, has passed a substantial presence test, or has become a “tax resident for tax purposes.” When a record is created by the employee, Glacier generates a tax summary page and populates the appropriate tax forms. Examples of these forms are the 8233, W-8Ben, and W-4 federal withholding form. The respective Payroll Coordinator/Administrator enters the Foreign National employee into Glacier. Glacier will prompt the employee directly to access their account. Glacier access for employees As well as the help option contacts inside Glacier, you can contact a Foreign National Specialist. Tools for Glacier Resources for Supervisors Supervisors should use these reports for reviewing employee time and absence requests and timesheets: Workday for Managers Workday Reports Earnings and Actuals Tips Mobile Device Allowance Agreement The UW Mobile Device Use and Allowance Policy governs the use of, and payment for, mobile device technologies (such as smart phones and tablets) required for business purposes by the University of Washington (UW).
