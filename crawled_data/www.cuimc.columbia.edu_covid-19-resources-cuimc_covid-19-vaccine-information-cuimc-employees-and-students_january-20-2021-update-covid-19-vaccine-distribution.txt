It was another productive day at the Armory, and everyone we talk to about getting vaccinated there is so grateful. Thanks to all the staff and volunteers who are making this possible. They are nearing their 10,000th vaccination! To help streamline vaccinations, all 1st dose vaccinations this week will be at the Armory, with the exception of a special event at Milstein on Friday, Jan. 22. In addition, as outlined below, second doses this week are administered in separate locations, by vaccine brand; please go to the right location based on the vaccine brand you received for the first dose. As of today, over 38,000 faculty, staff, and students at NewYork-Presbyterian, Weill Cornell, and Columbia have received their first dose of the vaccine. There have also been over 12,000 second doses administered. First dose vaccinations include over 17,000 individuals on the Columbia Campus who are working in patient care areas, with over 7,200 of them Columbia employees and students. CUIMC and Columbia University Employees Included in New York State Phases 1a and 1b Phase 1A CUIMC staff included in 1A are individuals who directly interact with patients and all care team members and staff who provide in-person support to those delivering patient care. It also includes those conducting COVID-19 tests, handling COVID-19 specimens, and administering COVID-19 vaccinations. CUIMC staff in these roles should come in to receive a vaccine as soon as possible at the Armory. No appointments are necessary. Please see the hours and locations below. Phase 1B CUIMC and Columbia University employees age 65 and older (category 1B) must make an appointment through Connect, and they will receive vaccinations at The Armory, located at 168th and Fort Washington.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) The FAQ documents on the CUIMC COVID Vaccine Information page continue to be updated, so please check the site for the latest versions. Below is the Question of the Day: I am wondering if there is any reason to worry, based on the current push to release reserved second doses, that we will not have the doses available for our second vaccine on our scheduled date. Are you still certain you will have the doses needed to give the doses on the scheduled dates? We expect to have enough second doses to offer to all of our health care personnel who received first doses. Thank you and stay safe!
