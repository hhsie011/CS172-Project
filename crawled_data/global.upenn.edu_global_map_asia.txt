The group’s findings illuminate how the Mughal Empire maintained itself through warfare and raise questions about Mughal military logistics -- about the transporting of men, animals, weaponry, and supplies over long distances for military campaigns. At the close of the project, the students worked with Sreenivasan on an article, which they are planning to submit to the Digital Humanities Journal.

Moreover in November 2019, Dr. Steinhardt organized the Penn Museum’s first-ever Middle-Period Mongolian Archaeology Conference, convening top experts in Mongolian archaeology from around the world to better understand Mongolian history, which has implications for our understanding of the histories of the peoples of Russia, China, Korea, and various other countries in the region.

The purpose of this study is to reveal pathways to homelessness and assess housing support systems empirically by analyzing governmental and private data in both countries.

Through this partnership, Penn GSE has collaborated with colleagues at the University of Cambridge (UK) and at NU to establish NU’s Graduate School of Education (NUGSE.) Hartley and his Penn GSE colleague Peter Eckel have organized a number of exchanges, bringing Penn GSE doctoral students to NUGSE during two summers and inviting groups of NU doctoral students to Penn during successive fall semesters. Hartley and his team have ongoing academic partnerships with colleagues at NU which have produced books and journal articles on a number of topics including institutional autonomy and graduate employment opportunities.

In the first two years, Braham and his team audited ger in Mongolia and Philadelphia, building a “test ranch” of improved ger outside Ulaanbaatar in collaboration with Kieran Timberlake Architects, North Face, and Arc’teryx. The first goal was to replace coal stoves with electric heaters to reduce local pollution and reduce heating costs. In the third year, the lessons of the first two years were used to develop a package of “Cooking, Heating, and Insulation Products and Service (CHIPS) that were applied to 200 ger in Bayankhongor, Mongolia, which were successfully heated with electricity. The fourth year of research brings the CHIPS package back to Ulaanbaatar in six demonstration ger. The first phase of research was supported by a grant from Penn Global’s Global Engagement Fund (GEF).

In June 2017, Hellerstein launched the project with a workshop at Nanjing University for11 Jewish Studies scholars from China and the US.. In June 2018, Hellerstein convened a two-day conference at China’s Nanjing University that brought together 28 Jewish studies scholars from China, the US, Israel, and Europe. In June 2019, she and her Nanjing University partners led a pedagogical workshop on teaching Jewish Studies in China; 18 academics attended at the Penn Wharton China Center in Beijing. A volume of essays from the project, China and Ashkenazic Jewry: Transcultural Exchanges, co-edited by Hellerstein and SONG Lihong, will be published by De Gruyter Press in 2022. The project is supported in part by Penn Global’s China Research and Engagement Fund (CREF).
