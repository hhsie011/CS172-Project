Carter Brown Architecture Lectures Performances Workshops Blog Curatorial Fellowship A small number of Master's in public humanities students are awarded Curatorial Fellowships to bring their expertise in exhibit design, digital scholarship, and public programs to Brown departments, centers, galleries and libraries. Curatorial Fellows receive a yearly stipend ($15,000) and work 12-15 hours per week for their two years in the MA program. All students who request financial support from the program are eligible to be considered for curatorial fellowships available in the fall of their entry year. No additional paperwork is required. In the past, we had curatorial fellows working at Brown University Library, Brown Arts Institute, Instructional Technology Group, Office of Institutional Equity and Diversity, Swearer Center, and Center for the Study of Race and Ethnicity in America. The curatorial fellowships vary from year to year, and are offered if funding is available at the sponsoring departments.
