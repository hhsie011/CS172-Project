With teaching and research across the humanities, sciences, and social sciences, LACS expands the intellectual presence of Latin America and the Caribbean at Cornell by organizing campus events to bring together faculty, students, and the Cornell community. We sponsor undergraduate and graduate minors, and we encourage students to gain meaningful international experiences through internship opportunities, study abroad programs, and short-term course visits. LACS is supported by an Undergraduate International Studies and Foreign Languages (UISFL) grant from the U.S. Department of Education.
