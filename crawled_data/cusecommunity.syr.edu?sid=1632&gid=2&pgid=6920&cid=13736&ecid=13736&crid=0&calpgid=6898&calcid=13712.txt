There are approximately 5,000 alumni in the area, and roughly 350 students from the region attend Syracuse University each year. We connect alumni with their alma mater through professional development offerings, a New Student Send-Off, game watches, a National Orange Day community service project and a networking event for recent graduates and young alumni who are new to Albany.
