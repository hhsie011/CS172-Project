This multi-year project is set to be completed by June 2023. Back to top Project Details Virtual servers at the university allow departments and individuals to run their server workloads without having to manage physical hardware. This could include web hosting, print servers, custom applications, and more. All existing virtual servers will be moved from on-premises to Microsoft Azure. Azure is Microsoft’s cloud computing platform. The platform provides access to a multitude of emerging technologies across a wide variety of technologies. At Iowa State, Azure will be used for an ever-growing list of items, starting with virtual servers. Moving to the new service will: Provide users with increased capabilities Offer increased resiliency that boosts productivity Allow better control of data through self-service options Back to top Project Process To navigate the transition, ITS will catalog all existing virtual servers hosted on the current virtual server environment managed by ITS. Once identified, ITS will work with an external partner to conduct the migration process. Owners of existing virtual servers will be contacted to establish migration timelines and implement processes to minimize impact. Back to top Schedule & Timeline October 13, 2021 Migration timelines being developed with customers. September 10, 2021 Communication to existing server owners. June 2021 External partner identified. 2020 Azure selected as cloud computing platform. Back to top Frequently Asked Questions Will I have to rebuild my server? No. Servers will be migrated as-is. Will I have to re-IP my server? Yes. The Azure environment cannot use the same IP space campus uses and servers will need different IP address(es). Will I have to resubmit firewall rules? No. ITS will collect and migrate existing firewall rules for owner. Do I have to migrate? Yes. The on-premises infrastructure will be shut down in June 2023 and will no longer be available. Will prices change? Yes. The potential price listing is shown below.

Prices are subject to change and are set by Microsoft, not Iowa State University. ** Cost varies based on type of VM chosen, burst or constant performance. Why not just replace the on-premises infrastructure? Originally, ITS planned to replace the on-premises infrastructure with new hardware. Upon further investigation, it was determined that the cost for replacing the current infrastructure is about the same as Microsoft Azure. And by migrating to Azure, server owners will have greater functionality and flexibility. How can I reduce my expense? In the first phase of the project, identified costs represent running a full server that is on 24/7/365. In the second phase of the project, server owners will have the option to move from a full server to a cloud-native service which should reduce prices. Examples include managed web hosting without a server, managed storage without a server, managed databases without a server, and others. Once migrated, ITS will work with server owners to optimize needs and service levels. Who do I contact for questions? Please contact azure@iastate.edu for more information.
