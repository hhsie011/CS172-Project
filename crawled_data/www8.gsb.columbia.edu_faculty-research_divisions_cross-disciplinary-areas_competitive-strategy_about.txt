The CDA is chaired by Charles Angelucci and Dan Wang. Basic functions include: Building the faculty by hiring tenured and tenure-track faculty members who will enhance the School’s ability to produce leading scholarship on strategy in economics, psychology, organizational sociology, and other social science disciplines. Facilitating research through such efforts as selectively funding research that advances scholarship at the frontier of strategy research, and bridges academic divisions and disciplines. Supporting teaching through the development of teaching materials and courses in the School’s MBA, Executive MBA and Executive Education programs, among other efforts. Extending outreach by connecting scholars to the larger academic community through such events as conferences, fostering connections between researchers and relevant practitioners, and raising the visibility of and promoting access to the School’s scholarship and expertise (e.g., through the dissemination of working papers and press releases, etc.). Goals The initiative’s overarching goals are: To attract the world’s best faculty members whose work is at the forefront of scholarship on strategy in social science. To solidify Columbia Business School’s reputation as one of the world’s top centers for strategy scholarship and teaching.
