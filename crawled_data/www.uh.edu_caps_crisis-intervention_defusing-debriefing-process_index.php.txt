Defusing is done the day of the incident and is designed to assure understanding of their reactions and to discuss resources for further services when needed. Defusing interventions involve individuals who were directly involved in the incident and take place at a location secured by the UH campus community caller. They are designed to assist individuals in coping in the short term and address immediate needs. Debriefings are usually the second level of intervention for those directly affected by the incident and often the first for those not directly involved. A debriefing is normally done within 72 hours of the incident and gives the individual or group the opportunity to talk about their experience, how it has affected them, identify individuals at risk, and inform the individual or group about services available to them in their community. When providing defusing and debriefing interventions, we are guided by APA Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct and the Mission Statement of the University of Houston.
