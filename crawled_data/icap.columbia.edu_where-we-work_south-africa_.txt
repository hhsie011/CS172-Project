HIV Prevention Services for Key Underserved Populations under PEPFAR Project Details ICAP contributed to South Africa’s National Strategic Plan on HIV/AIDS and sexually-transmitted infections (STIs) and tuberculosis (TB) by providing technical support for the implementation of comprehensive HIV prevention services Project Details ICAP contributed to South Africa’s National Strategic Plan on HIV/AIDS and sexually-transmitted infections (STIs) and tuberculosis (TB) by providing technical support for the implementation of comprehensive HIV prevention services for men who have sex with men (MSM). Implemented under the project name Mosaic Men’s Health Initiatives (MOSAIC), this project sought to increase coverage, access, and quality of HIV-related services for MSM in five provinces in South Africa by capacity building at the institutional, health facility, and community level to provide clinically-competent HIV care services to MSM. The project also delivered MSM services through mobile wellness clinics staffed by peer outreach workers, lay counselors and nurses who provide HIV counseling, testing, and screening for TB and STIs.

Project Details ICAP implemented a study to enhance services for non-communicable diseases (NCDs). This two-phase project aimed to expand diabetes and hypertension screening for people living with HIV in South Africa. Phase one included: a baseline needs assessment and situational analysis; selection of Zamdela Community Health Centre, in the Free State province, as the study site; provision of medical equipment; and development and delivery of NCD tools and training. Phase two included a study to determine the prevalence of these conditions in HIV-infected patients and the feasibility of screening methods to be integrated in HIV services. (funded by the Medtronic Foundation) South Africa ICAP MCAP Project Details Columbia University’s role in implementing PEPFAR began in 2003, when it received funding from the Global AIDS Program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) under the University Project Details Columbia University’s role in implementing PEPFAR began in 2003, when it received funding from the Global AIDS Program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) under the University Technical Assistance Projects (UTAP) to support the development of important components of national HIV programs, including treatment protocols and training. In 2004, ICAP was founded and was awarded a new cooperative agreement from CDC under the PEPFAR framework, the Track 1.0 funding mechanism, to provide comprehensive HIV care and treatment in five countries: Kenya, Mozambique, Rwanda, South Africa, and Tanzania, with programming in Côte d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, and Nigeria subsequently added. This initiative, the Multicountry Columbia Antiretroviral Program (MCAP), rapidly expanded programs for HIV care and ART by promoting early diagnosis of HIV infection, maintaining the health of those living with HIV, and preventing further transmission of HIV within the community. MCAP programming between 2004 and 2012, in addition to being focused on rapidly scaling up care and treatment in partnership with host-country governments, also emphasized the full continuum of HIV-related services, continued capacity building and health systems strengthening, and transition of operations to host governments and local nongovernmental organizations.

MTCT-Plus and MTCT-Plus Expansion Project Details The MTCT-Plus Initiative, the world’s first multi-country HIV treatment program, aimed to demonstrate to a disbelieving world that it was possible to provide care and antiretroviral (ARV) treatment in resource-limited Project Details The MTCT-Plus Initiative, the world’s first multi-country HIV treatment program, aimed to demonstrate to a disbelieving world that it was possible to provide care and antiretroviral (ARV) treatment in resource-limited settings, using programs to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) as an entry point. In December 2003, the MTCT-Plus Secretariat in New York (the precursor to ICAP, headed by ICAP’s Wafaa El-Sadr and Elaine Abrams) received its first grant from the new President’s Emergency Program For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Four years later, the MTCT-Plus Initiative of Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health was providing HIV care and treatment for nearly 17,000 people at 14 sites in nine countries. MTCT-Plus received expansion funding from USAID in 2003 and 2006. By 2010, ICAP had provided HIV care and treatment to more than one million people.

(funded by the NIH) UTAP and UTAP-2 Project Details In September 2002, the Mailman School of Public Health (MSPH) at Columbia University (CU) entered into a Cooperative Agreement with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for the University Technical Project Details In September 2002, the Mailman School of Public Health (MSPH) at Columbia University (CU) entered into a Cooperative Agreement with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for the University Technical Assistance Projects (UTAP) in Support of the Global HIV/AIDS Program. Situated within ICAP, UTAP was originally envisioned as a single-country program for the provision of technical assistance, but rapidly grew to include long-term and short-term technical and administrative assistance to the national responses to HIV/AIDS in five countries: Mozambique, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, and Zambia. As the original UTAP project drew to a close and PEPFAR moved into its second phase—focused on sustainability—ICAP entered into several, follow-on Cooperative Agreements, called UTAP-2. Four were country-focused (in Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Swaziland, and Tanzania) and the fifth—UTAP-2 Atlanta—became a flexible mechanism for providing a wide range of technical assistance and other support to PEPFAR countries. After beginning in 2009 as a means to help CDC conduct surveillance training more efficiently through distance education, UTAP-2 Atlanta grew over the next six and a half years to comprise 11 distinct projects addressing needs and gaps in the HIV response and answering important research questions to inform the response going forward.
