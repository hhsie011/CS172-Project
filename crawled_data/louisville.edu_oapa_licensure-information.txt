Separate from educational requirements, state licensure boards may require applicants to complete professional examinations, background checks, years of professional experience, jurisprudence exams, etc. Prospective and current students should keep in mind that licensing and authorization requirements vary by state and that relocating during the course of a program to another state could impact whether that student should continue in the course or meet the eligibility requirements of that state. If students are considering relocating, they should check with the respective state board for licensure eligibility requirements. If you live outside Kentucky and are considering enrolling in a program that leads to a professional license, we highly recommended that you contact the appropriate state licensing agency in your state or the state where you intend to work to seek the most up-to-date information about state licensure requirements before beginning the program. Information about State Authorization, Online Education. Please select the academic area you are interested in for more information about programs that lead to licensure or certification.
