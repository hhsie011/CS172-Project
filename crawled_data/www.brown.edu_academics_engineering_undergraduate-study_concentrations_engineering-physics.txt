It enables students to craft a program that combines both disciplines, and provides an excellent foundation for a research career. Sc.B. in Engineering Physics Much of engineering has its roots in physics, and physics relies on engineers to develop the instrumentation necessary to advance the field. The Sc.B. degree in engineering and physics is offered jointly by the School of Engineering and the Department of Physics. It enables students to craft a program that combines both disciplines, and provides an excellent foundation for a research career. The program can be entered by taking the standard introductory sequence of courses from either department, and offers a choice between physics and engineering for many upper level courses. The program has a total of 19 required courses, and has the following general structure Two introductory courses in engineering or physics Five courses in mathematics, applied mathematics or mathematical physics A computer programming course Ten additional courses in physics and/or engineering, which include electricity and magetism, advanced classical mechanics, electrical circuits, chemistry or continuum mechanics, quantum mechanics, and solid state physics. A thesis in engineering or physics Sample course plan For complete requirements, please see the University Bulletin. SEM.
