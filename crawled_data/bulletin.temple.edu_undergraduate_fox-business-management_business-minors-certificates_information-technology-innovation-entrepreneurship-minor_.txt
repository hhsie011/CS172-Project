Courses for the minor must be completed prior to graduation; if completed, the minor will be recorded on the final transcript upon graduation. For more information and to declare or rescind this minor, visit the MIS department. Interested students should discuss with their home college advisors how the courses in the minor will fit into their overall degree plan and are strongly encouraged to declare the minor early in their academic career.
