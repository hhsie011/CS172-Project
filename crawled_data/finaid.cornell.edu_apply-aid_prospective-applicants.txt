If you wish only to apply for federal aid, you just need to complete and submit the FAFSA. FAFSA (Cornell’s FAFSA code is 002711) CSS Profile (Cornell’s undergraduate CSS Code is 2098) Tax Documentation – signed tax return, schedules, W2s; as well as business or foreign taxes (if applicable) to IDOC Non-Custodial CSS Profile and Tax Documentation (If applicable) Financial Aid Application Deadlines: Spring Transfer 2021-22: October 15, 2021 Early Decision 2022-23: November 21, 2021 Regular Decision 2022-23: February 15, 2022 Fall Transfer 2022-23: March 15, 2022 All undergraduate students and admissions applicants who are seeking financial aid need to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Completing the FAFSA is the best first step to take in order to apply for financial aid. The FAFSA determines your financial aid eligibility for federal sources of financial aid, but we also treat it as part of the institutional requirements. Please be sure to transfer your tax information directly from the IRS into the FAFSA form when prompted. To be considered for undergraduate, Cornell Grant funding you must also complete the College Board’s CSS PROFILE and submit supporting tax information. Once you complete the CSS PROFILE the first year, we strive to keep your financial aid offer as consistent as possible and ask that in the following years you only submit the FAFSA. Please do not submit a CSS PROFILE for your second year applying for financial aid, unless we specifically ask for one. We will use the information submitted through the FAFSA to determine if you have significant changes to your family income compared to the prior financial aid application. If additional information is needed, we will ask for it specifically once your FAFSA eligibility has been reviewed. Cornell University has a need-based financial aid policy. This means we do not offer scholarships based on academic merit or athletic achievement. Financial Aid eligibility is assessed by evaluating a family’s financial circumstances and their ability to contribute through an Estimated Family Contribution to the costs of your education. Completing all of your financial aid application materials by the financial aid deadlines will help our office provide financial aid offers in time for your admissions deposit deadline or the July bill if you are a current student. Submitting an application after the financial aid deadline may mean you will need to make a decision to attend the university without knowing what your financial aid may be.
