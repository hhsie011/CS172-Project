Definitions vary, but at their core, the central idea underpinning the concept of social justice is that all people should both be treated equally AND have equal access to society's resources and opportunities. Concepts of social justice acknowledge that this access and treatment has been inequitable historically, a practice that continues in the present for people across identity groups. Below are organizations advocating for justice across the country. Requests to add additional items can be sent to [email protected]. Please note Columbia University is not affiliated with, nor does it explicitly endorse, any of the organizations listed.

I am committed to that task, but, more importantly, Columbia is committed to it. Columbia is an old institution by the standards of the United States, and it has its share of shameful periods and moments of great progress. I hope we can collectively add to the latter. Across the University, there are many people reflecting on what can be done." – President Lee C.
