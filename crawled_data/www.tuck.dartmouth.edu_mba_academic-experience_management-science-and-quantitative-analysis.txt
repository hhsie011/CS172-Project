The 15 credits used to qualify can include no more than one full-course equivalent grade of LP (one full-course equivalent is one full-term course or two mini courses).

Such coursework must be consistent with the qualifying sequence of study. Petitions should be sent to tuck.registrar@tuck.dartmouth.edu, and should include a course syllabus, assignments, and exams (if possible). At the end of the spring term of their second year, an audit will be done to ensure that students pursuing the option have successfully completed all requirements.
