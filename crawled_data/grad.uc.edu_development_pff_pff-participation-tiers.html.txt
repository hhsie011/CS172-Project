Students matriculated prior to the fall 2019 application deadline should refer to the Legacy Program page. UC's Preparing Future Faculty program offers three participation tiers to students. Each tier has requirements that students must complete in order to exit the program or advance to the next tier. Student progress is calculated utilizing activity points. Students receive activity points for participating in PFF activities. Once a student completes their desired tier, he/she/they will receive a decorative certificate and a signed letter of completion, outlining the tier requirements. Students must complete the application process prior to starting tier progress, and students must complete an exit survey in order to complete a tier. Students can request the exit survey from the program coordinator at gradpff@uc.edu. Activity Points Student progress within PFF tiers is calculated through activity points. Students accumulate activity points by participating in PFF activities. Following participation in the activity, students must complete and submit an activity log to gradpff@uc.edu. Failure to do so will result in the omission of the completed activity from your PFF progress record. Activity logs must be completed and submitted within one month of the PFF activity date.
