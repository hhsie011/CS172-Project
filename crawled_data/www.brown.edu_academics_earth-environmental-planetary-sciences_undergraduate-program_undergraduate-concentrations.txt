Research opportunities encompass a broad spectrum of basic and applied investigations, linked with environmental sciences, engineering, materials science, archaeology, space science, astronomy, economics, international relations, or meteorology. Our department is known on campus as being open and friendly. With 20 faculty, 40-50 undergraduate concentrators (>50% women), and 60-65 graduate students, classes are comfortably small, and faculty, graduates and undergraduates interact frequently. Geosciences Concentration Requirements Standard Program for the A.B. degree in Geosciences Geosciences is a highly interdisciplinary concentration employing principles from physics, chemistry, and biology to understand the structure of the Earth and other planetary bodies. Concentrators can study Earth and planetary interiors, including the formation of rocks and minerals, movement of the Earth's tectonic plates, and the circulation of the planets' core and mantle. Other areas emphasize surface processes, such as the movement and storage of water. This concentration is a good choice for students who seek a broad scientific understanding of the processes that shape the physical world around us. The ScB requires more (19) courses, including a research course. DEEPS provides a highly collaborative learning environment that emphasizes process-oriented, hands-on approaches in the classroom, in labs and on field trips. There are many opportunities for students to do research working with faculty, graduate students, and researchers. The degree builds students' skills in critical thinking, written and oral communication, data analysis and modeling, and applying systems approaches to problem solving, which prepare students for a wide variety of careers.

Degree in Geo-Bio Students in Geology-Biology apply principles from geology, biology, chemistry, and physics to understand how major components of the Earth, such as its atmosphere and oceans, interact with and sustain life in the past, present, and into the future. Many courses emphasize climate change, environmental pollution, and biogeochemistry, so this concentration is a good one for students interested in studying the environment. Other areas emphasize Earth history, including climate change, extinction events, and using the Earth’s sedimentary record to investigate environmental change.

Degree in Geochemistry Geochemists investigate low-temperature and high-temperature processes operating on scales that range from atoms, to the Earth, to the solar system. Low-temperature geochemistry focuses on chemical and biochemical processes on and near Earth's surface, including environmental geochemistry, pollution in the ocean and freshwater bodies, and how the Earth's geochemical record reflects past climate conditions. High-temperature geochemistry focuses on the formation and evolution of the Earth and other planets, magma formation and properties, volcanic activity, and metamorphism.

The Department of Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences offers many courses to develop our concentrators' written communication skills, including writing-designated (WRIT) courses that satisfy Brown's writing requirement. We advise students to take at least one, and preferably many of these courses. Concentrations in the Department of Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences do not allow submissions of written work to be used in place of WRIT courses. Brown requires all undergraduates to complete at least one WRIT course by the end of their 4th semester, and a second WRIT course during their 5th-7th semesters. A list of WRIT courses is available here. These concentration guidelines apply to all students in the Class of 2017 and beyond.
