This is accomplished through a partnership between data science materials science professionals and the development of modeling concepts, tools, techniques and systems to integrate and leverage data science methodologies with fundamental physics and chemistry to speed up the discovery of novel materials. We also exploit group funding opportunities in this space and partner with hardware and software engineers to examine the development and use of computers and software platforms.
