These services are provided by Career Center staff members who serve as individual Career Advisors. Our staff members are competent, trained, and committed to providing quality assistance to FSU students engaging in career planning and decision-making. Our services are offered in three formats based on individual need: Drop-In Career Advising Drop-in advising requires no appointment and generally consists of a 10-20 minute individual session with a Career Advisor. This option is the fastest, simplest way for students to get timely career planning assistance. Simply come to the 1st floor of The Career Center, sign in at the desk, and a friendly Career Advisor will see you as quickly as possible. Career Advisors can assist you with topics such as choosing a major, resume and cover letter writing, personal statement review, interviewing tips, networking, career-decision making, launching a job/internship campaign, negotiating and evaluating offers, and more. The Career Center will offer both in-person drop-in career advising hours, and virtual career advising with career liaisons through NoleNetwork appointments. The Career Center will be closed for advising the week of May 2nd thru May 6th. REGULAR DROP-IN cAREER ADVISING HOURS WILL RESUME ON MAY 9TH.
