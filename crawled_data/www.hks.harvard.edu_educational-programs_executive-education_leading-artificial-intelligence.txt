Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) is expanding into nearly every sector of society—from healthcare and finance to transportation and government services. Yet most decision makers do not fully understand how these technologies work, nor fully grasp their unintended consequences. Public trust in AI and ML requires that leaders understand and address questions around fairness, privacy, and bias. Leaders like you are asking for tools and resources to better navigate this uncharted territory. Leading in Artificial Intelligence: Exploring Technology and Policy is an executive program that provides you with this opportunity. It lies at the critical intersection of policy and technology. Innovative yet practical, this program will strengthen your capacity to lead in AI, including how to mitigate risk without inhibiting innovation. Together with your peers and renowned Harvard faculty, you will be immersed in a live learning experience with peer learning opportunities and activities you will do on your own.
