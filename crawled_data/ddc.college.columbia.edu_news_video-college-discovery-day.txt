Newsletters Search Enter a keyword Search [Video] College Discovery Day Our high school students became college students for the day. Organized and sponsored by the Double Discovery Student Organization (DDSO)–a recognized Columbia University student group who assist with the recruitment and training of Double Discovery Center volunteers–, Barnard and Columbia College members took 50 of our students to their classes to give them a first-hand look at a day in the life of an undergraduate. Students attended lectures on topics such as biochemistry, Japanese architecture, philosophy, anthropology and physics. Between lectures, Double Discovery students had the chance to speak with their university classmen in discussion groups about college life, extra curricular activities and dormitory living.
