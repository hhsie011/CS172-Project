About The Queer & Trans Employee Network is the affinity group for all LGBTQ+ employees at Florida State University. The network serves as a resource for members, promotes positive relationships among members of the network and community, and increases visibility for the LGBTQ+ community on campus while respecting members' rights to privacy. The network meets twice in the spring and fall semesters and once in the summer and aims to host at least one social event or program each semester. Join Those interested in joining the Queer & Trans Employee Network can complete an interest form to be added to the mailing list.
