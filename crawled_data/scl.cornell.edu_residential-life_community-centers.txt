Cornell's five Community Centers and the Willard Straight Hall Student Union are hubs of activity on campus – go-to places to meet people, get a bite to eat, experience Cornell's thriving social scene, or find a place to study or work out. At the heart of the first-year experience for undergraduate and transfer students is the Tatkon Center, a support and resource center uniquely focused on new students, offering informal peer mentoring and guidance, plus programs and services to ease the transition to Cornell and help new students discover campus opportunities throughout their first year. The Big Red Barn is Cornell's on-campus social center for graduate and professional students. In addition to being a Cornell Dining eatery, the Big Red Barn is a great place to attend social events, meet up with friends, and study. The Cornell Center for Intercultural Dialogue promotes programs that support and bring together Cornell's diverse student community, including those from Cornell's themed Program Houses, and diversity- and social justice-related student organizations across campus.
