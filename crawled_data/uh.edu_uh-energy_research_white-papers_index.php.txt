This series is a collaboration of research reports examining pertinent topics throughout the energy sector and aims to provide leaders from industry, nonprofits and regulatory agencies with information they need to navigate the changing energy landscape. While UH Energy already offers a popular symposium series focusing on key issues in the field and a blog hosted by Forbes.com intended to reach a wide audience, the White Paper Series, in contrast, is focused on distilling information on a variety of energy-related topics in a way that can help industry leaders prepare for the future.
