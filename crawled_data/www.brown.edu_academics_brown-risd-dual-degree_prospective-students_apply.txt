Each admission office will conduct a separate evaluation before joint consideration for the Dual Degree Program. Consequently, it is possible that a student could be admitted to RISD only, to Brown only, or to both Brown and RISD but not to the Dual Degree Program. Students accepted into the Dual Degree Program will be enrolled in both Brown and RISD and will be required to complete existing degree requirements for both institutions.
