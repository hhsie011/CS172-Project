Facilitated by the KU School of Social Welfare’s Center for Community Engagement & Collaboration (CCEC), this group will meet via zoom on a set schedule during the year, as determined by the consensus of the group and proposed originally to be bi-monthly. The initial focus of the group would be to help support the rural social work workforce in the following three integrated ways: EDUCATE: To support training and resources that promote professional resilience and wellness in the rural social work workforce, including students, frontline workers, and supervisors. CONNECT: To provide members of the social work workforce with opportunities for connection to strengthen the resiliency of their practice in rural areas of the state. SUPPORT: To help support those social workers living and working in rural Kansas at the individual and organizational levels. Information on organizational and individual resiliency can be shared with the group members to help bolster these practices in agencies where social workers are employed.
