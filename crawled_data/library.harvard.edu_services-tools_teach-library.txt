What We Offer Whether that's a session about leveraging library resources for research in a particular topic area, or using the library's special collection materials in your teaching, we can make it happen. Teach Remotely with Harvard Library Harvard’s vast collection is one of the best in the world, but that’s far from the only reason you might find a librarian helpful. We’re happy to talk whenever your students will be using sources or evaluating information of any kind. There is a library specialist for every subject, and we can help at every point in your process, from initial course design to guidance and support for your students to assessment and re-design. You can even invite a librarian to visit your class or section remotely and help get your students on the right track. Our visits are customized to the needs of your course, and topics include: Engaging with Primary Sources Introduction to College-Level Research Literature Reviews The Stories Maps Tell Oral History and Interview Skills Reaching Beyond Harvard Evaluating What You Find Database Searching Email us and we can connect you with the library’s liaison for your department or program. How To Teach Remotely with Harvard Library Teaching a class remotely? Harvard Library can help. General Library Instruction Sessions Librarians can provide instruction sessions tailored to a specific class or topic area. Sessions can be developed around any skill level or disciplinary interest. Librarian-led classes can be held in a variety of library spaces or in the class's regular location. To arrange a session, contact your library liaison or submit a request. Teaching with Special Collections and Archives Class sessions at participating special collections libraries and archives can range from surveys of faculty-selected collection material to sessions for which our staff provide guided explorations. Students examine materials during a class at the Harvard University Archives We're also happy to support students through assignments which require engagement with our collections. Bring your class in for an hour or schedule several visits for in-depth investigations of archives, manuscripts, maps, rare books, and more. To start the planning process, submit a request and you'll be contacted by a librarian or archivist who will work with you to plan and execute your goals for the session.
