As a result, the numbers listed for any one school may not fully represent the entire body of faculty who teach and work with students in that school. In the Schools of Music and Drama, adjunct professors provide the core of the schools’ regular faculty. As a result, the distinction among the categories of tenured/term/non-ladder is less relevant in those schools. In 2018 the additional category of Ladder/Continuing was added to the table. This category counts Law, Medicine, and Nursing ladder faculty who are not on the tenure track. Faculty in the School of Engineering and Applied Science are counted within the Faculty of Arts & Sciences. Faculty in the School of Public Health are counted within the School of Medicine.
