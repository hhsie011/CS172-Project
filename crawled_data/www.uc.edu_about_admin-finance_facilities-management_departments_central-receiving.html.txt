The University of Cincinnati’s Central Receiving Center is responsible for receiving and processing University funded materials, inspecting shipments for quantity and condition, verifying contents for UC Flex orders and maintaining a log for Credit Card Orders and other shipments. Central Receiving also provides delivery service for Printing Services, Surplus Equipment Management and computer forms distribution. Shipping services are provided for departments requesting assistance. Business Hours: 7:30 am to 4:00 pm - Monday-Friday Receiving Hours: 7:45 am to 3:45 pm - Monday-Friday For Assistance, Contact Us: Telephone: 513-556-5655 Central Distribution Center: 792 E McMillan St, Cincinnati, OH 45206 David Breen Associate Director , Mail Service & Campus Receiving 513-556-5655 david.breen@uc.edu History In December, 1978, the Central Receiving Department was established. A division of Purchasing, Central Receiving formally opened February 2, 1979 in Walnut Hills, approximately two miles from the main Clifton campus. The Albers Building, which was previously a food chain store, was converted into a five-bay receiving area with offices and warehousing facilities included. This innovative receiving and redelivery system was developed to funnel most delivery activities through the main site. As the University of Cincinnati moves toward a pedestrian campus, incoming freight trucks and vendors will experience more difficulty in direct deliveries and, therefore, have a central point of delivery, as was intended 20 years ago. Equipment Used Central Receiving utilizes four 16’ cargo trucks with an inside cargo clearance of 7’2" in height and 7’6" across. The tailgate height is 46" off the ground. Overhead clearance for our trucks is 13’. Other freight handling equipment is used: two-wheel dolly, pallet truck (electric and manual) and barrel, furniture and floor dollies.Replace with your text Receiving Services Central Receiving will accept authorized shipments directed to the University of Cincinnati. The freight bill/log manifest will be checked for an accurate address, carton count and condition of the shipment. All freight will be inspected for loss, damage or overage and any variances will be noted on the freight bill. Shipments may be refused if damaged or not adequately containerized for internal handling and forwarding. If a shipment exceeds the size limitations of our vehicles, we will request the delivery to be made directly, if possible. Once the shipment has been signed for, the information is then recorded into the UC Flex system, thus producing a hard copy used to record additional information on order status. This copy is forwarded with the vendor’s packing slip and the shipment to the requesting department. Shipping Services Central Receiving provides shipping services for those departments wishing to ship items out from the University. A Shipping Request Form, obtained by contacting Central Receiving at 513-556-5655, must be filled out which includes general information and an account number to be charged for freight costs. The outbound shipment must be labeled, packed and ready to send. Boxes and packing material are not available from our center. Central Receiving utilizes United Parcel Service (UPS) for packages up to 150 lbs. The size measurements must not exceed 130 inches in length and girth combined and any one length cannot be over 108 inches. For larger shipments, we ship best way via commercial carrier.
