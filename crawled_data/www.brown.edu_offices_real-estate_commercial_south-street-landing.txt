More than 400 University staff members from 11 administrative departments now work in South Street Landing in Providence's Jewelry District. Brown has leased 136,000 square feet of the 265,000-square-foot South Street Landing. Relocating administrative offices to the building advances the University’s academic mission by freeing space on College Hill for undergraduate-focused academic pursuits, and it strengthens connections between the administrative units that serve as the University’s backbone.
