We then reviewed our current curriculum, learning objectives and degree requirements, including our current specialization framework. These discussions began at the CRP August 2015 faculty retreat and were continued in subsequent in faculty meetings in the fall of 2015. In these meetings CRP faculty isolated important programmatic and strategic planning issues that we hoped could be informed by a deeper and more systematic process to create a new, revised strategic plan for the UT-CRP program moving forward. In January of 2016, the entire CRP faculty and five representatives selected by the CRP student organization held the first of a series of meetings to review and revise the strategic plan. In February of 2016, faculty and students conducted a “Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats” (SWOT) analysis which highlighted a set of strategic issues and a vision and goals exercise that related to the SWOT analysis. This process also highlighted the fundamental purposes and aspirations of the program. This step in the process led to the crafting of a provisional mission statement, set of goals and performance measures for future review and refinement. This work formed the foundation of a half-day retreat on March 24, 2016 that included faculty, students and six prominent professionals, including the chair of the Central Texas American Planning Association chapter. The SWOT analysis and a provisional mission statement, program goals and performance measures were reviewed and revised at this retreat. In addition, key programmatic issues were isolated that needed to be addressed for the program to align strongly with the aspirations of the strategic plan. Three working groups were formed out of this retreat: a group to further refine and finalize the strategic plan; a group to review and make final recommendations regarding our current specialization areas; and a group to address issues of diversity and equity in our faculty and student recruitment, our curriculum and in the broader culture of our school and program. These three working groups met, communicated and worked on producing recommendations from late March through early May of 2016. As work continued on finalizing a new strategic plan, input was also received at our annual CRP career day events on April 8, of 2016. These events included an alumni panel and roundtable discussions involving over 30 employers focusing on current trends in planning and related professions, knowledge, skills and abilities sought by employers of masters graduates and the status of specializations and certificate programs in hiring decisions. The information and advice received at these events fed into our strategic planning process and our decision to eliminate most of our specialization areas. A final 3-hour meeting was held on May 10, 2016 with faculty and student representatives to complete final work on the strategic plan, make final recommendations on our program specialization areas and propose and implement an aggressive pan to promote equity and diversity across the CRP program. The faculty and students adopted the final strategic plan by consensus. We believe that this process, spanning roughly nine months, was inclusive, highly engaging and deliberative. It forced all program stakeholders to take a broader view and reimagine the values, purposes and goals that should animate cutting edge planning research, teaching and practice in the current setting and into the future. The 2015-16 revised strategic plan seeks to align the mission and goals of the UT-CRP program with enduring and emerging challenges in the planning profession to create and support healthy, safe, just and environmentally resilient communities. This intensive strategic planning process yielded a new mission statement reflecting the core values and fundamental purpose of the UT-CRP program. Our mission is connected to seven specific program goals and specific performance measures that register meaningful progress toward the key goals of the program. The new strategic plan for the UT-CRP program provides a clear framework for the program that will act as a guidepost and durable reference for faculty, students and professional partners now and into the future CRP Mission Statement The Community and Regional Planning (CRP) Program at the University of Texas at Austin seeks to continuously strengthen, adapt, and improve our teaching, research, and service activities to create and support healthy, safe, just and environmentally resilient communities. Our mission is to provide the knowledge, skills, and abilities that empower students to accomplish these goals through practical engagement in transparent and socially inclusive planning processes in a variety of settings in the United States and around the world. We strive to provide an environment of innovation in teaching, research and practice that accomplishes this mission while remaining faithful to our long standing values of equity, fairness, diversity and dedication to creating and maintaining sustainable communities.
