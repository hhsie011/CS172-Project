It offers interdisciplinary programs in Romance languages – French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese – and literatures. Students in Romance Studies select a major in an area of literature (French, Italian, or Hispanic literatures) and choose a minor in one or two other areas from any field. French, Hispanic, or Italian literature. The field offers a full complement of courses in French, Hispanic, or Italian literatures. It seeks to incorporate current, speculative, theoretical views of literature and culture, in interdisciplinary fashion and in dialogue with multiple methodologies and perspectives. Students choose one literary/cultural tradition as their major concentration. They are expected to acquire a working knowledge of the general history of that literature/culture, to become conversant with the social and intellectual history, and to speak and write their major language fluently. They are trained in bibliographical, linguistic, and analytical skills essential to teaching and research in the interpretation of those literatures and cultures. Students are encouraged to study foreign languages other than the language of the major concentration, especially when special linguistic competence is necessary for the student's research. Such need is determined by the student's Special Committee. Students with a major in French, Hispanic, or Italian literatures teach a mix of language and literature and culture courses as part of their professional training; numerous teaching assistantships are available. A semester-long methodology in language teaching course allows beginning assistants to learn strategies and methodologies, while a practicum allows students to be observed and aided by an experienced instructor in the first semester of their teaching. Orientation workshops on multiple aspects of teaching both language and literature/culture courses are offered before the semester begins, in addition to different workshops throughout the academic year. Research and study opportunities: Students are encouraged to spend a term or year abroad to improve their language skills and/or advance their research. The Department currently has an exchange program in France and there are many other opportunities students can apply for during the academic year or over the summer. Cornell's excellent research library has renowned special collections, such as the Dante and the Witchcraft collections, in addition to a partnership with peer institutions that brings their resources to campus via BorrowDirect, numbering into the 60 million volumes. The field also benefits from the interdisciplinary Medieval Studies Program, the Global Early Modern Studies Colloquium, the Society for the Humanities, the Latin American Studies Program, the Latinx Studies Program, the Feminist Gender and Sexuality Studies Program, the Atkinson Center for Sustainability, and the Institute for European Studies.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
