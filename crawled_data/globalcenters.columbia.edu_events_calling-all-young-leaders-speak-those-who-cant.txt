All the world's creatures, large and small, are interdependent, and play an important role in our environment, helping to keep it healthy and balanced. In response, Columbia Global Centers | Beijing jointly launches the "Speak Up" Initiative, a part of the 12th International Youth Summit on Energy and Climate Change (IYSECC-XII), with China Youth Climate Action Network (CYCAN) co-founded by Columbia SIPA alumni.
