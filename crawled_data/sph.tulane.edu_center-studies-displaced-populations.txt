Home / Center for Studies of Displaced Populations tracking code Center for Studies of Displaced Populations The Center for Studies of Displaced Populations, established in 2016, supports several studies focused on individuals and families in transition. The principal one is "Demographic and Health Disparities in Recovery from Hurricane Katrina: KATRINA@10". The NIH-funded KATRINA@10 Program consists of an interrelated set of three primary data collection projects that focus on specific sub-populations who were uniquely affected by Hurricane Katrina; two secondary analyses of data that are more broadly representative of the overall affected population; and three cores to support the set of research projects. A central strength of the Center's research is that it entails both depth and breadth in its assessment of recovery at the 10-year anniversary of one of the worst disasters in American history. Happy New Year! 2022 is the Year of The Tiger (click to view and read the full card).
