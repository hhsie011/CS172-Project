What is learning and development and how is it different from training? Learning and development (L&D) involves analyzing a situation and making recommendations on how to improve a work unit’s functioning. Sometimes an L&D intervention may involve a training program but may also include coaching, mentoring, process analysis, mediation, and meeting/retreat planning and facilitation. How do I schedule a training program for my department? If you are a unit head and would like a program tailored and delivered to your staff as a group, please contact us at 7-2215 or email pds@temple.edu and we will meet with you to schedule or even design a course that is just right for you and your staff! Can I schedule one-on-one coaching? If you feel you would benefit from one-on-one coaching, L&D will do our best to accommodate you. If you have not yet, look through the course offerings for the semester and see if the workshops touch upon issues you feel you need assistance with first. If you feel you need more individual help, we will be glad to meet with you and other people in your work unit if appropriate to help you perform at your best. Contact us at 7-2215 or email pds@temple.edu for more information on coaching.
