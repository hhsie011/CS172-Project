There are always sashes, often stoles, but this year’s distinguished College of Pharmacy scholars received a set of white and green honor cords at the 74th Annual Honors Day celebrations to mark the very highest level of academic accomplishment. After a two-year pause, Honors Day returned to the Forty Acres as an in-person, university-wide ceremony hosted by President Hartzell on Saturday, April 9 at the Frank Erwin Center on the UT Campus. Introduced in 1948 and celebrated every year since, Honors Day recognizes the accomplishments of the highest achieving students at The University of Texas at Austin — those who, by meeting competitive criteria, have earned their distinction as College Scholars or Distinguished College Scholars.
