By engaged we mean that you participate or use our programs to an extent that you develop a sense of ownership and belonging with us and the university community. We want you to feel like you matter here, because you do. One of our more popular activities is informal recreation. Informal recreation is where facilities and equipment are made available for your use on a walk up basis. There are no scheduled games, leagues etc. but rather basketball courts, racquetball courts, weight equipment, cardiovascular equipment etc. are all made available for you to use when it fits your schedule. Our facilities are open over 187 hours per week and offer different opportunities at each location. The open recreation program provides a great chance to try new activities as equipment for things like racquetball and squash are available so you can try new things without having to buy anything. Come by and visit them all, you'll find a place to become "engaged." For information on all of our facilities — including hours, location and descriptions — please use the links to the left.
