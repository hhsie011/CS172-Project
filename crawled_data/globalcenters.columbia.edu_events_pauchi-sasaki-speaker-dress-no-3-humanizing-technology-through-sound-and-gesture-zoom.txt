The Speaker Dress (SD) is an interdisciplinary project that combines disciplines such as coding, sound art, music, fashion, dance, and visual arts. This artistic research reflects on the relationship between human creativity/expressivity and technology, and the influence they have on each other. Technology is approached as an extension of human gesture, and not as a self-contained source of meaning. In this sense, the SD aims to find new narratives, questioning the relationship between performer and music-making. Instead of using electronic devices as an external interface to generate sound, the SD turns the performer into an instrument. In the lecture, the timeline of the project and the creative process of SD no.3 will be exposed. This process includes a study on metal in female fashion, the creation of a functional notation that integrates musical and movement/dance notation with technical cues, the conceptual foundation of this third installment of the project, as well as the inspirations for the design of a new operatic performance that will home the SD no.3. Pauchi Sasaki is a composer, performer, and improviser who recreates intimate subjective landscapes through electro-acoustic sonorities, influenced by improvisational aesthetics and ethnic musical traditions. Her interdisciplinary approach integrates musical composition with the design of multimedia performances, the application of new technologies, and the development of self-designed instruments. Her film scores appear in more than thirty feature and short films. She has received three "Best Original Score" international awards, the Ibermúsicas Latin American grant for sound composition with new technologies at CMMAS, The Rolex Mentor and Protégé Arts Initiative selected by composer Philip Glass, and the Goethe-Institute’s artist residency in Brazil and Berlin. Her work has been presented at the Tokyo Experimental Festival, Lincoln Center's Mostly Mozart Festival, The Kitchen, Carnegie Hall, Walt Disney Hall, the MET, the Venice Biennale, the Gran Teatro Nacional del Perú, among other venues.
