Reporting All Criminal Incidents We encourage all students, employees, and guests to report criminal incidents, accidents, and other emergencies promptly to the Department of Public Safety's Operations Centers at the Morningside Campus or the Medical Center. Incidents may be reported by telephone at the above listed numbers, or in person at either campus' Public Safety office. Incidents can also be reported directly to any uniformed Public Safety Officer. Reporting a Bias (Hate) Crime or Incident of Bias An individual who believes that he or she may have been the victim of a hate crime or may have witnessed a hate crime, should contact the Department of Public Safety immediately. When Public Safety receives a report of a hate crime, an investigator will interview witnesses, collect evidence, and make any and all notifications. Depending on the seriousness of the matter, the Department of Public Safety may refer the matter immediately to the New York City Police Department, may conduct an investigation, or may refer the matter to the appropriate dean or supervisor for Dean's Discipline or other action. There are times when an individual may believe that he or she has been the victim of or witnessed an act of bias, but there has been no apparent crime committed. In those incidents, victims or witnesses may contact the Department of Public Safety, the University's Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action, or the University's Ombuds Office. Please see the link below for the full University Policy and a list of available resources.
