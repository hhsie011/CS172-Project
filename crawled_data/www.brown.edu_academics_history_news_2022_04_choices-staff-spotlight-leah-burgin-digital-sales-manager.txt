I believe that K-12 social studies curriculum plays a pivotal role in students' development as the next generation of decision makers and I'm thrilled to be a part of that important work. About Leah's position: The Digital Sales Manager is a new position at Choices, and my main focus will be on supporting and growing the Digital Editions platform. I'll work closely with teachers who already use the platform, as well as teachers who are thinking about a subscription. Working with the Choices team, I'll build behind-the-scenes systems and resources for sales, troubleshooting, and other aspects of Digital Editions." Welcome, Leah!
