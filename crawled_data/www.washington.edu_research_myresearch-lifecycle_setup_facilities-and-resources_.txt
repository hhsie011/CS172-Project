In some cases the research teams may need to identify alternative resources or request re-budgeting to allow for contracting or procurement needed to complete the research. Teams should also be aware of sponsor requirements imposed on procurement of equipment, supplies and services. Roles Principal Investigators are responsible for identifying and securing the facilities and resources needed to conduct their research programs and projects. Department research administrators can assist researchers and their teams by maintaining records of requirements and training status for use of shared facilities, as well as names of contacts for engaging other available resources. The University is responsible for ensuring compliance with sponsor requirements as well as state and federal laws governing procurement. Plan/Act Be aware of approvals or training that will be required to use a facility or resource committed to your project or program. Research materials that require specialized training should be identified by the Setup stage to ensure training can be completed in a timely manner. Coordinate with the relevant regulatory offices for questions regarding training and use of specialized space, equipment, and supplies. Work with your department research administrator when submitting unique procurement requests that may require sole or single source justification. Space There may be outstanding approvals or training required for spaces needed to conduct the proposed research. Now is a good time to revisit space-specific requirements, including personnel assigned to the project and their eligibility to use the facility or equipment. Equipment Some projects may require procurement of equipment in the Setup stage, particularly those in which the equipment cost was included in the approved budget. Prevent delays when it’s time to make purchases by identifying and taking the steps to meet sponsor requirements as well as University and department policies related to procurement and associated documentation. Supplies The procurement of certain supplies may require approved protocols or trainings, particularly if reagents used may be radioactive or pose some other risk or danger. Anticipate what the supply needs will be for a project throughout the budget period, there may be sponsor requirements that restrict timing of expenditures. Services If any services will be needed to conduct the research that weren’t identified in the Plan/Propose stage, researchers and their teams will want to identify and initiate agreements early in the Setup stage to prevent delays in achieving their proposed scientific aims. This can be particularly important in cases of sequence dependency, or if sponsor approval is required. Personnel There may be training, budgetary, and commitment considerations and requirements for personnel working on a specific project or program that should be reviewed in the Setup stage. Depending on their role in the project, individuals may have different compliance and administrative obligations. This may include ensuring effort review and certifications are meeting university and federal standards. Travel Travel approvals vary by sponsor and location. Principal Investigators and their team must be aware of approvals required for travel. International travel often requires additional review prior to purchase. It is recommended the research team prepare budgets and plan to route requests for these approvals as early as possible. Other Resources Securing other resources in the Setup stage may require a variety of tasks and engagements. In cases where the research will rely on a shared university service or facility, the Setup stage is the time to confirm individuals conducting the research will have sufficient training and access. It may benefit the research team to identify and document key contacts as well as training and access requirements.
