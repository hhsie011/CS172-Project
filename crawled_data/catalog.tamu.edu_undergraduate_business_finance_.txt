Sinn '00 Department of Finance Overview Faculty Majors Certificates Courses The Adam C. Sinn '00 Department of Finance at Mays Business School is one of the country's top finance departments. The department's goal is to provide students with the theoretical and empirical tools necessary to achieve high levels of expertise in all areas of finance. The business enterprise must raise capital, use it to maximum advantage, and reward investors. Finance is the set of management challenges (and career opportunities) concerned with succeeding at these tasks. The department offers a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) in Finance. The finance (FINC) major involves both required and elective courses in three areas. Corporate Finance encompasses the tools and techniques for valuing productive assets, choosing ways of funding them, and gauging financial success. This area focuses on how corporations determine funding sources, capital structure, and investment decisions. Investments encompasses the theoretical and practical models that help assess risks and rewards of stocks, bonds, derivatives, and other “financial assets” (individually and in portfolios), as well as the financial health of firms and institutions offering them to the investing public. Markets and Institutions explores the ways in which bankers, brokers, and other financial institutions convert savings into productive capital. Mays Business School BBA-FINC graduates with good academic records place well in all the above career areas, as well as in graduate and professional schools. Firms in a variety of industries, along with major financial firms such as commercial and investment banking, brokerage, wealth management and consulting, seek finance graduates. Accordingly, the Adam C. Sinn '00 Department of Finance emphasizes scholarship in its faculty, professionalism in its programs, and innovation in its relationships with employers and mentors. The department offers seven certificate programs for BBA business majors. Each program is designed to complement the student’s degree by providing a concentrated course of study and participation in experiential learning opportunities or internships in the selected area.
