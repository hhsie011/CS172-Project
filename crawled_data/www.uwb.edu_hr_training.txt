For more information, please read the Administrative Policy Statement and Minors at the UW. Free Training Resources These guidelines govern work-from-home policies/procedures for Classified Staff when campus is officially closed due to suspended operations. Please note that the working from home option does not apply to classified staff who have been notified that their positions are considered "essential". Essential staff must report to work during suspended operations, and do not have the option of making up time. All work from home requires supervisor approval. Please talk with your supervisor in advance regarding the types of projects that are appropriate. See activities below that have been approved for all employees for suspended operations days. Working from home is optional. Time can still be made up or leave can be taken during suspended operations. If you choose to work from home, there is no guarantee that enough work will be available to account for all closure time, so some make-up time or leave may need to be used to supplement. Work from home on the day of closure and any make-up time during the week of closure are calculated at straight time. Reporting work from home-time: Email your supervisor with the number of hours and a brief summary of what you worked on from home once you return to work. If you worked from home on a closure day, this should be noted on your timesheet.
