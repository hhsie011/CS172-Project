Each institute receives funding from the Division of Mathematical Sciences of the National Science Foundation (NSF). ICERM was launched in 2010 with a five-year $15.5-million grant from the NSF. In 2015, a $17.5M grant was awarded for an additional five years. Most recently, a $23.7M grant renewal to Brown University was announced in July 2020. Research at ICERM focuses on topics of critical and emerging mathematical and societal importance, with a particular emphasis on the interplay between mathematics and computational experimentation, visualization and simulation. The research at the institute is collaborative in nature and takes place in the context of two semester-long programs together with several associated workshops. Other scientific activities include international conferences, a summer undergraduate research program, and special events targeting under-represented groups in the mathematical sciences. Each year ICERM hosts nearly 1,000 scholars and researchers from all over the world who work together for periods ranging from several weeks to several months. Acknowledging the NSF As per NSF requirements, we ask that all program participants properly acknowledge the support they received from ICERM in any publication involving work that was done while in residence at the institute. We also request that members provide ICERM with the bibliographical reference for these publications. Following is a suggested guideline for the wording of the acknowledgment: This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. DMS-1929284 while the author was in residence at the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics in Providence, RI, during the [insert name of program here] program.
