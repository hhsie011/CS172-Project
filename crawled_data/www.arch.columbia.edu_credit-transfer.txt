Transfer credit may apply to advanced standing or waivers. Master of Architecture There are two ways that a student may receive advanced standing in the M.Arch. Program: (1) Advanced placement into the second year of the MArch program A student who is admitted into the second year of the M.Arch. Program may receive advanced standing for the first-year courses including the two design studios (potentially 36 points) M.Arch applicants who have completed, or are about to complete, an undergraduate degree in a non-professional program in architecture may apply for advanced standing into the second year class. Advanced placement is determined after a complete review of the applicant’s portfolio, transcripts, and relevant course syllabi by the admissions committee. Applicants who are granted advanced placement must have undergraduate courses that are roughly analogous to the course of study of the first year of the graduate program, demonstrating high achievement in design. Advanced standing applicants may be eligible to receive up to 36 credits counted toward their degree, allowing a student to complete the degree in as few as two years. Accepted students who affirmed in their application that they wish to be evaluated for advancement into the third semester will be notified of advanced standing status in their letters of admission (2) Advanced standing or waivers in individual required MArch courses A student admitted into the first year with an undergraduate degree in architecture may receive credit for some courses; credit will be evaluated on an individual basis (maximum 9 points). MArch students may receive up to 9 pts of advanced standing or waivers in technology and history classes. MArch students who have successfully completed comparable courses (grade B or above) at another university may apply for advanced standing or course waivers. Waived courses must be replaced by another 3 pt course in the same distribution. Completed applications must be supported by a syllabus, transcript, and either a set of course tests or complete course notes. Forms should be submitted during the add/drop period of the semester (during first two weeks of classes). Once granted, advanced standing will appear as a note on a student’s transcript, but only after an MArch student has completed their first year (both fall and spring semesters.) Advanced standing will never appear in SSOL. To apply for advanced standing or course waiver, complete the form: https://apply.gsapp.columbia.edu/register/course-waiver-request For Building/Technology classes; please submit materials to the Director of the Architecture Technology Sequence, Lola Ben-Alon, rlb2211@columbia.edu For History/Theory classes; please submit materials to the Director of the History Theory Sequence, Reinhold Martin, rm454@columbia.edu M.S. Advanced Architectural Design / M.S. Architecture and Urban Design The GSAPP does not accept advanced standing in the M.S. AAD or M.S. AUD programs. M.S. Real Estate Development Students may petition for waivers in Construction Technology and Management (Term II - 3pts) and Real Estate Law (Term III - 3pts). Waived courses must be replaced by one 3pt course or two 1.5pts courses. Advanced standing and waivers are granted upon enrollment into the program. M.S. Urban Planning / M.S. Historic Preservation The GSAPP does not grant advanced standing in the M.S. UP and M.S. HP Programs. Students who have completed relevant coursework corresponding to required coursework within a program, may petition for a waiver. All waivers must be approved by the course instructor as well as the Program Manager and Program Director. No requests for waivers will be considered without official copies of relevant transcripts and syllabi. Waiver or advanced standing is not possible for elective courses within the Programs. Waivers granted to M.S. HP students for prior work in American Architecture must be replaced by an architectural history course within the GSAPP. Other relevant coursework corresponding to required core courses completed at other institutions must be replaced by a course within the same distribution area (preservation planning, design, history/theory, or architectural conserva. Waivers are reviewed on a case by case basis with the faculty and administration of the M.S. HP program in order to ensure that all students gain balanced foundational knowledge of conservation, planning, design and history/theory. Waivers may be granted to M.S. UP students for required core courses where relevant coursework was successfully completed at another institution. Waivers from any required course will be reviewed on a case by case basis by the instructor, Program Manager, and the Program Director. Students enrolled in the M.S. HP and M.S. UP programs must complete a studio during their first year and a thesis in their second year. For this reason, the GSAPP requires that all M.S. HP and M.S. UP degree candidates complete the program in 4 semesters, with a minimum of 15 pts per semester.
