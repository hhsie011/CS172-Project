Skip to main content Contact Us Admissions Early Outreach Innovative Programs for Exceptional Students We are pleased to announce a shift in early outreach programming conducted by the Office for Precollegiate Programs for Talented and Gifted (OPPTAG). OPPTAG instructors and supporters have positively impacted generations of youth. At the same time, we recognize the needs of talented and gifted youth have changed, creating demands for precollegiate programming that reach a wide audience in every corner of the state. With this in mind, we have made the decision to retire our OPPTAG summer programs – including Adventures, Discoveries, and Explorations. This includes the 2020 summer camps. The Investigation Series Fall Conference will also end. Iowa State University is an exceptional choice for high-achieving and motivated students, and we remain committed to early outreach. Academic enrichment opportunities, including curricula supporting innovation and entrepreneurship, continue to be encouraged by the entire campus community, both on and off campus. Moving forward, we will be partnering with ISU Extension and Outreach to reach a wider group of youth across the state of Iowa. The months ahead will allow us the time to develop new and exciting program initiatives; updates on our progress will be posted on this page.
