We believe entrepreneurial principles are very much in keeping with the goals of every aspect of higher education—after all, being a “first mover” in any endeavor starts with a dedication to discovery and transformation. In this spirit, we’ll empower all members of our community to launch solutions early, evaluate results critically, and make improvements continuously. Above all, we want this rapid innovation cycle to be flexible and collaborative, and to reflect profound empathy for the end user—which we define as humanity itself.
