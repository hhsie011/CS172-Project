Students who wish to obtain credit for thesis related research work in the fall should enroll in PHYS1980 (an override code from the advisor will be needed). Senior theses are due to be handed into the Department Honors Coordinator and the Senior Thesis Advisor 10 days before the beginning of reading period in a student’s final semester. The final version of a student’s thesis is due no later than midnight on the last day of reading period. Students wishing to be considered for honors must give a Senior thesis presentation no later than the last day of reading period. These presentations typically last a half hour comprised of a 20-minute talk and 10-minute question and discussion period.
