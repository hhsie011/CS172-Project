Research Statement Thumb carpometacarpal (CMC) osteoarthritis (OA) is a widespread, disabling disease of undetermined etiology that is far more prevalent in woman than in men. The disease affects 15% of adults over age 30, and two-thirds of women over the age of 55. Loss of thumb function alone imparts a 40%-50% impairment to the upper extremity due to its central role in nearly all grasp and handling tasks. Although recent studies suggest genetics, increased BMI and environmental factors (such as hand use) are likely associated with the development of thumb CMC OA, there is strong empirical and experimental data indicating that altered biomechanics plays a central role in the disease, and, importantly in its treatment. CMC OA is far more prevalent in women than men, and women have flatter joint surfaces, smaller areas of cartilage contact, and higher contact pressures. The interpretation of this is that the CMC joints in women are less biomechanically stable than those in men, and consequently at increased risk for altered joint loading and the onset and/or progression of OA. At this point, however, there are no published studies of CMC joint biomechanics in normal or OA-affected individuals, nor are there any longitudinal studies of joint biomechanics as the disease progresses. We hypothesize CMC joint laxity differs with age and gender, and that joint laxity will predict OA progression in symptomatic, early-stage patients, where CMC joint laxity is defined as articular kinematics that are abnormal in direction and/or magnitude. This study is designed to generate foundational data on thumb CMC biomechanics in vivo by quantifying and comparing the differences in CMC biomechanics in older women (n = 11, age 45-75 yrs.) and younger women (n = 11, age 18-25 yrs.), and between women and men (n = 11, age 18  25 yrs; and n = 11, age 45-75 yrs.) using a cross-sectional experimental design (Aim 1), and, using a longitudinal experimental design, to determine if CMC joint laxity is positively associated with CMC OA progression 1.5 and 3 years after initial diagnosis in patients (N = 80; 45-75 yrs.) who initially present with CMC pain and minimal radiographic evidence of OA (Eaton I/II) (Aim 2). Aim 1 will provide the first in vivo data to date on 3-D biomechanics of the CMC joint during functional tasks, which should provide insight into the role of biomechanics in the disease, and reasons for the high prevalence of OA in women as compared to men. Aim 2 will provide the first quantitative assessment of the biomechanical changes that occur in the CMC joint during early OA progression in this population and will provide the foundation for future studies designed to evaluate the mechanistic relationship between altered joint biomechanics and cartilage degradation. Together, these studies will provide data for the rational design of surgical procedures designed to restore, reproduce, or replace the structural anatomy of the complex CMC joint, as well as baseline data for future randomized control trials and risk factor studies. Preclinical development and evaluation of an instrumented replacement trapezium (iTrapz) capable of measuring joint contact loads at the base of the thumb, establishing the rigor for a future clinical trial in trapezial arthroplasty. The numerous surgical treatments for late-stage osteoarthritis (OA) of the thumb carpometacarpal (CMC) – or trapeziometacarpal (TMC) – joint, are highly varied and suboptimal. TMC OA is a degenerative disease that results in significant impairment due to pain and loss of function. The prevalence of TMC OA is at least 20-25% in those over 50, and it increases into the eighth decade when as many as 80% have evidence of disease. High forces in the trapeziometacarpal joint are believed to influence OA development and treatment success. However, our understanding of joint loads developed in the hand is limited to predictions from mathematical models that have yet to be validated by in vivo measurements. Custom implants instrumented to measure joint contact loads have been developed for the hip, knee, and spine. Data from these implants has provided critical insight into joint function, with the tangible direct benefits of validating and improving musculoskeletal models and providing important information for implant designers and manufacturers. Instrumented implants also have the potential to provide highly novel biofeedback to patients to guide rehabilitation. Building on our extensive and rigorous in vivo studies of TMC morphology and kinematics, and the records of success in other instrumented joints, we propose to develop and validate a preclinical instrumented trapezium implant, which we refer to as the iTrapz. In our first aim we will design, fabricate and validate a proof-of-concept wired iTrapz. In Aim 2 we will validate the wired iTrapz in a cadaver model using a robotic musculoskeletal simulator. Once we complete these aims we will have a highly innovative load sensor suitable for cadaver studies. Given the need for more rigorous studies of thumb arthroplasties, this accomplishment alone will have a significant impact. In Aim 3 we will develop a first-prototype inductively powered and telemeterized iTrapz implant. In Aim 3 we will also begin planning for in vivo implementation in a clinical study. Upon completion of Aim 3 we will have demonstrated that measuring in vivo thumb loads during the activities of daily living is feasible, and we will have developed the necessary knowledge, skills and technologies to support the fabrication of a hermetically sealed implant suitable for clinical implementation. This project is significant in that it will benefit several constituencies: clinicians will benefit from the knowledge of the loads associated with disease, injury, surgery and repair; the modeling and research communities will benefit directly from measurements of joint loads during activities of daily living, which are unknown in the hand; and engineers and manufacturers will benefit from critically-needed performance data. Motion-Specific Toy Controllers for Upper Extremity Rehabilitation in Children Cerebral palsy (CP) is a neuromotor impairment comprised of a group of non-progressive clinical syndromes of children that are characterized by motor dysfunction and affects approximately one out of every 500 children. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, braces, orthotics, electrical stimulation, medications and surgery are the current major forms of treatment used to improve strength and joint range of motion, prevent contractures and increase function for hemiplegic cerebral palsy. Recent studies using constraint induced movement therapy and robotic therapy suggest that increased skilled use of disabled muscles may promote functional restoration. A challenge with constraint induced movement therapy is that this intensive therapeutic intervention requires casting a child's "good" limb. Robotic therapy is restricted in its use to institutional settings. The research described in this proposal will develop and evaluate a play controller that encourages the use of affected muscles in order to facilitate functional recovery beyond what can be achieved by currently available therapies. Our approach capitalizes upon a primary learning avenue for children - play. The premise of this proposal is that toy and computer game play will encourage extended use of the impaired limb. Our first specific aim is to optimize and validate the design of a therapeutic play controller for remote controlled (RC) toys and for computer games by comparison with standard optical motion capture measures. Our design requirements include: remote control of commercially available toys and computer games, sensing of targeted relative joint motion, configurable range and gain setting for sensed joint motion, and data recording of joint motion during play. Our second specific aim is to demonstrate the efficacy and usability of the Play Controller using two platforms (RC toys and computer games). This aim will be accomplished in a controlled clinic setting and in a 1-week home pilot study. Joint motion and play measures will be collected during the sessions and analyzed to demonstrate efficacy and usability. Our third specific aim is to acquire validated clinical and quality of life measures of the Play Controller to power our clinical trials. In addition to our clinical outcome measures of hand function, strength, spasticity and tone, we will include quality of life (QOL) measures assessing physical impact and psychosocial functioning. Building upon established therapies while addressing the limitations of their cost, accessibility, and motivation, the significance of our approach is the need for extended neuromuscular therapy in children with impairments. The potential benefits of the technologies developed within this project are translatable to patients of any age and a wide range of extremity neuromotor impairments. This R21 proposal is highly innovative in its approach to develop a play-motivated therapeutic device that incorporates targeted joint motion, massed-practice therapy, activity logging, existing toys and computer games, and cost-effectiveness.
