As a rising second-year student, Eisenback came to the Brandeis School of Law with a background as a union steward for a manufacturing company. He came to law school to pursue a career that will allow him to continue advocating for workers' rights. "I want to be a lawyer that represents the people that I find most relatable. I have worked since I was 15 years old in a variety of different industries, so I find that employees are most relatable to me," he says. "I would like to advocate for them when their rights as workers are being infringed upon." Eisenback will have the chance to see labor law firsthand this summer. He was selected by the Peggy Browning Fund — a national organization dedicated to educating law students about workplace justice — to serve as one of its student fellows. He will be working with the Industrial Division of the Communications Workers of America (IUE-CWA) in Dayton, Ohio. "The IUE-CWA is a labor union representing workers in a variety of industries, mostly in manufacturing. The Division represents workers at several major employers, including General Electric and Northrop Grumman," states the Peggy Browning Fund. "On any given day, I could be asked to file charges with the NLRB, to interview a client or a union member on a possible grievance or to write a legal memo on ADA issues, NLRA, Title VII or FMLA," Eisenback says. "Whatever the task is, I will be very excited to learn everything that I possibly can."
