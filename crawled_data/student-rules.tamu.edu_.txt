Home Aggie Code of Honor Rules Part I: Academic Rules (Rules 1 – 22 & 61) Part II: Student Life Rules (Rules 23 – 44) Part III: Student Grievance Procedures (Rules 45 – 60) Appendixes Students’ Rights Recent Rule Changes Review Committee Minutes Foreword Texas A&M University is a community that is dedicated to personal and academic excellence. Choosing to join the community obligates each member to a code of civilized behavior. The purpose of this handbook is to present the rules that govern student conduct and student activities at Texas A&M University and that describe faculty and staff obligations in their work with students. These rules result from years of experience and are the products of student, staff, and faculty thought. Each individual student, faculty member, and staff employee is expected to read this handbook carefully and observe its requirements. Particular attention should be given to the Aggie Code of Honor, the University Statement on Harassment and Discrimination and the Students’ Rights and Responsibilities. No rule, no matter how carefully worded, can cover all eventualities completely. Beyond specific rules, we should all aspire to conduct ourselves with respect for others, the highest ethical standards, and personal integrity. That is what the Aggie Spirit is all about. About Student Rules Each student has the responsibility to be fully acquainted with and to comply with the Texas A&M University Student Rules. More specific rules, information, and procedures may be found in various publications pertaining to each particular service or department. When available, links have been provided to the appropriate websites. The Texas A&M University Student Rules are broken down into three sections, with additional information provided in the appendixes: Part I: Academic Rules (Rules 1 – 22 & 61) Part II: Student Life Rules (Rules 23 – 44) Part III: Student Grievance Procedures (Rules 45 – 60) Appendices Other TAMU Rule & Policy Resources: Aggie Honor System Office: http://aggiehonor.tamu.edu Office of Risk, Ethics and Compliance: http://rules-saps.tamu.edu Residence Life & University Apartments Handbooks: http://reslife.tamu.edu/livingOnCampus/rules Texas A&M University System Policy and Regulation Library: https://www.tamus.edu/legal/policy/policy-and-regulation-library/ The Standard of the Corps of Cadets: https: https://corps.tamu.edu/corps-of-cadets-policies/ Texas A&M Gameday & Tailgating Rules: http://tailgating.tamu.edu/ For Campuses Outside of Brazos County Please find your campus point of contact for the student rules at https://committees.tamu.edu/committees/index/index/id/138.
