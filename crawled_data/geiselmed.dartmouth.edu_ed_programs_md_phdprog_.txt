The profession of medicine has entered an especially challenging and exciting period as the health care system undergoes revolutionary changes in its organization and focus. In addition, we are experiencing an explosion of new knowledge in the basic sciences. There is, therefore, an increased need for leaders who can use powerful, newly developed technical and conceptual tools to diagnose, treat, and prevent illness. One of the most effective ways to provide leadership on these issues and to advance our knowledge of health care and the human condition is through an educational program such as the MD-PhD Program. The training provided to the MD-PhD student is unique as it provides for developing basic science analytical skills coupled with the acquisition of highly diagnostic clinical skills. The MD-PhD program at Dartmouth combines systematic and rigorous research preparation for the PhD degree with the full MD curriculum. The program at the Geisel School of Medicine offers opportunities that are both challenging and rewarding for students who are committed and motivated. Dartmouth financially and academically provides the support and guidance needed by students pursing the MD-PhD degrees. For more information on this program, visit the MD-PhD website or call (603) 653-9958.
