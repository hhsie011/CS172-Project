He received a B.S. in Engineering from Harvey Mudd College, a Ph.D. in Bioengineering from Rice University, and post-doctoral training at Duke University. As a member of the Center for Biomedical Engineering, the goal of Professor Darling's research is to understand the relationship between the biological function of cells and tissues and their micro/nano-scale mechanical properties, with special focus on stem cells. Professor Darling's long-term objective is to use quantitative assessment of the mechanical and biological characteristics of heterogeneous cell populations to improve tissue regeneration and cell-based therapies.

Full Text PubMed Research Research Statement The Darling Lab conducts research in cell mechanics, mesenchymal stem cells, and musculoskeletal tissue regeneration. Its primary focus is to understand cellular heterogeneity and its effects on both fundamental phenomena and translational applications. Central to this pursuit is the identification of novel biological and mechanical markers for isolating high-value cell populations. Specific capabilities in his group include characterizing the mechanophenotype of living cells and tissues, enriching heterogeneous samples via intracellular gene and protein expression, and generating cell mimicking microparticles for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Core capabilities include micro/nano-scale mechanical testing and imaging with atomic force microscopy (AFM), standard cell culture and tissue engineering techniques, and traditional molecular and biochemical assays. We are also developing novel tools and methodologies for the identification of cellular subpopulations. Our long-term goals are to improve the quality and consistency of stem cell sources such that any downstream application produces better results. General areas of interest to the lab include: 1. Innovative techniques for evaluating the mechanical characteristics of cells and tissues. 2. Stem cell enrichment for improving tissue regeneration approaches. 3. Development of molecular tools to study and identify function-specific biomarkers. 4. Technique innovation for the analysis of cellular subpopulations.
