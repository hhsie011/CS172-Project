The formation of the Department was the culmination of fifteen years of growth in Biostatistics at Brown, beginning with the founding of the Center for Statistical Sciences (CSS) in 1995 as a unit of the Brown Medical School. Over the years, CSS developed a robust research enterprise and provided the academic strength and infrastructure for the growth of the Biostatistics faculty and the launching of degree programs in Biostatistics in 1999 (PhD) and 2007 (ScM, AM). The Undergraduate Statistics Concentration was also formed in 1997, with the Center's leadership. In 2006, the Biostatistics Section of the Department of Community Health was formed as a transitional organization for the Biostatistics faculty in the process of laying the foundations for the establishment of the Department. Mission The mission of the Department of Biostatistics at Brown is to conduct fundamental research that generates new discoveries in theory and methods of statistics and data science; to provide expertise and leadership and to promote interdisciplinary research in domain areas related to human health and the life sciences; to develop future researchers and professionals in the field of biostatistics through a graduate program that combines rigorous training in theory and methods with meaningful engagement in interdisciplinary research; to provide high quality courses and mentoring in biostatistics and data science for the broader community of students and researchers at Brown; and to serve the academic community at Brown and the scientific community at large by providing intellectual and organizational leadership and collaboration on programs in the statistical and data sciences. Our Partners The Department of Biostatistics faculty and staff collaborate throughout Brown University, the School of Public Health and public health institutions throughout the State and country, establishing relationships with a wide variety of partners. The work in which we engage allows for the collection and in-depth analysis of large-scale data and translates usable outcome data through state-of-the-art methodologies and algorithms. These partnerships engage multi-disciplined expertise focused on specific public health issues.
