The recommended format for URL naming is as follows: unit-name/policy-name Example: Policy Owner: Policy Office Policy Title: University Policy Program New URL: policy-office/university-policy-program You will always use the same Policy Owner prefix for your policies, and the only thing you will need to customize is what you will use for the policy title. We recommend using the most concise version of the policy name possible, excluding words such as ‘of, ’ ‘the,’ ‘a,’ etc., and separating words with dashes.
