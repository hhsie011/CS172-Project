Students wishing to pursue a modified major in WGSS must submit a written proposal that will be reviewed by the WGSS Faculty Steering Committee; approval by the chair or other appropriate faculty member in the secondary discipline is also required. In addition to major cards, Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies requires majors to complete the Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Modified Major Worksheet. Class of 2016 and later: Please carefully review the Office of the Registrar's guide on how to create and submit a Modified Major Plan in DartWorks before beginning the process. About the Modified Major The modified major in Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies combines gender-related interdisciplinary coursework taken under the auspices of the Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Program with courses that are specific to a given discipline. Students will design a coherent program of study as they combine their interest in gender studies with knowledge and skills provided by their secondary interest. The courses in the secondary discipline should not be WGSS cross-listed or associated courses; they should instead be courses necessary for students to gain proficiency in their chosen secondary discipline, i.e., courses that count for the major or minor in that discipline. Requirements Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies (7 courses: 4 Core + 3 Electives) WGSS 10: Sex, Gender, and Society WGSS 15: Roots of Feminism WGSS 16: Contemporary Issues in Feminism WGSS 80: Senior Seminar Three additional upper-level courses from the WGSS course offerings. One of these courses may be an associated course. Secondary Discipline (4 courses from a single discipline) Four upper-level courses that count towards the Major/Minor in that discipline. Modified Major Worksheet Modifying Another Major with Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies When Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies becomes the secondary part of a modified major, five courses are required: WGSS 10 (prerequisite) and four additional courses selected from the Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies offerings. Only two of these courses can be associated courses. A modified major should be planned to form a coherent program of study with the major. Students must file a written statement with each department and the Registrar explaining the rationale for the courses selected for the modified major. Class of 2016 and later: Please carefully review the Office of the Registrar's guide on how to create and submit a Modified Major Plan in Degreeworks before beginning the process.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Program in Women's, Gender, &amp; Sexuality Studies Undergraduate Overview Major Modified Major Minor Honors Program Honors Thesis Guidelines Past Honors Theses Courses Previous Terms Associated Courses Independent Study Transfer Credit Alumni Stories Tell Us Your News Research Overview Gender Research Institute at Dartmouth Resources News & Events News & Events Annual Stonewall Lecture Past Lecture Series People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
