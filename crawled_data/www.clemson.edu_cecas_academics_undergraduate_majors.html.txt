Visit Campus Transfer/Dual-Education FAQ & Resources Related Links Undergraduate Experiences Global Engagement Learning Opportunities Committed to Excellence Advanced Scholarship The College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences (CECAS) offers a broad range of rigorous and rewarding baccalaureate programs which provide exceptional academic opportunities. Combining engineering and science disciplines facilitates study and research in fields transcending traditional areas. Students enjoy close interaction with distinguished faculty committed to undergraduate education and research excellence. ABET, an independent organization that ensures programs meet quality standards, has accredited our engineering and computer science programs. ABET Accreditation Bioengineering B.S. The goal of bioengineering is the same as it has been for generations: create integrated, innovative technology to improve human health. The ways to reach that goal, on the other hand, are as varied as ever. Clemson’s Department of Bioengineering tackles tough issues through research and hands-on experiences. BIOE Overview Biosystems Engineering B.S. Biosystems Engineering is a field dedicated to studying the footprints our ideas may leave on the earth and determining the best ways to prevent permanent harm. At Clemson, you’ll learn the fundamentals of engineering science and biological applications through hands-on, team-based experiential learning activities. BioSys Overview Chemical Engineering B.S. Based on the sciences of chemistry, biology, physics, and mathematics, chemical engineering is at the forefront of environmental pollution prevention and remediation and is also leading the way in medical and health-related research. Clemson’s program offers increased interaction between students and faculty. ChemE Overview Civil Engineering B.S. Civil engineers plan, design, construct, maintain and operate facilities and systems that control and improve the environment for modern civilizations. At Clemson, our civil engineering program utilizes hands-on lab experiences, strong student/faculty relationships, and a curriculum that works toward your goals. CE Overview Computer Engineering B.S. The Computer Engineering program provides in-depth education and hands-on experience with computers of all sizes. Students learn to solve real-world problems on hardware and computer architecture, software, and systems through a versatile array of technical electives that include communication and intelligent systems. CompE Overview Computer Science B.S./B.A. The School of Computing offers three undergraduate options, each starting with a common core curriculum. For Computer Science, choose how technical (B.S.) or interdisciplinary (B.A.) you want for your degree. Computer Information Systems is for those interested in applying computing solutions to problems in business or entrepreneurial environments. CompSci Overview Electrical Engineering B.S. The Electrical Engineering program encompasses circuits, computer engineering, electromagnetic fields, electronics, controls, signal analysis, power systems, and communications. Technical electives during senior year allow students to select specialties. ElectricalE Overview Environmental Engineering B.S. Environmental engineers are on the frontlines of world issues. Clemson University has the first ABET-accredited undergraduate degree program in South Carolina for environmental engineering and offers a core curriculum that emphasizes areas including wastewater treatment, air pollution control, sustainability, and risk assessment. EnvironmentalE Overview Geology B.S. The B.S. degree in Geology offers students a flexible program of study that emphasizes hands-on experience in classrooms, laboratories, and fieldwork. Optional concentration areas in hydrogeology and environmental science are offered for students interested in those specific career paths. Geology Overview Industrial Engineering B.S. Clemson’s Industrial Engineering program focuses on several major research and teaching emphasis areas that involve optimization, supply chain design, quality control, user-centered design, and ergonomics. Your capstone class allows you to apply everything you’ve learned to a project for an off-campus client such as Caterpillar, 3M, or Milliken. IE Overview Materials Science & Engineering B.S. Materials Science & Engineering is a vast, interdisciplinary field based around the creation of materials that will change and define how we go about our everyday tasks. The program establishes in students a broad foundation in the science and engineering of materials and hands-on work with particles, thin films, and bulk materials. MSE Overview Mechanical Engineering B.S. Mechanical Engineering students prepare for a career in engineering and for lifelong learning through a balanced B.S. program that includes working in teams and individually. Curriculum covers fundamental engineering sciences as well as the arts and humanities to develop a deeper understanding of today’s complex modern society.
