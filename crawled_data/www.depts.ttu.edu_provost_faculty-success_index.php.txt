Faculty success begins at the point of hire and initial appointment and continues through the faculty member's career. Faculty success is a continuing effort and ongoing outcome of the individual faculty member, the faculty member's colleagues, unit leaders, college administrators, and university administrators. We hope through this website to provide you with up-to-date information about resources and areas of support available to you as you continue your success as a faculty member or strive to facilitate faculty success as a faculty administrator.
