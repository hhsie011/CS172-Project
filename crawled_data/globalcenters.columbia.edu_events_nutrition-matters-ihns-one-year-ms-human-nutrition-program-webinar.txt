On July 11, join Dr. Sharon Akabas, MS Program Director, for a webinar presentation and discover the intersections between nutrition and health, as well as how you can make a difference. About the program The Masters in Human Nutrition prepares students for advanced training or positions in healthcare, academia, and industry, in the United States and abroad. The IHN has a robust professional development and career guidance component to help students explore numerous academic and career options. In addition to acquiring a broad and deep training in nutrition science, students end the year as stronger critical thinkers, better writers, and more confident public speakers. All courses are designed to enhance nutrition knowledge and skills and are applicable to academic, research, and clinical settings. Besides the core courses, students may choose to focus on one of three tracks: basic nutrition science, clinical, or public health nutrition. The Masters in Human Nutrition is comprised of 33 credits and is completed in one year, including ten weeks of full time work (350 hours or more) in the summer. MS students must complete all required courses and electives with a grade average of B– or better, participate in at least one research project, and complete a written master's thesis summarizing the project results. The thesis must be approved by the sponsor of the project, the faculty adviser, and the director of the MS program. Though most students who enroll in the program plan to continue on to medical or dental school, the program serves as a foundation for those planning to continue on to PhD programs and those who will begin employment immediately upon graduation.
