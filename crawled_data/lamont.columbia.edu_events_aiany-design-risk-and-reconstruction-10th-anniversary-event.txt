Recognizing the need to address the increasing threats and vulnerabilities faced by communities across the globe, co-chairs Lance Jay Brown, FAIA, and Illya Azaroff, FAIA, founded DfRR in 2011. The AIA New York Board of Directors formally established DfRR on May 17, 2011 and sanctioned the committee name on June 21, 2011. The committee’s mission is to harness the design community’s expertise to address disaster mitigation and adaptation in response to major events such as major storms, extreme heat, climate change, sea-level rise, and terrorist attacks. This program will feature a lineup of speakers and committee members who have made significant commitments to DfRR over the years, highlighting the committee’s milestone initiatives, including the 2012-13 Post-Sandy Initiative, the 2015 Extreme Heat symposium, the 2017 Everything Water series, and 2021’s Fight or Flight? Rethinking the Urban Footprint series on managed retreat.
