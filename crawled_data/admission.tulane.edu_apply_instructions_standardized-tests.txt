Home / Apply / Instructions / Standardized Tests custom css-js - global Standardized Tests Submitting test scores for the SAT or ACT will be an optional — not required — part of the admission process for students applying this fall for a spot in Tulane University’s 2022 entering class. This is a one-year policy in response to the multiple test cancellations due to COVID-19 making it difficult for students to retake tests. Learn more about our temporary test optional policy. If you are still interested in submitting test scores with your application, please see our instructions below. Submitting Your Scores Tulane University is committed to access and affordability for all students. Applicants may self-report scores or submit scores via the testing agency. Self-reported test scores may be submitted (and updated) in the following ways: Entering scores in the testing section of the Common Application or Tulane Application Entering scores in your Green Wave Portal after submitting your application Self-reported scores should not be superscored or recalculated and should be reported exactly as received for each testing date. Tulane will calculate the superscore. Official test scores from the testing agency are required of students who are admitted and choose to enroll. Official scores are required within three weeks of submitting the enrollment deposit. Prospective athletes must send official score reports from the testing agency to Tulane upon applying. *Please note: Tulane reserves the right to revoke an offer of admission if an applicant's self-reported test scores do not align with those in the official score report. Tulane's ACT Code: 1614 Tulane's SAT Code: 6832 How Scores Are Reviewed It is our policy to consider the score from either exam that represents applicants in the most positive academic light; therefore, we do not have a preference for either standardized test over the other. We superscore the SAT, meaning that we will consider the highest section scores across all SAT score reports from all SAT test dates. When reporting scores on the application, students should report all scores from single test dates only and should not recalculate their own superscores. Tulane will calculate the superscore. We will only superscore SAT reports that are on the same numerical scale (see below section, "Redesigned SAT"). If you submit separate scores from both the 2400-scale SAT and from the redesigned SAT, we will only consider the highest overall score. We superscore the ACT, meaning that we will consider the highest section scores across all ACT score reports from all ACT test dates. When reporting scores on the application, students should report all scores from single test dates only and should not recalculate their own superscores. Tulane will calculate the superscore. We do not require scores for the written portion of either test. SAT Subject Tests are optional. If you choose to include those scores as part of your application, they will be considered.
