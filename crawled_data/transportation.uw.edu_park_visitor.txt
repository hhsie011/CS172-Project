What to know about Commencement parking. visitor-parking-page-inset-bnr-750x275.jpg Welcome to the University of Washington. If you are driving to campus, please allow at least 30 minutes to park and find your way to your destination. In many cases, it may be easier for you to arrive by bus or light rail. Visitors may need to stop at a gatehouse to purchase a permit before parking. Our parking specialists are happy to assign a parking lot for the day based on availability, your destination and any special needs. They can also help with campus maps, directions, accessible parking and building information. If you are familiar with the campus, you may want to use self-serve parking instead. Be aware that event rates may affect parking cost and availability. Parking permits are required Monday through Friday, 6 a.m. to 9 p.m., and Saturdays from 7 a.m. until noon.
