How I've Changed My time at HDS has seen my development as a scholar, minister, and person of faith. I am particularly grateful for those I have met here at HDS, friends and mentors, that I trust will be companions for years to come. Favorite Class or Professor My favorite courses are many: “The Trial and Death of Jesus” with Professors Giovanni Bazzana and Shaye Cohen,“Twentieth Century Jewish Theology" with Professor Jon Levenson, three courses on the Church and the Holocaust with Professor Kevin Madigan, “Jews and Gentiles" with Professor Daniel Boyarin, two courses in Jewish studies with Saul Zaritt, and six semesters of Yiddish language and literature with Dr. Sara Feldman. Message of Thanks I would like to express gratitude to my academic advisor, Professor Kevin Madigan, and my thesis advisor, Professor Michelle Sanchez. I am grateful to my mentors and peers in Harvard Yiddish Studies, particularly Professor Saul Zaritt and Dr. Sara Feldman. I am grateful for the support of spiritual communities at HDS and my friends and mentors at Emmanuel Church (Boston) and Central Reform Temple (Boston).
