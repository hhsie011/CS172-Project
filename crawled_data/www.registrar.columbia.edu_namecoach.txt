This user-friendly tool is available in Canvas for courses that have been selected for a pilot initiative. If your course is selected for the NameCoach pilot, you only need to record your name once. Once recorded, it will appear in any other courses selected for the pilot and of which you are a registered student or instructor. Below are instructions for recording your name, listening to the recorded names of other students, and, for instructors, sending a reminder to students to make their recordings. Record Your Name 1. Open a Chrome web browser. (Note: Safari will not work for NameCoach recording.) If you don't have Chrome installed on your Mac or PC, you can download it here. 2. Log into Canvas. 3. Find the “NameCoach” link on the left-hand navigation of Canvas. NameCoach is only visible for courses that are part of the pilot. (Click or tap image above to zoom.) 4. Click the “Record Name” button next to your name. (Click or tap image above to zoom.) 5. Choose how to record. Either select “Phone” and enter your phone number, or, select “Web Recorder.” Proceed to the next step and follow instructions to record your name. When recording, be sure to speak clearly and audibly into your device. (Click or tap image above to zoom.) 6. Listen to the recording by pressing on the “Play” button next to your name. Does your name sound clear and audible? To record it again, click "Edit this recording." (Click or tap image above to zoom.) Listen to Available Recordings 1. Log into Canvas. 2.
