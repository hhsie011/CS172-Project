Master Classes provide an opportunity for hands-on recruiting by working closely with potential future employees. Moreover, sponsoring organizations benefit from the delivery of actionable results and recommendations for their unique business project. Characteristics of Master Class projects Semester-long projects addressing real-world issues facing project sponsors Students’ actionable recommendations make a significant contribution to the organization Teams consisting of 3-6 second-year MBA students work on each project under the watchful guidance of experienced faculty A time commitment from each student team of approximately 80 team-hours per semester (approximately 6 hours per week) Requirements for Sponsoring a Master Class project Project sponsors must provide a liaison for the students throughout the semester, providing access to background information, people, data, etc. Project sponsors must provide feedback to the student team on the project results either in person (preferably) or through written evaluations.
