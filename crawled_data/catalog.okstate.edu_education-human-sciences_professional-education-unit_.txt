http://education.okstate.edu/peu Officers of the Professional Education Council Robin Fuxa, PhD—Director of Professional Education The Professional Education Unit coordinates all Professional Education programs offered at Oklahoma State University. All programs are operated in collaboration with the College of Education and Human Sciences, the Ferguson College of Agriculture, the College of Arts and Sciences, and the Graduate College. The Director of the Professional Education Unit (PEU) is the head of the unit. The Professional Education Council has been established as the governance and oversight structure for the Professional Education Unit. The Unit has a mission statement, goals and a strategic plan that guide the operation of its programs. Professional Education Unit Core Values The underlying structure of the unit is articulated through its conceptual framework that guides the direction of programs, teaching practices, candidate performance, faculty scholarship, and service. The core values of the conceptual framework emphasize leadership, ethics and professionalism, academics and professional roles, diversity and service orientation/community outreach (L.E.A.D.S.). Leadership The PEU prepares candidates who are committed to the belief that professional educators who provide quality education are the foundation of a prosperous and democratic society. Ethics and Professionalism The PEU prepares candidates who demonstrate ethical and professional behavior in their interactions with students, families, colleagues and communities and practice social justice. Academic and Professional Roles The PEU provides opportunities to prepare knowledgeable candidates who reflect upon the connections between academics and their professional roles. Diversity PEU prepares candidates who believe everyone deserves the opportunity to learn and can learn; they possess knowledge, skills, and dispositions to serve as effective professionals who understand and meet the needs of a diverse society. See Professional Education Diversity policy for more information: https://education.okstate.edu/departments-programs/stles/peu/diversity.html. Service Orientation/Community Outreach The PEU prepares candidates who value and engage in service and meaningful involvement of the learner/client and their families, as well as their school and their community. All Professional Education programs are administered by the Director of Professional Education and are coordinated through the Office of Professional Education. Upon completion of an approved program or degree, passing the appropriate Certification Examinations for Oklahoma Educators (CEOE), and the recommendation of the University, the candidate will be eligible for certification to serve in Oklahoma schools. All candidates completing an approved program or applying for an initial or advanced certificate are subject to all rules and regulations specified by the OSU Professional Education Unit, the Oklahoma State Board of Education, and the Office of Educational Quality and Accountability (OEQA). State-mandated changes in teacher certification may result in additional requirements for certification at any time. Certification programs are offered at various levels in the College of Education and Human Sciences as well as in the Ferguson College of Agriculture, and the College of Arts and Sciences, but all require earning at least a bachelor’s degree for recommendation for a standard certificate. Each candidate (regardless of level or college) seeking recommendation for certification from OSU through a Professional Education program must make formal application to do so using the “Application for Admission to Professional Education” and must meet the admission standards specified. Graduate programs leading to the master’s degree, the education specialist degree, and both the Doctor of Education and the Doctor of Philosophy degrees are offered in several areas. In addition, we offer pathways for non-traditional routes to certification in some certification areas. Professional Education at Oklahoma State University is fully accredited by the state and NCATE (legacy) with our next regular Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP - the accrediting body that replaced NCATE) accreditation visit schedule for Spring 2022. Information regarding all Professional Education policies and practices may be obtained from the Office of Professional Education or the Professional Education website. Inquiries concerning any aspect of Professional Education programs at Oklahoma State University should be addressed to the head of the School or Department offering the program or the Office of Professional Education, 325 Willard. The Unit prepares educator candidates with the knowledge, skills, and dispositions for a wide range of certification and teaching areas. Further, there is currently an immense demand for educators in Oklahoma, nationally, and internationally; our graduates are comprehensively prepared to serve as educator and equity advocates wherever they put their professional preparation to work.

However, dispositions affect your professional life in and out of school, and we want to be certain you’re well prepared to have a successful tenure as an educator. With that in mind, dispositions may be addressed and recorded at any point in your program, whether a formal or informal interaction and whether interacting with a peer, staff member, or faculty member. We believe it’s vital to celebrate your successes as well as speak with you about areas that could raise challenges for you as a professional, and this is why we have this guiding document as a starting place to be able to work with you on your professional dispositions. Dispositional concerns are often a reason candidates are not successful. Please know that if faculty or staff members speak with you about your dispositions, they are doing so because they want you to be successful. As someone in a professional program, however, it is also important to be aware that dispositional challenges may affect your ability to be placed for field experiences or clinical practice; placements are not guaranteed. Candidates who are not successful will be provided guidance tailored to them, and except in egregious cases or when problems persist over time, candidates who encounter dispositional challenges generally go on to be successful educators. Do not be alarmed at constructive feedback over the course of your program, as this is a learning environment. This assessment offers an opportunity to learn more about your own dispositions and grow in that aspect of your preparation as an education professional.

Admission to Professional Education The criteria for admission to Professional Education programs are based on university-wide and Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education (OSRHE) policies approved by the Professional Education Council and overseen by the Director of Professional Education. Requirements are applicable to all Professional Education administrative units of the colleges preparing educators. Students should submit an Application for Admission to Professional Education form to the Professional Education Unit during their first semester in their respective programs. The candidate is not considered a fully-eligible participant in a Professional Education program until formally admitted to the Professional Education Unit. Full admission is required to enroll in the restricted courses in teaching methods and the clinical practice internship. Criteria for Admission to Undergraduate Professional Education Programs The student must meet all of the following criteria to be fully admitted to Professional Education: Orientation to Professional Education Course and Field Experiences. An appropriate orientation to Professional Education course must be completed with a grade of "C" or better. One semester credit hour of early field experiences must be completed with a grade of "C" or better or grade of "P." Basic Skills Competency. Basic skills competency must be demonstrated by successful completion of the Oklahoma General Education Test (OGET) or an ACT composite score of 22 with the writing section included, or an SAT total score of 1120 including the following scores on the essay section: five (5) on Reading, four (4) on Analysis, and five (5) on Writing. Minimum cumulative overall GPA of 2.50 or higher as specified by the individual program. The minimum cumulative overall GPA must be earned based on no fewer than 40 credit hours of courses to include lower-division general education requirements as specified in the student's program. Criteria for Admission to Graduate (Post-Baccalaureate) Professional Education Programs Graduate (post-baccalaureate) students must complete the Application for Admission to Professional Education form. Post-baccalaureate candidates must meet one of the following criteria for full admission to Professional Education: The student must have completed an approved Professional Education program and hold a valid Oklahoma certificate or Provisional, Standard, or Professional Certificate; or a valid certificate from a state with which the Oklahoma State Department of Education has an interstate contract. The certificate or Provisional, Standard, or Professional Certificate must have included successful completion of (a) one semester credit hour of early field experiences with a grade of "C" or better or a grade of "P" and (b) an orientation to professional education course with a grade of "C" or better or a grade of "P." If the graduate student does not hold a valid credential and did not successfully complete the criteria listed above, he or she must meet 2 or 3. Students in a Master's program must satisfy the departmental requirements for unqualified admission to the Master's degree program: have a minimum cumulative overall GPA of at least 2.50 or higher as specified by the individual program; complete one semester credit hour of early field experiences with a grade of "C" or better or a grade of "P," and complete an orientation to Professional Education course with a grade of "C" or better or a grade of "P," and receive a passing score on the OGET or an ACT composite score of 22 with the writing section included, or an SAT total score of 1120 including the following scores on the essay section: five (5) on Reading, four (4) on Analysis, and five (5) on Writing. Students classified by the Graduate College as "special" or "provisionally admitted" must: have a minimum cumulative overall GPA of at least 2.50 or higher as specified by the individual program; and complete one semester credit hour of early field experiences and an orientation to Professional Education course with a grade of "C" or better or a grade of "P," and receive a passing score on the OGET or an ACT composite score of 22 with the writing section included, or an SAT total score of 1120 including the following scores on the essay section: five (5) on Reading, four (4) on Analysis, and five (5) on Writing. Professional Portfolio Candidates in Professional Education are required to submit a professional portfolio for review and approval at designated checkpoints prior to certification. Details of the portfolio are available in the Professional Education Student Handbook (http://education.okstate.edu/peu). Transfer Students Transfer students must work toward meeting the criteria for full admission to Professional Education established by Oklahoma State University as soon as possible during the first semester at OSU. It may be possible to transfer admission from another Oklahoma institution. For information see the OSU site http://education.okstate.edu/peu or contact the Office of Professional Education. Retention in Professional Education For participation in all courses requiring full admission to and for continued acceptability in the Professional Education unit, an undergraduate candidate must maintain a grade-point average required for graduation of at least 2.50 or 2.75 depending on the program. If this GPA falls below 2.50/2.75, the candidate is placed on probation. When the required graduation GPA is raised above 2.50/2.75, the candidate is removed from probation. If the candidate fails to meet the graduation GPA requirement in that probationary semester or fails to have at least a 2.50/2.75 GPA for that semester, the candidate will be suspended from the Professional Education Unit. A candidate not satisfying the probation requirements at the end of the semester following the initial probationary semester will be administratively withdrawn from the Professional Education Unit and all courses having full admission as a prerequisite. Readmission to the Professional Education Unit will require a new application. Advisors are available to assist the candidate in regularly reviewing continuing retention or reinstatement in Professional Education programs. A retention review prior to enrollment and again prior to the beginning of classes each semester is encouraged when continuing retention is in question. Graduate students, including those classified as graduate special students, admitted to the Professional Education unit must meet and maintain the requirements of the Graduate College to remain in good academic standing. This will require that graduate candidates earn and maintain a 3.00 GPA at Oklahoma State University following admission to Professional Education. Remediation Opportunities It is important for candidates to recognize the importance of milestones (admission requirements, testing, portfolio, etc.), professionalism, and dispositions as non-negotiable requirements in Oklahoma State Statutes and national accreditation requirements. Program area faculty, advisors, and PEU staff are available to assist candidates through remediation opportunities as needed. Foreign Language Proficiency Candidates in Professional Education programs are required to document competency in a foreign language at the novice high-level. The OSU Professional Education Council has established the following options through which a student may attain documented novice-high competency: The candidate who wishes to be tested in a language may choose, at personal expense, to successfully complete the Oral Proficiency Interview developed by the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages. The candidate may complete two years of high school coursework in a single foreign language with grades of “ B” or better (from a State Department of Education approved high school program). The candidate may complete three or more credit hours (or transcripted equivalent), in a single foreign language from an accredited college or university with a grade of “C” or better. The candidate may successfully complete an equivalent College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) in a foreign language. The candidate may meet the requirement by transfer of documentation of meeting the foreign language competency from one of the teacher education programs in the State of Oklahoma approved by the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education. Candidates whose native language is other than English may document proficiency in English with a score of 550 or more on the Test of English as a Foreign Language. Program Completers In Oklahoma, a program completer is defined as a person who has met all the requirements of an accredited educator preparation program. Program completers include all those who are documented as having met such requirements. OSU requirements include a degree, program credentials as documented on a transcript and written proof of having met the program's requirements which include successful completion of all certification examinations/assessments and a professional portfolio. State or national certification or accreditation requirements may necessitate changes in certification requirements at any time. The certification check sheets are available at https://education.okstate.edu/departments-programs/stles/peu/certification.html and detail requirements for each certification area. Background Check for Field Placements In alignment with Oklahoma state statutes and administrative code (OS §70-6-190, OS §70-3-104, OAC 210:20-9-98), the Oklahoma State University (OSU) Professional Education Unit (PEU) requires a state level background check (name check) on ALL non-certified candidates prior to placement in any field experience or clinical practice. The candidate is responsible for associated fees, which may vary depending on in-state or out-of-state student status. The PEU may request an updated background check as needed. While we make every effort to place candidates in the best possible field experience or clinical practice situation, school districts do review background checks and past criminal history in terms of their own policies and may decline hosting a particular candidate for field experiences or clinical practice. (In most cases this would be an Oklahoma check, however, in the case of an out-of-state transfer student it could be a check from their originating state.) This process if facilitated by the Office of Professional Education (325 Willard). Field Experiences/Clinical Practice Placement in Diverse Setting As part of a land-grant institution, we are particularly proud of partnering with Oklahoma public schools. Candidates will experience diverse placements in a variety of settings (rural, urban, and suburban), in varied school community socio-economics, and in racially and ethnically diverse school communities. Previous clinical/field experiences will be considered when determining the internship placement. See the Professional Education Diversity Statement for clarification: https://education.okstate.edu/departments-programs/stles/peu/diversity.html. Data on all field experience and clinical practice placements is maintained by the Professional Education Unit and Assistant Director of Assessment. Initial and Advanced certification programs work directly with the Coordinator of Field Experiences and Clinical Practice to best serve candidates and our partnering school districts with research-based experiences. Placements are based on the following criteria: OSU must have a contractual agreement with the participating school district, the principal and the mentor teacher/educator must be in agreement about the placement, the mentor teacher/educator must meet established criteria to work with a candidate, a qualified OSU supervisor must be available for travel to that site, and a program faculty recommendation for clinical practice is required (based on academics, field experiences, and dispositions). Clinical Practice Requirements In order to participate in clinical practice, all teacher candidates must complete the Clinical Practice Internship Application during the prior semester. Clinical practice information including the Clinical Practice Application link is available in the PEU Student Handbook. Details and the deadline for the clinical practice application will be provided at the mandatory Intent to Student Teach meeting held each semester. Typically, these are the first Wednesday of September at 5pm (for Spring interns) and the first Wednesday of February at 5pm (for Fall interns); location and any schedule changes will be provided by email. Candidates must successfully complete submissions 1 and 2 of the portfolio, pass the OGET and have received a score on the OSAT, and complete all required coursework with the specified GPAs before a placement will be sought. Candidates will be notified by e-mail of their placements after the Professional Education staff has received confirmation from the cooperating schools. Candidates should not meet with teachers or principals or otherwise attempt to establish their own placement. The following guidelines should be considered when listing your placement preferences in the space provided on the application: Public Schools: All internships occur in public schools. Placement Settings: Candidates are placed in a variety of settings (rural, urban, and suburban), in a variety of school community socio-economics, and in racially and ethnically diverse school communities. Previous clinical/field experiences will be considered when determining the internship placement. Professional Experiences: Candidates will be placed in a location where professional experiences can develop. You will not be placed in a school where your children attend, a relative is employed, or you have developed personal relationships. In addition, candidates will likely not be placed in a school system they attended. Finances: Finances cannot be considered when determining the internship placement. Out of Area/State Placements: Out-of-area/out-of-state placements are rare and only granted in extenuating circumstances. To request an out-of-area/out-of/state placement, refer to the policy on the OSU Professional Education website. Note that the intern must appeal to the Field Experiences Committee for consideration, and, if granted, the intern bears all financial responsibility associated with placement, travel to on-campus meetings, and supervision and fees charged by a cooperating institution. Some programs facilitate international student teaching; check with your program for details. NOTE: Check with your program area for information about any additional placement requirements for your certification area prior to completing your application. Criteria for clinical practice placement for all Professional Education candidates: Continued full admission to a program in the Professional Education unit (see "Retention in Professional Education" on the previous page); A current overall grade-point average of at least 2.50 or higher as specified by the program; A grade-point average of at least 2.50 or higher as specified by the program in courses listed on the current approved program for certification in the areas of professional core, major and college/departmental requirements. No grade lower than a "C" or a "P" in either of these areas; Completion of all professional education course work that includes at least one course in social foundations, all early field experiences (60 clock hours minimum in diverse settings), exceptional learners, and human growth and development, with no grade lower than "C" or "P" in any of these courses. It is recommended that all professional sequence coursework be completed. Successful completion of submission I and II requirements for the Professional Education Program portfolio. The exact submission dates for portfolio are set by the Professional Education Unit in collaboration with programs. Portfolios should contain the materials listed in the Portfolio Handbook (https://education.okstate.edu/departments-programs/stles/peu/portfolio.html) for the pre-internship submission and any additional items required by a specific program. Must have taken and received a score on the appropriate subject area test (OSAT) for certification. Must be recommended for clinical practice by program faculty. Required Grades in Clinical Practice A candidate must receive grades of "P" in all sections of clinical practice in order to be recommended for a teaching certificate. A candidate assigned a grade of "F" in any section of clinical practice will not qualify for a recommendation for any level of certification. Placements in clinical practice are made based on program faculty recommendation, availability of a qualified cooperating teacher, school district and site preferences, availability of a university supervisor, and candidate request. Candidates do not contact schools to secure their own placements. Candidates will not be placed in a school where a relative(s) attends or is employed or where the candidate has developed personal relationships with teachers or administration. In addition, candidates will not be placed in the school system from which they graduated. Finances cannot be considered when determining the internship placement. As a general rule, interns are placed within an approximate 75-mile radius of Stillwater. Out-of-Area/Out-of-State Placements A candidate requesting an out-of-area/out-of-state placement due to extenuating circumstances or seeking an assignment that provides exceptional professional experiences that would not be afforded by a local placement must submit a written request and receive the approval of the degree program area coordinator, the unit head and the PEU Field Experiences Committee (application available here: https://education.okstate.edu/departments-programs/professional-education-unit/field-experiences.html). Securing placements and supervision are the responsibility of the Office of Field Experiences and Clinical Practice and the program area coordinator. Candidates granted an out-of-area/out-of-state placement must meet all clinical practice deadlines and requirements, including attendance of on-campus meetings and are required to pay the following fees: All necessary and appropriate fees required in securing and finalizing the placement (e.g., such as reimbursement for cooperating teacher, supervisor, etc.). These fees are payable to the Office of Professional Education or designated office and/or out-of-state university at the beginning of the semester in which the placement is sought. If a recommendation for certification is to be made by Oklahoma State University, the candidate is responsible for reimbursing visits performed by the cooperating institution. All other criteria pertaining to in-state clinical practice placements apply as previously stated. OSU fees - A non-refundable administrative fee to cover time and extra work related to securing an out-of-area placement may be assessed when an approved request is submitted to the Clinical Practices office. The fee is due upon approval of the requested out-of-state or out-of-area placement. Supervising teacher fees - The out-of-area/out-of-state supervising fee is determined by each supervisor, the out-of-area/out-of-state university, and the Field Experience and Clinical Practices Office and typically ranges from $400 to $800 to cover the expenses incurred to conduct the required observations and student teaching evaluations. Students are responsible for all costs related to their out-of-area/out-of-state supervision. The fee is to be paid to Office of Professional Education, who will then pay the supervisor. Cooperating teacher fees - Whereas local cooperating teachers are compensated with tuition vouchers, an out-of-area/out-of-state cooperating teacher may not benefit from such compensation. Additional fees - The local (out-of-area/out-of-state) cooperating university may require a fee for supervision for a student not enrolled in their university. Exceptions to this policy are permitted for students who are enrolled in programs that have a specific out-of-area/out-of-state placement policy and for students who participate in special placements abroad. Qualifications for consideration of out-of-state/out-of-area placement request: Minimum cumulative 3.0 GPA and 3.0 GPA in content/certification area classes. Successful interview with Program Area Coordinator presenting your request for an out-of-area placement. Recommendation from Program Area faculty. Approval of the PEC Field Experiences Committee. Agreement from local (out-of-area/out-of-state) university to supervise the student teacher. Availability and willingness of qualified university-affiliated supervisor to observe and evaluate student teacher. A memorandum of understanding signed by the student, the Program Area Coordinator, and the PEU or Program Representative must be on file prior to the request for placement being sent to the school district. The out-of-area/out-of-state university may require additional signed documentation. The Internship Experience The clinical practice intern is supported by their student teaching course instructor, the assigned OSU Supervisor and Mentor/Cooperating Teacher and the School Principal. Mentor Teachers and OSU Supervisors are asked to complete training in co-teaching prior to the experience, and training must be renewed at least every five years. If needed during the internship, the problem-solving process includes the support team above as well as Professional Education Unit representatives. The Memorandum of Understanding candidates sign at the application stage signifies their understanding of conduct to be followed during the internship. A breach in this agreement can result in removal from the internship. Insurance Neither school districts nor OSU insure candidates during the internship; candidates are responsible for carrying their own insurance of any type that may apply. Candidates are strongly encouraged to obtain professional liability insurance. Candidates are encouraged to consider student membership of the Oklahoma Aspiring Educators Association (the student membership for the Oklahoma Educators Assocation -- OEA) or the Professional Oklahoma Educators (POE), which typically both provide liability insurance to student members. Outside Activities/Classes during the Clinical Practice Internship The clinical practice internship experience is considered the beginning of your professional career and your energies should be directed toward making the most of your professional assignment. Therefore, taking coursework other than the internship courses is not advised during your internship. Employment, while not prohibited, can be a significant challenge for interns, particularly depending upon the number of hours and the flexibility (or lack thereof) of your schedule. However, we recognize that employment is a necessity in many cases. If you must have outside employment or have other significant commitments such as parenting, caring for an elderly or ill relative, etc., please be sure to speak with your Professional Education placement staff member to strategize ways to navigate these life/work demands and have a highly successful internship experience. Appeals By enrolling in Professional Education programs at Oklahoma State University, students accept the responsibility for complying with all applicable Professional Education Council policies and procedures that allow them to maintain good academic standing. If the student believes that the established policies of the Professional Education Council have not been fairly or consistently followed, he/she has the right to pursue an appeal. Certification Examinations/Assessments for Oklahoma Educators All candidates who graduate or are seeking recommendation for certification from a Professional Education program are required to complete the Certification Examinations for Oklahoma Educators before a license or area of certification can be issued. The examinations, which include a general education test, subject area tests, and a professional teaching exam (OGET, OSAT), are administered by the Evaluation Systems, Pearson for the Office of Educational Quality and Accountability. Registration materials are available online at www.ceoe.nesinc.com. Information on the Praxis Performance Assessment for Teachers (PPAT) is available here https://www.ets.org/ppa/test-takers/teachers/about; candidates should take care that they do not register for the PPAT prior to their final internship semester, however. Copies of the test competencies and study guides for the Oklahoma Teacher Certification Testing Program are available on the Pearson Education, Inc., website at www.ceoe.nesinc.com and for the PPAT at https://www.ets.org/ppa/test-takers/teachers/prepare. Teacher candidates must successfully complete the OGET [or an ACT composite score of 22 with the writing section included, or an SAT total score of 1120 including the following scores on the essay section: five (5) on Reading, four (4) on Analysis, and five (5) on Writing] prior to admission to Professional Education; receive a score on the OSAT prior to student teaching placement, and pass the PPAT (during the final internship semester) prior to a certification. Note: If the OSAT was not passed prior to internship, it must also be passed prior to certification. Recommendations for Certificate, or Additional Certification Areas Application information for an Oklahoma certificate can be obtained in the Office of Professional Education, 325 Willard. Candidates seeking advisement concerning teacher certificates can be assisted by a Coordinator in the Office of Professional Education. Effective May 31, 2001, Title 68 O.S. 238.1 requires all certificate holders be in compliance with Oklahoma state income tax laws before a teaching certificate can be obtained or renewed. Effective November 1, 2001, Oklahoma Statute 70 O.S. 6-190 requires applicants for initial Oklahoma teacher certification to have a full federal fingerprint-based background clearance. To receive Oklahoma State University’s in-state or out-of-state certification "Recommendation" or "Verification" of program completion, the applicant must: be admitted and maintain admission to OSU’s Professional Education Unit; complete the appropriate level of degree; meet the Foreign Language Proficiency Requirement; meet the Computer Proficiency Requirement; complete the required courses with the required grades and grade-point averages; have confirmation of the final clearance of all three portfolio submissions; pass the required Certification Examinations for Oklahoma Educators for Oklahoma certification and Praxis Performance Assessment for Teachers; and successfully complete all other required assessments such as the legal issues quiz and the trauma-informed pedagogy quiz, and complete the state’s application for certification. Unless the applicant has successfully completed all of the above, Oklahoma State University will not make a recommendation or verify program completion for an in-state or out-of-state certificate. A candidate assigned the grade of “F” in any section of clinical practice will not qualify for a recommendation for a license or any level of certification. Requirements for certification and degrees are not necessarily the same thing. Candidates must meet all other certification requirements, including portfolio and foreign language proficiency if appropriate.
