PreviousNext I read a small book called Die Bergfahrt (which Donna Stonecipher chose to translate as Ascent) by the Swiss author Ludwig Hohl (1904-1980) and I admire Hohl's skill in giving life to the mountain he "describes." Bergfahrt tells the story of two young men at the beginning of the last century who set out for a mountain hike in the Alps. They don't seem to know each other too well; their ideas about a joyful climb into ice and snow differ wildly. Soon into the story, we realize that there is a third protagonist: the nameless mountain. Hohl proves a grandiose writer when it comes to capturing the volatile, soothing, harsh, challenging, rewarding, and antagonistic character of the Alpes. He focuses on the interaction of man and "nature", social relationships, and "destiny." Wonderful rhythmical prose, concise, unrelenting, suspenseful. There is a tragic end – but even this will surprise you. - Ulrike Draesner Departments African and African American Studies Anthropology Art History Asian Societies, Cultures, and Languages Program Biological Sciences Chemistry Classics Cognitive Science Comparative Literature Computer Science Earth Sciences Economics Education Engineering Sciences English Environmental Studies Film and Media Studies French and Italian Geography German Studies Government History Humanities 1 & 2 Institute for Writing and Rhetoric Jewish Studies Latin American, Latino and Caribbean Studies Linguistics Mathematics Medieval and Renaissance Studies Music Native American Studies Philosophy Physics and Astronomy Psychological and Brain Sciences Religion Russian Sociology Spanish and Portuguese Studio Art Theater Women’s and Gender Studies Inclusivity “Dartmouth’s capacity to advance its dual mission of education and research depends upon the full diversity and inclusivity of this community…Diversity and inclusivity are necessary partners. Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of German Studies Undergraduate Overview Why Study German?
