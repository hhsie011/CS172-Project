Child Protection Training Request If you have direct contact with minors through your Temple employment and/or volunteer work, the university recommends that you get training on the recognition and reporting of child abuse. One place to do this is through a free online program developed by the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services (DHS). In addition, DHS and each county agency will conduct a continuing publicity and education program for Pennsylvania residents aimed at the prevention of child abuse and child neglect. DHS will provide information related to the recognition and reporting of child abuse on its website through printable booklets and brochures, educational videos and internet-based interactive training exercises. More information from DHS on training requirements and services is available online.
