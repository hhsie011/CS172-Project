Visit our Avoiding Plagiarism guide to find out more. From the University’s plagiarism page, plagiarism is a form of academic dishonesty defined as “the intentional or unintentional copying of language, structure, or ideas of another and attributing the work to one’s own efforts” (p. 29). The catalog also states that “when, in the opinion of a faculty member, there is evidence that a student has committed an act of academic dishonesty, the faculty member shall make a formal written charge of academic dishonest, including a description of the misconduct, to the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies.” (p. 29).
