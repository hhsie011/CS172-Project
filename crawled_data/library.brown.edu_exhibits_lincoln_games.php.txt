For more than a century, Abraham Lincoln has been employed by authors, toymakers, and educators to present a model of honesty and probity for children, not only in the United States, but all across the globe. This exhibition will display some of the more unusual items from the McLellan Lincoln collection, documenting the didactic use of Lincoln’s image while promoting childhood fun.
