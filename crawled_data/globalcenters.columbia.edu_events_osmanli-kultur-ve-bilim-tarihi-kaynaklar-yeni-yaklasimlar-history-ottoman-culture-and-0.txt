Doç. A. Tunç Şen, Yrd. Doç. Harun Küçük ve Prof. Dr. Hakan Karatek’nin katılımıyla 10 Temmuz Salı akşamı Columbia Üniversitesi'nin Studio-X Istanbul ofisinde gerçekleşti. Panel Hakkında Osmanlı dünyasının harp peşinde koşup saray çevresinde siyaset mücadelesi veren devlet ricalinden çok daha fazlasını barındırdığı malumsa da, bu çok dilli, çok dinli, farklı zümre ve etnik temellerden insanlarla dolu “imparatorluk”ta üretilmiş gündelik kültürün ve bilimin kapsamlı bir envanterini çıkarmak, bu alanlardaki mevcut kaynakları dünya tarihçiliğinin radarına sokabilmek esaslı bir mesele olarak halen önümüzde duruyor. Bu panel, biri kültür diğeri ise bilim tarihi üzerine hâlihazırda devam etmekte olan iki kaynak derlemesi projesinden hareketle, erken modern Osmanlı dünyasındaki kültür ve bilim hayatından bazı kesitler sunup konuyla ilgili bazı meseleleri gündeme getirmeyi planlıyor.

On July 10, the Center hosted Assistant Professor Tunç Şen, Assistant Professor Harun Küçük and Professor Hakan Karateke, for a public panel on the “History of Ottoman Culture and Science: Sources, New Approaches” at Columbia University's Studio-X Istanbul office. About the Panel To make a comprehensive inventory of everyday cultures and sciences produced in the "empire", filled with people from multilingual, multi-religious, multi-religious, ethnic and multi-linguistic backgrounds in which the Ottoman world ran after the war and hosted much more than the state riche, it still remains as a fundamental issue to be able to bring resources into the radar of world history. This panel plans to present some sections from the culture and science life in the early modern Ottoman world and to bring some issues related to this subject, based on the two ongoing resource collection project on the history of science, one of which is culture.
