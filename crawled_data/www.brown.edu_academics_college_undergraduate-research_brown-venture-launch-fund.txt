The fund offers promising ventures three levels of progressively increasing funding using a gated award system. At the first level, funding and support is used to test assumptions or prove hypotheses embedded within venture plans. The second and third stages of funding help bring products and services to market and assist ventures in achieving scale and impact. The Brown Venture Launch Fund is not a business plan competition. Applicants with strong ideas will have an opportunity to further refine their venture plans via Peer Critique sessions and other resources available at Brown University. All that is required of applicants at the first level is clear understanding of a problem or opportunity, a vision or plan for a project or venture to fill this need, and a readiness to take action.
