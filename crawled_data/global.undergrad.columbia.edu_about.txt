UGE enhances access and support for undergraduates to global opportunities and brings students and faculty together in a central location that creates a hub of global activity at Columbia, allowing students to better connect and learn about potential programs; faculty and staff to share their global and regional expertise and advice; and for the collaborative development, implementation and assessment of new and existing undergraduate global programs and opportunities for global engagement across Columbia and around the world.
