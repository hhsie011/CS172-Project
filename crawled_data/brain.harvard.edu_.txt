Bolshakov, PhD Professor of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School Professor of Psychiatry, McLean Hospital The Bolshakov lab focuses on cellular and molecular mechanisms of learned and innate behaviors using a combination of electrophysiological, cell biological, and optogenetic techniques. READ MORE > Our Neuroscience Community Depression in Development: An Orchestration of Genetics and Experience Yiwen Zhu and colleagues from Erin Dunn’s lab examined in humans the effect of genes previously shown to influence the timing of sensitive periods in animals and the interplay between these genetic factors and exposure to commonly occurring childhood adversities on depression risk. They found that genes regulating sensitive periods associated with depression risk and their expression levels varied over the course of development. READ MORE > Layering Up (the Nervous System) When neural circuits are assembled, several asymmetric cell behaviors are involved. How are these behaviors coordinated? Evelyn Avilés from the lab of Lisa Goodrich discusses how a new study of the molecule Fat3 and its interactors give us some answers. READ MORE > Changing Frames of Reference in the Fly Jenny Lu and colleagues in Rachel Wilson’s lab share new work on a neural circuit in the fly that transforms velocity from body-centric to world-centric reference frames. This work reveals how vector computations can be performed in the brain.
