Contributing towards our own retirement is something each of us should take ownership in. Baylor is very generous in supporting its employees in their efforts to contribute towards and prepare for their future retirement, however, relying on Baylor's contribution alone may not be enough to effectively prepare someone for retirement and the lifestyle they wish to have during their retirement years. We encourage everyone to contribute towards their retirement and speak to a CAPTRUST advisor to help determine what you should be contributing and create a plan to help you reach your retirement goals. Pre-Tax Vs. Roth Contributions Info: If you'd like to learn more about Pre-Tax vs. Roth contributions, then watch this Understanding The Roth Plan Option Presentation provided by CAPTRUST.
