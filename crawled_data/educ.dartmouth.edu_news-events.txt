[more] David Kraemer Quoted in Discover November 22, 2021 "There's no scientific evidence supporting the idea that people have different learning styles. At least, not in any sense that is actionable for improving education." "Isn't a primary goal of education to train students to improve their weak areas, and not just play to their strengths? So, even if there was evidence to support these theories, I'm not sure how they would be implemented by teachers." -David Kraemer [more] Associate Professor Michele Tine receives Jerome Goldstein Award for Distinguished Teaching September 2, 2021 Associate Professor of Education Michele Tine is the recipient of the Jerome Goldstein Award for Distinguished Teaching.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Education Undergraduate Minor Cameron-Glickenhaus Family Fund Prize Application Courses Careers Opportunities in Peer Mentoring News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
