As “Big Data” exerts its influence in most areas of modern life, Brown’s new Data Science Initiative also seeks to increase data fluency, educate the next generation of data scientists, and explore the impact of the data revolution on culture and society. “ The massive increase of data available to us, along with amazing advances in algorithms and computing power, has created possibilities we never imagined. At Brown, we want to drive methodological innovation and pay attention to the social and cultural impacts of big data. We are also excited to think about novel ways to empower students to become literate with data and their analysis. ” Bjorn Sandstede Professor of Applied Mathematics Originally created from four strong departments—Applied Mathematics, Biostatistics, Computer Science, and Mathematics—the Data Science Initiative builds on Brown’s leadership in those fields to develop innovative new methods for creating meaning and knowledge from data. Support data science at Brown. Help drive discovery that will realize the promise of big data to improve lives and enhance the human experience.
