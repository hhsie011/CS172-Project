S. Carberry, the presentation did not take place. Josiah Stinkney Carberry, the immediately legendary “Professor of Psychoceramics” (cracked pots), would go on to not appear numerous other times. In his honor, every Friday the 13th, brown jugs are available in which to deposit loose change to support the Carberry Book Fund, which is used to purchase “such books as Professor Carberry might or might not approve of.” Brown University Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA Phone: 401-863-1000 Maps & Directions / Contact Us © Brown University X
