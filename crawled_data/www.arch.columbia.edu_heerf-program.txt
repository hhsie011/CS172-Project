For example, we understand many are experiencing challenges in finding work or other funding sources generally used to support items such as tuition, fees, food, housing, course materials, technology, health care (including mental), and child care or other educationally related expenses. Funding will be from the Higher Education Emergency Relief Funds (HEERF), and priority will be given to students who exhibit exceptional need. The awards will be $500 to $1,500, and the amounts will be determined based on the number of applications received and the specific needs presented in the application. Funds are limited and GSAPP is unable to guarantee that all eligible students will receive funding. To apply for HEERF III program funding, please complete the online application by Monday, December 6, 2021. Award recipients will be notified by Monday, December 13, 2021. More information on the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund and a related FAQ can be found on the Student Financial Services Financial Aid website. Please contact GSAPP’s Financial Aid Office at financialaid@arch.columbia.edu with any questions. Online Application Form October 8, 2021 Columbia is launching the next phase of disbursement to students of federal funds provided through the Higher Education Emergency Relief Funds (HEERF) program. The University’s neediest students who are enrolled full time in schools or programs that do not already have a “meet need / no loan” or “fully funded“ financial aid policy will receive $1500 per student. Each school will determine student eligibility for this portion of the program. In addition, all students in need may be eligible for additional school based emergency funding through HEERF. If selected, these one-time grants to eligible students may be used for costs that arise due to the coronavirus pandemic or other education related expenses, such as tuition, food, housing, health care (including mental health care) or child care. International students and domestic students who would like to be considered for this funding but did not complete a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) will be sent instructions to provide financial information that will be used to determine their eligibility for this funding. Domestic students may check to see if they filed a FAFSA by accessing the University’s financial aid portal. Instructions to log in are found on the site’s main page. Alternatively, domestic students may check via the U.S. Department of Education’s website. Students for whom we do not have a FAFSA on file will receive a link to submit financial information on Friday, October 15 and can submit the form for consideration through Friday, October 22. Additional information on the disbursement schedule will be shared by email and posted on the GSAPP website. Additional information on the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund including an FAQ can be found on the Student Financial Services website. Before these grants are processed, recipients will be asked to certify that the grant will support ongoing financial need with the aforementioned expenses. Recipients will be given the option to apply the grant to an outstanding balance on their student account or otherwise, the grant will be directly paid to the student through a direct deposit or check. We look forward to sharing additional details in the coming weeks; if you have any questions in the meantime, please contact GSAPP’s Financial Aid Office at financialaid@arch.columbia.edu for assistance.
