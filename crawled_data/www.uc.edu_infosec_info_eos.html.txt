Operating System Support Guide This guide is meant to illustrate the lifecycles of the multiple different operating systems (OS) on the UC network. It will walk you through the operating systems that we’ve had on UC’s network, from Active to End-Of-Support (EOS) so you, the user, can stay up to date and safe. Attached are the release notes, fact sheets, and lifecycles from each developer/vendor. Microsoft Windows Lifecycle Factsheet Ubuntu’s Release End of Life Page Red Hat Enterprise Linux Lifecycle CentOS Lifecycle NOTE: Apple releases a new version of the OS every year usually in the Fall. However, they support several previous releases. Please refer to https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222. Any Apple device that will not update to a supported OS version is considered EOS. CURRENT VERSIONS OF OS: Windows 10 21H2 Windows 11 Windows Server 2022 macOS Monterey 12 Ubuntu 21.10 or 20.04.3 LTS RHEL 8.5 CentOS 8.2 The are major changes to CentOS Life Cycle. Please see vendor page: https://blog.centos.org/2020/12/future-is-centos-stream/ Active This OS is the current OS that all systems should be using. Going EOS Soon This OS is going to be EOS in the next couple of months. Consider updating soon. EOS OIS and tech companies no longer support this OS. Systems that still have an OS with this category MUST upgrade to the newest OS.
