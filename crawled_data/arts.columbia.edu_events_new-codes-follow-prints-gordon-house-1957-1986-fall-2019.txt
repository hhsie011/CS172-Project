Breaking boundaries between typography and fine art compelled House to collaborate with artists—including Peter Blake and Richard Hamilton—when designing album covers for the Beatles. The artist’s diligence in perfecting tight apertures, or a dense design in typesetting, lead to a lifetime of experimentation in printmaking. A key group of prints will be on display in New York City for the first time, along with screenprints produced at Kelpra Studio that reveal the artist’s pivotal role initiating Chris Prater’s enthusiasm for fine art printing in the 1960s. Expanding upon the concept of the screen or matrix, House’s radical artistic practice continued as he manipulated imagery from trade catalogues or computer circuit boards to present complex compositions embedded with color.
