This program is open to both undergraduate and graduate students of all majors. International students are eligible to apply for the Federal Jackets Fellowship; however, some federal offices only accept internship applications from citizens of the United States. Selection is based on a potential for leadership as indicated by your grades, work experience, extracurricular activities, interests, and maturity. You will be asked to furnish a transcript and resume, as well as two references from people who have taught you or worked with you. During your internship in D.C., you will be asked to provide pictures and testimonials of your experience. Eligibility requires you to be enrolled at Georgia Tech the semester following your internship. Once you return to campus, you must also be available for outreach to other Georgia Tech students.
