At the home of Baron Gottfried van Swieten he heard and was deeply impressed by the music of his great predecessors Bach and Handel. This concert gives an insight into what Mozart learned from Bach in particular, and shows how, through the alchemy of genius, he transformed those lessons into something utterly personal and profoundly far-reaching. It is a chance to enter the unique mind of Mozart, and to hear some wonderful music by both master and disciple. This concert is a production of the Aspect Foundation for Music & Arts.
