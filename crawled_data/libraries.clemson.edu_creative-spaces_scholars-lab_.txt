The Scholar’s Lab works in conjunction with Clemson Libraries’ Data Services to support researchers as they develop research projects and work with their data, whatever form it may take. The space includes a variety of technology for visitors to use for their own research (or simply to try out a new tool) as well as space for collaboration and presentations. The Scholars’ Lab is open Monday – Friday from 10am – 4pm. Support The Scholars’ Lab is staffed by a small group of student workers that have an interest and training in various aspects of data visualization and digital scholarship. We are happy to help and answer questions about working with your data, whether you’re just getting started or need help with a specific piece of technology or analysis. Stop by during our office hours or fill out this form to request help. We’ll reach out to you soon, usually within one day. Teaching & Workshops We frequently offer free training events, which are publicized on the University calendar as well as via the library’s social media channels. A list of upcoming events can be seen in the sidebar on the right. If you’d like to suggest a workshop, guest speaker, or request a session for a specific group, please email Megan Sheffield at msheff@nullclemson.edu. Upcoming Events We are working hard to plan upcoming events and workshops. Please check back for updates.
