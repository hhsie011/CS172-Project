Print Degree Planner (opens a new window) | Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Facebook this Page (opens a new window) Tweet this Page (opens a new window) Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering (120 UNITS) The requirements for the degree comprise three major segments: foundation courses in mathematics and physical sciences (32 units); general education courses in the arts, humanities, social sciences and other related areas (24 units of undergraduate coursework); and a sequence of required (53 units) and technical courses (11 units) to fulfill the requirements of the Mechanical Engineering degree or the emphasis in Manufacturing Engineering. Students are required to meet with their academic adviser every semester during the first year and at least once a year thereafter. Students are strongly encouraged to see their academic advisers frequently to obtain guidance in pursuit of their careers. All courses taken in fulfillment of the requirements for the bachelor’s degree must be taken for a letter grade, i.e., under grade Option 1. All mathematics and physical science courses required for the degree must be completed with at least a “C” (2.0) to count as prerequisite courses to engineering courses or as credit towards the degree. Graduate courses are not open to undergraduate students without approval of the department chair or graduate program adviser. Mathematics and Science Courses (32 units) EGME 308 - Engineering Analysis (3) MATH 150A - Calculus I (4) MATH 150B - Calculus II (4) MATH 250A - Calculus III (4) MATH 250B - Introduction to Linear Algebra and Differential Equations (4) CHEM 120A - General Chemistry (5) or CHEM 123 - Chemistry for Engineers (3) * PHYS 225 - Fundamental Physics: Mechanics (3) PHYS 225L - Fundamental Physics: Laboratory (1) PHYS 226 - Fundamental Physics: Electricity and Magnetism (3) PHYS 226L - Fundamental Physics: Laboratory (1) Note * If CHEM 123 is taken in lieu of CHEM 120A, an additional 2 elective units are needed to meet the 120-unit requirement General Education All students at Cal State Fullerton are expected to complete prescribed units of General Education that are made up of courses outside of their chosen disciplines. Students seeking a degree in Engineering have been provided exceptions from some of the General Education requirements. For this reason, it is important that students take the approved G.E. courses for Engineering majors that are found in their Titan Degree Audit (TDA). Additionally, they should confirm the G.E. courses that are required within their specific programs with their respective advisers. Upper-Division Writing Requirement The following courses are required by all mechanical engineering majors: EGME 306A , EGME 306B , EGME 476A and EGME 476B . Written work for these courses must meet professional standards and requires completion with a grade of “C” (2.0) or better. Laboratory reports are graded in English composition, as well as content. Required Courses (53 units) EGCE 201 - Statics (3) EGCE 302 - Dynamics (3) EGEE 203 - Electric Circuits (3) EGEE 203L - Electric Circuits Laboratory (1) EGME 102 - Engineering Graphics (2) EGME 205 - Digital Computation (3) EGME 304 - Thermodynamics (3) EGME 306A - Unified Laboratory (1) EGME 306B - Fluids and Thermal Laboratory (1) EGME 322L - Introduction to Computer-Aided Design (3) EGME 331 - Mechanical Behavior of Materials (3) EGME 333 - Fluid Mechanics (3) EGME 335 - Kinematics of Mechanisms (3) EGME 401 - Engineering Economics and Professionalism (3) EGME 407 - Heat Transfer (3) EGME 414 - Design Project I (3) EGME 419 - Design Project II (2) EGME 421 - Mechanical Design (3) EGME 431 - Mechanical Vibrations (3) EGME 476A - Dynamic Systems and Controls Laboratory (2) EGME 476B - Energy and Power Laboratory (2) Technical Electives (11 units) Select electives from the focus areas below, based on adviser recommendations. Students may count EGME 497 and EGME 499 as electives, but must submit an application form to the adviser and department chair for approval. With adviser approval, technical electives may include up to 3 units of 300- or 400-level coursework from non-engineering departments.
