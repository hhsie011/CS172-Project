The College of Design strives to provide each student with a broad educational background and preparation in a specific design or art discipline. Each program is designed to develop knowledge and appreciation of the physical and cultural environment, to stimulate creative thinking and analysis, and to prepare students for participation in a wide variety of careers. The college’s programs also encompass many opportunities for individualized study and extracurricular activities such as visiting lectures and symposia, workshops, gallery exhibits, practicum and internship programs, field trips, and international study programs. Graduates of the college are employed in private firms, government, industry, and education, or are self-employed as designers or artists. Opportunities for graduates include careers as architects, landscape architects, community and regional planners, graphic designers, industrial designers, interior designers, studio artists, arts administrators and environmental designers. Organization of Curricula All undergraduate programs in the College of Design share a common foundation curriculum, the Core Design Program, followed by degree-specific curricula. The Core Design Program grounds the undergraduate degree programs and provides a rich, rigorous, inclusive base for the college's professional and non-professional programs. It creates a shared language, experience, and community for programs, faculty, and students and exposes students to all design disciplines, allowing them to make more informed degree choices, apply to multiple degree programs, and experiment with interdisciplinary work. The intense, discipline-specific professional curricula that follow the Core Design Program focus on developing students’ ability and knowledge in their major. Within the major area, students advance creative and professional skills through classroom and studio work, critiques of student projects, discussion with professional practitioners, and field studies. General education, contained in both the Core Design Program and the degree programs, is composed to ensure that students receive a well-rounded undergraduate education. High School Preparation Courses in fine arts and design that develop visualization and freehand drawing abilities are highly recommended, though not required for entrance. Students planning to enroll in an academic program in the College of Design must complete the following high school requirements: 4 years of English, including coursework in composition and literature and up to 1 year of speech and/or journalism, to develop communication skills and critical reading/writing ability 3 years of mathematics to develop problem-solving skills, including 1 year each of algebra, geometry, and advanced algebra 3 years of science, including at least two of the following: 1 year of biology, 1 year of chemistry, or 1 year of physics 2 years of social studies, including at least 1 year of U.S. history and 1 semester of U.S. government Admission Standards to Enrollment-Managed Professional Programs Admission into the enrollment-managed professional programs of Architecture, Graphic Design, Industrial Design, Integrated Studio Arts, Interior Design, and Landscape Architecture requires a separate application after completing the Core Design Program. Students may apply directly to the professional program in Community and Regional Planning and to the programs in Art and Design and Interdisciplinary Design. Transfer students from two-year institutions also may apply to these three programs. Advising Each student receives personal assistance from an academic advisor within the student’s curriculum area. Students enrolled in the college’s Core Design Program are advised by professional advisors. Once admitted to professional programs, students are assigned to faculty advisors within the student’s curriculum area. Advisors help students develop a program of study and access pertinent university resources, and provide information on career choice. The college’s career services office works with students to develop their career goals as well as prepare and search for employment. Honors Program The College of Design participates in the Honors Program, which provides opportunities for outstanding students to individualize their programs of study. Honors students in the College of Design will work with the Honors Program chair or Honors academic advisor to choose from academic and co-curricular experiences that offer breadth and depth in their learning, as well as opportunities for personal, community, and professional development.
