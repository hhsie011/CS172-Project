About Us Undergraduate Program Graduate Program Coterminal MS Program Research People News Events Resources Contact Us Understanding our planets and their historyU Our students and geoscientists study the properties of minerals, rocks, soils, sediments and water, using multiple lenses -- stratigraphy, paleobiology, geochemistry, and planetary sciences. Their work informs our understanding of natural hazards such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, and floods. It helps us meet natural resource challenges through environmental and geological engineering, mapping and land use planning, surface and groundwater management, and the exploration and sustainable extraction of energy and minerals. It also helps us answer fundamental questions about the origin, history, and habitability of planets.

The program will be carried into the new school focused on climate and sustainability. Navigate to Thinking beyond the academic degree CNET To find alien life, scientists are unlocking mysteries of Saturn moon Titan After modeling Titan's landscape, researchers led by Stanford geologist Mathieu Lapôtre found the moon exhibits a special type of sedimentary process called sintering, which means neighboring grains smash together and fuse into a bigger, stronger piece that's less destructible by wind. Navigate to To find alien life, scientists are unlocking mysteries of Saturn moon Titan Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment Massive conservation effort California has rolled out plans to protect plant and animal life across 30 percent of the state’s most critical land and water by 2030. Biologists Elizabeth Hadly and Mary Ruckelshaus and environmental law expert Deborah Sivas discuss keys to its success, potential impacts, legal precedents, and more. (Source: Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment) Navigate to Massive conservation effort Stanford Earth Matters Scientists model landscape formation on Titan, revealing an Earth-like alien world A new hypothesis reveals that a global sedimentary cycle driven by seasons could explain the formation of landscapes on Saturn’s moon Titan. The research shows the alien world may be more Earth-like than previously thought.
