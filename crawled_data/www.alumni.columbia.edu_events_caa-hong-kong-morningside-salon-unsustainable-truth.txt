Our lives are split between living every day and accumulating money for our future. We have over $100 trillion invested, more than the size of the global economy, and the planet can no longer produce enough to keep this growing. There is no other way to say it – our savings are killing the planet. CUAAHK would cordially like to invite you to our next Morningside Salon discussion, with Richard Busellato and David Ko, authors of the book The Unsustainable Truth: How Investing for the Future is Destroying the Planet and What to Do About It. David and Richard will share with us their journey from finance to problem-solving on climate-related changes, as well as their research on the driving financial, social, and ethical aspects of sustainability. This event is supported by CBS Alumni Club of Hong Kong and the CVC.
