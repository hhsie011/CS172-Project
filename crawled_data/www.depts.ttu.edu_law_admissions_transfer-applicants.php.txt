Students must submit the following documents: Completed transfer application (available at LSAC.org); Official law school transcripts showing all first-year curriculum; Letter of recommendation from a current law professor at the school the student is transferring from; and, Letter of good standing based on the first-year curriculum, including class rank. In addition to the traditional holistic review, which includes LSAT and undergraduate GPA, preference will be given to applicants who have exhibited academic excellence at their current law school. Transfer Credits Students may transfer up to 30 credit hours. Based on the course syllabi and curriculum, the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs and the Registrar's Office will determine how many credit hours will transfer to Texas Tech Law. The credit for a course taken at another law school will not transfer unless the student receives a grade for the course at or above that law school's grade point average required for graduation. For example, if the other law school requires a C cumulative grade point average for graduation, and the student receives a passing grade lower than a C (e.g. D+), credit for that course will not transfer. Only the credits for courses taken at another law school will be recorded on a student's Texas Tech Law transcript. The grades for these courses will not be recorded on the student's transcript and will not be used to compute the student's cumulative grade point average at Texas Tech Law. For more information please visit our Transfer of Course Credits Policy. Visiting Applicants An applicant may apply to be a visiting student as long as he or she is in good standing at another ABA-accredited law school. Credits earned at Texas Tech Law will need to be approved by the student's home institution. A visiting student applicant must submit the following: Completed visiting application (available at LSAC.org); Official law school transcript; and, Letter of permission from home institution stating that credits at Texas Tech Law will be accepted and applied toward their degree requirements. For more information about attending Texas Tech Law as a visiting student, please call the Office of Admissions at 806-742-3792.
