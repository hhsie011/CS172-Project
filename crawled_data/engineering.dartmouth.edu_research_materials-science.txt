Materials science and engineering (MSE) research at Dartmouth supports discovery in fundamental applied engineering as well as translational science in areas such as ice physics, nano- and bio-materials, energy harvesting and storage, and materials modeling. A diversity of concentrations is offered with collaborative synergies between the biological and chemical, biomedical, electrical and computer, energy, and mechanical, operations and systems engineering research areas. Graduate engineering students are expected to propose a plan of study that supports their interests, potentially including distinctive intellectual paths unconstrained by disciplinary boundaries and enriched by interdisciplinary synergies. MSE research addresses key challenges in the following sub-areas supported by leading faculty in their fields. On This Page Mechanical Behavior of Structural Materials Properties of Functional Materials Biomaterials Energy Materials Microfabrication Computational Materials Science & Modeling Mechanical Behavior of Structural Materials Increasing our fundamental understanding of structural materials leads to advances in manufacturing, construction, energy systems, medicine, and environmental science, to name just a few. Research focused on ice- and polar-related phenomena can not only facilitate planning for a more resilient future but also be applicable to metals, ceramics and other crystalline materials. Improving the durability of mechanical components and developing advanced composite materials—as well as better understanding the role of mechanical forces and shape engineering—can have significant economic ramifications throughout industry, particularly in the energy, manufacturing, medical and transportation sectors. Research Subfields Composite material systems Deformation and fracture mechanics Glaciology and climate Intermetallic compounds Polymer wear and processing Snow, firn and ice physics Thin structure mechanics Researchers Mary R. Albert Ian Baker Yan Li Erland M. Schulson Douglas W. Van Citters Properties of Functional Materials Functional materials—classified on the basis of the functions they can perform—represent a fast growing set of advanced materials and composites, some properties of which (shape, electrical conductivity, mechanical properties, color etc.) are responsive to external stimuli. Because of their unique properties, these materials are advancing innovation in the areas of energy conversion and storage, sensing, electronics, photonics, and biomedicine. Research Subfields Electronic assembly High-performance printed and flexible devices Micromechanical and electromechanical systems (MEMS) Multifunctional nanomaterials Nanomaterials design and synthesis Optoelectronic materials and devices Researchers Hui Fang Katie Hixon Christopher G. Levey Weiyang (Fiona) Li Jifeng Liu William Scheideler Charles R. Sullivan Biomaterials Advances in biomaterials facilitate biomedical research and inspire novel designs for implantable and bio-inspired devices. Research focused on orthopedic implants strives to optimize materials for weight, strength, formability, customization, and cost. Material-specific testing of implant retrievals is done to assess and understand changes that occur in vivo as part of the ultimate goal of improving patient outcomes. Work toward better synthetic tissue substitutes is also ongoing with the challenge of developing materials that mimic both the structure and mechanical performance of natural tissue and permit strong tissue-implant interfaces. Research Subfields Biomimetic materials and devices Orthopaedic implant analysis and behavior Tissue engineering Researchers Ian Baker Katie Hixon Yan Li Douglas W. Van Citters Energy Materials Materials play a critical role in achieving a sustainable energy future. High-temperature materials enable power plants to increase their operating temperature which increases their efficiency. Demand for high-performance permanent magnets is growing for applications such as wind turbines and electric and hybrid cars. New materials for power electronics can help increase efficiency and reduce both size and cost and are also key for development of low-power sensors and energy harvesting for hybrid electronics. In the case of solar cells, it is highly desirable to use naturally abundant, environmentally-friendly materials which can also pave the way for novel cost-effective battery systems as well as sustainable lighting technology for the 21st century. Research Subfields Energy harvesting Energy storage and conversion devices Fast reactor fuel materials High-performance permanent magnets High temperature materials Power electronics Solar and thermophotovoltaic cells Researchers Ian Baker Christopher G. Levey Weiyang (Fiona) Li Yan Li Jifeng Liu William Scheideler Charles R. Sullivan Microfabrication Microfabrication research spans a broad range of disciplines, including electrical, mechanical, and chemical engineering, physics, computer science, and robotics as well as materials science. One of the biggest challenges is devising an efficient means of assembling small parts such as with self-assembly methods or with microrobots that can work together in a microfactory. Applications include cybersecurity, thin-film solar cells, and printed and flexible devices. Research Subfields 3D nanomanufacturing Micro-robot fabrication Self-assembled nanophotonic structures Researchers Christopher G. Levey Jifeng Liu William Scheideler Computational Materials Science & Modeling Computational methods and modeling as applied to materials science enable prediction and optimization of the properties and behavior of new materials, particularly at the nanoscale. Microstructural evolution occurs by a variety of mechanisms and the ability to predict its effects on the macroscopic properties of materials has a wide range of applications.
