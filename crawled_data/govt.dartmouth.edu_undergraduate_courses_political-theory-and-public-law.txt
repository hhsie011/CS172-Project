We will examine the ways in which human decision-making rises to the occasion and meets the aims of the justice system, and the ways in which we fall short. We will examine the biases inherent in human decision-making, the assumptions underlying the justice system (and whether they are supported by scientific evidence), the ways in which investigative and courtroom procedures may enhance or reduce the ability of human beings to execute the law free from bias and prejudice.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Government About Why Government?
