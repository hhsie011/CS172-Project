The title of our journal, "Quaesitum", is a Latin term denoting that which is sought as the objective of inquiry. We strive to provide a venue for the inquisitive endeavors of UofM authors who will in turn spark curiosity in readers. Students from all academic disciplines are showcased in Quaesitum. Faculty reviewers with specialized knowledge and experience publishing in the author's area of research contribute suggestions for refining manuscripts. Papers are then polished with the guidance of Quaesitum's editorial staff. Authors gain first-hand experience in the academic publishing process. Authors also receive editorial comments and specialized feedback relevant to their research topic which helps shape their work into professional research articles. The submission deadline for Quaesitum is the first day of classes each spring semester. The journal is published every summer.
