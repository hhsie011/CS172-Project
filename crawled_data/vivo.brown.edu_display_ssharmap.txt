He has expertise in reproductive biology and reproductive immunology with long term research interests in placental biology, reproductive immunology, and pathogenesis of adverse pregnancy outcomes. This long-standing experience provides an excellent foundation for the work proposed. His long-standing experience in research has addressed uterine immunity, cytokine imbalance, hormonal regulation, and angiogenic dysregulation in pregnancy complications. His recent work has provided novel insights into the etiology of preeclampsia. His research team has developed a well-defined “humanized mouse model” for preeclampsia. His recent work has also identified systemic and placental targets and mechanistic pathways for the effects of gene-environment interactions on pregnancy. His laboratory for the first time has demonstrated that protein misfolding and aggregation are key components of the preeclampsia etiology. This work has highlighted the role of proteins such as transthyretin, transporter of thyroxine and retinol, and amyloid precursor protein in the placenta, suggesting a mechanistic similarity between preeclampsia and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease. Even more significant are the observations that aggregated transthyretin could induce preeclampsia-like features in pregnant mice. This work and other projects on placental development and uterine immunity have allowed us to actively collaborate with National and International research groups. Dr. Sharma has served as a member of numerous NIH and American Diabetes Association (ADA) review panels. He recently completed his tenure as President of the American Society for Reproductive Immunology (2010-2012) and continues to be on the Society’s Executive Committee. He has organized and chaired numerous National and International scientific meetings. Dr. Sharma was the recipient of the 2007 Blackwell Munksgaard Award for outstanding research in Reproductive Immunology. He recently received the 2014 Distinguished Service Award from the American Society for Reproductive Immunology. He served as an Associate Editor of the Journal of Immunology and currently serves as a member of the Editorial Board of the American Journal of Reproductive Immunology. He is the Principal Investigator/Director of the NIH-funded Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) for Reproductive Health.

He has expertise in reproductive biology and reproductive immunology with long term research interests in placental biology, reproductive immunology, and pathogenesis of adverse pregnancy outcomes. This long-standing experience provides an excellent foundation for the work proposed. His long-standing experience in research has addressed uterine immunity, cytokine imbalance, hormonal regulation, and angiogenic dysregulation in pregnancy complications. Research Statement Dr. Surendra Sharma is Professor of Pediatrics and Director of Center of Biomedical Research Excellence at Women and Infants HospitalBrown University, Providence, Rhode Island, USA. He is an internationally known investigator in the field of Immune Programming of Pregnancy and Associated Disorders and has served as President of the American Society for Reproductive Immunology. He has served as a member on review boards for the NIH and the American Diabetes Association as well as on editorial boards of several journals. His academic interests are as follows.His lab works on human and pre-clinical models and therapeutic options for pregnancy complications. His group has recentlr published on a "humanized mouse model" of preeclampsia, a devastating pregnancy syndrome. Importantly, his recent work has led to the novel findings of a mechanistic and an epidemiological link between preeclampsia and Alzheimer's disease. This work suggests that protein aggregation and impaired autophagy are main contributors to the pathophysiology of preeclampsia. His long-standing experience in research has addressed uterine immunity, cytokine imbalance, hormonal regulation, and angiogenic dysregulation in pregnancy complications.
