A facilitated meeting with the Ombuds Office offers an informal forum for individuals to share their concerns directly with those involved in a structured and respectful way. We will key in on recurring issues, discuss a range of solutions or approaches and maintain a positive flow to keep everyone focused on moving forward. The objective is not to focus on the past instead to focus on what can be done in the future.
