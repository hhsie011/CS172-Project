VAWA provides domestic violence survivors with the means that are essential to escaping violence and establishing safe, independent lives. Under the law, students and employees who are victims or survivors of sexual and interpersonal violence receive the same rights under Title IX and the VAWA, regardless of immigration and visa status. Cornell will not retaliate against you or treat you differently on the basis of reporting a crime, and will protect you from retaliation if you do report. International students and scholars with questions about their immigration and visa status are advised to utilize the following resources: Immigration and Visa Information for Victims of Sexual and Interpersonal Violence (Cornell’s Office of Global Learning) Immigration Options for Victims of Crimes (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services) Immigrant Legal Resource Center (ILRC) publications, information, and guidance Contact Us Cornell University Office of Institutional Equity and Title IX Day Hall, Suite 500 (Fifth Floor) 607-255-2242 titleix@cornell.edu Report an Incident © 2014 Cornell University Facebook Twitter YouTube Hosted by CampusPress Skip to toolbar Log In Search
