MMR: New York State public health law and University policy requires that all students born on or after January 1, 1957 document immunity to measles, mumps, and rubella. This requirement applies before a student is permitted to register for their first term at Columbia. Meningitis decision: New York State public health law and University policy require that students must also document that they either have received the meningococcus meningitis vaccine (MenACWY) or have declined to receive it. This requirement applies before a student is permitted to register for their first term at Columbia. COVID-19: University policy requires that students must provide documentation of being up to date with COVID-19 vaccinations. You are up to date with your COVID-19 vaccines when you have received all doses in the primary series and all boosters recommended for you, when eligible. Completion of the vaccine process is defined as completion of the initial vaccination and booster dose(s): Initial vaccination At least 14 days after the second dose of a two-dose vaccine At least 14 days after receiving a single dose vaccine (currently only the Janssen/Johnson&Johnson vaccine) At least 14 days after your booster dose, if eligible Eligibility: In general, at least five months after the last dose of your initial Pfizer or Moderna series (or other WHO-authorized vaccine) or two months after the initial J & J vaccination All students are expected to complete the COVID-19 vaccine process at least 14 days before first accessing University facilities or participating in in-person University-approved activities to ensure they are considered fully vaccinated at the time of first access. Fall 2022 students must complete the primary vaccination and booster (if eligible) in order to register for, or remain registered for, fall 2022 courses. Continuing students that register in the spring/summer and fail to complete this requirement are subject to de-registration from fall courses before the start of the fall 2022 term. Seasonal Influenza: Columbia University policy requires that students receive, or provide documentation they have received, the seasonal influenza vaccine between August 1 of the Fall term and May 1 of the Spring term. Staff that are also students are required to get the flu vaccine due to their student status. For students new to the University in the Spring term, this requirement applies before a student is permitted to register for their first term at Columbia. Students must upload documentation in the Upload Immunization Files section and enter the date the vaccine was received in the Medical Clearances section of the Columbia Health Patient Portal (step-by-step instructions). Students must submit immunization documentation upon admission or at least 30 days prior to their scheduled registration date. Compliance with all current vaccine requirements must be confirmed before students are permitted to register. Populations While all Columbia students are subject to immunization requirements, the process details contained herein apply to the following schools: Graduate School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation Graduate School of Arts Graduate School of Arts & Sciences Columbia Business School Columbia Climate School Columbia College Columbia Journalism School Columbia Law School Fu Foundation School of Engineering & Applied Sciences School of General Studies School of International & Public Affairs School of Professional Studies School of Social Work Students enrolled in the following schools must follow the processes managed by Student Health on Haven and may include additional requirements: College of Dental Medicine School of Nursing Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons Mailman School of Public Health Students enrolled in the following schools must follow the process and procedures as outlined by their respective schools: Barnard College Jewish Theological Seminary Teachers College Union Theological Seminary Students Students that intend to access campus for any reason at any time, including those registered only for online courses, are subject to this requirement. Any student that fails to complete the requirement or has not received a medical or religious exemption for the required vaccines shall not be permitted to access University facilities nor engage in any in-person, University-recognized activities. Immunization Requirement by Student Type Student Type Permitted to register for on campus classes (includes online programs where in person classes are permitted) MMR, Meningitis Decision, COVID-19, Seasonal Flu ✓ Student Type Study Abroad (CU-registered) MMR, Meningitis Decision, COVID-19, Seasonal Flu ✓ Student Type Not permitted to register for on campus classes MMR, Meningitis Decision, COVID-19, Seasonal Flu ✗ Student Type Study Abroad (Non-CU registered; eg.

This requirement applies even if the primary purpose for access to University facilities is a role other than student. Expand all Collapse all Ways to Document Immunity Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) Provide a certificate of immunization verifying the date of the disease or the administered measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines. All immunizations must have been received on or after your first birthday. This includes documents such as: Completed and signed Columbia MMR form (preferred) Certificate from a licensed physician Migrant health record Union health record Community health plan record Military dependent “shot” record Immunization record card signed by a physician, physician's assistant, or nurse practitioner It is important for you to maintain a copy, as often the forms are illegible or lack identifying information required to process the documentation. If you do not use the Columbia University MMR Form be sure to include your UNI on all uploaded documents. All documentation must be submitted in English or accompanied by a certified translation (at the student’s expense). Verification of documentation is at the sole discretion of Columbia Health. Additional information or documentation may be requested and if requested must be provided in order to verify a submission. Live Measles: 2 doses required. Vaccines must have been administered at least 28 days apart. Measles vaccine doses administered prior to 1968 are not valid unless documentation specifically states it was a LIVE vaccine. Live Mumps: 1 injection required. Vaccine was not available in the United States until January 1, 1969; therefore, no statement of immunization administered before that date is acceptable. Live Rubella: 1 injection required. Vaccine was not available in the U.S. until January 1, 1969; therefore, no statement of immunization administered before that date is acceptable. Note: The MMR combined vaccination fulfills the requirement for 1 measles, 1 mumps, and 1 rubella immunization. A second measles shot is required. The MMR combined vaccine was not available in the U.S. before January 1, 1972; therefore, no immunizations administered before that date are acceptable for U.S. students. MMR Vaccine or Blood Test at Columbia If you are unable to locate your immunization documentation, Medical Services offers the MMR vaccine and titer (blood) test. The vaccine and blood test should be completed at least 30 days prior to registering for classes. Medical Services is located on the third floor of John Jay Hall. Please note that the results of the blood test may take 3-5 business days. Costs for meeting the pre-matriculation requirements at Medical Services: $150 for the MMR Titer $180 for each MMR Dose All fees must be paid before the titer or vaccine will be administered. Documented History of Illness If diagnosed by a physician, a history of having had measles or mumps is acceptable proof of immunity for the respective disease. Provide documentation verifying the date of the disease. Alternatively, a physician or health care provider must enter the dates of initial diagnosis on the Columbia University MMR Form; students must also complete the student section of this form. A diagnosis of previous rubella disease is not acceptable proof of immunity under the New York State Health Code. Immunity Proven by Serologic Testing Immunity to all three diseases may be proven by a single blood test for antibodies. You must submit a copy of the actual laboratory report containing the date of test, antibody level, and reference range along with the completed student section of the Columbia University MMR Form. Documentation from Another School College or university: Complete the student section of the Columbia University MMR Form and submit it along with a copy of your immunization record. Since requirements vary by state and country, your record is reviewed for compliance with New York State standards High School: Complete the student section of the Columbia University MMR Form and submit it with the high school immunization certificate for review. The New York State Department of Health is encouraging high schools to provide a copy of the certificate to students when they graduate. Meningitis (MenACWY) New York State public health law requires that college and university students receive information from their institutions about meningococcal meningitis and the MenACWY vaccine that protects against most strains of the disease that can occur on university campuses. Columbia students must make an informed decision about being vaccinated, intent to be vaccinated, or declination of vaccination and must certify their decision online. The process only takes two to three minutes. Students must formally indicate their decision about being vaccinated before they will be permitted to register for classes. It is required that students submit their documentation upon admission or at least 30 days prior to their scheduled registration date. For this reason, all incoming students are placed on hold prior to their first registration. All documentation must be submitted in English or accompanied by a certified translation (at the student’s expense). Verification of documentation is at the sole discretion of Columbia Health. Additional information or documentation may be requested and if requested must be provided in order to verify a submission. Note: If a student indicated they have received the vaccine they must also upload proof of the vaccine and it must be verified by Columbia in order for this requirement to be completed. COVID-19 To protect the health and well-being of the community, Columbia University requires all students to receive a primary vaccine series and booster against COVID-19. Columbia University accepts all vaccines authorized/approved by the US Food and Drug Administration or the World Health Organization. Additionally, individuals who have participated in a phase 2 vaccine trial in the United States will be considered fully vaccinated in the absence of formal FDA authorization if the following conditions are met: (1) the phase 3 trial results have been published; (2) student participants are confirmed by the study investigators to have received the complete vaccine regimen; and (3) the sponsor has submitted for formal FDA authorization. At present this only applies to the Novavax vaccine. Please upload the documentation you have in the Medical Clearances section of the Patient Portal (step-by-step instructions) and Columbia Health will review. Anyone not meeting requirements or needing to submit additional information will receive outreach from Columbia Health. All students are expected to complete the vaccine process at least 14 days before first accessing University facilities or participating with University approved activities to ensure they are considered fully vaccinated. In limited situations where a student has difficulty accessing an approved vaccine, the student can receive the vaccine from the University at no out-of-pocket cost. Until fully vaccinated, such students will be required to comply with additional COVID-19 requirements and other preventive measures in place at that time. All records must include the following: Student Name Date of Birth Name of vaccine received Date of vaccination(s) Provider name, signature, or stamp Vaccines Received from Columbia Health Students who receive a vaccine from Columbia Health on the Morningside campus have their records updated automatically and do not need to upload records.

Exemptions Columbia University is committed to providing a safe, inclusive, and supportive experience for all students and recognizes medical contraindications to vaccination as well as student observance of their faith as it pertains to the practice of immunization. To request a medical or religious exemption, please complete the appropriate request forms (see below), read the required Vaccine Information Information (see forms for links), attach all supplemental materials, and upload all documents to the Columbia Health Patient Portal. Students requesting an exemption must submit separate forms for each vaccine exemption request. Exemptions requests will not be considered if incomplete documentation is received. Each complete request is carefully reviewed and a determination is made based on the information submitted. All requests are considered and reviewed, but approval is not guaranteed. Decisions are final, not subject to appeal, and will be shared in a determination letter sent to your University email. Students may provide a new request with new supporting documentation if information changes. Please note that all exemptions are temporary and must be renewed as noted in the instructions. Please allow a minimum of 15 business days for requests to be processed and requests will not be expedited.

Yes. You will be notified via your Columbia email address only if you need to provide additional information. How long will it take for my registration hold to be removed? Immunization records are processed in order of receipt. At the start of the academic semester, it may take a few days for your documentation to be processed and for the hold to be removed. You should also check that you have properly completed the online meningococcal meningitis requirement. Please allow up to 15 business days for processing. How will I know that the hold has been removed? Check your hold status by logging into your SSOL account. If I am in the process of completing the vaccinations (MMR & COVID-19), will I be permitted to register for classes (MMR) or access campus (COVID-19) before having the second dose? Usually. Once we have verified your proof of having received the 1st dose, you will be able to register for classes (MMR) or access campus (COVID-19). Since it is medically necessary that you wait for at least 21-28 days between vaccines, you are granted temporary compliance for 28 days from the date on which the first dose was administered. You will become fully compliant only by submitting proof of the second dose. Students that fail to receive the second dose in a timely manner may be subject to de-registration from all courses or blocked from accessing campus, and may not receive tuition and fee refunds. I have a copy of my immunization records; do I need to have my doctor complete the Columbia MMR form? Students may submit an official copy of their immunization history and lab results in place of having a physician complete the MMR form. Be sure to include your full name, date of birth, and UNI on the documentation. Additionally, complete the student section of the Columbia MMR form and submit along with your official records. Where can I get more information on the COVID-19 Vaccine and Requirement? Please visit the Columbia University COVID-19 website. How do you protect the privacy of my information? Columbia Health makes every effort to protect the privacy of submitted information. Please review our Notice of Privacy Practices and Vaccine Status Privacy Notice for more details.
