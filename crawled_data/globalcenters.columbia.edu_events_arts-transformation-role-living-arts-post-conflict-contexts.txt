9:00 PM Columbia Global Centers l Paris, 4 rue de Chevreuse, 75006 In 2016, Cambodian Living Arts convened a forum in Phnom Penh, inviting 40 arts activators from 20 countries around the world to explore practices, partnerships and possibilities for their essential work in the arts, through the lens of post conflict. 2 years later, on the eve of the European premiere of "Bangsokol: A Requiem for Cambodia," three of the participants will be in conversation - discussing developments in the sector, evolving challenges and opportunities in the current global context and how arts can play a more central role in conflict transformation and peacebuilding. Convened by: Cambodian Living Arts & Columbia Global Center Paris PANELLISTS Phloeun Prim A visionary cultural entrepreneur, Phloeun has spearheaded Cambodian Living Arts’ transformation from a grassroots project reviving traditional arts to the leading cultural agency in Cambodia. Phloeun has led the organization as it extended its reach from local to international programming and evolved its role from straightforward transmission of traditions to stimulating expression and innovation. Born during the genocide, Phloeun is proud to have returned to Cambodia and be part of the movement using the arts for healing, social transformation, and economic development.
