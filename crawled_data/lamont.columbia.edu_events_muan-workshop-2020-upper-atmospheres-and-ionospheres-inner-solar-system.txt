Other bodies, such as comets and moons are also welcome. The objective is to embrace comparative studies between different planetary bodies in addition to the usual Mars aeronomy and plasma physics discussions, as this will lead to a better understanding of the role of upper atmospheres on planetary evolution and habitability at Mars and in the Solar System. The main topics for discussion are: -Planetary aeronomy - past, present and future. -Thermosphere-ionosphere-magnetosphere-exosphere (TIME) coupling. -Lower-upper atmosphere connections. A significant part of the workshop will be devoted to brainstorming and opportunities to discuss different science aspects, and to help establish fruitful collaborations. Our workshop will be co-hosted by the Center for Climate Systems Research at the Columbia Earth Institute. There will be opportunities to present posters or talks. The workshop will be limited to 100 attendees, so to aid us in planning, we encourage all those interested to please indicate your interest here: https://bit.ly/37Obwp9 SOC: Beatriz Sanchez-Cano (University of Leicester) David Andrews (Swedish Institute of Space Physics) Mark Lester (University of Leicester) Robert Lillis (UC Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory) Hermann Opgenoorth (Umea University) Dmitri Titov (ESA) Michael J.
