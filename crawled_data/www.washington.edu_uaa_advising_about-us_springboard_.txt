The reality of a "sophomore slump" is not unique to UW, and is a well researched reality that is common at universities nationwide. Springboard Programs To support students as they transition into their second year at the University of Washington, UAA Advising leads Springboard - a suite of interventions in the first year that promote meaningful experiences in the second year. While some Springboard activities run the entire academic year, others specifically target students in their final quarter of their first year.

Advising Guides Advising Guides help students craft an undergraduate experience that is meaningful to them. These guides are designed to help students reflect on their goals and interests, while navigating the various academic and co-curricular opportunities available at UW. Advising Guides have been developed for first-year students, second-year students, and transfer students. Advising Guides Dinner with the Pack Dinner with the Pack brings together UW students and alumni for conversations about undergraduate academics, co-curricular involvement, and the ways in which a UW undergraduate education will contribute to a meaningful life post-graduation. Learn More Academic Planning Workshops UAA Advising partners with several capacity constrained departments to offer workshops for students not admitted to a particular major. Led by Academic Advisers, and developed in collaboration with departments, these workshops support students as they develop an academic plan, prepare for co-curricular involvement related to their academic interests, and set goals for future quarters. Contact Allie Carpenter, alliecar@uw.edu, for collaboration opportunities. Partnership with Housing and Food Services Throughout the academic year, UAA Advising partners with Housing and Food Services to offer passive programming to students. Topics include major exploration, major to career myth busting, alumni stories, registration tips, and academic transition.

Alumni Spotlight Brian Kuranishi 2020, Communication (BA) & Interdisciplinary Visual Arts (BA) When I first came to the University of Washington, I had my heart set on being an artist and pursuing a degree in Art. After my first few quarters, I decided to explore around and came across an Introduction to Communication class. It was in this class that sparked something inside of me. This set me on a path which opened the doors for me to be able to study something that I was passionate about in different avenues through art and communication.
