To safeguard vulnerable works of art, soldiers and workers set up masonry supports for buildings, braced statues with wood planks, padded monuments with sandbags, wrapped delicate marble columns in wool, laid mattresses over frescoes, and—where possible—shipped paintings and statues to safer locations. Italy’s national heritage was immediately mobilized as a propaganda tool, with photographs documenting protective efforts and also war damage to paintings, frescoes, and churches.
