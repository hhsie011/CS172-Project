AND WHEREAS, Wichita State University must establish and maintain a culture that welcomes and promotes the free exchange of ideas to fulfill its role and mission. AND WHEREAS the University may reasonably regulate the time, place, or manner of expression to preserve its mission, its normal functions, and the use of its buildings, facilities, and grounds. AND WHEREAS higher education institutions like Wichita State University cannot allow the erosion of the essential commitment to free speech necessary for a free society and should explore the most challenging, complex, and provocative ideas and debates in culture today. AND WHEREAS universities are central to defending free speech and expression in society, and Wichita State University respects and supports academic freedom in the classroom where faculty and students can engage in intellectual debate without fear of censorship. AND WHEREAS Wichita State University may not support certain messages, the University recognizes it is inappropriate for the University to attempt to censor ideas and opinions even when the University community believes them to be disagreeable. AND WHEREAS the diverse ideas of the members of the Wichita State University community may naturally conflict, it is for individual members of our University community, not the University as an institution, to make value judgments, and to act on those judgments, not by seeking to suppress speech, but by openly and vigorously contesting the ideas they oppose. NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT WICHITA STATE UNIVERSITY supports the University of Chicago Foundation Principles for Free Expression and Open Discourse which offers a useful framework for preserving independent thought and critical inquiry. Wichita State University will not shy away from exploring uncomfortable topics or discussions on campus but will instead foster an environment where difficult discussions can take place to challenge the University community, to help them grow intellectually, and to allow everyone to fully and responsibly practice and promote freedom of expression and inquiry.
