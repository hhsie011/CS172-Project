He holds a PhD degree in Geography from University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). Mwenda’s research focuses on changing spatial patterns of health outcomes such as infectious disease and undernutrition among vulnerable populations around the world, and how these patterns are influenced by various environmental, climatic and socioeconomic factors. Prior to arriving at Brown, Mwenda served as the Manager of the Social Demography Laboratory at the UCSB Broom Center for Demography, and previously worked as a GIS & Spatial Analysis Specialist at Dartmouth College. Mwenda’s research interests include designing and applying methods that explore, analyze and visualize spatial patterns within health data, to better understand human-environment dynamics (e.g. population health, climate and society), and the role humans play at the nexus among these.
