The world urgently needs leaders with capacity in the areas of policy, finance, and clean technology; in 2017, the International Energy Agency estimated that $3.5 trillion per year in energy investments would be required until 2050 to offset the rise in carbon emissions. Of these, approximately $1 trillion per year must be dedicated to the deployment and financing of clean energy. The challenges—and the opportunities—are both immense and immediate. To tackle them, all must come together to develop innovative approaches to how we produce, distribute, and consume energy. It requires a cross-sectoral approach and an interdisciplinary lens. It requires an informed workforce and powerful knowledge networks. And it requires sharp skills and a willingness to learn. This is precisely why the Yale Center for Business and the Environment (CBEY) has drawn on its vast network of professionals and on the expertise of Yale faculty to offer a unique program marrying academic rigor with practical skills. This program offers Yale's expertise in a condensed, user-friendly format to professionals who need to better understand the interplay of the financial, technological, and socioeconomic drivers in financing and deploying renewable energy. Admissions to the FDCE '23 program will open on January 11, 2022, and close on March 20, 2022. Learn More and Apply You can also get on our mailing list by filling out the form below.
