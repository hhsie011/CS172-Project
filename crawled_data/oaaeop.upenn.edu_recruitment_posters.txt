Some of the statutes, regulations, and laws enforced by agencies within the Department of Labor stipulate posters must be displayed conspicuously in and around areas frequented by all employees. Failure to keep these notices up to date can result in substantial fines and employee lawsuits. Government regulations mandate the display of certain posters in areas where a majority of employees tend to congregate. The Office of Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity Programs (OAA•EOP) maintains display cases on the main campus and hospitals, ensuring that these posters are kept current. If you have posters in your area or need additional posters and need assistance on how to keep them current in accordance with regulatory requirements, please contact the OAA•EOP at (215) 898-6993, or email us at oaaeop@pobox.upenn.edu.
