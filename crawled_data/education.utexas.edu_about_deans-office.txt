The College of Education is in a unique position to answer this call to action. Together, we will continue to build on the college’s strengths, developing and disseminating evidence-based practices that make a real difference for children, schools, and communities. The strong binds that connect the college to diverse communities of practice will continue to be honored and nurtured, and they will serve as a bridge to developing a diverse workforce of educators and health professionals who will teach and lead in ways that promote equity and social justice. As someone who was a first-generation college student, I have a deeply held belief in the transformative power of education. I feel a sense of urgency to address the longstanding opportunity gaps and education and health disparities that persistently affect our most vulnerable students, families, and communities. I can think of no better venue to move this sense of urgency into bold action than the College of Education at the University of Texas at Austin. The college is in a position of national prominence and is poised to advance its standing as a world leader in addressing the increasingly multifaceted challenges in education and health by harnessing individual and community assets, and bridging research and practice. I am excited to be part of it. CHARLES R.
