You’ll be happy to discover that there are many forms of support available to you as a part-time student. There’s financial aid for matriculated students who enroll for at least six credits and demonstrate financial need. There are a variety of grants and scholarships targeted specifically to part-time students, from both federal and College of Professional Studies sources. Some, like the merit-based Achiever Scholarship for transfer students, offer significant savings. At University College, there’s even a child care grant for students who have children who need supervision while their parents attend classes and study.
