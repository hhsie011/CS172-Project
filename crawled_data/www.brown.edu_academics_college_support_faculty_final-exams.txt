The dates and times of exams are arranged so that students will not be taking multiple exams at the same hour. While individual faculty members may choose not to give a final exam in a course (substituting a final paper assignment, for example), they are not permitted to change the assigned date of a final exam. When assigning a paper or project instead of an exam, it is advisable to make the due date on the scheduled exam date whenever possible.
