The nine million Africans came to the Americas between 1492 and 1800 more than tripled the number of European immigrants during the period. Two million more arrived between the supposed abolition of slavery was declared by the British government in 1807, and by mid-century. The fact that this movement is directed to areas where the Aboriginal population was meager, or had disappeared as a cultural group, amplified its demographic, economic and socio-cultural impact. Today the number of Afro-descendants in the Americas is estimated at 180 million and they represent the majority of the population in almost twenty countries. This lecture deals with the African presence in the Americas not from the perspective of the historiography of slavery - that is immense - but as part of the history of migration and socio-racial formations in the New World.
