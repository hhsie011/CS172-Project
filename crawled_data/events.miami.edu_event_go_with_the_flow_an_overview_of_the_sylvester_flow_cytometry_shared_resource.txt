FCSR services facilitate a broad array of research, including studies on single cell genomics, apoptosis, gene expression, drug metabolism, immune responses, and pathways of cellular activation, both normal and tumor related. Cutting-edge technologies available in the FCSR include spectral cytometry and mass cytometry instruments that can significantly expand the number of parameters simultaneously assessed. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) instruments include 3 cell sorters, including the BD FACSAria Fusion, plus a new walk-up sorter (CytoFLEX) is on order. The FCSR also has 4 flow cytometry analyzers, including the Cytek Aurora, plus a new analyzer (BD FACSymphony A5 SE) is on order. Moreover, the FCSR provides mass cytometry and imaging mass cytometry services with the Fluidigm CyTOF, with the capability of analyzing cells in suspension or solid tissues, and a repository of validated antibodies and a heavy metal-antibody custom conjugation service in support of the use of the CyTOF system. FCSR resources also include the ALS CellCelector, which can perform automated transfer of single cells, cell colonies, clusters and spheroids from culture plates. Data analysis support includes access to software solutions for multiplexed suspension and spatial multi-omics studies. The FCSR was recently recognized by the International Society for the Advancement of Cytometry (ISAC) as a Center of Excellence in implementing and following best practices in cytometry. This seminar will cover the existing and new instruments and services of the FCSR and discuss their high impact applications in research projects.
