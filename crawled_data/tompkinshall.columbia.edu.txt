Tompkins Hall Nursery and Childcare Home Mission Early childhood education through the joyful exploration of the self, others and the natural world. Our Approach Education is a social experience and one by which, experience is defined and internalized through thoughtful reflection. Each child is an active, contributing member of the community. Our classrooms provide a welcoming, deliberate arena for children to utilize their intellect and creativity. As educators, we shape the meaningful experiences through which children discuss, collaborate and grow. Teachers are social and intellectual resources for our students.
