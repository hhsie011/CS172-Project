5:30 PM Columbia Global Centers | Beijing, No. 26, 1F Core Plaza, 1 Shanyuan Street, Zhongguancun, Haidian District, Beijing The frequent and serious disasters triggered by climate change are causing losses to major assets all over the world. According to CDP's forecast, 215 of the world's largest companies will lose nearly USD 1 trillion due to climate change in the next five years. In May 2019, the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong proposed to require listed companies to disclose major climate related matters in their Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) reports therefore to take the corresponding actions. This new rule requires companies to examine the risks and impacts of climate change on their businesses and investors. In March 2019, Shanghai Stock Exchange made mandatory disclosure requirements for ESG related information on the listing of Sci-Tech innovation board. At the same time, in mainland China, the ESG information disclosure framework of listed companies has been formed, at the basis of which, the mandatory environmental information disclosure system of listed companies will be formed step by step. However, according to the survey and feedback being conducted, it shows that a large number of enterprises are still not familiar with the climate risk management, therefore it is difficult to establish a correlation between climate change and their own businesses, further the relevant disclosure information is not powerful enough to let the investors make informed decisions. In this regard, on November 21, Columbia Global Centers | Beijing and CBCA will hold a workshop to lead a discussion on the topic of the challenges faced by enterprises in climate risk management, from the perspectives of interpretation of the ESG information disclosure rules, climate risk management tools, solutions to climate change, in the purpose of comprehensively discuss the value of the climate risk management and climate strategy in the context of sustainable development of enterprises, further to provide referential suggestions and practical solutions to enterprises in facing challenges triggered by climate change.
