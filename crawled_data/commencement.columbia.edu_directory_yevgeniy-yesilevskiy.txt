He focuses on project-based and active-learning courses that seek to engage and improve engineering education through the design process. In his courses he guides students towards solving open-ended problems. By having students face uncertainty in their classes, he prepares them to be the next generation of innovators. For his efforts, he was awarded the 2021 Edward and Carole Kim Faculty Involvement Award. During the COVID-19 pandemic, he took the lead on creating a novel face shield design that was deployed in New York City hospitals. Additionally, he spearheaded the creation of project kits that allowed mechanical engineering students to maintain their hands-on education at home. Prior to Columbia, he received his PhD in 2018 from the University of Michigan for his work in legged robotic optimal energetics.
