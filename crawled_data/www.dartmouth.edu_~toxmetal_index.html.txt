We communicate our results to communities, grass-roots organizations, and state and federal agencies, and we train students to conduct research from both a clinical and community-based perspective. We hope you will be inspired to ask questions about our work, and will learn about the ways these metals may affect your health. NEW!! PFAS in NH Fact Sheet!! Check it out!
