Carter Brown Architecture Lectures Performances Workshops Blog Partnerships Community partnerships are crucial to the work of the John Nicholas Brown Center for Public Humanities and Cultural Heritage. These partnerships – with arts, cultural, and historical organizations throughout the state, region, and even the world – develop through our common engagement with the challenge of doing public intellectual and artistic work. They enrich and advance our work, providing a space for sharing knowledge and for thinking together through questions, such as the connection between the public humanities and social justice, the use of digital technologies to tell new stories and reach new audiences, or the potential for public programs about the arts, culture and history to create new relationships.
