More than 1,500 members of the Boston College community attended the dedication ceremony, along with family members and friends of those who had been lost. The memorial labyrinth—modeled after the 13th-century stone labyrinth at Chartres Cathedral in France—is 50 feet in diameter, with a circle of concentric rings forming a single path to the center, symbolic of life’s journey. The names of the 22 deceased alumni are etched into its outer ring.
