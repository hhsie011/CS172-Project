May 31, 2016 Columbia Global Centers | Amman launched a series inspired by the legacy of the late Soraya Salti, former President and CEO for Middle East and North Africa at INJAZ Al-Arab, a non-profit organization that supports youth education and training in the Arab world. With the support of Mr. Waleed AlBanawi, Founder and Chairman at JISR Venture Partners, the series commenced in fall 2016, and will honors the work and achievements of his life-partner Soraya Salti in the field of youth education and entrepreneurship. The fund helped establish a speaker and workshop series by youth and for youth that focuses on themes of gender equality, entrepreneurship, innovation, and leadership, among others. Based at the Columbia Global Center in Amman, this initiative reaches out to young people from undeserved backgrounds to promote and advance youth leadership development.
