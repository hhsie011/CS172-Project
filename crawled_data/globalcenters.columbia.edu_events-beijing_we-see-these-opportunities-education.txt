This far-reaching reform has caught close attention from frontline teaching practitioners, educational administrators, parents, and those interested in or willing to enter this profession. What is the future trend of China’s education? What role would they play in it? To answer these questions, Columbia Global Centers | Beijing co-sponsors this event featuring Teachers College alumni and experts from Beijing No.4 High School, YouChange China Social Entrepreneur Foundation, EdBeta Fund, and Tsinghua University. The speakers will share their insights on the evolving situation of the education industry, views on the future of education, educational innovation, educational technology, international education, and experiences on career transition and other possibilities for educators. Come and join us in the passionate discussion! We hope these insights will inspire your practice and career planning. The event will be available live on Beijing Center's Bilibili.
