Beginning with an historical overview of Hollywood’s efforts to control, even monopolize the world-wide media industry, the course will cover how this market has rapidly evolved over the last twenty years with the advent of digital media. Students will analyze Hollywood’s increasing tendency to co-finance media production through international production deals, as well as through distribution packages, both analog and digital. Students will learn to appreciate the complexity of international distribution rights for films and television programs. Inside the Studio Walls (3)This course is designed to give both a broad overview and specific insight to the wide array of professions, jobs, trades, and crafts that make up the Hollywood entertainment business. Built around weekly guest speakers, course gives students an “insider’s point of views” into almost every facet of the industry. From agents, lawyers and mangers,to creative executives and producers and writers, directors, and cinematographers, to editors, line producers, VFX supervisors and marketing executives, the goal is not only for the student to have a foundational understanding of how various aspects of the modern business functions as a whole, but to provide each student a chance to gain a more detailed understanding of those specific areas that interest them professionally. Hollywood Primer (3)This course examines the economic and regulatory aspects of traditional and new media industries in Hollywood and beyond. Historical, financial, technological, and regulatory issues related to the production and distribution of content on different media platforms will be also discussed from a comparative perspective.
