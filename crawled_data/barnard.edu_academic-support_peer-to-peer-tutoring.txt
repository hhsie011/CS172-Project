Students who are interested in a personalized and structured support can request a small group peer tutor. These tutors will meet with you for one hour each week to develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills while reviewing material for a course. Students may request an individual peer tutor after the second week of the semester. In order to provide the most effective peer tutoring experience, students should be able to clearly articulate why they need a peer tutor for a specific course. Peer tutors, when available, will be assigned as quickly as possible starting after the end the Add/Drop period. See below for how to request a peer tutor or apply to become a peer tutor. Mission and Philosophy of Tutoring The mission of the Peer Learning Program is to provide students with the support they need to succeed in numerous academic disciplines throughout their college experience. The philosophy of our program is to ensure that students are receiving direct academic tutoring and coaching in an inclusive and equitable environment. The goal of the program is to encourage our students to become independent and responsible learners. Through academic counseling and tutoring, it is our hope that students will develop and enhance strategic study skills and work closely with faculty to become more confident students. All students who are matched with a peer tutor are expected to share the responsibility of the tutoring process and make a commitment to independent learning. During the Tutoring Session The goal of individual/small group tutoring is to promote the development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills. To that end, homework assignments should be done in advance of the tutoring session so that your time may be spent addressing what you do not understand. While peer tutors will not provide the answers to homework problems, they will provide examples that will help you understand the process of finding a solution. At the end of your tutoring session, you and your peer tutor will review what you have covered, clarify any remaining questions, and arrange/confirm the time of your next tutoring session. Request a Tutor The Peer Learning Program is free to all Barnard students. Students may receive a maximum of one hour of tutoring per week, per course. To be matched with a peer tutor, please send an email to peertopeer@barnard.edu with your request. Please note that peer tutors are mainly for courses taught at Barnard. If you have any questions, contact us at peertopeer@barnard.edu. Apply to Become a Tutor The Barnard Dean of Studies Office continually seeks current Barnard students to serve as tutors in our Peer Learning Program. Peer Tutors are paid $16.50/hour, for anywhere between one and two hours per week (depending on your availability and demand for tutors in your area), to meet in small groups of no more than three students or individually who have requested a tutor for support in a particular class. Tutors are also paid for approximately one hour per month of training/in-service. Subjects where tutors are most in demand include: Biology, Calculus, Chemistry, Computer Science, Economics, Foreign Languages, and Physics. Other subjects may also be needed depending on student requests, so you are encouraged to apply even if the subject you want to tutor does not appear on this list. Qualifications: A grade of B+ or above in the Barnard course(s) (or equivalent) for which you wish to tutor A minimum GPA of 3.0 Empathy, patience, clarity, and kindness Commitment to academic integrity Good academic and disciplinary standing in the College Senior, Junior, Sophomore, or second-semester First-Year status Experience as a peer tutor preferred but not required To apply to be a Peer-to-Peer Learning Tutor, please email peertopeer@barnard.edu.
