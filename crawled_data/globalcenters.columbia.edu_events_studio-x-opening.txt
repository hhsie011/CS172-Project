The Studio-X, the global city laboratory of GSAPP, Columbia University's Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation opened its doors on November 8, 2013. The evening was a celebration of the collaborative and global spirit of Studio-X, and also included curated performances and live music. With locations in seven Global Centers—Amman, Beijing, Moscow, Mumbai, New York, Rio de Janeiro and now Istanbul—Studio X is the first truly global network for real-time exchange of projects, people, and ideas between regional leadership cities in which the best minds of Columbia University can think together with the best minds in Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, Eastern Europe and Asia. Working in collaboration with this broader network and with a range of counterparts in Turkey, Studio X Istanbul Director and architect Selva Gürdoğan will develop a series of events, lectures, workshops and exhibitions to foster a new form of discussion on the future of the built environment, encouraging the broadest and most open forms of idea and knowledge sharing.
