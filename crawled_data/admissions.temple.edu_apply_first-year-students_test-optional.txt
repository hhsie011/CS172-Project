We know standardized test scores aren’t always a reflection of your accomplishments. Our test-optional application path is part of our commitment to providing more opportunities for all dedicated, motivated students to access a high-quality undergraduate experience—no matter how you learn or how your achievements are represented. That’s why we take a holistic approach when reviewing all applications, to fully capture the individual experiences, extracurricular interests and academic coursework of each student. Being test-optional, we offer an admissions path for those whose potential for academic success is not accurately captured by standardized test scores such as the SAT or ACT, or for those students who could not take these tests due to circumstances outside of their control. If you believe an SAT or ACT score would complement your application, you should submit your scores. Standardized test scores are otherwise entirely optional and in no way required for admission. Contact For more information about applying test-optional, contact the Office of Undergraduate Admissions at 888-340-2222 or 215-204-7200.

Test-optional is an admissions path for talented students whose potential for academic success is not accurately captured by standardized test scores. Why is test-optional offered? Temple supports the holistic evaluation of our first-year candidates, and we appreciate the many ways in which they can demonstrate their academic strengths and potential to succeed in college. In some cases, students might feel that test scores do not accurately represent their true potential for success. You now have the option of submitting your standardized test scores (SAT or ACT) or choosing to apply test-optional (not sending your test scores). How do I know if I should apply test-optional? This is a personal and individual decision that you should weigh carefully prior to beginning your application to Temple. If you don’t think that your test scores truly reflect your potential, applying test-optional might be your best choice. However, if you believe an SAT or ACT score would complement your application, you should submit your scores. How do I choose to apply test-optional? On your Common Application, indicate whether you will be submitting your test scores or choosing to apply test-optional. Your decision can’t be changed once you receive an admissions decision, so we recommend that you think carefully about how you choose to apply. What application materials will I need to submit if I choose to apply test-optional? You’ll need to submit all other required application materials, including the application fee or waiver (if eligible) and your self-reported high school transcript. What if I have sent my test scores, but I choose to apply test-optional? Even if you have sent test scores to Temple but subsequently apply as a test-optional candidate, we will not consider your test scores in our admissions review. If I choose to apply test-optional, can I still be considered for academic scholarships and the Honors Program? Yes. All students who apply test-optional will automatically be considered for academic scholarships and admission to the Honors Program. Have other schools created test-optional plans? Temple’s test-optional application path, which was created in 2015, was designed to break down testing barriers to admission for highly qualified applicants. At that time, we were one of the first public research universities in the Northeast to provide this path for students. We are proud to be among the growing number of test-optional universities.
