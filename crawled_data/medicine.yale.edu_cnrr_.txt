Our objective is to promote functional recovery following spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, stroke, traumatic brain injury and neuropathic pain. We are a multidisciplinary team of scientists and clinicians researching ways to reverse the paralyzing effects of nerve demyelination, identify mechanisms that mediate pain after injury to the nervous system, and apply pharmacological and cell-based approaches to restore neurological function. Our vision of the future is one in which, as a result of advances in molecular, cellular and regenerative research, the effects of nervous system damage will be substantially mitigated, or completely reversed.
