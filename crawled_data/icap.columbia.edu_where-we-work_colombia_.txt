Reports indicate that Venezuelan migrants living with HIV are arriving to their host countries in poor health, and migrants not living with HIV lack access to prevention and testing services needed to ensure they remain HIV negative. Public health experts warn that this situation has the potential to undo significant progress toward epidemic control that has been made in the region. Colombia is host to nearly two million Venezuelan migrants. ICAP is working with AID for AIDS (AFA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Ministry of Health to ensure Venezuelan migrants living in Lima have access to the full spectrum of HIV prevention, care, and treatment services.
