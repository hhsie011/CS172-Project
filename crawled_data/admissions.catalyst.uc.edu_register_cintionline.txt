Where UC Obtains Personal Data • From You Or At Your Direction • UC receives personal data from multiple sources, most often directly from you or from a third party whom you have directed to provide information to UC (e.g., application for admission to UC through the use of CollegeNet or the Common App). Publicly Facing Technology Services The university’s publicly facing technology services (ex.: websites, student information system, learning management system, and similar) collect personal information that you knowingly and voluntarily provide when completing applications and forms, sending emails, registering for classes or other programs, responding to surveys, or ordering merchandise.

If you visit our websites, we automatically gather and store the following information about your visit so that we can track the use of our websites to make improvements.

In some cases, we may be required by law to release information gathered through and/or by UC technology services.

When subject to the GDPR, UC will comply with the regulation's core privacy principles. GDPR Lawful Bases for Processing Personal Data Under the GDPR, UC must have a lawful basis to process a data subject's personal data. Although there will be some instances where the processing of personal data will be pursuant to other lawful bases (e.g., processing necessary to protect the vital interests or safety of a data subject, processing related to legal action involving the university, etc.), the following lawful bases will apply to most UC data processing activities: • Processing for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by UC or by a third party; • Processing for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract; • Processing for compliance with a legal obligation to which UC is subject; and • Processing pursuant to the consent of a data subject for one or more specific purposes. GDPR Individual Rights of the Data Subject Subject to all other applicable laws and regulations, including all laws of the United States and the State of Ohio, where legally applicable, certain data subjects have the following rights under the GDPR: • To access the personal data we maintain about you; • To be provided with information about how we process your personal data; • To correct or modify your personal data; • To have your personal data deleted; • To object to or restrict how we process your personal data; • To request your personal data to be transferred to a third party; and • To file a complaint. Please be aware that under certain circumstances, the GDPR or other applicable laws may limit a data subject's exercise of the above rights. To exercise the above rights, data subjects should contact Privacy@uc.edu. Please note that exercising these rights is not a guarantee of a requested outcome.
