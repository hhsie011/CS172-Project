Launched in 2009, Bridge Year has provided transformative, community-based, service-learning experiences to over 340 incoming Princeton undergraduates. The program is open to all members of Princeton’s newly-admitted first-year class. "I can't imagine a life at Princeton without having participated in Bridge Year. The program gave me a new appreciation for the opportunities I am presented with on campus, and it realigned my priorities, as I have become a more aware citizen of this world. Plus, I have an amazing family and network of past participants to reach out to if I ever need anything!" -- Neeta Patel ’16 Footer Office of International Programs Louis A.
