At present, PEP operates in three correctional facilities: Taconic, Sing Sing, and Bedford Hills. Courses are offered in a variety of disciplines throughout the social sciences, humanities, and Columbia’s Core Curriculum. Upon their successful completion of the course, students are granted Columbia credit through the School of Professional Studies, which they can use to fulfill degree requirements offered by our peer institutions. To date, all the courses taught by Columbia faculty in Taconic and Sing Sing are organized through Hudson Link for Higher Education in Prison.
