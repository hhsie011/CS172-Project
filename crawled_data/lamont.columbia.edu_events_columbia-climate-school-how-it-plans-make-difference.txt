The mission of the Climate School is to fulfill Columbia's educational mission to educate the next generation of leaders, to undertake research, to generate new knowledge, and most importantly to turn that research into actionable solutions to the climate crisis. This webinar will introduce the Climate School to Columbia University students and to the general public. Three Deans of the Climate School will provide an overview of the Climate School. They will explain the role of the centers that fall under its umbrella, the type of educational activities it performs, and the groundbreaking research it is undertaking. Following that, each Dean will talk about climate issues from their own perspectives, and will share the most relevant concerns from their unique disciplinary points of view.
