State-of-the-art research in mind, brain, behavior and language requires spanning multiple levels of analysis and using a range of approaches and methodologies, and the integration of these two closely related departments has created an environment where this intellectual synthesis can flourish. The creation of CLPS reflects Brown’s philosophy to build bridges between disciplines and to encourage interdisciplinary studies.
