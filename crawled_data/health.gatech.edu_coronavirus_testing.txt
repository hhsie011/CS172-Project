Symptomatic At-Home Test Kits (Students Only) To provide students with options for immediate testing needs, Student Engagement and Well-Being has procured a limited supply of at-home testing kits to facilitate self-care for students who are experiencing symptoms or illness that could be Covid-19 related. Students are encouraged first and foremost to use on-campus testing. However, this may be prohibitive for some students who are feeling ill. Due to a limited and unpredictable supply chain, these at-home test kits are being distributed only to Georgia Tech students who are symptomatic. Kits will be available for no-contact delivery to students who reside on campus, or for pickup by a designated individual who is not currently symptomatic. Only one kit (which contains two tests) will be provided to each student who requests one in any given week. Request a Test Kit Travel-Certified Testing Travel testing is now being done with campus tests, which are collected from the testing site at 4 p.m. each day and processed the next day. Vault kits are no longer being used for travel testing.
