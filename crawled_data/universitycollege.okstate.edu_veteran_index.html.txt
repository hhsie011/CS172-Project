I am a full time student and a proud member of the Oklahoma National Guard. At the veteran center, I assist with events and help other veteran students. It is important that we take advantage of the opportunities that are available for our unique situation. So, I make it a priority to ensure that as student veterans, we adhere to our respective branches’ orders and that we ultimately succeed in school. I have the chance to develop my leadership skills and to connect with others who also help me along the way. Our supervisors and advisors go out of their way to make sure that we are equipped with the resources that we need to be prepared and succeed as students. This also includes our supervisor Cheryl Kleeman, listening to our problems, sharing advice, and connecting to us as a fellow veteran. I hope to continue this tradition and pass on these opportunities to future OSU student veterans." - Malik McGee, Veteran Student Pictured: Malik McGee with Cheryl Kleeman, Director, in front of the Veteran Success Center Resources Department of Veteran Affairs Oklahoma Department of Veteran Affairs Oklahoma City Vet Center Tulsa Vet Center Stillwater VA Health Clinic For more information, contact: Vincent Rivera CoordinatorStudent Veteran Success061 Student Union Stillwater, OK 74078405.744.8118militaryveterans@okstate.edu Department of Transfer and Student Veteran Success Back To Top Back To Top Oklahoma State University Stillwater, OK 74078 Campus & Parking Maps (405) 744-5000 Careers at OSU Hire OSU Grads OSU Institutions Stillwater (Main) Oklahoma City Tulsa Center for Health Sciences (Tulsa) Institute of Technology (Okmulgee) Veterinary Medicine (Stillwater) Follow OSU NewsEventsInside OSU Social Media Directory Facebook Twitter Instagram Linkedin Snapchat OSU Athletics >> © Oklahoma State University.
