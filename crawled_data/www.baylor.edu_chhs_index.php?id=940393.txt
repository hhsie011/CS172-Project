Earlier in my career, I studied animal models to explore these relationships, and expanded to include study of the neurobiological correlates. In particular, with my colleague Cort Pedersen, I developed a model of intergenerational transmission of individual differences in maternal and other behaviors that is mediated through changes in the oxytocin system. This model describes how experiencing different levels of maternal behavior in early life leads to continuity in not only maternal behaviors, but also other phenomena, such as depression-like behavior, in the animal models. Beginning in 2002, my research focus shifted to applying what I discovered in these animal models to human development. My current research comprises two primary themes: the role of oxytocin in mediating the effects of early experience on adult behavior and exploring the neurobiological structure of the oxytocin system by mapping oxytocin receptors in the brain. My recent research has explored the effects of early parental loss, operationalized as divorce, on later oxytocin levels and attachment styles, as well as exploring attachment to God and relating it to the effects of faith on health by examining oxytocin, which is implicated in stress responses that mediate the effects of faith on health.

I am especially interested in teaching critical thinking skills and encouraging my students to seriously think about how their faith integrates with their career goals and life choices.
