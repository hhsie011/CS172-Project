The Center also provides art enrichment programs, collaborative teaching opportunities, and learning experiences for diverse audiences through our Education department. Research Programs The Department of Research stewards a wide-ranging scholarly program that is both interdisciplinary in nature and international in scope. The department seeks to support the study and understanding of British art through talks, lectures, conferences, films, concerts, performances, symposia, and workshops. Encouraging the participation of scholars at all levels—undergraduate, graduate, postdoctoral, and senior—the department facilitates dialogues, collaborations, and networks. Learn more Residential Scholars Awards The Center offers three types of short-term residential awards to scholars undertaking research related to British art. While in residence, scholars will have access to the Center’s rich holdings of paintings, sculptures, drawings, prints, rare books, and manuscripts, as well as primary and secondary reference materials. Scholars will have a dedicated working space, the opportunity to participate in the Center’s events and programs, and will be encouraged to engage with the scholarly community of the Center and the university. Learn more Publications The Center has an active publishing program and collaborates with Yale University Press on publications accompanying major exhibitions. In conjunction with the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art, the Center publishes the award-winning online journal British Art Studies.
