Through aging and decay, Serritella’s sculptures challenge the viewer with both the nature of the material and the messages within. Each sculpture in Eric Serritella–Sharing Spaces fosters awareness to affect viewers’ behaviors toward the environment. Through this consciousness they can acquire new appreciations and ways of seeing. The exhibition can been seen at the Gregg Museum of Art & Design through Dec. 3.
