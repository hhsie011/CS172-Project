As 3Ls, we have seen the inter workings of the school and plan to put that knowledge to use for the entire student body. Having worked closely with student organizations, administration and main campus in the past, we are hard at work representing the best interest of the student body as a whole to them. We do a lot of our work behind the scenes, which is why the main goal of our administration is transparency. We want all students to know that they can speak to us about any issue they are having at any time. We know we cannot fix every issue overnight, but our goal is to be clear and transparent on what we can do to help.
