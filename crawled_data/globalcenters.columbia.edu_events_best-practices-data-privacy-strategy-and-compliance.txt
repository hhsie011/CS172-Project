Data privacy laws are emerging around the world as countries grapple with how to best regulate the protection of personal data. Given that online companies may be collecting data from individuals across continents, companies need to be prepared to address foreign privacy laws, many of which have only recently been enacted. This event will outline strategies for navigating global data privacy compliance and where we can expect shifts in the data privacy landscape over the next few years. *The event will be in English.
