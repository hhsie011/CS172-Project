From a humble beginning as a camellia collection in the 1950s, the South Carolina Botanical Garden (SCBG) has blossomed into a 295-acre sanctuary for diversity by re-engaging people in the living world. We strive to serve as an interdisciplinary resource focusing on teaching, research, and outreach that advances awareness and understanding of plants, animals, minerals, and our culture. The South Carolina Botanical Garden is a 295-acre garden and natural area that is a refuge for life. We exist for enjoyment and education and are available and accessible to all people. Our grounds are open and free-of-charge 365 days a year from sunrise to sunset. Visit us Today!
