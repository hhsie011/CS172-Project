Botany and plant pathology are concerned with the study of plants at all levels of biological organization, from molecular and cellular processes to the global ecosystem. This breadth of field reflects the wide range of issues and problems that confront plant biologists. In addition to addressing fundamental questions in plant biology, plant scientists in the 21st century will be called upon to provide information useful for producing food, fiber, and medicine for an increasing population, and for increasing our understanding of the diversity of plant and ecological systems and their interactions with humans. Students studying botany and plant pathology at OSU receive the basic science background necessary for such contributions, and may choose to focus in a particular area within plant science. The undergraduate program in the Department of Botany and Plant Pathology is designed for students who wish to receive a BS in Botany degree and for students pursuing degrees in other fields that require a knowledge of plant biology. For example, students who have an undergraduate major in biology or environmental sciences may wish to emphasize botany courses in their upper-division course work. Completion of the undergraduate curriculum in botany can qualify students for graduate work in various areas of plant biology and plant pathology, and for positions in state and federal agencies, and industries concerned with plants and their products. Prospective botany majors should obtain a strong background in the biological and physical sciences at the high school level. Specifically recommended are a minimum of three years of high school mathematics, including algebra, geometry, and some exposure to trigonometry, one year of chemistry, one year of biology, one year of physics, and courses designed to develop computer and writing skills. Students without an adequate background in mathematics and science may make up these deficiencies early in their college careers. Completion of one of the following options is required for the BS in Botany: Comprehensive Botany (Corvallis campus only) Customizable (Ecampus and Corvallis campus) Ecology, Evolution, and Conservation (Corvallis campus only) Molecular, Cellular, and Genomic Botany (Corvallis campus only) Plant Pathology (Corvallis campus only) Major Code: 515 Communicate scientific concepts, experimental results and analytical arguments clearly and concisely verbally and in writing. Apply scientific methods, reasoning and appropriate mathematics to describe, explain and understand biological systems. Demonstrate understanding of five core concepts in biology: evolution; pathways and transformations of energy and matter; information flow, exchange, and storage; structure and function; and biological systems. Use interdisciplinary approaches (applying chemistry and quantitative skills) to work on biological problems. Describe the complex networks of interactions that determine energy flow and the cycling of water, carbon, nitrogen, and minerals within ecosystems. Identify and analyze the anatomical and morphological features of plants and plant structures as they enable plant function and reveal plant evolutionary histories. Recognize and describe the features of vascular plant groups using standard botanical terminology. Interpret the evolutionary and phylogenetic relationships of plants by evaluating analytical and experimental tools used to understand organismal diversity. Incorporate information from physiology, genetics, developmental biology, biochemistry and genomics to explain how plants integrate water-relations, mineral and organic nutrition, solute transport, respiration and photosynthesis, hormonal and environmental signals to regulate the processes of growth and reproduction. Describe and implement laboratory methods typically used in plant biology. The required curriculum meets the course requirements of the university and the College of Agricultural Sciences and provides for a broad background in plant science. Completing an option and engaging in an experiential learning activity allows students to fulfill their individual education goals and prepare for career aspirations. All Botany undergraduate majors are required to do the following: Complete the core course curriculum meeting the requirements of the university, College of Agricultural Sciences, and Botany academic requirements. Select and complete the course curriculum of a 21-credit option to obtain advanced scientific background and skills in a particular area of plant science. Students may select a pre-determined botany option from the catalog or create a customized option with approval of a BOT advisor. Course work delivered in the options provides students with advanced knowledge and skills related to the study of plants and plant-like organisms in natural and managed ecosystems and in the laboratory. Comprehensive Botany Customizable Option Ecology, Evolution, and Conservation Molecular, Cellular, and Genomic Botany Plant Pathology Participate in an experiential learning and subsequent student seminar. Every Botany major is required to have an experiential learning (EL) component in their curriculum that is not part of a scheduled academic course. The EL component can take many forms but must involve a minimum of 60 hours of work and must have a substantial educational objective that is related to the BOT degree. Academic credit is not required but may be earned by enrolling in research (BOT 401) or internship (BOT 410). Paid and voluntary positions are both acceptable. To meet the requirement, the student and the EL supervisor must make a written agreement that is approved by a Botany advisor. After completion of the EL project, the student is required to participate in a 1-credit student seminar during Fall term of the senior year (BOT 407), to reflect on the EL project and to incorporate it into future career planning activities.
