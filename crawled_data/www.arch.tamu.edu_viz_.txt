McLaughlin was the founding department head in Visualization and held that position from 2008 to 2020. During his tenure the department more than tripled in size, added the undergraduate program in Visualization, minors in Art and Game Design & Development, and Texas A&M University’s first Master of Fine Arts degree program. In 2018 the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board bestowed a Recognition of Excellence to the department. Prior to joining the faculty at Texas A&M, McLaughlin worked in the movie industry at Industrial Light & Magic, and Lucasfilm Animation in San Francisco, California, where he led teams of artists and engineers developing computer graphics techniques for digital creatures in award-winning visual effects for films. His credit list of 15 feature films includes Mars Attacks!, Star Wars: Episode I, Van Helsing, War of the Worlds, and ground-breaking virtual production techniques on the prototype for James Cameron’s Avatar. McLaughlin earned his Bachelor of Environmental Design degree from Texas A&M in 1990 and was among the first graduates of the Master of Science in Visualization Sciences program in 1994. Across his career, McLaughlin’s work has focused on integrating science, technology, and the arts. He’s committed to developing academic programs, interdisciplinary approaches to research, and creative work. Congrats and Gig 'Em Tim! #tamu #tamuarch @tamu @tamuarch @tamuviz @timmatviz #tamuviz #visualization #vizlab #art #dean #new #college #visualandperformingarts #design #game #animation #interactive #lucasfilm #starwars #avatar #studio ... tamuviz View Apr 28 Open The Metropolitan Museum of Art has awarded Sabrina Carletti a postdoctoral Leonard A.

Sebastian is a senior 2D artist at Gamigo in Austin, TX. While he is usually working on games, earlier this year he had the opportunity to take a little break from digital work to design and paint this mural for Gamigo’s new office. The main idea behind it was to inject a little bit of nature to try to decorporatize the space. Sebastian says “it’s just over 40x9’, and it took 24 days to complete. I wasn’t able to do it alone, and I am very grateful to everyone who lent a hand." The mural looks amazing! We look forward to seeing more alumni work. If you want to be featured, please don’t hesitate to contact @tamuviz. #tamu #tamuarch @tamu @tamuarch @tamuviz @sebastiankawar @gamigogroup #tamuviz #visualization #vizlab #art #mural #atxartist #austinart #austinartist #austinmural #roundrock #illustration #installationart #gameart #conceptart #riverart #bigart ... tamuviz View Apr 21 Open Howdy, Vizzers!
