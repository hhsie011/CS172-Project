Wigley Launches Book in Chile Santiago Architecture Dean Emeritus Wigley Launches Book in Chile December 31, 2019 Mark Wigley, Professor and Dean Emeritus at Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation (GSAPP), traveled to Chile mid-December to present his book, “The Architectural Brain.” The book is the latest, available in both English and Spanish, in the ARQ Docs series published by Ediciones ARQ which forms part of Universidad Católica’s (UC) School of Architecture, Design and Urban Studies (Fadeu). “I consider Mark one of today’s most lucid architectural thinkers, one of the most important. Besides having been the Dean of GSAPP from 2004-2014, he’s written at least 10 books and has presented at extremely important expositions – in New York, Istanbul, Venice. He’s top of the line worldwide when it comes to architecture,” said Francisco Díaz (GSAPP '13), Professor of Architecture at Universidad Católica, editor-in-chief of Ediciones ARQ and member of the Santiago Center Advisory Board. Wigley is the fourth such author from GSAPP to publish in an ARQ Docs series that now has 25 volumes, noted Díaz, who invited the Dean Emeritus to write the book. GSAPP faculty who have previously published in the ARQ Docs series include Felicity Scott, Andrés Jaque and Enrique Walker. “The Architectural Brain” – launched on campus at UC before an audience of some 150 people – is about the way architects think, and in that framework the author proposes a specific way of teaching architecture. During his time in Chile, Wigley also participated in a UC seminar organized by Professor Pedro Alonso titled "Global Infrastructures and the Cold War."
