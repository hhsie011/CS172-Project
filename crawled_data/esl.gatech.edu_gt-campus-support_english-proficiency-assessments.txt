Applicants to Graduate Programs at Georgia Tech The GTLI English Language Proficiency Assessment is designed to assess English language proficiency skills for applicants to graduate programs at Georgia Tech. The assessment is an interactive, audio-and video-recorded session (via Zoom) that will take approximately 90 minutes and have two main parts: a speaking/listening section and a writing/reading section. Learn More and Register Prospective J-1 Scholars and Interns The Department of State (DOS) established regulations effective January 2015 which require sponsors to identify English language proficiency for exchange visitors coming to the U.S. on J-1 visas. Sponsors must review evidence from an objective measure that demonstrates the exchange visitor has “sufficient English proficiency to perform their jobs, navigate daily life in the United States, read and comprehend program materials, understand fully their responsibilities, rights, and protections, and be able to obtain assistance.” Georgia Tech requires evidence of English language proficiency to determine eligibility to participate in a specific Exchange Visitor program at Georgia Tech. The level of proficiency required aligns with the category and the type of activities the Exchange Visitor will engage in.
