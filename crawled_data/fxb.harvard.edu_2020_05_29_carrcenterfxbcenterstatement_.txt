Safra Center for Ethics. Note: please see below for a list of additional co-signers. “We strongly condemn the Minneapolis Police Department’s vicious and brutal murder of George Floyd. This and other recent events highlight the lethal impact of the racist criminalization of Americans of African descent and the need to explicitly name and unequivocally fight against the racism and violence that has been woven into the fabric of the United States since its founding. It is understandable that this longstanding, flagrant disregard for the human rights of African Americans has led to outrage across the country. We call on law enforcement officers responding to demonstrations to exercise utmost restraint and work closely with community leaders to avoid escalating the situation further. The murders of African Americans at the hands of police and vigilantes must stop and perpetrators must be charged and brought to justice. As research centers at Harvard University committed to human rights, we affirm the values of racial equity, justice, and non-violence. For the future of the United States, our public leaders must urgently do the same.” Thank you to the following centers for adding their names to this statement in support of condemning police violence: Harvard Center for Population and Development Studies, Harvard Law School Criminal Justice Institute, William Monroe Trotter Collaborative for Social Justice, Center for Public Leadership at Harvard Kennedy School, Harvard University Center for African Studies, David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies, the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, the Department of African & African American Studies, the Charles Warren Center for Studies in American History, the Harvard University Asia Center, the Lakshmi Mittal and Family South Asia Institute, and the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, Center for Public Leadership, the Lee Kum Sheung Center for Health and Happiness, Center for Education Policy Research at Harvard University, Mahindra Humanities Center at Harvard, and the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies, the Center for Middle Eastern Studies, and the Korea Institute. ### Media Contacts: Carr Center: Alexandra Geller, Alexandra_Geller@hks.harvard.edu FXB Center: Veronica Lewin, vlewin@hsph.harvard.edu Share this:FacebookTwitterLinkedInReddit Categories:Blog, Highlights, News//Tags:human rights, police violence, racism Post navigation Previous PostPrevious Study: Structural Racism, Historical Redlining, and Preterm Birth in New York City Next PostNext Working Paper, The Unequal Toll of Covid-19 Mortality by Age in the United States: Quantifying Racial/Ethnic Disparities Follow us on Twitter @FXBHarvardMy Tweets Archives Archives Select Month May 2022 March 2022 February 2022 January 2022 December 2021 November 2021 October 2021 September 2021 July 2021 June 2021 May 2021 April 2021 January 2021 December 2020 November 2020 October 2020 September 2020 August 2020 June 2020 May 2020 April 2020 March 2020 February 2020 January 2020 December 2019 November 2019 October 2019 September 2019 July 2019 June 2019 May 2019 April 2019 March 2019 February 2019 January 2019 December 2018 October 2018 September 2018 August 2018 July 2018 June 2018 May 2018 April 2018 March 2018 February 2018 January 2018 December 2017 November 2017 October 2017 September 2017 August 2017 July 2017 June 2017 May 2017 April 2017 March 2017 February 2017 January 2017 December 2016 November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 July 2014 May 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 June 2013 Harvard T.H.
