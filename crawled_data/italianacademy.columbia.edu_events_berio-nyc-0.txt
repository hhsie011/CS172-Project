Ensemble mise-en is an innovative and versatile New York-based contemporary music collective led by composer Moon Young Ha. With over fifteen of New York’s most talented musicians, our multi-national personnel strive to bring a repertoire of challenging, new sounds to diverse audiences. The ensemble wishes to impart an experience that is simultaneously multi-cultural, intellectually stimulating, and aesthetically pleasing (“mee” in Korean means “beauty”, and “zahn” means “to decorate”), promoting large-scale composition projects and intense performances of contemporary music with programs featuring the works of many established and budding composers alike. Since it was founded in 2011, ensemble mise-en has collaborated on several special projects, including more than ten commissions and twenty NY and US premieres, and has performed at various exciting venues such as (le) poisson rouge, Bohemian National Hall, the Tank, the DiMenna Center, Tenri Cultural Institute, The Invisible Dog Art Center, the cell, where the ensemble has been an artist-in-residence since 2012, and others. These performances have been supported by Washington Square Contemporary Music Society, Italian Academy at Columbia University, International Alliance for Women in Music, Austrian Cultural Forum New York, Open Meadows Foundation, New York University, New York Foundation for the Arts, Harry and Alice Eiler Foundation, Goethe-Institute (Boston), and Villa Gillet (Lyon, France). www.mise-en.org Upcoming Events The Italian Academy for Advanced Studies, Columbia University1161 Amsterdam Avenue · New York, NY 10027 Phone (212) 854-2306 Contact Us [email protected] Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
