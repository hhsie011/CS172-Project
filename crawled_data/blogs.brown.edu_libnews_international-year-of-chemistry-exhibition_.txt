This fall, the Brown University Library will celebrate IYC with Unveiling the Secrets: the Evolution of Modern Chemistry, an exhibition drawn from the Library’s history of science collections. Unveiling the Secrets features a range of printed alchemical texts, as well as key works in early modern experimental chemistry and atomic chemistry. The exhibit opens on Friday, September 30, 2011 and runs through Monday, October 31 in the Gammell Gallery at the John Hay Library. This entry was posted in Exhibits & Events by Amy Atticks.
