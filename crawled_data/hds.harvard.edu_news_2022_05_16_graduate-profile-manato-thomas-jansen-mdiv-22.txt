Memorable Moment There are so many memorable moments I'll cherish, but one that gave me so much joy was the weekly Tuesday Morning Eucharist gatherings in the brand new Multifaith Space, where we shared the bread and cup after our time apart in 2020–21, seeing familiar faces, and beholding the sunrise and silence together. Message of Thanks I'm so grateful for my advisers Emily Click and Dean Teddy Hickman-Maynard, who helped me settle into my first and final years of my time at HDS and made space for me to pursue my passions and speak things out amid all the inner chaos! I'm grateful for Professor Kimberley Patton's presence, warmth, humor, and care, and for her courses "Icon or Idol?" and "Weeping in the Religious Imagination" that I recommend folks take! And thank you Morgan Curtis for companioning alongside me and my thesis this past year as a phenomenal teaching fellow! Future Plans I will be moving to Madison, Wisconsin, in June to serve as the Associate Director of Residential Community at Pres House! I will miss HDS dearly but am thrilled to call the Midwest home again and to be closer to family again.
