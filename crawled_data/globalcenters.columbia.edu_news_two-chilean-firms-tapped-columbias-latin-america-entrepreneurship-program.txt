Columbia’s Latin America Entrepreneurship Program Santiago Two Chilean Firms Tapped for Columbia’s Latin America Entrepreneurship Program February 17, 2020 Two Chilean companies have been selected to form part of the 2020-2021 version of the Columbia Business School’s Entrepreneurship and Competitiveness in Latin America (ECLA) program, which targets entrepreneurs from mid-sized Latin American companies seeking to become more competitive in today’s global environment. One of the firms, BHCompliance, is specialized in business ethics compliance. It diagnoses and monitors regulated aspects of corporate integrity. The second company, OGR Puntaje Nacional, aims to improve education in Latin America through technology and innovation. The program began in January with on-campus classes. “The classes were spectacular, the teachers were top level. We had classes at Uris Hall, where we shared the building with the MBA students – it was a very good atmosphere,” says Ramon Montero, Legal and Compliance Manager at BHCompliance. “The classes were very participatory and we achieved a very good connection between all the students; there was a very good level of companies” participating in the ECLA program. This is the sixth version of the ECLA program, which is led by Business School Professor Nelson Fraiman. The program offers combined on-campus and online classes throughout the year, as well as a study trip to Morocco in March. Along with representatives from the global entrepreneurship movement Endeavor, another fifteen companies are also participating in the program: Aequales (Colombia) Almendares (Cuba) Cartao Vai Bem (Brazil) Contabilizei (Brazil) D1 (Brazil) Esteban Cordero (Argentina) Leonali (Mexico) Mesfix (Colombia) Monteoro Alimentos (Peru) Pacari (Ecuador) Quinoa Café (Peru) RV Inmobiliaria (Colombia) Superfuds (Colombia) Talar (Uruguay) Traincol (Colombia) Use this link to see the photo gallery.
