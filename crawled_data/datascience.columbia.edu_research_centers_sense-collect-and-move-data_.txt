These capabilities constitute one of the foundational technologies that enable myriad data applications with benefits that scale from human beings to society. Broadly categorized, sensing data includes research on novel sensors and sensing modalities, ranging from new materials to new sensing devices and systems; collecting data includes technology to connect sensors to data; and moving data includes advances in models, protocols, architectures and technologies for data centers and networks in many scales and modalities.
