In 1953, a Baylor staff member began to serve “frosted Coke” to students in the still-new Student Union Building’s Barfield Drawing Room. The informal gathering offered students a chance to socialize and escape the typical school day. 68 years later, that tradition continues — every Tuesday, from 3-4 p.m., still in the Barfield Drawing Room. Originally known as “Coke Hour,” the event switched to “Dr Pepper Hour” in 1997 when the Waco-born beverage became one of the university’s official soft drinks. Dr Pepper Hour is now one of Baylor’s oldest traditions, having started the same year as All University Sing. (For comparison, the “Sic'em, Bears!” yell didn’t come along until 1960, and the Baylor Line wasn’t started until a decade after that.) Sic'em, Dr Pepper Hour! OFFICIAL RECIPES Traditional Style 1 scoop of vanilla ice cream 8 oz. bottle of Dr Pepper or Diet Dr Pepper Directions: Place vanilla ice cream and Dr Pepper in a mixing bowl. Whip till evenly mixed.
