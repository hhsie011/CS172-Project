Belonging at Cornell Cornell’s transformative diversity and inclusion framework, Belonging at Cornell, provides a broad institutional structure for asserting the centrality of diversity and inclusion to the university’s values and excellence. Cornell’s diversity and inclusion framework is based on the recognition that education, research, knowledge production, and operational and academic pursuits are enhanced through full and reciprocal engagement among diverse perspectives, life experiences, and modes of knowledge creation and interpretation. Reporting Bias Reporting, understanding, and preventing unacceptable behaviors such as bias, sexual misconduct, and hazing are essential to maintaining our caring community. Cornell offers various avenues for reporting these incidents as well as receiving confidential care and support if you need it. Land Acknowledgement The Graduate School Office of Inclusion & Student Engagement acknowledges that Cornell University is located on the traditional homelands of the Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ’ (the Cayuga Nation). The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ’ are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ’ dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ’ people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ’ leadership. We encourage all who engage with the Graduate School and Cornell University to learn more about the Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ’, their history, and people, and to take meaningful action to support Indigenous scholars and their communities. We also encourage all to learn more about the American Indian and Indigenous Studies Program‘s Project and Blog on Cornell’s Relationship to Indigenous Dispossession. Commitment to Equity & Inclusion The Graduate School recognizes that the acute and frequently transgenerational trauma being experienced by members of our Black, Indigenous, Latinx/a/o, and Asian and Pacific Islander communities, which has only been amplified by our current socio-cultural circumstances, is an outcome of the structural racism that continues to pervade our society and institutions. We also recognize the impact of the bias and trauma experienced by those who identify with other backgrounds historically excluded from the academy, such as scholars who manage disabilities, members of our LGBTQ+ community, and international scholars, especially those whose identities have been racialized and/or marginalized within a U.S. context. Positive systemic and structural change will only come with informed and intentional action. To this end, the Graduate School remains committed to actively fostering an environment that engenders the full and safe participation of all members of our graduate and professional student community and demonstrates how their diverse perspectives, identities, ways of knowing, and lived experiences are recognized and valued. The Graduate School continues to carry forward and expand initiatives to support social justice, address inequities, and help Cornell, as well as the academy more broadly, become a place where all members of our community, but especially those from backgrounds historically excluded and underrepresented in graduate education, can establish a sense of belonging, feel affirmed, see themselves represented in multiple dimensions, and where they can thrive, not just survive.
