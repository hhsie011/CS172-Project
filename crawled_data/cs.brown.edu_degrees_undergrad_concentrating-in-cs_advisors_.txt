To sign up for a concentration, you should go to the Dean of the College's ASK page: https://ask.brown.edu/home/. There you may either ask for a particular faculty member as your advisor (taken from the tables below) or you may have one assigned to you. Our intent is that your initial concentration advisor continues to be your advisor until you graduate. However, if for some reason the advising relationship is not working out, you may switch to someone else who agrees to become your new advisor. If your advisor is not available, for example is on leave, then the director of undergraduate studies or his designate will serve as your interim advisor. Your advisor is not only the person you go to with questions, complaints, requests for exceptions, etc. She or he is someone who can discuss your plans with you, both your Brown plans and your post-Brown plans. We strongly urge you to take advantage of the advising program and meet with your advisor frequently. In addition, during the concentration-advising week every fall all concentrators must meet with their advisors and, if nothing else, make certain they are on track to graduate. If you have any questions about the concentration-advising program or are having difficulty contacting your advisor, please contact the director of undergraduate studies, Tom Doeppner. Note that not all faculty mentioned below are currently available as advisors. Please consult ASK for the list of those faculty who are available now.
