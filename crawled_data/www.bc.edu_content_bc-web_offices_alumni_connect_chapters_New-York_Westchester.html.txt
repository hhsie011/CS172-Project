The chapter has sought to connect the BC community through service, spirituality, family, athletic and development activities. This dedicated group of volunteers has shown time and time again the importance of community, and just how much BC Eagles serve as men and women for others. 6,728 Alumni Parents & Friends social leaders contact us events Follow Us Westchester Chapter Facebook Page Westchester Chapter LinkedIn Page Westchester Chapter Instagram Page Meet Your Chapter Leaders Ned Roseberry '93 Lives in: Larchmont, New York Major: Finance & Marketing Industry: Financial Services Favorite BC Memory: Senior Week Why did you get involved in your local chapter?: BC alumni are energized by memories of their time on the Heights, eager to help continue their love of our alma mater and bound by the spirit of being men and women for others. I got involved to help local alumni (and there are a lot of us in Westchester) to find fun, engaging and consistent ways to continue this passion for Boston College in their daily lives, with their families, and in their communities—through the various ways their affiliation to Boston College that is most meaningful to them. What are your local favorites in your city?: Love the new Billy & Petes (owned by BC Grad Billy Bishop!), Trattoria, La La Taqueria, the new Bellasera in town, a great lunch from Stanz, sushi from Wasabi, Wings and Ribs from Sherwoods or anything from Larchmont Tavern in Larchmont. Love a run over thorough Flint Park and the nature trail, or running the Leatherstocking trail. Fun Fact: Big Buffalo Bills football fan!
