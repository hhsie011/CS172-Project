RATE’s unique focus brings diverse student and faculty interests into dynamic conversation about the past, preparing scholars to share and develop their expertise in a wide range of professional settings. Students are admitted either after completing an MA in history elsewhere, or they may obtain an MA in history at Iowa State while progressing toward the Ph.D. degree. Quick Facts: The RATE program requires thirty semester hours of graduate credit for the MA and an additional 42 for the Ph.D. (72 hours in total). In some cases, the MA may be recommended as the terminal degree. Students who continue beyond the MA are expected to pass a qualifying examination covering four general fields selected by the student, complete a dissertation, and defend it orally in the Ph.D. final examination. RATE generally enrolls about a dozen students, at various stages of the doctoral program. Recent dissertations have included studies of the development of agricultural communities in California, the creation of farm safety programs in the mid-twentieth century, adoption of technological and scientific innovation by mid-twentieth century midwestern farmers, and work, family and community in communal societies.

All funding is contingent on students making good progress toward their degrees, and on the department’s annual budget. Students are encouraged to seek outside funding as well.
