From wing-shaped vessels to dancing figurines, archaeology has a story to tell us about the lives and imaginations of people who lived thousands of years ago. The Stories Objects Tell is an exhibit curated by Kristen Marchetti for Brown University’s Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World. Works included in the show may be a response to archaeology in general or to objects in the Joukowsky Institute’s collection of art and artifacts. Kristen Marchetti is Records and Collections Assistant at the Joukowsky Institute, and an A.B. Candidate in History of Art and Architecture and in Visual Arts at Brown. She will be graduating in May 2022. The exhibit is on view March 14, 2022-April 14, 2022, throughout Rhode Island Hall.
