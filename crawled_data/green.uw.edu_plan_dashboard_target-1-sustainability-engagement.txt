Implementing actions include a wide range of education programs, collaborations, and volunteerism that touch the lives of nearly every student, staff and faculty member, as well as community members in the neighborhoods surrounding UW campuses. The 2021 Action Plan will include actions that promote innovative collaborations between UW’s existing healthy living and environmental sustainability efforts; expanded professional development; and community engagement programs. Status updates Quarterly status reports FY2022 1st Quarter (Summer 2021) FY2021 3rd & 4th Quarter (Winter & Spring 2020) FY2021 2nd Quarter (Fall 2020) FY2021 1st Quarter (Summer 2020) Target actions for FY2021 Action: Whole U and UW Sustainability Collaborate To Expand Universitywide Communication Responsible party: UW Sustainability, Whole U FY 2021 steps: UW Sustainability will lead an effort to define “sustainability engagement” in measurable terms, and assess a 2020 baseline. The defined measurement unit shall correlate to an individual receiving an encouragement toward considering environmental impact, human health, diversity, equity or inclusion in the context of their participation in the UW community. The Whole U plans to continue offering a seminar every quarter in collaboration with UW Sustainability and will add sustainability features to a monthly editorial calendar and encourage UW Sustainability to contribute articles or recommend other UW faculty and staff. UW Sustainability will revamp the Green Office and Lab Certification programs and include student ambassadors; provide student capstone internships to engage with underrepresented groups and RSOs; develop an inclusion plan for outreach communications. The Whole U will add a sustainability focus for every signature program that involved overall wellness.

Collect data on sustainability focused Registered Student Organizations (RSOs), and promote student engagement with community service through these RSOs. Depending on current levels of engagement, provide information and resources to these RSOs regarding engagement with both episodic and long-term volunteer opportunities. Evaluate expanding opportunities to all RSOs. See full details Target metrics Metrics for this target are still being developed.
