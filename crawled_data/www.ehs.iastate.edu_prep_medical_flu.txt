Protect Yourself from the Flu Take these everyday actions to stay healthy: Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash after use. Wash hands often with soap and water, especially after coughing or sneezing. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are also effective. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth to avoid spreading germs. Get enough rest -- eight hours is ideal. Exercise regularly. Eat healthy and regularly. Stay home -- don't go to work or classes if you are sick. Try to avoid close contact with sick people.
