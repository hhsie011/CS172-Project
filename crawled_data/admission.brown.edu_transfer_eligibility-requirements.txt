Eligibility Requirements for Transfer Applicants To be eligible for transfer admission you must have completed at least one full year of college study (or its equivalent) before your planned matriculation at Brown. Both part-time and full-time students at accredited two- and four-year colleges may seek transfer admission. Applicants who submit transfer applications to Brown in the spring of 2022 will only be eligible to apply if they will have completed at least one year of full-time college enrollment before September 2022. University rules stipulate that anyone admitted as a transfer must be enrolled full-time at Brown for at least four semesters prior to earning an undergraduate degree. For this reason we discourage transfer applications from students who will have accrued more than four semesters of college work prior to their enrollment at Brown. High school students who are currently enrolled in dual-degree programs or early college programs are ineligible to apply as transfers. These students may only apply as first-year applicants. Students who have already completed a bachelor’s degree at another college are ineligible to apply as transfers. Applicants from British universities must have completed a year or more of their undergraduate education prior to applying. We will make exceptions to this rule for applicants from British universities that provide graded fall-semester transcripts for their students. U.S. military veterans and current service members are highly encouraged to apply via Brown’s Veterans Application, regardless of their year of high school graduation or any college credits earned to date.
