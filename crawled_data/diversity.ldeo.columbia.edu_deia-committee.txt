This Committee is charged with the important task of helping to create and uphold a safe working environment, that fosters a diverse, nurturing, and vibrant community founded upon the fundamental dignity and worth of all of its members. Building on the work of the Lamont Diversity Equity and Inclusion (LDEI) Task Force, the DEIA Committee has the goals of helping advance Lamont in three key areas: (1) supporting the inclusion and success of historically underrepresented groups in geoscience including Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC); (2) ensuring a research and teaching environment free from explicit and implicit discrimination and bias; and (3) creating a safe and welcoming campus where everyone thrives and is respected.
