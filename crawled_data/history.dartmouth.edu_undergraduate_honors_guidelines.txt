To apply to the History Honors Thesis Program, you must propose a thesis topic and secure the agreement of a faculty member to advise the project. If you are interested in participating in the History Honors Thesis Program, you should consider topics of interest to you and discuss them with potential faculty advisers as early as possible. All ideas require discussion, development, and preliminary research to transform them into viable research topics. We strongly advise you to communicate with and secure a faculty adviser by the end of spring term of your junior year. For the Class of 2022, the deadline for honors program applications will be September 1, 2021. You should send this application directly to the Honors Program director, Professor Jennifer Miller (Jennifer.m.miller@dartmouth.edu) and to History Department Administrator Bruch Lehmann (bruch.lehmann@dartmouth.edu). This application should consist of a two-paragraph project description and, if possible, include some potential ideas about primary sources. You should also have your adviser email confirmation that they are willing to serve in this role. Finally, your application should include the Honors Proposal Coversheet (you do not need to have your adviser sign this sheet – email confirmation will suffice). Note that students applying for the honors program need to have completed 5 history classes by the beginning of fall term. History Honors program applications should have a college grade point average of 3.0 and one of 3.5 in the History Department. Students who miss the deadline or have not fulfilled these requirements may petition for admission to the honors program – contact Professor J. Miller for details about this process. During the fall term, students will work with the Honors director and their advisers to develop a longer and more detailed research proposal, identify available sources, and begin their research. Because it is not yet clear if Dartmouth will allow institutionally funded travel next year, you should consider the availability of digital, library-based, and archival sources for your topic. The department can provide some limited research funding to students conducting honors research and details on this will be made available to Honors students in the fall. Further, and more extensive, funding is available through Undergraduate Advising and Research (UGAR), the Rockefeller Center for Public Policy and the Leslie Center for the Humanities. Note that some of these have summer/fall funding deadlines in April. If you are hoping to apply for funding for summer or fall, feel free to teach out to Professor J. Miller about the application process. If you have any questions about the Honors Program, please do not hesitate to contact Professor Jennifer Miller (Jennifer.m.miller@dartmouth.edu).

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of History Undergraduate Overview History FAQs for First Year and Transfer Students How to Declare a Major or Minor in History Major Modified Major Minor Transfer Credit Policy Course Descriptions First-Year Seminars Introductory Africa, Asia, Latin America & The Caribbean (AALAC) Europe (EUR) Interregional & Comparative (INTER) United States (US) Seminars & Colloquia Independent Study & Honors Course Schedule 2021-2022 Schedule 2022-2023 Schedule 2023-2024 Schedule Course Syllabi Honors Thesis Program General Timeline Guidelines for the Class of 2022 Guidelines for the Class of 2023 Honors Theses By Year Phi Alpha Theta Honors Society Prizes After Graduation Alumni Update Research Overview Faculty Research Initiatives Dartmouth History Institute Student Research Initiatives and Resources The Dartmouth Vietnam Project History Librarian Research Funding Resources Undergraduate Research Database Student Class Projects Foreign Study News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
