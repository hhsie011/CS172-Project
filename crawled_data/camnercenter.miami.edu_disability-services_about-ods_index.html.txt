Individuals with disabilities must request academic accommodations through the Office of Disabilities Services. Accommodations are determined on a collaborative and case-by-case basis and are based on the documentation provided by the individual. ODS staff will work collaboratively with students to determine what academic adjustments and educational auxiliary aids are reasonable to ensure that students with disabilities are not subject to discrimination. All documentation is reviewed, and accommodations are assigned in accordance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), including the Americans with Disabilities Amendments Act of 2008. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, Americans with Disabilities Amendments Act of 2008, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, qualified individuals with disabilities are protected from discrimination and may be entitled to reasonable accommodations and/or equal access to programs and services. The University of Miami follows and abides by the definition of disability set forth in the foregoing statutes. In determining whether a person is a qualified individual with a disability, the University of Miami does not take into consideration the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures other than ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses. Information is available to prospective and enrolled students, their parents and/or sponsors. The Office of Disability Services (ODS) is in the Camner Center for Academic Resources in Whitten University Center 2400. ODS staff can be reached at 305-284-2374 (Voice) or 305-284-1999 (Fax). Office hours are 8:30 am to 5:00 pm, Monday through Friday. Individuals may email the office staff for quick responses to questions.
