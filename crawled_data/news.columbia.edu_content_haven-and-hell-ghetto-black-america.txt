Yet while black urban neighborhoods have suffered from institutional racism and economic neglect, they also have been places of refuge and community. Lance Freeman, professor of architecture and urban planning, traces the evolving role of predominantly black neighborhoods in northern cities from the late 19th century to the present day and reveals forces that caused the ghetto’s role as haven or hell to wax and wane. Offering timely planning and policy recommendations, he provides a new understanding of urban black communities at a time when the future of many inner-city neighborhoods appears uncertain. 212-854-5573 [email protected] Genre Nonfiction Topic African Diaspora Contact Us [email protected] Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
