The Henry Bellmon Office of Scholar Development and Undergraduate Research has long been a national leader and innovator in scholar development and, more recently, undergraduate research. For over 25 years, our office has prepared students for the future, whether in competition for prestigious national and international fellowships, admission to top graduate schools, securing highly competitive jobs, or attaining the skills required to grow as a leader. The past has taught us that diverse programs, targeted to a wide range of majors, year classifications, and interests, has been the most successful way to elevate a large number of students’ educational experience. Our office enhances undergraduate opportunity, encourages student-faculty mentoring, and promotes retention through scholarship/fellowship success, undergraduate research, international experience, and individual/institutional recognition. We hope you will join our team, as student, faculty or supporter, in broadening OSU’s reputation as a top school for scholars who develop their academic abilities in exceptional ways, increasing the national visibility of our students, university, and state.
