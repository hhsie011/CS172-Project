Community Resources Community and Ethical Standards Student Handbook Current: Safety MAAP - Medical Alcohol Amnesty Policy Purpose The purpose of the policy is to facilitate access and remove barriers to students who require medical assistance in alcohol related emergencies, and to provide the opportunity for caring, non-punitive interventions in response to such incidents. The Medical Alcohol Amnesty Policy (MAAP) is a key component of Clemson University's comprehensive approach to reducing the harmful consequences caused by the excessive consumption of alcohol. The MAAP represents the University's commitment to informed decision-making and promotion of responsible behaviors when faced with alcohol-related emergencies. In order to achieve these goals, the MAAP mandates that discretion be exercised, as permitted under Clemson University's Code of Conduct, as follows: Person In Need of Medical Attention The policy may apply when a student receives emergency medical assistance that is (a) related to the consumption of alcohol, and (b) sought by a person not serving in an official University capacity. The student will not be charged or sanctioned for violations of University alcohol-related policies. Students receiving medical assistance in compliance with this policy shall not be referred for prosecution for any state, local or federal crime or misdemeanor solely related to the possession, consumption or supplying of alcohol. The student will be required to consult with the Dean of Students or designee and may be required to participate in an appropriate educational program. Nothing in this policy shall prevent an individual who is obligated by federal, state, or local law, or University policy, practice, or procedure, to do so from reporting, charging, or taking other action related to the possible criminal prosecution of any student. No individual may receive amnesty under this section more than once in a two year period. Records of all requests for assistance under this policy shall be maintained by the Office of Community and Ethical Standards. Participation in any program as a result of this policy shall not be noted on the student's judicial record. In the event an individual who previously utilized the MAAP policy is involved in a subsequent alcohol-related incident, this incident and any resulting charges shall be treated as an alleged second offense. Other Individuals Present Students who seek emergency assistance on behalf of persons experiencing alcohol-related emergencies will not be charged or sanctioned for violations of University alcohol-related policies. Students seeking assistance in compliance with this policy shall not be referred for prosecution for any state, local or federal crime or misdemeanor solely related to the possession, consumption or supplying of alcohol. Students may be required to consult with the Dean or an Associate Dean of Students and may be required to participate in an appropriate educational program depending upon their involvement in the situation. Participation in any program as a result of this policy shall not be noted on the student's judicial record. Nothing in this policy shall prevent an individual who is obligated by federal, state, or local law, or University policy, practice, or procedure, to do so from reporting, charging, or taking other action related to the possible criminal prosecution of any student. No individual may receive amnesty under this section more than once in a two year period. Records of all requests for assistance under this policy shall be maintained by the Office of Community and Ethical Standards. Participation in any program as a result of this policy shall not be noted on the student's judicial record. In the event an individual who previously utilized the MAAP policy is involved in a subsequent alcohol-related incident, this incident and any resulting charges shall be treated as an alleged second offense. Organizations A representative of an organization hosting an event is required to promptly seek medical assistance in an emergency that is related to the consumption of alcohol. Hosting organizations whose representatives seek emergency assistance on behalf of persons experiencing alcohol-related emergencies will not be charged or sanctioned for violations of University alcohol-related policies. Organization representatives may be required to consult with the Dean or an Associate Dean of Students and that organization may be required to participate in an appropriate educational program. Participation in any program as a result of this policy shall not be noted on the organization's judicial record. No organization may receive protection under this section more than one time in an academic year. Reviewed 2012 Contact: Office of Community and Ethical Standards, 912 University Union, 864-656-0510.
