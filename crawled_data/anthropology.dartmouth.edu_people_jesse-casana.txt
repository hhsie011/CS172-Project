Casana's projects explore large regions, embrace long periods of human history, and employ a wide range of technologies. He has directed field projects throughout the Middle East, including in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, Syria and Dubai, and collaborates on numerous other investigations around the globe. Much of Prof. Casana’s research is dedicated to developing new approaches to archaeological remote sensing using satellite imagery, drones, and ground-based geophysics. He currently directs the CORONA Atlas Project, working to make Cold War-era spy satellite imagery available to researchers, NASA and NEH-funded efforts to explore archaeological landscapes using drone-acquired thermal and mulispectral imagery, and he co-directs the NSF-funded SPARC (SPatial Archaeometry Research Collaborations) Program.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Anthropology Undergraduate Overview Major Modified Major Minor Global Health Minor How to Declare an Anthropology Major or Minor Courses Introductory Courses Archaeology Biological Anthropology Cultural Anthropology Independent Study Culminating Seminars Past Teaching Schedules Honors Program Honors Proposal Submission Form Transfer Credits Careers Alumni: Where Are They Now?
