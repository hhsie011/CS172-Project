The series illustrates discussions on three undisputed classics of world cinema; namely “Citizen Kane, 1941, USA, The Rules of the Game, 1939, France, and Late Spring, 1949, Japan.” Each week, Prof. Peña places a given film within its aesthetic, economic, technological, and socio-political context, detailing each director’s formal techniques while teasing out the implications of these aesthetic and technological decisions. *This event will be in English.
