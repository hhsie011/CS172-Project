The program, administered by EcoReps, provides a framework for self-evaluation as well as resources to help student groups implement sustainable practices within their clubs. Anyone from an official UW student group (known as Registered Student Organizations, or RSOs at UW Seattle) can apply to receive a Green Dawg Certification, provided they or a member of the club knowingly volunteer to serve as that club’s Green Dawg Representative. Our brief online survey allows groups to recognize what steps their club is already taking to be green, and areas where there is room for improvement. Qualifying groups will be recognized at different levels of certification based on the criteria they meet. The certification is based on club practices in action areas such as energy conservation, green meetings, paper conservation, waste diversion, transportation, and more. How does a group apply for Certification? To participate, a representative from the applying UW student group should be selected as the designated point of contact, and should complete the online application form. Once the form is filled out, you will receive an email from us within a few days with more information as well as sustainability resources available to you.

Though offices, labs, residence halls and public buildings can be certified green, there is no defined way to certify the practices of individuals or a group. Since a large part of a sustainable campus has to do with our individual actions, it is important that there are accessible ways for students to learn about sustainability and be recognized for it. On the Green Dawgs Team, we believe that the future of sustainability on campus, and around the world, lies within the potential of students to mobilize resources, expertise, information and concrete action to protect the nature and society from environmental degradation.
