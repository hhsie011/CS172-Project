You are here: GT Home Home Coronavirus Covid-19 Health Information Vaccine Executive Order Compliance Requirements Temporarily Suspended Recently, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia issued a nation-wide injunction that temporarily prevents the federal government from enforcing the federal contractor vaccine mandate and the related Covid-19 guidance issued by the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force, in all covered contracts and subcontracts throughout the United States. Based on this injunction, Georgia Tech is temporarily suspending the vaccination requirement for Georgia Tech employees who work on, in support of, or in proximity to people working on federal contracts. If you are a Georgia Tech employee who was notified that you are subject to the federal contractor vaccination requirement, that requirement has been temporarily suspended. Despite this temporary suspension, Georgia Tech strongly encourages those employees identified as subject to the federal contractor vaccine requirement to consider getting vaccinated so that you will be in compliance with the January 18, 2022, deadline in the event the injunction is changed or lifted due to ongoing litigation.
