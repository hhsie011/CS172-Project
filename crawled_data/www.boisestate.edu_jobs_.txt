Boise State is home. When I come to work I am surrounded by individuals who care about me and treat me as part of their family. The campus — especially when classes are in session — has a buzz, a vibrancy and an energetic feeling, unlike any other place I’ve worked. Boise State, and the people who work here, are inspiring.
