Students are advised to review all steps of their academic progress with their academic advisor. 1. Admission, Academic Standing and Withdrawal 1.1 Admission of Freshmen Policies and procedures governing the admission of new freshmen are detailed in another section of the Catalog. (See "Undergraduate Admissions.") Assessment/Course Placement To help insure that students possess the skills necessary to be successful in college, the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education require students to obtain a 19 ACT subject area score(s) in science reasoning, mathematics, and English to enroll in course work in the respective subject area(s). Students must score 19 or higher in reading to enroll in courses that require extensive reading. Students scoring below 19 will be required to remediate in the discipline area (UNIV courses with course numbers beginning with 0) or undergo additional testing to determine the level of readiness for college level work. Students must pass developmental courses within the first 24 hours attempted or have all subsequent enrollments restricted to developmental courses until the deficiencies are removed. If a student fails to remediate in a single subject within the 24 hour limit and is in good academic standing, the advisor and dean may recommend to the Provost that the student be allowed to continue to enroll in college level courses in addition to developmental courses. 1.2 Admission of Transfer Students Policies and procedures governing the admission of transfer students are detailed in another section of the Catalog. (See "Undergraduate Admissions.") 1.3 Admission to Certain Professional Programs Admission to certain programs as approved by the University may be restricted. (See "Undergraduate Admissions" and appropriate college sections in the Catalog.) 1.4 English Proficiency Requirement As a condition of admission to undergraduate study at OSU, all persons for whom English is a second language shall be required to present evidence of English proficiency. (See "Undergraduate Admissions.") 1.5 Satisfactory Academic Progress Students not under academic suspension from the University are judged to be making satisfactory progress toward their educational objectives. They are eligible to enroll in any of the undergraduate colleges except as may be restricted. (See Academic Regulation 1.3 Admission to Certain Professional Programs.) 1.6 Good Academic Standing and Scholastic Requirements for Continuing Enrollment of a Student Under Academic Probation in an Undergraduate College Undergraduate students must meet the GPA requirements below to be in good academic standing. Each college, department, or academic program within OSU may require higher standards for admission, retention, or good academic standing. GPA Requirements for Good Academic Standing Overall Hours attempted (total retention/graduation hours attempted) Minimum Overall Grade-Point Average Required (retention/graduation GPA) 0 through 30 1.70 31 or more 2.00 Any student not maintaining an overall GPA as indicated above will be placed on probation for one semester. At the end of that semester, he or she must have a current term (semester) GPA of 2.00, not to include physical education activity (leisure) or developmental courses, or meet the minimum standard required above, in order to continue as a student. First year students (30 or fewer credit hours, as defined by OSRHE policy) with an overall GPA of 1.70 to less than 2.00 will be placed on academic notice. These students should remain in contact with their student academic service offices regarding special academic support services and procedures. See Academic Regulation 6.4: Grade-Point Average Calculations for a description of overall and current term GPA calculations. These calculations are made three times per year, to coincide with the conclusion of the fall and spring semesters, and the collective summer term. Grades submitted after these calculations are carried forward to the next calculation. (See also Academic Regulation 6.13 Academic Forgiveness.) A student enrolling on probation should seek help from an academic advisor and a counselor in the University Counseling Services when deciding on an academic load and extracurricular activities. 1.7 Academic Suspension A student on probation will be suspended when he or she earns a current term (semester) GPA of less than a 2.00 in regularly-graded course work not including physical education activity (leisure) or developmental courses, and the overall grade-point average falls below the following. See Academic Regulation 6.4: Grade-Point Average Calculations for a description of overall and term GPA calculations. GPA Requirements for Academic Suspension Total Overall Hours attempted (total retention/graduation hours attempted) Minimum Overall Grade-Point Average Required (retention/graduation GPA) 0 through 30 1.70 31 or more 2.00 1.8 Reinstatement after Academic Suspension A student who has been suspended from the University for academic reasons may not be readmitted until one regular semester (fall or spring) has elapsed (unless the faculty appeals committee grants immediate reinstatement). Students who wish to appeal suspension status should inquire about procedures and deadlines from their advisor or the Office of Academic Affairs. Students who were concurrently enrolled in another college or university during the semester may appeal the suspension by submitting an official transcript from the institution. Procedures and deadlines for appealing may be obtained from the Office of Academic Affairs. Readmission after one regular semester (fall or spring) has elapsed will be considered on the merits of the individual case. Suspended students can be readmitted only one time. If a student is suspended a second time, he or she must attend another institution and raise the overall (retention/graduation) GPA before readmission to OSU can be considered. A student with 90 or more hours in a specified degree program who has been academically suspended may enroll, at the discretion of the institution, in up to 15 additional credit hours in a further attempt to achieve the requirements for retention. During these 15 hours of enrollment, the student must achieve a minimum 2.00 current term (semester) GPA at the end of each term or must raise the overall (retention) GPA to 2.00 or above to avoid suspension. This senior suspension exception must be approved by the Director of Student Academic Services or Associate Dean for Instruction in the student's college in the form of a letter to the Registrar. This option can be exercised only once per student. A student suspended from OSU at the end of the spring semester may continue in the summer semester at OSU if this spring suspension was the student's first suspension. The student must complete a minimum of six hours and must achieve a 2.00 current term (summer semester) GPA, or raise the overall (retention/graduation) GPA to the OSRHE standard, in order to continue in the subsequent fall semester. The student should contact his or her dean's office for additional information and restrictions. (See also Academic Regulation 1.7 Academic Suspension.) 1.9 Readmission An undergraduate student who has attended OSU but was not enrolled during the immediate past semester (except the summer session) must submit an updated Application for Admission and current application fee. A student who has enrolled in another college or university since last attending OSU must submit a transcript from each school. Admission status will be determined after an evaluation of the previous work has been made. 1.10 Cancelling Enrollment and Withdrawing from the University Enrollment cancellation occurs when a student drops all classes before classes begin, that is, before the applicable semester or session begins. Student requests to cancel enrollment must be received by the Office of the Registrar before the first day of classes for the term. Enrollment changes, such as cancelling enrollment or withdrawing from the University are the responsibility of the student. Failure to attend classes or nonpayment of tuition and fees does not constitute notice of cancellation. Withdrawing from the University occurs when a student drops all classes after classes begin, that is, after the applicable semester or session begins. The withdrawal process is initiated with the student’s academic advisor or in the student’s academic student services office. International students must also consult with International Students and Scholars (ISS) before dropping courses or withdrawing for the semester. Under reporting regulations required by the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), dropping below full-time can put a student’s visa status in jeopardy. General cancellation and withdrawal periods are provided in the table below. The Academic Calendar provides specific dates for each term. Exceptions to these deadlines may be considered by petition due to documented extraordinary circumstances and committee approval. The Retroactive Drop/Withdraw Petition and the Petition for a Refund of Tuition and Fees are available on the Registrar website (registrar.okstate.edu). Cancellation/Withdrawal Periods for Full-Semester (16-week) Courses Cancellation/Withdrawal Periods for Full-Semester (16-week) Courses Semester Time Period Course Grade Course-Related Tuition/Fee Refund Before term begins (cancellation) No transcript records 100% refund First 6 days No transcript record 100% refund Day 7-10 No transcript record Partial refund Weeks 3-12 "W" No refund Weeks 13-14 "W" or "F" as assigned by instructor No refund Weeks 15-16 Final grade as assigned by instructor No refund Summer courses, intersession courses, and other courses that do not extend through the entire 16-week semester follow proportionate cancellation/withdrawal/refund periods. (See also OSU Policy 2-0206 Adding and Dropping Classes and Withdrawing from the University). 2. Student Status 2.1 Classification of Students Undergraduate classification is determined by the criteria below: Classification of Students Year Criteria Freshman fewer than 30 semester credit hours earned Sophomore 30 to 59 semester credit hours earned Junior 60 to 89 semester credit hours earned Senior 90 or more semester credit hours earned These hours are calculated based on overall (retention) hours earned. 2.2 Full-Time Students Undergraduate students who are enrolled in 12 or more semester credit hours (six or more for the summer session) are classified as "full-time" students. Graduate students enrolled in nine or more semester credit hours (three or more for the summer session) are classified as "full-time." Credit hours offered through correspondence study are not counted toward full-time status, unless the course is independent study taken through regular enrollment. Students engaged in an internship or cooperative education program assignment that requires full-time work on the assignment are regarded as full-time students when they are enrolled in the number of credit hours deemed appropriate for the academic credit they receive for the assignment. A student holding a 0.50 FTE Graduate Teaching/Research Associate/Assistant (GTA or GRA) appointment who is enrolled in a minimum of six hours during the fall or spring semester and two hours during the summer semester will be certified as a full-time graduate student. Any FTE appointment less than 0.50 requires nine hours of enrollment for the fall or spring semester and three hours of enrollment for the summer semester in order for the student to be classified as a full-time student. There is no reduction in credit hour requirements in the final semester of enrollment for GTAs or GRAs. A student enrolled for the final semester of a bachelor's degree program may be classified as a full-time student if enrolled in fewer than 12 hours during that semester. Doctoral Candidacy Enrollment Requirements Doctoral students who have completed the requirements for admission to doctoral candidacy and had their “Admission to Doctoral Candidacy” form approved by the Graduate College may enroll for a minimum of at least two credit hours during any term and be considered full-time. This post-candidacy reduced enrollment option applies to all qualified graduate students, including GTAs, GRAs, international students and veterans receiving VA benefits. A student is normally expected to enroll primarily in research hours or in program-approved courses after being admitted to doctoral candidacy. 2.3 Part-Time Students Students who are enrolled but not meeting the definition of full-time students are classified as "part-time." Undergraduate students are classified as "half-time" if they are enrolled in six hours in a regular semester (or three hours in a summer session). Graduate students are classified as "half-time" if they are enrolled in four hours in a regular semester (or two hours in a summer session). 2.4 Special Students A student who does not have immediate plans to enter a degree program but wants to take courses may be classified as a "special student." A student on an F-1 visa may not enroll as a special student since he or she must be admitted to a degree program. 3. Undergraduate Degree Requirements 3.1 Date of Matriculation A student's matriculation date is associated with his or her first term after high school graduation as an admitted student in an accredited institution of higher education. That date will be used in calculating the time limit for the use of a given plan of study. 3.2 Changes in Degree Requirements A student generally follows the degree requirements associated with his or her matriculation year. Although the curriculum may be revised before a student graduates, students will be held responsible for the degree requirements in effect at the time of matriculation and any changes that are made, so long as these changes do not result in semester credit hours being added or do not delay graduation. A student has the option of adopting the new degree requirements that have been established since matriculation. The time limit for following a given undergraduate degree program is six years. Time limits for graduate degrees are described under "Academic Regulations" in the "Graduate College" section of the Catalog. 3.3 The Honors College (See the "Honors College" section of the Catalog.) 3.4 General Education Requirements In keeping with State Regents policy, every OSU undergraduate degree includes a 40-credit-hour general education core that meets the requirements specified in the following table. Degree requirements may exceed the minimum criteria stated below. Courses that carry general education designations are identified in the student information system and the Courses section of the Catalog. Physical education/leisure activity courses may not be used to meet general education requirements. General Education Requirements General Education Area General Education Designation Required Minimum (at least 40 credit hours total) Courses and Notes (See degree plans for details) The following English, history and government courses are specified on all degree plans as required by OSRHE and OSU policy. English Composition - 6 credit hours See Academic Regulation 3.5 American History - 3 credit hours HIST 1103, HIST 1483, or HIST 1493 American Government - 3 credit hours POLS 1113 The analytical and quantitative thought course may be specified on degree plans. Analytical and Quantitative Thought A 3 credit hours of mathematics MATH or STAT prefix with A designation For the following 15 credit hours, generally degree plans do not require specific courses (see exception below); Students are allowed to choose any courses that meet the area requirements. Humanities H 6 credit hours Courses with H designation Social and Behavior Sciences S 3 credit hours Courses with S designation Natural Sciences N 6 credit hours Courses with N designation. One course must also carry the L designation. Scientific Investigation (Laboratory Science) L 1 course See Natural Sciences Diversity D 1 course Course with D designation; No minimum credit hour requirement; Institutional policy, not required by the State Regents; Unless the D course also carries an A, H, S, or N, it is not included in the minimum 40-credit-hour general education total. International Dimension I 1 course Course with I designation; No minimum credit hour requirement; Institutional policy, not required by the State Regents; Unless the I course also carries an A, H, S, or N, it is not included in the minimum 40-credit-hour general education total. Degree plans may specify courses for the following 10 hours. Additional General Education Courses A, H, S, or N 10 credit hours to reach total of 40 OSU degree plans are designed to allow maximum flexibility within general education areas H, S, N, L, D, and I, so students may select the courses they take to fulfill these requirements. No more than 10 general education credit hours should be specific required courses on a degree plan, as indicated in the last row of the table above. Departments/Colleges may request an exception from the Office of Academic Affairs to specify more than 10 hours, but such exceptions would generally be approved only in the case of formal written external accreditation or certification requirements. Substitution of general education courses is allowed when background for the major demands greater depth in an area in which a general education requirement is stated. Only in the Analytical and Quantitative Thought (A) and Natural Sciences (N) areas is substitution of the more advanced lower-division course permitted. Such a substitution requires the recommendation of the student’s academic advisor and dean and the approval of the Office of Academic Affairs. (See also Academic Regulation 3.6.) For students who earn an Associate of Arts or Associate of Science degree from another college or university within the Oklahoma State System, the lower-division general education requirement of the baccalaureate degree shall be the responsibility of the institution awarding the associate degree, providing the general education requirements specified by the State Regents are met. OSU may, with the approval of the State Regents, require that transferring students complete additional general education work for the degree if such additional work is programmed as a part of the upper division requirements of the degree program. The Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education require computer proficiency prior to graduation. The use of computers is an integral part of every OSU degree program; hence a student demonstrates proficiency by satisfactorily completing degree requirements. 3.5 English Composition Requirement The University requires a minimum of six semester credit hours in English composition for a baccalaureate degree. The required sequence of courses is ENGL 1113 Composition I and ENGL 1213 Composition II. For those who qualify, ENGL 1123 International Freshman Composition I or ENGL 1313 Critical Analysis and Writing I may be substituted for ENGL 1113 Composition I. Students who earn an "A" or "B" in ENGL 1113 Composition I (or ENGL 1123 International Freshman Composition I or ENGL 1313 Critical Analysis and Writing I) or who earn three semester credit hours in English composition through credit by exam, and who have the consent of their college, may substitute ENGL 3323 Technical Writing for ENGL 1213 Composition II. Students who qualify may substitute ENGL 1223 International Freshman Composition II or ENGL 1413 Critical Analysis and Writing II for ENGL 1213 Composition II. A third course may be required by the student's college to satisfy either an additional composition or oral communication requirement. 3.6 Substitution of Required Courses A course substitution is a specific course that takes the place of a required course on a degree plan because it meets the content and/or spirit of the requirement. Individual colleges have the authority to approve substitutions for required courses on degree plans with two exceptions: Substitutions related to university general education requirements require approval from Academic Affairs (see Academic Regulation 3.4), with the exception of the English composition substitutions described in Academic Regulation 3.5; A lower-division course may not be substituted for an upper-division course to meet degree requirements. 3.7 Waiving of Required Courses A course waiver excuses a student from completing a required course on a degree plan because the student has fulfilled the content requirement of the course by completing other courses or academic experiences. A course waiver does not result in awarding credit hours and consequently does not reduce the number of semester credit hours required for the degree or for any other degree-related requirements. A maximum of six semester credit hours may be waived, and waiver approval is granted only in special circumstances. Required courses in English, American history and American government cannot be waived. Waivers must be approved by the student’s advisor, the head of the student’s major department and the dean of the college. Waivers involving university general education requirements must in addition be approved by Academic Affairs. 3.8 Changing Majors Students are advised to select a specific major no later than the end of the sophomore year. Students on probation, or not making satisfactory progress toward a degree, may change majors only with the approval of the dean of the college in which they wish to pursue a different degree. Students should contact the office of Student Academic Services of his or her college concerning procedures and forms to change majors and/or minors. 3.9 Deadline for Completion of Requirements Degrees are conferred only on specific commencement dates. If a student completes requirements for a degree after a commencement date, the degree will be granted at the next scheduled commencement after the student files a graduation application. (See Academic Regulation 7.8 Graduation Application.) The student may request a certified statement of completion of graduation requirements from the Office of the Registrar. 3.10 Second Baccalaureate Degree A student who receives a baccalaureate degree from OSU may use all applicable courses toward a second baccalaureate degree. An additional baccalaureate degree may not be earned in the same major as the first degree, even if the option is different. For example, it is not possible to earn both a BS degree in Sociology with an option in Anthropology and a BS degree in Sociology with an option in Applied Sociology. Completion of requirements for more than one concentration may be noted on the official transcript, but a second degree will not be awarded. The Bachelor of University Studies cannot be earned as a second or concurrent OSU baccalaureate degree. Second Graduate Degrees The Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education (OSRHE) do not allow students to obtain a second degree in the same “major” as the first degree, even if the options/concentrations are different. For example, it is not possible to earn both an MS degree in Physics with a concentration in Medical Physics and an MS degree in Physics with a concentration in Optics and Photonics. Completion of requirements for more than one concentration may be noted on the official transcript, but a second degree will not be awarded. Additionally, because of the OSRHE requirement for a coursework common core within a master’s degree options, it should not be assumed that obtaining an additional option/concentration within the same degree program and level will be possible. Careful discussions and planning with the Graduate Program Coordinator prior to admission is imperative, if such study is desired. 3.11 Double Majors and Minors A double major can be earned by satisfying the primary major's degree requirements and the major requirements for the second major plus any additional college/departmental requirements from the second major degree plan if deemed appropriate by the college home of the second major. If the general education courses are met from one college, they do not need to be met for the second major if it is in another college. The second major does not necessarily require hours above the minimum required for the first major. Whether additional hours are required generally depends upon the number of electives allowed by the first major and the extent of overlap between courses in the two majors. Minors are available for many fields of study. A list of current minors and their requirements can be found on the Degree Requirements page of the Registrar's website and in the "Minors and Certificates" section of the Catalog. Undergraduate minors may not duplicate majors or options/concentrations within a student's curriculum (for example, a student who earns a BA in Art with an Art History concentration may earn a minor in Studio Art but not Art History). All components of a student's curriculum, including multiple majors and/or minors, will be noted on the student's transcript while in-progress. Students should contact their college Student Academic Services office for information on adding or removing additional majors or minors from their curriculum. 3.12 Pre-Finals Week Final examinations are scheduled at the end of each semester and are preceded by pre-finals week, which begins seven days prior to the first day of finals. During pre-finals week, all normal class activities will continue; however, no assignment, test or examination accounting for more than five percent of the course grade may be given; and no activity or field trip may be scheduled that conflicts with another class. This excludes makeup and laboratory examinations, out-of-class assignments or projects made prior to pre-finals week, and independent study courses. No student or campus organization may hold meetings, banquets, receptions, or may sponsor or participate in any activity, program, or related function that requires student participation. Additional information may be obtained from the student services office of each college or the Office of Academic Affairs. 3.13 Final Exam Overload In the event that a student has three or more final exams scheduled for a single day, that student is entitled to arrange with the faculty member instructing the highest numbered course (based on the 4-digit course number) to reschedule that examination at a time of mutual convenience during final exam week. (Common final exams are not among those to be rescheduled unless two common exams are scheduled at the same time.) The affected student should submit to the instructor a written request to take the affected exam at a different time at least two weeks prior to the beginning of final exam week. In seeking to provide relief to the student, the instructor may request that the student provide a copy of his or her schedule to confirm the difficulty. The instructor has one week prior to the beginning of final exam week to arrange a mutually convenient time for administration of the final exam, after which the student may take the request to the instructor’s department head. 4. Credits 4.1 Residence Credit Residence credit is awarded for work taken on campus (not through correspondence or credit earned by examination) or at a location officially designated as a residence center by the governing board of the institution (e.g., in-state military bases and OSU courses at OSU-Tulsa.) 4.2 Credit Earned Through Outreach and Correspondence Outreach Credit Outreach credit is earned by OSU-admitted students who complete credit courses offered during normal academic terms through OSU academic outreach programs. Outreach courses are also referred to as "electronically delivered" and "traditional off-campus courses and programs" in State Regents’ policy. OSU accepts transfer outreach credit from other accredited institutions. Outreach credit is fully applicable toward the satisfaction of requirements for academic degrees and certificates consistent with State Regents’ and institutional residence and degree requirements. Correspondence Credit Correspondence credit is earned by students who complete year-long correspondence study courses offered through Office of Individual Study. Admission to OSU is not required to earn correspondence credit unless the student intends to apply the credits toward an OSU degree. OSU will accept, toward a degree, a maximum of eight transfer semester credit hours earned through correspondence study from other accredited institutions. Credits earned through correspondence study cannot exceed one-fourth of the credits required for a baccalaureate degree. (See also Academic Regulations 2.2, 4.1, 5.5, and 6.11.) 4.3 Transfer Credit from Other Accredited Four-Year Institutions Except as excluded in Academic Regulations 4.4 Transfer of Credit from Community Colleges and 7.2 Residence Credit Requirements, credits transferred from accredited senior colleges will apply toward baccalaureate degrees in the same way that they would apply had they been earned in residence at OSU. Students may not use transfer credits to satisfy more than one-half the major course requirements for a department unless they have the approval of the head of that department and the academic dean. 4.4 Transfer Credit from Community Colleges Credits will be accepted by transfer from a community college to meet lower-division (i.e., 1000- and 2000-level courses) requirements only. A minimum of 60 semester credit hours must be earned at a senior college. Within these guidelines, transfer credits are subject to the individual colleges' degree requirements. See Academic Regulation 4.6 for degree applicability of credit for prior learning received from community college transcripts. 4.5 Transfer Credit from International Colleges and Universities Credit is accepted based on equivalent standards as outlined in Academic Regulations 4.3 and 4.4. Credit is accepted based on the U.S. letter grade equivalents for the post-secondary grading method used in each country of study. 4.6 Credit for Prior Learning (Credit by Exam) Credit for prior learning, also referred to as credit by exam, applies to learning acquired from, but not limited to, work and life experiences, non-degree granting institutions, professional training, military training, or open source learning. OSU uses the State Regents' recognized or approved methods to validate prior learning for awarding credit, including the following examinations: Advanced Placement Program (AP), International Baccalaureate Program (IB), College Level Examination Program (CLEP), DANTES Subject Standardized Tests (DSST), and OSU Advanced Standing Examinations. a. credit earned by examination will be recorded on a student’s OSU transcript with a neutral grade of “CBE-P” (Pass) if the student earns the equivalent of a “C” or better on the examination. No grade is recorded if the student fails the exam; b. credit earned by examination does not count toward the minimum of 30 hours that must be earned in residence (See Academic Regulation 7.2 Residence Credit Requirements); c. credit earned by examination through institution-independent exams, including AP, CLEP, IB and DSST (see military credit below), applies toward the minimum 60 semester credit hours that must be earned at a senior college, regardless of whether OSU received the exam scores directly from the primary testing source or from transfer transcripts (including high school, community college, and senior college transcripts). Credit earned through Advanced Standing (Departmental) Examinations will only apply toward the minimum 60 credit hours that must be earned at a senior college if the examination credit was awarded at a senior college. Advanced Standing (Departmental) Examinations from community colleges do not apply toward the 60 credit hours. Generic credit by exam (unknown exam type) will only apply toward the minimum 60 credit hours that must be earned at a senior college if the source of the credit is a senior college. d. a native speaker of a foreign language (one whose high-school level instruction was conducted principally in that language) cannot earn credit toward graduation in lower-division (1000-2000 level) courses in that language (See Academic Regulation 4.9 Foreign Language Credit for Native Speakers); OSU Advanced Standing Examinations may be offered by academic departments on campus in subject areas not offered through the examination programs listed above. Any currently enrolled student whose travel, employment, extensive readings or educational experience appear to have given the student proficiency in a subject that is offered at OSU, equivalent to the proficiency ordinarily expected of those students who take the subject in a regular class, may apply for an examination on the subject. In addition to the regulations listed above, to qualify for an OSU Advanced Standing Examination the student must: a. be enrolled at OSU; b. not have taken an Advanced Standing exam over the course within the preceding six months; c. receive the approval of the head of the department and the associate dean in which the course is offered; d. present a valid student I.D. at the examination. Information pertaining to OSU Advanced Standing Examinations may be obtained from the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Military Credit OSU accepts credit as recommended by the American Council on Education (ACE), as published in "The Guide to the Evaluation of Military Experiences in the Armed Services," for selected educational experiences provided by the armed forces. OSU also accepts credit earned through the DSST exams (DANTES Subject Standardized tests) for active veteran and dependent military personnel. Students who wish to establish credit for military training should request and submit a copy of their JST (Joint Services Transcript) and/or a DSST transcript to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions for evaluation. Training Programs OSU awards credit as recommended by the American Council on Education (ACE) in the "National Guide to Educational Credit for Training Programs." Students may present certificates of completion or a transcript from the ACE Registry of Credit Recommendations to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions for evaluation. OSU also awards credit based on the recommendation of the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York in the NCCRS (National College Credit Recommendation Service, formerly National PONSI). 4.7 Graduate Credit Hours for Undergraduates An OSU undergraduate senior may take a limited number of courses for graduate credit toward an OSU degree program. Undergraduates admitted to an approved OSU accelerated master’s degree program may utilize some of these credits for both a baccalaureate degree and graduate degree as outlined in section 11.15 of the Graduate College section of the University Catalog. All other undergraduates are subject to the graduate credit rules below. The credits may not be utilized for both a baccalaureate degree and a graduate degree. The courses in question must be approved for graduate credit (as listed in the Course Catalog). The applicability of such graduate courses to a specific graduate program will be determined by the student's graduate advisory committee when the student enrolls in the Graduate College and submits a plan of study for an advanced degree. To receive credit, a Graduate Credit for Seniors form must be completed by the student to receive graduate credit for courses taken. This form must be submitted to the Graduate College prior to the end of the second week of class instruction of a regular semester, or the first week of a regular summer session. The required form is available on the Graduate College's website or in the Graduate College. Such credit may be earned only if the following conditions are satisfied at the time of application: Students must have a minimum overall (cumulative graduation/retention) undergraduate GPA of 3.00. The total enrollment must not exceed 18 credit hours for a regular semester or nine credit hours for a summer session. The student must be within 12 semester credit hours of completing requirements for the baccalaureate degree at the beginning of the semester or summer session in which courses are taken for graduate credit. Admission to courses taken for graduate credit must have approval of the course instructor, the director of the undergraduate student services office associated with the student's major, and the dean of the Graduate College. Not more than 15 semester credit hours taken while a senior may be approved for graduate credit. The student must earn a grade of "B" or higher in those courses for which he or she seeks graduate credit. Credit will be applied to the student's graduate transcript only after the student has been admitted as a graduate student at OSU. Students are cautioned that institutions other than OSU may or may not allow courses taken for graduate credit during the senior year to be transferred into one of their graduate programs. 4.8 Semester Credit Hour A semester credit hour is equivalent to sixteen 50-minute class sessions (including examinations) conducted under the guidance of a qualified instructor plus 32 hours of preparation time, or sixteen 3-hour laboratory sessions, or sixteen 2-hour laboratory sessions plus 16 hours of preparation time. These same equivalencies apply to outreach courses, short courses and other learning formats for which academic credit is awarded. 4.9 Foreign Language Credit for Native Speakers A native speaker of a foreign language cannot enroll in or earn credit toward graduation in lower-division (1000- or 2000-level) courses in that language. A native speaker of a foreign language is defined as a person whose high-school level instruction was conducted principally in that language. Native speakers may occasionally have valid reasons for establishing credit in a lower-division course. Requests for such consideration should be directed to the dean of the student's college for recommendation to the head of the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures. 5. Enrollment 5.1 Course Numbering System All courses are identified by numbers composed of four digits. The first digit indicates the class year in which the subject is ordinarily taken, although enrollment is not exclusive as to student classification (1-freshman, 2-sophomore, 3-junior, 4-senior, 5 and 6-graduate, 7-professional); the second and third digits identify the course within the field; and the last digit indicates the number of semester credit hours the course carries. For example, a course numbered 1123 should be interpreted as a freshman, or beginning, level course carrying three hours of credit. A course number beginning with zero indicates that the course does not carry University credit. A course number ending in zero indicates that the course carries variable credit. All courses approved for graduate credit must be numbered 5000 or above. When sections of graduate courses are cross-listed (meet at the same time on the same days in the same classroom with the same instructor) with undergraduate courses, the syllabus for the graduate course must include assignments at an intellectual level commensurate with that of graduate work when compared to that required for undergraduate credit. 5.2 Maximum Semester Credit Hour Load Undergraduate students are allowed to enroll in the number of credit hours each semester that do not result in academic overload, which is defined as the number of semester-credit-hours 25 percent or more than the number of weeks in the applicable academic term. See the "Graduate College" section of the Catalog for graduate student enrollment information. Undergraduates desiring to carry an academic overload must have demonstrated readiness to perform on an overload basis, either through superior performance on a college aptitude test or on the basis of superior academic achievement in high school or college, and must complete a Petition for Excessive Hours (available in the Office of the Registrar). The maximum academic overload in any given term is limited to the number of semester-credit-hours which is 50 percent greater than the total number of weeks in the applicable academic term. Exceptions to deserving students may be granted by the Office of Academic Affairs. In a regular 16-week Fall or Spring semester, the maximum enrollment for undergraduates without special approval is 19 credit hours. Enrollment in 20 to 24 credit hours results in academic overload, which requires a Petition for Excessive Hours. Enrollment in 25 or more credit hours requires both a Petition for Excessive Hours and approval by the Office of Academic Affairs. Proportionate credit-hour limits apply to summer sessions and intersession periods separately, depending on the length of the session. 5.3 Adding Courses The sixth class day of a regular semester or the third class day of an eight-week summer session, or the proportionate period for block or short courses is the last day a course may be added (nonrestrictive). With instructor and academic advisor approval, a course may be added during the second week of classes (seventh through tenth class days) of a regular semester or the fourth or fifth class day of an eight-week summer session, or the proportionate period for block or short courses (restrictive). 5.4 Dropping Courses Dropping refers to the dropping of one or more courses while remaining enrolled in at least one other OSU course for a given semester. Courses may not be dropped without the approval of the student’s academic advisor. Enrollment changes, such as dropping courses, are the responsibility of the student. Failure to attend classes or nonpayment of tuition and fees does not constitute dropping a course. General drop periods are provided in the table below. The Academic Calendar provides specific dates for each term. Exceptions to these deadlines may be considered by petition due to documented extraordinary circumstances and committee approval. The Retroactive Drop/Withdraw Petition and the Petition for a Refund of Tuition and Fees forms are available on the Registrar website. Periods for Dropping Full-Semester (16-week) Courses Periods for Dropping Full-Semester (16-week) Courses Semester Time Period Course Grade Course-Related Tuition/Fee Refund Before term begins No transcript record 100% refund First 6 days No transcript record 100% refund Days 7-10 No transcript record Partial refund Weeks 3-12 "W" No refund Weeks 13-14 Assigned grade of "W" or "F" by instructor No refund Weeks 15-16 No drop option - Final grade as assigned by instructor No refund Summer courses, intersession courses, and other courses that do not extend through the entire 16-week semester follow proportionate drop/refund periods. A student may not drop any course in which a violation of academic integrity is pending against the student. If the student admits responsibility for a violation meriting a grade of "F" for an assignment or examination, the instructor or Academic Integrity Panel may permit the student to drop the course with a grade of "W." If the student is found not responsible for the violation, he or she may drop the course with either a "W" or "F," (according to the drop grade policy) appearing on the academic record. If the student is found responsible for the violation, the instructor may assign an appropriate sanction, including assigning the grade "F" for the assignment/examination or "F!" for the course. (See Policy and Procedures Letter 02-0822). International students need to consult with International Students and Scholars (ISS) before dropping courses or withdrawing for the semester. Under reporting regulations required by the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), dropping below full-time can put a student’s visa status in jeopardy. 5.5 Concurrent Enrollment A student who desires to earn credits concurrently at another institution or through correspondence, or DANTES (Defense Activity for Non-traditional Education Support) examinations while enrolled for residence credit at OSU, must secure approval in advance from his or her dean if he or she expects this institution to accept those credits. Armed Forces personnel will be granted 60 days from the date of their first enrollment to establish, through DANTES examinations, advanced standing in subject matter that they mastered while in the Armed Forces. 5.6 Course Prerequisites Course prerequisites are published in the course section of the University Catalog. When no prerequisites are listed for courses numbered 3000 or 4000, it is understood that the prerequisite is approval of the student’s advisor. The prerequisite for courses at the 5000 or 6000 level is graduate standing in addition to any other prerequisites listed. Instructors may waive prerequisites when the student’s background justifies this action. Academic advisors may only provide overrides of prerequisite requirements for undergraduate courses, and only if examination of the student’s academic record verifies the prerequisites for the undergraduate course have been met. Before the beginning of a term, departments may review class rosters to verify completion of prerequisite requirements and may initiate action to drop students who do not meet the published requirements. Prior approval of the instructor may be required for enrollment in problems courses, independent study, internships, thesis and dissertation courses, and courses taught in a professional school. 5.7 Class Enrollment Maxima The maximum number of students permitted to be enrolled in each section of a course is determined by the department head and can be increased or decreased only by the department head or dean. Generally, the maximum number of students permitted in an honors section is 22 students. The Dean of The Honors College may slightly increase or decrease the size of some honors sections. The number of students enrolled in a class may not exceed the fire code capacity of the designated classroom. 5.8 Priority Enrollment Currently enrolled/continuing students register for summer and fall classes during the latter part of the preceding spring semester, and for spring classes during the latter part of the fall semester. In order to facilitate access to courses required for timely degree completion, a student's priority for enrollment generally follows academic class level with seniors having the highest priority. Some exceptions to this basic priority may be necessary to accommodate bona fide student needs, such as a special priority for physically disabled students. The Office of Academic Affairs determines enrollment priorities, and enrollment schedules and priorities are posted in the enrollment guide located on the Registrar's website at registrar.okstate.edu. Full-time staff members may utilize priority enrollment to help ensure they are given an opportunity to identify a section(s) at a time that is least disruptive to work in the office. This benefit of priority enrollment is extended to full-time (100% FTE), regular staff members. Staff members employed at less than one hundred percent are not eligible for priority enrollment. 5.9 Late Enrollment Students are allowed and encouraged to enroll well before the beginning of a given term (fall, spring, summer). Students whose initial enrollment for the term occurs on or after the first day of the class will be charged a late enrollment fee. A student is permitted to add classes after initial enrollment without a late enrollment fee during the first two weeks of a 16-week semester or through the fifth day of an eight-week summer session or during proportionate periods for block or short courses. Adding a course or increasing credit hours in a variable-credit class after the restrictive deadline is granted by petition only through the Office of the Registrar, and is not appropriate if enrollment was delayed due to a registration hold or if the semester has ended. Late class section changes approved through this petition process will be processed as if they occurred within the nonrestrictive drop/add period. See the "Tuition, Fees, and Cost Estimates" section of the Catalog for the current late enrollment fee amount. 5.10 Payment of Tuition and Fees Oklahoma State University (OSU) combines enrollment costs and charges from different areas on campus into one consolidated account. By enrolling/registering in classes, students accept the responsibility of the costs associated with the courses unless dropping/withdrawal occurs by the published dates to receive credit. The Bursar Office generates a monthly electronic billing statement (e-bill) on the last business day of every month detailing charges, credits, and payments that occurred during the month. A billing email notification is sent to the student’s OSU email address at the beginning of each month when the billing statement is available to view online. Your OSU email is considered to be the primary source for receiving electronic communications from the University. If someone other than the student should also receive billing notifications, an authorized user may be set up by the student through student portal at http://my.okstate.edu/ by clicking OSU Stillwater/Tulsa Bursar Account under Quick Links. Authorized user login access is located through the bursar website at http://bursar.okstate.edu. Payment is due no later than the 15th of each month. All tuition and fees (required and optional) and other charges are considered past due if not paid by the 15th of the billing month. Late fees and holds can be avoided by paying by the published deadline. Students may use their O-Key credentials to view online real-time account activity at http://my.okstate.edu/ clicking OSU Stillwater/Tulsa Bursar Account under Quick Links. Failure to view a bill does not relieve the student of his/her financial obligation. It is the student’s responsibility to update addresses and phone numbers at the University. Miscellaneous charges (such as books/supplies) may occur throughout the semester, often after financial aid has processed. Students are responsible for paying these subsequent charges as they appear on monthly bursar billing statements. In efforts to assist students in meeting financial obligations, Oklahoma State University offers a semester based payment plan as an alternative to the traditional lump-sum payment method. This plan provides an opportunity for families (authorized users) and students to pay University billed expenses in regular monthly payments. No finance charges are associated with the payment plan or enrollment holds if payments are made as promised. The Payment Plan is available online each semester. The student can sign-up online at http://my.okstate.edu/ by clicking OSU Stillwater/Tulsa Bursar Account under Quick Links. It is important to designate a parent under the authorized user tab by entering their email address for access to the payment plan enrollment. September 15th is the deadline to enroll in the Fall plan and February 15th is the deadline to enroll for the Spring plan. Summer enrollment is not eligible for the plan. There is a $25 non-refundable application fee due at the time of application each semester. Payment plan participants receive installment payment due notifications in separate emails from the monthly billing notification. The monthly billing notification informs payment plan participants of the total monthly billing statement amount for informational purposes. Providing a paper check as payment authorizes Oklahoma State University to clear that check electronically. Bank accounts may be debited the same day payment is received. Electronically cleared transactions appear on bank statements even though paper checks are not presented to the financial institution. Any resubmission due to insufficient funds may also occur electronically. All transactions are secure and payment by check constitutes acceptance of these terms. Returned items are assessed a $25 fee and the account holder is responsible for all dishonored payments which have been processed on their account. If a payment is returned to the University by the bank and the payment was made to get enrolled, the Bursar may cancel enrollment and referral to student conduct is a possibility. Delinquent accounts accrue a penalty at the rate of 1.5% monthly (19.56% APR). Any charges incurred by the University in an effort to collect on delinquent accounts are assessed to and become the responsibility of the account holder. Delinquent account information is disclosed to credit reporting agencies, which could endanger the student’s credit rating on a local or national level. Past due accounts are presented to the warrant intercept program (WIP) that captures state income tax refunds to pay outstanding OSU debt. Oklahoma law has jurisdiction and any disputes arising shall be determined in accordance with the law of this jurisdiction. Accounts must be current before a student can obtain the release of any academic records such as transcript, receive a diploma or enroll for subsequent semesters. Oklahoma State University extends bursar optional charging privileges to students in order to facilitate use of campus based services. Bursar accounts must remain current or charging privileges may be revoked. If the student’s federal or institutional financial aid or third-party sponsor payment is either not received by Oklahoma State University or loss of eligibility to retain financial aid for the semester occurs, the student still has the responsibility for paying their bursar account obligations by the set due date. Consent is assumed that communication via all phone numbers, including cell phones, provided to the University as a source of contact could occur. This includes contact from its agents, representatives, and attorneys (including collection agencies) for purposes of collecting any portion of your account financial obligation which is past due. The University reserves the right to request prepayment before allowing registration for future terms based upon previous actions. 5.11 Auditing Courses A student who does not wish to receive credit in a course may enroll as an auditor, provided space is available and the student obtains approval from the instructor of the course and his or her advisor. (Note: advisor permission is only required for currently enrolled students.) A student who enrolls as an auditor must verify that he or she will not petition to receive credit for the audited course by any method other than that described below under "Audit to Credit." Instructor discretion will determine the auditor's level of class participation, such as taking exams or turning in assignments. Audited courses do not count in the determination of full-time student status and do not apply toward Veterans Affairs benefits. Laboratory courses, private music lessons, studio art courses, outreach courses, and other courses that require special course fees are not open for audit enrollment. The audit enrollment form is available on the Office of the Registrar website (registrar.okstate.edu). Initial enrollment in a course as an auditor may be completed only between the first and the tenth class day (inclusive) of a 16-week semester and proportionate periods for shorter sessions. Audit to Credit The allowable time to change from audit to credit enrollment is between the first and tenth class day (inclusive) of a 16-week semester and proportionate periods for shorter sessions. Students changing enrollment status from audit to credit must have been admitted to OSU. Credit to Audit A student who is already enrolled for credit in a course may change the enrollment to audit only if the student officially drops the course (or, if appropriate, withdraws) at the time the student changes to audit. This action is not allowed after the drop/withdraw deadline for the course. The audit action will not remove the original course withdrawal notation from the student's transcript. Audited courses appear on a student's official transcript with an indication that the course was an audit enrollment. An "AU" appears where the grade would normally appear. The "AU" does not contribute to a student's GPA, and no credit hours are earned for the course. Audit enrollments follow the same resident and non-resident tuition and fee policies as credit enrollments. Late enrollment fees are waived for audit enrollments. Any individual 65 years or older may audit a class at no charge. The audit tuition and fees are also waived for faculty and staff who have retired from the University under the Oklahoma Teacher Retirement System's "Rule of 80" or "Rule of 90" regardless of age at time of retirement (OSU Policy 2-0108). 5.12 Minimum Class Size The minimum number of students required in order for a class to meet is as follows: 20 students for lower-division classes, 12 students for upper-division classes, and eight students for graduate-level classes. 6. Grades and Grading 6.1 Official Transcripts All official transcripts of the student's academic record at OSU are prepared and released by the Office of the Registrar. Copies of transcripts from other institutions cannot be furnished. 6.2 Grade Interpretation The quality of student performance in all classes is indicated by the following letter grades: "A," "B," "C," "D," "F," "F!," "I," "NP," "P," "S," "U," "W," "R," "SR," or "UR." Descriptions of the grades are provided below. For graduate students, a grade of "D" or "F" is considered a failing grade. Additional consequences and/or requirements for graduate students receiving "C," "D," and "F" grades also exist in most graduate programs. Irrespective of letter grades received, an overall 3.00 GPA must be maintained. See the "Graduate College" section of the Catalog. Undergraduate Grade Interpretation Grade Interpretation Grade "A" Excellent Grade "B" Good Grade "C" Average Grade "D" Below average Grade "F" Failure Graduate Grade Interpretation Grade Interpretation Grade "A" Excellent Grade "B" Good Grade "C" Passing Grade "D" No Graduate Degree Credit Grade "F" No Graduate Degree Credit Grade "F"! (pronounced F shriek) The "!" indicates that the student failed the course because of a violation of academic integrity. Students may remove the first "!" (though not the "F") from their transcripts by completing an academic integrity educational program. The "F!" will appear on the transcript for a minimum of one semester. (See also academicintegrity.okstate.edu.) "Incomplete" Grade This grade is given to a student who satisfactorily completes the majority of course work (i.e., material amounting to more than 50% of the course grade as outlined in the course syllabus) and whose work averaged "D" or better, but who has been unavoidably prevented from completing the remaining work of the course. This grade is considered temporary. The instructor should convey to the student the conditions the student must fulfill in order to complete the course. The instructor will submit a final grade of “I” along with an incomplete final/default grade. The default is the projected grade the student would earn if he or she received a zero for the remaining course work. Grades of "A," and ”SR” are not permitted for the default grade, and an instructor may not require the student to repeat the course to remove the incomplete. The academic transcript will reflect an "I" grade for the course until the final grade is assigned. The maximum time allowed for a student to complete the course is one calendar year after the end of the semester for which the incomplete grade was awarded. The dean of the student's college (for graduate students, this is the Graduate Dean) may recommend to the Office of the Registrar an adjustment of this period in exceptional circumstances, which must be clearly documented with supporting evidence when deemed appropriate. Instructors have the prerogative to require a shorter period of time to complete the remaining requirements. It is the responsibility of the student to satisfy the requirements stipulated by the instructor at the time the incomplete grade is assigned; it is the responsibility of the instructor to initiate action to have any new permanent grade entered as soon as possible after the student completes the course or, after one year, partially fulfills the remaining requirements. Upon completion of any or all of the remaining requirements, or at the end of the one-year period (whichever occurs first), the incomplete grade on the transcript is changed to reflect the final grade for the course. Any course in which none of the remaining requirements are fulfilled will, after one year, have the incomplete grade changed to the default grade. If the student opts to graduate prior to the end of the one year period and if the course is required for graduation, the remaining course requirements must be completed and the final grade assigned by the deadline for course work completion for his or her final graduating semester. If the course is not required for graduation, the standard completion time limits apply. When the temporary incomplete grade is replaced with the incomplete final grade, this action is not considered a violation of the policy that states a grade will not be lowered after graduation. An incomplete grade that was assigned prior to the Fall 2008 semester and is not changed within the designated time limit remains a permanent "I" grade on the transcript. Grade "NP." This grade is given for unsatisfactory work (including that evaluated as "D") in courses on the pass-no pass grading system. Both credit hours and grade-points are ignored in calculating grade-point averages. Grade "P." This grade is given for passing work in OSU courses approved for pass-no pass and pass-fail grading systems. Both credit hours and grade points are ignored in calculating grade-point averages. Grade "S" or "U." This grade is given for satisfactory (equivalent to a "C" or better) or unsatisfactory work in developmental courses in English, mathematics, reading, and science. On the transcript, developmental courses are designated by “DEV” preceding the grade, such as “DEV-S.” These grades count in attempted hours, but not in earned hours. They are not included in GPA calculations and do not satisfy degree requirements. Grade "W." This grade indicates that the student dropped the course. Grade "R." This grade is given to a student in a master's degree creative component course, and other courses as appropriate, when course work is still in progress. It is the responsibility of the instructor to initiate action to have a permanent letter grade entered as soon as possible after the student completes the course work. Grade "SR" or "UR." These grades are given for satisfactory and unsatisfactory work, respectively, in thesis or dissertation courses (5000 or 6000). Both credit hours and grade points are ignored in calculating grade point averages, but courses in which a grade of "SR" is earned may be used toward minimum degree requirements. Mark of “CBE” preceding a grade. Grades for credit by exam (P or S) are designated on the transcript by “CBE” preceding the grade, such as “CBE-P.” These grades count in attempted and earned hours, but they are not included in GPA calculations. Mark of “PA” preceding a grade. Grades for performance/activity (leisure) courses are designated on the transcript by “PA” preceding the grade, such as “PA-B.” These grades count in attempted hours, but not in earned hours, and they are not included in GPA calculations. Limitations exist on applying these courses toward degree requirements. Mark of "AU" An "AU" indicates that the student enrolled as an auditor in the course. An "AU" is not a grade and is not used in calculating grade-point averages. Mark of "N" An "N" indicates that at the time grades were due in the Office of the Registrar, a final grade was not reported by the student's instructor. An "N" is not a grade and will be changed to the grade earned within a reasonable time. It is not used in calculating grade-point averages. 6.3 Grade-Point System The following grade-point system is used in calculating the grade-point average. Grade "A" yields 4 grade points per semester credit hour. Grade "B" yields 3 grade points per semester credit hour. Grade "C" yields 2 grade points per semester credit hour. Grade "D" yields 1 grade point per semester credit hour. Grade "F" yields 0 grade points per semester credit hour. 6.4 Grade-Point Average Calculations In calculating grade-point averages, the total number of grade points earned is divided by the total number of hours attempted. The grade of "I," "NP," "P," "S," "U," "W," "R," "SR," "UR," or the mark of "AU" or "N" will not affect the grade-point average. In addition, the following courses are excluded from GPA calculations: developmental courses, physical education activity (leisure) courses, and courses repeated (with an original grade of “D” or “F”) or reprieved/renewed based on State Regents policy. (See Academic Regulation 6.13 Academic Forgiveness.) Effective Fall 2016, GPA terminology changed with the transition to a new student information system. Both the new and old terminology are included below to assist with the transition. Overall (formerly Retention and Graduation) Grade-Point Average All OSU and transfer courses in which a student has a recorded grade are included in the calculation, excluding the courses described in the introductory paragraph. Total Institution Grade-Point Average This GPA is calculated in the same manner as the Overall GPA but includes only OSU (institutional) courses. Total Transfer Grade-Point Average This GPA is calculated in the same manner as the Overall GPA but includes only transfer (non-OSU) courses. Current Term (formerly Semester) Grade-Point Average This GPA is calculated in the same manner as the Overall GPA but includes only the courses for a single term (spring, summer, or fall). Transcripts for students with enrollment from OSU and another institution during the same term will display two current term GPAs—one for each institution. [Effective Fall 2016] Cumulative Grade-Point Average This GPA displays on the transcript after each OSU term and is calculated in the same manner as the Total Institution GPA but is based only on OSU courses for that term and all previous OSU terms. [Prior to Fall 2016] Cumulative Grade-Point Average All courses in which a student had a recorded grade were included in the calculation, including physical education activity (leisure) courses and forgiven courses. 6.5 Six Week (Midterm) Progress Reports Faculty are expected to report six week (midterm) progress grades for all students (regardless of classification) enrolled in 1000- and 2000-level classes and are encouraged to submit six week grades for students in all courses. This will normally occur shortly after the sixth week of classes. Student athletes will have all six week grades reported, not just 1000- and 2000-level. Progress reports are made available on Self Service to students and their academic advisors. 6.6 Pass-No Pass Grading System An undergraduate student may elect to take no more than four courses or 15 hours (whichever is greater) during his or her academic career with the pass-no pass grading option. The option is restricted to those students who: have earned 28 or more semester credit hours; have at least a 2.50 overall grade-point average; have met all of the prerequisites for enrollment in the course in question; do not need the course in question for meeting any requirements for graduation or certification other than as a general (unrestricted) elective; have approval of the academic advisor. A student who chooses the pass-no pass option must do so by the last date on which a course may be added. Once the deadline has passed, a student may not change the choice of grading systems. The pass-no pass option is not identified on the official class roll and thus is not known to the instructor. The instructor assigns a normal grade based on the quality of the work performed. The grades of "A," "B" and "C" are recorded on the transcript as "P"; the grades of "D" and "F" are recorded as "NP." "W" and "I" grades are recorded without change. The pass-no pass grade will not affect the grade-point average. Graduate students should refer to the "Graduate College" section of the Catalog. For spring 2020 only, students were offered the option to elect pass/no-pass grades for spring 2020 courses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Students were given one week to view assigned grades and elect pass/no-pass grading on a course-by-course basis. At the undergraduate level, letter grades of D or better convert to a P (pass) and F grades convert to a NP (no pass) if pass/no-pass grading is selected. At the graduate and professional levels, grades of C or better convert to a P, while grades of D and F convert to an NP. All spring 2020 courses receiving passing (P) grades count toward degree requirements, including requirements where a minimum grade of C is required. This policy exception is in accordance with guidance received from the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education. 6.7 Pass-Fail Grading System Some courses are taught only on a pass-fail basis. Such courses are so designated in the Course Catalog. Students who pass the course are awarded the grade of "P"; those who fail the course are awarded the grade of "F." Graduate students should refer to the "Graduate College" section of the Catalog. 6.8 Grade Reports Reports of the final grades of all students are compiled shortly after the end of each semester and are made available electronically to the students, the students' advisors and the students' deans via Self Service. 6.9 Correcting Grades Reported in Error The only permitted reasons for changing a final grade are to correct a grade that was reported in error, to remove an incomplete grade, or to change a grade at the direction of the Grade Appeals Board or Academic Integrity Panel. An instructor may not allow students to perform extra work after the end of the course in order to raise their grade. Grade change requests must be submitted in writing to the Office of the Registrar and must have both the department head's and the dean's approvals. A grade may not be lowered after the student has graduated unless the degree has been revoked. 6.10 Grade Appeals A student may appeal a grade given by an instructor in cases in which he or she believes the grade awarded is inconsistent with announced grading policy. (See "Student Rights and Responsibilities" or contact the Office of Academic Affairs.) 6.11 Honor Rolls Full-time undergraduate students who complete at least 12 earned OSU credit hours during a fall or spring semester with a current term semester (not overall) grade-point average of 4.00 (i.e., all "A's") are placed on the President's List of Distinguished Students. Grades earned through correspondence may not be included in meeting the minimum enrollment required or grade-point average required for an honor roll. Students who have completed their courses under the same requirements as outlined above, with a grade-point average of 3.50 or higher and no grade below "C," are placed on the Dean's List of Distinguished Students. (See also Academic Regulation 6.4 Grade-point Average Calculations. 6.12 Violation of Academic Integrity Oklahoma State University is committed to maintaining the highest level of academic integrity and ethical behavior. It is necessary that all members of the University support and promulgate the values of honesty and responsibility appropriate for an academic community. Not only does such academic integrity and ethical behavior contribute to the status of the University, but it also represents an important component of the educational process. To assure a high level of integrity among students, behaviors that violate academic integrity (e.g., unauthorized collaboration, plagiarism, multiple submissions, cheating on examinations, fabricating information, helping another person cheat, unauthorized advance access to examinations, altering or destroying the work of others, and fraudulently altering academic records) will not be condoned nor tolerated. Violations may subject the student to disciplinary action including the following: receiving a failing grade on an assignment, examination, or course; receiving an "F!" notation of a violation of academic integrity on the transcript; and suspension from the University. In the event an incident is not resolved at the time grade reports are due to the Registrar (e.g., an alleged violation is discovered during the final examination period), the instructor will assign an incomplete grade until the allegation is resolved. (See also academicintegrity.okstate.edu.) 6.13 Academic Forgiveness (Undergraduates) Repeated Courses A student shall have the prerogative to repeat a course and have only the second grade, even if it is lower than the first grade, included in the calculation of the overall (retention/graduation) grade-point average up to a maximum of four courses but not to exceed 18 credit hours in which the original grade was a "D" or "F." If a course is repeated more than once, all grades except the first attempt are included in the grade-point averages. The original course and grade remain on the transcript along with a notation indicating whether the course is included in or excluded from the GPA. All other repeated courses, those in excess of the 18-hour, four-course maximum and those with a grade of "C" or better in the original course, are included in the grade-point averages." Academic Reprieve A currently enrolled or former OSU student may request an academic reprieve for all courses in one semester or two consecutive semesters if the following conditions are met: at least three years must have elapsed between the period in which the grades being requested reprieved were earned and the reprieve request; the student must have earned an overall GPA of 2.00 or higher with no grade lower than a "C" in all regularly graded (A, B, C, D, F) course work ( a minimum of 12 hours) excluding physical education activity or performance courses since the semester requested to be reprieved; the student has not previously been granted an academic reprieve or renewal; there were extenuating circumstances which caused the student to perform poorly during the semester. Course work with a passing grade included in a reprieved semester may be used to demonstrate competency in the subject matter. However, the course work may not be used to fulfill credit hour degree requirements. Academic Renewal A currently enrolled or former OSU student may request an academic renewal for all courses taken prior to a specified date if the following conditions are met: at least five years must have elapsed between the last semester being renewed and the renewal request; prior to requesting academic renewal, the student must have earned an overall GPA of 2.00 or higher with no grade lower than a "C" in all regularly graded (A, B, C, D, F) course work (a minimum of 12 hours) excluding physical education activity or performance courses; the request will be for all courses completed before the date specified in the request for renewal; the student has not previously been granted an academic reprieve or renewal. Neither the content nor credit hours of renewed course work may be used to fulfill any degree or graduation requirements. Requests for Reprieve or Renewal A student may request an academic reprieve or renewal by submitting an Academic Reprieve or Renewal Petition to Academic Affairs. A committee appointed by Academic Affairs reviews each request and approves or denies a request based on the conditions stated above and the committee’s judgment concerning the extenuating circumstances reported by the student. Courses that are reprieved or renewed remain on the student’s transcript but are excluded from the overall (retention and graduation) grade-point average and identified as such on the transcript. See also OSU Policy 2-0820, Academic Forgiveness for Undergraduate Students. 7. Graduation 7.1 Graduation Requirements The responsibility for satisfying all requirements for a degree rests with the student. advisors, faculty members and administrators offer help to the student in meeting this responsibility. 7.2 Residence Credit Requirements Students must earn at least 30 semester credit hours at OSU (excluding credit for prior learning and correspondence study). At least 15 of the final 30 hours applied toward the degree or at least fifty percent of the upper-division hours required by OSU in the major field must be satisfactorily completed at OSU. In the Spears School of Business, a minimum of 15 of the last 30 hours applied toward the degree and at least 50 percent of the upper-division hours required in the major field must be satisfactorily completed at OSU. 7.3 Residence Waiver for Certain Premedical and Prelaw Students Students who complete at least 90 semester credit hours in a recognized premedical science or pre-law preparatory program and are admitted to a professional program leading to the doctoral degree at an accredited professional school, including medicine, osteopathic medicine, chiropractic medicine, veterinary medicine, dentistry, optometry, pharmacy, physical therapy, podiatry, and law, will be awarded the appropriate baccalaureate degree upon the successful completion of 30 semester credit hours in professional school courses applicable to the OSU major. This option is available only to students who have completed all other degree requirements for the major, have taken at least the last 30 semester credit hours of work at OSU prior to transferring to a professional school (See Academic Regulation 7.2 Residence Credit Requirements), and have completed at least 60 semester credit hours at a baccalaureate degree granting institution (See Academic Regulation 4.4 Transfer Credit from Community Colleges). Credits from accredited professional schools that are part of baccalaureate degree-granting institutions will satisfy the 60 semester credit hour requirement. 7.4 Minimum Hours for Graduation Each degree program requires a specific minimum number of semester credit hours for graduation, as indicated in the Catalog. No degree program shall require fewer than 120 semester credit hours for graduation. By OSRHE policy, these 120 hours are exclusive of physical education activity courses (leisure activity courses.) No student shall be permitted to graduate having completed fewer total hours than the requirement specified for that degree. At least 40 hours of upper-division course work shall be required in every baccalaureate degree program. (By OSRHE policy, these 40 hours are exclusive of physical education activity courses.) A minimum of 30 hours is required in the major field. Of these 30 hours, at least 15 hours must be upper division. Hours of "S" or "U" earned in developmental courses may not count toward total hours. 7.5 Grade-Point Average for Graduation An overall (retention/graduation) grade-point average of 2.00 or higher is required for all courses in which a student has a recorded grade, excluding any courses repeated or reprieved and excluding developmental courses and physical education activity courses. (See Academic Regulation 6.13 Academic Forgiveness.) This is in addition to the 2.00 or higher grade-point average required by the department in the major or minor fields. 7.6 Payment of Graduation Fees Basic graduation cost is included in the records maintenance fee. 7.7 Requirements for Honors Degrees The individual colleges have specific requirements for degrees with honors. Students should consult the office of their academic dean for information. (See the "Honors College" section of the Catalog.) 7.8 Graduation Application All degree candidates must submit a graduation application (online via Self Service) before or during their final semester to be eligible for graduation. Undergraduates must be classified as a senior before they can submit a graduation application, and graduate students must have filed an approved Graduate Clearance Form with the Graduate College before they are eligible to submit a graduation application. Students must submit their graduation application by November 1 for their name to appear in the fall commencement program, and by April 1 for spring and summer graduate names to appear in the spring commencement program. Students who will complete all degree requirements in the summer should file their graduation application for the summer term, but are invited to participate in the spring commencement ceremony. Students whose graduation application has become inactive (due to not meeting degree requirements, changing a component of their degree program, or other factors) will be required to submit a new graduation application via Self Service. Graduation applications do not automatically roll to the next term if degree requirements are not met. Contact the Registrar’s Office if assistance is needed. 7.9 Presence at Commencement Exercises The University will hold Commencement exercises at the close of the fall semester and at the close of the spring semester. Students who plan to meet the graduation requirements at the close of the following summer session are invited and encouraged to participate in the Commencement exercises at the close of the previous spring semester. The University encourages all candidates for degrees to be present at the Commencement exercises. Attendance is not compulsory. 7.10 Graduation with Distinction Students who earn an OSU undergraduate degree can also earn a level of distinction based upon the final overall (retention/graduation) grade-point average. (See also Academic Regulation 6.4 Grade-point Average Calculations) The level of distinction added to the diploma and transcript is: Classification of Students Year Criteria Overall (retention/graduation) grade-point average Distinction 3.90 to 4.00 Summa cum laude 3.80 to 3.89 Magna cum laude 3.70 to 3.79 Cum laude This grade-point average calculation is two decimal places only, e.g., 3.69. In actuality, this GPA may be 3.69785 if additional digits were to be added. However, the value used to determine distinction is 3.69, which does not qualify for a level of distinction. 7.11 Professional Education Professional Education requires a minimum 2.50 GPA for admission to Professional Education, student teaching and graduation. This requirement is consistent with state standards for students who complete professional education programs and seek licensure in the state of Oklahoma.
