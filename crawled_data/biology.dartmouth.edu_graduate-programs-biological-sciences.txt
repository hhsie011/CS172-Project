Andrew Bridges, a Ph.D. candidate in the Molecular and Cellular Biology Graduate Program, is working on the understanding the role of a cytoskeletal elements called septins. Dr. Christen DiPetrillo, PhD; graduate student Oluwafadekemi Awoyinka, and Research Assistant Erin Dymek working in Prof. Elizabeth F. Smith's research lab. Post doctorate Sichul Lee works the Life Science Center's plant biology lab under the guidance of Mary Lou Guerinot, the Ronald and Deborah Harris Professor in the Department of Biological Sciences. PreviousNext The Ecology, Evolution, Ecosystems and Society (EEES) program encompasses all areas of ecology, evolutionary biology, ecosystems and related disciplines, while the Molecular and Cellular Biology (MCB) program spans topics from biophysics to molecular pathogenesis. EEES students may help an MCB lab with modeling and statistics, while MCB labs may assist EEES students with molecular techniques—just one example of the many ways these groups create synergy. Graduate Study Programs Molecular and Cellular Biology We are an interactive and collegial community of scientists dedicated to innovative, world-class research. In this environment, we train our diverse student population to become precise and creative thinkers who impact science and society. Visit our website! Graduate Study Programs Ecology, Evolution, Environment and Society Ecology & Evolutionary Biology (EEB) is one of two clusters within Dartmouth’s graduate program in Ecology, Evolution, Environment, and Society (EEES). The focus of the EEB cluster is the advancement of basic knowledge in ecology and evolutionary biology. Areas of inquiry include: the perception and responses of organisms to their environment; the dynamics of genomes, organisms, populations and communities in ecological and evolutionary time; and the properties of communities and ecosystems that permit and constrain resilience in the presence of environmental change. Study systems within EEB range from genes to ecosystems, microscopic to global, terrestrial to aquatic, local to international, and contemporary to deep evolutionary time. Research programs typically include a mix of experiments, bioinformatics, mathematical models, and structured field observations. In all cases, the goal is to gain new scientific understanding that is broader than the study system. Basic knowledge of ecology and evolutionary biology has always been relevant to human endeavors, but never more so than in the 21st century when it has become foundational to the environmental security of people everywhere Overview Ecology, Evolution, Environment & Society Molecular and Cellular Biology Polar Research IGERT Biology Graduate Course Descriptions Ecology, Evolution, Ecosystems and Society Molecular and Cellular Biology Graduate Student Council Share Related DepartmentDepartment of SociologyRelated DepartmentDepartment of Chemistry Departments African and African American Studies Anthropology Art History Asian Societies, Cultures, and Languages Program Biological Sciences Chemistry Classics Cognitive Science Comparative Literature Computer Science Earth Sciences Economics Education Engineering Sciences English Environmental Studies Film and Media Studies French and Italian Geography German Studies Government History Humanities 1 & 2 Institute for Writing and Rhetoric Jewish Studies Latin American, Latino and Caribbean Studies Linguistics Mathematics Medieval and Renaissance Studies Music Native American Studies Philosophy Physics and Astronomy Psychological and Brain Sciences Religion Russian Sociology Spanish and Portuguese Studio Art Theater Women’s and Gender Studies Inclusivity “Dartmouth’s capacity to advance its dual mission of education and research depends upon the full diversity and inclusivity of this community…Diversity and inclusivity are necessary partners. Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Biological Sciences Undergraduate Overview Welcome Class of 2026 Welcome Back Classes of 2023, 2024, 2025 Major & Minor Course Schedules & Syllabi Current and Upcoming Bio 11 and Foundation Classes First Year Writing Seminars - Biology 7 Biology 11 Foundation Course Offerings Foundation Level Course Syllabi Intermediate Level Course Syllabi Advanced Level Course Syllabi Non-Major Course Syllabi Foreign Study Program Faculty Advisors Teaching Science Fellows Independent Study & the Honors Program Research Opportunities Dartmouth-sponsored Research Programs Funding and Finding an Advisor Transfer Credits Graduate Overview Ecology, Evolution, Environment & Society Molecular and Cellular Biology Research Overview Resources & Research Facilities Life Sciences Light Microscopy Facility Faculty Publications Neukom Postdoctoral Fellowship Foreign Study Program Seminars, News & Events News & Events Cramer Seminar Series Chris Reed Memorial Lecture Past Symposia and Conferences Travel People SEPA My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
