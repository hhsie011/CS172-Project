This was a good way to give exposure to advanced topics that the visitor could not have done on his own.” “The student worked well with his mentor and with an American REU (freshman) student.” “I really enjoyed it. The student was highly motivated. I think he made my students more motivated now.” “I think the program worked well for my research team this summer. My students were stimulated by having a visiting student participating.” “This was one of the best summer students I have had in my group — outstanding potential.” Comments from UGVR Students “The UGVR program was very well organized and was the best program I have ever attended.” “I have a wonderful summer in Stanford and have learned a lot during the past two months.” “The communication with professors and my partners were very helpful and cheerful. It was a great pleasure to work with these nice people.” “I not only learned how to do research in a more independent format and frequently cooperate with others, but also felt myself become a part of the lab rather than just a visitor.” “The hands-on experience, the exploration of the research world and meeting with the professor are my favorite parts.” “The highlight of my UGVR experience is my research. Working with PI and labmates in Stanford is an excellent experience. I love the idea of my project a lot!” “I have made friends with many different people and learned a lot about culture diversity. I think UGVR program is one of the best programs I have ever seen.” “People in Stanford are very impressive. My professor is a great mentor who helps me a lot and gives me many inspirations in doing research. My labmates are very nice and helpful. I had a wonderful time working with them. The organizers and coordinators of the UGVR program are all very considerate. Thanks to you all for the great experience!” Past participant rosters Summer 2019 Summer 2018 Summer 2017 Summer 2016 Past participants Click on an image to open our photo gallery. 2017 Participants UGVR 2016 participants UGVR 2015 participants UGVR 2011 participants UGVR 2010 participants UGVR 2009 participants Print Stanford ENGINEERING Web Login Address 475 Via Ortega Stanford, CA 94305 United States Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Youtube Instagram Stanford Engineering Magazine Events Departments Open Faculty Positions Open Staff Positions Intranet Give Visit Contact Us Sign up for our email Your source for engineering research and ideas Research & Ideas email Stanford University Stanford Home(link is external) Maps & Directions(link is external) Search Stanford(link is external) Emergency Info(link is external) Terms of Use(link is external) Privacy(link is external) Copyright(link is external) Trademarks(link is external) Non-Discrimination(link is external) Accessibility(link is external) © Stanford University.
