PreviousNext Women's, Gender, & Sexuality Studies The Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Program gives students a theoretical base for a systematic analysis of the construction of gender and the historical, economic, political, social, and cultural experiences of women. It is an interdisciplinary program drawing on resources from the Social Sciences, the Humanities, and the Sciences. The Women's Studies Program at Dartmouth was established in 1978, and was the first such program in any of the previously all-male Ivy League colleges. Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies may be undertaken as a program for a major, minor, and modified major. Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies graduates report that the critical tools learned in the Program have helped them succeed in a wide variety of careers and further studies. About LGBTS/Queer Studies Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Studies (LGBTS) courses examine lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender identities and politics in historical and contemporary contexts. Rather than take sex and gender as given, in or by nature, many of the LGBT courses investigate sex and gender as sites of bodily and discursive contestation. LGBT classes first appeared in the Dartmouth curriculum in the Spring of 1992. LGBTS topics courses were taught occasionally until 1996, when funding from the Carpenter Foundation supported the development of an introductory course in LGBTS. Looking for a more permanent solution, the Dean of the Faculty asked Women's and Gender Studies if the Program could become the home, at least temporarily, for LGBTS courses. Currently, classes with LGBT/queer content are available in a number of departments and programs as well as Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Program in Women's, Gender, &amp; Sexuality Studies Undergraduate Overview Major Modified Major Minor Honors Program Honors Thesis Guidelines Past Honors Theses Courses Previous Terms Associated Courses Independent Study Transfer Credit Alumni Stories Tell Us Your News Research Overview Gender Research Institute at Dartmouth Resources News & Events News & Events Annual Stonewall Lecture Past Lecture Series People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
