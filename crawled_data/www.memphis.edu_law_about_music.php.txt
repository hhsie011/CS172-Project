Blues, rock 'n' roll, hip hop, jazz, classical, folk, country, and gospel – our native sons and daughters are deep into the business and art of making music. The annual Beale Street Music Festival is a three-day celebration that attracts musicians and fans from all 50 states and foreign countries. Each year it kicks off the Memphis in May International Festival, which includes the largest BBQ competition in the world and is a week-long party and competition – and all this happens a few blocks from Memphis Law. One of the easiest ways to find out what's going on in the Memphis live music scene any night of the week is to pick up a Memphis Flyer or check the online entertainment section of the daily paper, The Commercial Appeal.
