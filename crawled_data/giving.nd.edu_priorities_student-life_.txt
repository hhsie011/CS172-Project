In giving to student life, you enable Domers to experience all that is uniquely and memorably "Notre Dame." A rich student life, one that shapes hearts and minds, is a hallmark of a Notre Dame education. We strive to care for all who study here physically, emotionally, and spiritually—building camaraderie, encouraging passions and leadership potential, and offering guidance on faith and spiritual growth. From the distinct personalities of each of our 32 residence halls, to the more than 400 student organizations, to the campus hubs where friendships blossom among shared interests and values, Notre Dame student life is more than day-to-day living. Your gift to student life means you're positively influencing every dimension of the Notre Dame experience.
