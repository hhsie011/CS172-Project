Students are encouraged to seek advice whenever the need arises and as often as necessary. Students tend to seek advising freshman and sophomore year when they are considering filing a concentration, planning courses, and discussing study abroad options and junior and senior years when they are seeking approval for abroad courses, working on capstone projects, finalizing their undergraduate career at Brown, and considering their future after graduation. Advising helps ensure that students pursue an intellectually coherent and challenging program of study rather than just any collection of courses that might happen to formally meet the requirements.
