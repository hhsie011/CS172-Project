Skip navigation Columbia University Experience SIPA Ideas Lab Academics Admissions Faculty & Research Careers Experience SIPA Ideas Lab Academics Admissions Faculty & Research Careers The global COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 presented institutions of higher education with challenges in teaching and learning, as well as in the assessment of academic performance. As a consequence of these challenges, Columbia University affirms the following principle: The University’s graduate and professional schools, as well as their respective admissions committees, will take into account the important disruptions caused by the COVID-19 outbreak when reviewing student transcripts and other admissions materials as part of their customary practice of performing holistic reviews of individual applications or dossiers. Specifically, we will respect decisions made by institutions or individuals regarding the adoption of Pass/Fail or similar grading options during the period in question. The Provost and University Deans adopted this principle to ensure that no applicants are disadvantaged by policy decisions made by their colleges/universities as a result of this unprecedented public health event. ************************************************************************************************************************************************************** To create an application, scroll to the bottom of the page and select "Create an account" if you're a first-time user, or "Log in" if you're a returning user.
