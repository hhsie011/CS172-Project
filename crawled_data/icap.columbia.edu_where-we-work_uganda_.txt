Since the recent UPHIA HIV population-based survey, ICAP has been working with the Ministry of Health on innovative linkage and service delivery strategies for HIV prevention, care, and treatment, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and Test and Treat.

The survey includes household-based interviews and HIV counseling and testing for adults and children. Survey findings will be used to assess the impact of Uganda’s HIV response at the national level and to help guide and target future investment and programs.

In December 2003, the MTCT-Plus Secretariat in New York (the precursor to ICAP, headed by ICAP’s Wafaa El-Sadr and Elaine Abrams) received its first grant from the new President’s Emergency Program For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Four years later, the MTCT-Plus Initiative of Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health was providing HIV care and treatment for nearly 17,000 people at 14 sites in nine countries. MTCT-Plus received expansion funding from USAID in 2003 and 2006. By 2010, ICAP had provided HIV care and treatment to more than one million people.

UTAP-2 Project Details In September 2002, the Mailman School of Public Health (MSPH) at Columbia University (CU) entered into a Cooperative Agreement with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for the University Technical Project Details In September 2002, the Mailman School of Public Health (MSPH) at Columbia University (CU) entered into a Cooperative Agreement with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for the University Technical Assistance Projects (UTAP) in Support of the Global HIV/AIDS Program. Situated within ICAP, UTAP was originally envisioned as a single-country program for the provision of technical assistance, but rapidly grew to include long-term and short-term technical and administrative assistance to the national responses to HIV/AIDS in five countries: Mozambique, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, and Zambia. As the original UTAP project drew to a close and PEPFAR moved into its second phase—focused on sustainability—ICAP entered into several, follow-on Cooperative Agreements, called UTAP-2. Four were country-focused (in Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Swaziland, and Tanzania) and the fifth—UTAP-2 Atlanta—became a flexible mechanism for providing a wide range of technical assistance and other support to PEPFAR countries. After beginning in 2009 as a means to help CDC conduct surveillance training more efficiently through distance education, UTAP-2 Atlanta grew over the next six and a half years to comprise 11 distinct projects addressing needs and gaps in the HIV response and answering important research questions to inform the response going forward.

ICAP in Uganda Program Start 2015 Key Technical Areas Capacity building of educational institutions HIV prevention, care, and treatment Population-based surveys Surveillance Current Funders Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation PEPFAR / Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Country Representative Dr. Sam Biraro Dr. Sam Biraro is ICAP’s country representative in Uganda and leads UPHIA, the PEPFAR-supported population-based HIV impact assessment survey that is reaching 15,000 households and engaging multiple national and international stakeholders. He began his career in clinical practice with Mulago Hospital in Kampala and later with Kisiizi, a missionary hospital in rural southwestern Uganda. He then worked in clinical research with Epicentre/MSF on studies looking into strategies for HIV care and treatment and treatment of malaria. At the Medical Research Council and the Uganda Virus Research Institute, Sam conducted population-based surveillance of HIV, HSV-2, and sexually transmitted infections. Most recently, his work has focused on non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including studies into the burden of NCDs in the general population and health facility readiness to provide NCD care, as well as on an intervention to strengthen the health system in provision of NCD care. Dr. Biraro graduated as a medical doctor (MBChB) from Mbarara University and earned an MPH from Loma Linda University. He completed his PhD at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
