Organizational Dynamics has also provided me with an enhanced view in which to observe education and life beyond my role and title.” Noof Mohammed Al Jenibi Master of Applied Positive Psychology ‘18 “The knowledge that you will gain will not benefit you in your professional life only, but in your personal life. The world needs you. Whatever you learn from the MAPP program, it is a life-changing experience.” Ana Margarita Olivos Master of Science in Organizational Dynamics '14 "Because of Organizational Dynamics, I know that it is possible to develop a highly effective organization that can co-exist in an environment that has high-risk for continuous challenges and need for change.” Jack Breiner Master of Science in Applied Geosciences ‘18 "In the scheme of our planet, we are working with the top one-half percent, but that’s where all of the people live and where all of the life is. That’s why you get into a field like this, because you care about the ultimate outcome of what you’re doing." Trisha Bhagde Master of Chemical Sciences ’19 “I’ve always wanted a PhD, but I never had long-term lab exposure. While I do my capstone, I am in the lab five days a week, so it’s giving me an idea of what’s in store for a PhD.” Joseph Glaser-Reich Master of Applied Positive Psychology ‘18 “Every individual in this program is doing something incredibly interesting, and the ability to sit down and talk with these people—to call them friends—was an unexpected and wonderful piece of the experience.” Aaron Brodsky Master of Chemical Sciences, ’20 "My advisor helped guide me in the right direction and stay positive when the coursework has gotten challenging. It’s a supportive culture, it’s not ‘sink or swim,’ and that has made a huge difference for me.” Previous Next LPS News Congratulations to the Penn LPS Class of 2022 On Sunday, May 15, Penn’s College of Liberal and Professional Studies (LPS) welcomed family, friends, faculty, and the Class of 2022 for the first in-person graduation ceremony since 2019.
