A recent change to implement URL Defense through Proofpoint has resulted in increased delivery issues for some users that are automatically forwarding messages from Clemson’s email service to services not managed by Clemson, including personal Gmail accounts. If you have set up automatic forwarding from your Clemson managed email to a non-Clemson email account, please be advised that forwarding is not recommended. These services are unsupported and our ability to troubleshoot any email delivery issues will be limited. Please contact the CCIT Support Center with any questions. You can call/text (864) 656-3494, email ITHELP@clemson.edu or start a web chat at ccit.clemson.edu.
