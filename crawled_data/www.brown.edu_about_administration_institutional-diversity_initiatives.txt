Improving campus culture—and the retention of a diverse student body and workforce at Brown—not only involves efforts that make Brown more inclusive in its policies and culture on campus. It also shows the University is a leader in national conversations on approaches to institutional inclusion and diversity planning. Academic Initiatives To help students of all backgrounds reach their goals, Brown promotes and participates in several academic initiatives that focus on inclusion and achievement. These initiatives are particularly in support of low-income students, first-college-generation students, and underrepresented students of color. These initiatives include: Presidential Diversity Postdoctoral Fellowships Young Scholars Conference Leadership Alliance Consortium Partnerships The Brown-Tougaloo Partnership: Formalized in 1964, the Brown University – Tougaloo College Partnership (BTP) is designed to enrich both campuses through student and faculty academic and cultural exchanges, collaborative research ventures, and administrative level engagements. Administrative Fellows Program To nurture a talented and diverse staff by providing enhanced access to professional development resources and networks to prepare them to become leaders in promoting more inclusive communities within higher education, the Office of Institutional Equity and Diversity sponsors the Administrative Fellows Program.
