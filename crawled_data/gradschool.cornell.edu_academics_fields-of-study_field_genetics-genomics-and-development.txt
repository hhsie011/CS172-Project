The GGD Field builds on the strong tradition of interdisciplinary training at Cornell and is composed of more than 55 faculty members from 15 departments in 5 colleges. The field has particular strengths in the following research areas: Genetics; Developmental Biology; Population Structure and Molecular Evolution; Molecular Genetics; Genomics; Computational Biology; and Plant Genetics. Graduate students in the Field of GGD obtain outstanding training in genomics, genetics and development and acquire analytical tools that enable them to understand the mechanisms of inheritance, development, mutation, gene regulation, and population structure and evolution. The Cornell campus offers state-of-the-art facilities and provides many opportunities for collaboration. This fertile environment, led by an enthusiastic and dedicated faculty, provides a rigorous training environment. Our graduates enjoy successful careers in research universities and institutes, undergraduate colleges, and industry.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
