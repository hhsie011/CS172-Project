At a lab in Wilder Hall, Daniel Allman, Guarini '23, left, and physics professor Kevin Wright observe a segment of the first superfluid circuit that uses ultracold electron-like atoms. (Photo by Robert Gill) The Mystery Behind Magnetic Explosions Explained "The rate at which magnetic field lines reconnect is of extreme importance for processes in space that can impact Earth," said Yi-Hsin Liu, an assistant professor of physics and astronomy at Dartmouth. "After decades of effort, we now have a full theory to address this long-standing problem." Physics and Astronomy Course Offerings - Winter, Spring 2022 Updated Winter 2022 Offerings, multi-year planning chart, and library resources for independent research in Physics and Astronomy Meet our newest condensed matter physics colleague The Department of Physics and Astronomy is pleased to announce that Dr. Rufus Boyack will join Dartmouth as an Assistant Professor this coming July. Dr. Boyack is a condensed-matter theorist exploring fundamental aspects of strongly correlated quantum systems. Welcome, Rufus! LAMP mission launched The 317 group (Lynch Rocket Lab) launched their 3rd successful rocket mission this year, March 5th from Poker Flat Alaska. The LAMP mission instruments were built by Dartmouth students Grace Kwon, Ted McManus, Caitlin Lynch, Magda Moses, Ruthie Nordhoff, Jules van Irsel; and staff Ralph Gibson, Alan Goldblatt, Jeff Renk, and Whitey Adams. 'Split' Photon Provides New Way to See Light "Every photon can be thought of as the sum of two distinct halves," says Vincent Flynn, Guarini '22, the lead author of the paper. "We were able to identify conditions for isolating these halves from one another."

Grad student Magda Moses from the 317 lab, and UAF/GI grad student Matt Blandin, are in the field for this. First reports are excellent science conditions and instrument performance. The mission studies the Earth's auroral cusp. New Theory for Detecting Light in the Darkness of a Vacuum Hui Wang, Guarini '21, a postdoctoral researcher, and Miles Blencowe, the Eleanor and A. Kelvin Smith Distinguished Professor in Physics, have described an experiment that could allow researchers to produce and detect light in a vacuum. (Photo by Robert Gill) Kristina Lynch named to Endowed Chair I study the plasma physics of the northern lights using NASA sounding rockets in the context of ground-based observations. My work focuses on developing distributed sets of observations so that we can learn how the electric and magnetic fields controlling the aurora work.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Physics and Astronomy Undergraduate Overview Information for New Students Physics Major Astronomy Major Engineering Physics Major Undergraduate Awards Honors Recent Senior Theses Undergraduate Requirements Physics and Astronomy Course Offerings Physics Society Student Research Opportunities Careers in Physics and Astronomy Astronomy and Your Career Undergraduate Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Graduate Overview Graduate Awards Apply Financial Aid Degree Requirements Courses Recent PhD Graduates Graduate Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Foreign Study Overview Astronomy FSP in South Africa Research Overview All Projects Astrophysics Current Projects Particles, Fields, Gravitation, and Cosmology Current Projects Gravitational Quantum Physics Quantum and Condensed Matter Current Projects Plasma and Space Physics Current Projects Resources Overview Weather Archive News & Events News & Events Colloquia Physics and Astronomy Colloquia Colloquium Archives (before 2017) Symposiums Symposium on Charles Young's 1869 Discovery of Coronium Jay Lawrence Symposium Archive Pressure of Light Symposium Public Lecture Archives Public Observing People Faculty & Staff Students Alumni Advisory Board Membership Directory Committee Assignments Department Chair Diversity Statement Graduate Advisor Undergraduate Advisor My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
