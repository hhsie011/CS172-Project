Chan School of Public Health > Admissions > Non-Degree Programs Non-Degree Programs The list below offers a summary view of non-degree programs at the School. Before applying, please be sure to check the requirements specific to the program you wish to enter, as these may differ from the general information provided on this page. Demonstrated excellence in written and spoken English, plus strong verbal and quantitative aptitudes are prerequisites for all programs. Executive and Continuing Professional Education (ECPE) We offer a broad portfolio of executive education programs and continuing education courses covering topics including leadership, management, research improvement and innovation, public health education, environmental health and safety, nutrition, health policy, and organizational strategy. Prerequisites vary by course. Certificate in Public Health and Business Leadership (PHBL) This part-time, one-year program is designed for mid- and senior-level executives who wish to acquire public health skills and knowledge within a business framework in order to better navigate future challenges and build organizational resilience. The program takes place over four 4-day weekends (three remote and one in person) and includes a faculty-mentored practical experience. Global Health Delivery Intensive (GHDI) GHDI attracts a diverse, international cadre of mid-career global health professionals who seek training in global health delivery content and skills. During the three-and-a-half week intensive summer course, participants in the program take three courses at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health: epidemiology and biostatistics (EPI505), principles of global health management (GHP555), and a case-based course in global health delivery (GHP532). Non-Degree Programs During the Academic Year The School offers a variety of courses during the academic year that are open to individuals affiliated with Harvard University either through their workplace or their career and research. Students receive non-degree credit for the coursework completed. Those who apply to and are accepted into a Harvard Chan School degree program within five years of completion of the non-degree course(s), may have a maximum of 20 academic and financial credits counted toward the degree program. Online Courses Departments and programs at Harvard Chan and across Harvard University offer a wide range of non-credit online courses and instructional materials for individuals just beginning their public health explorations as well as those hoping to increase their working knowledge in a particular area. Some courses are free and open to all, others have strict eligibility requirements. Please review the requirements of the course you are interested in before applying. Program in Clinical Effectiveness (PCE) PCE is designed for the clinician seeking the quantitative and analytic skills needed for clinical research, or the clinician interested in health care administration. Special Student Status (SS) This non-degree option is open to anyone who would like to register for Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health courses for one academic year. Applicants must apply to a department through the standard SOPHAS application process and need to have met departmental eligibility requirements. This option is available for the following departments: Biostatistics; Environmental Health; Epidemiology; Global Health and Population; Health Policy and Management; Nutrition; and Social and Behavioral Sciences. Summer Session for Public Health Studies The Summer Session is intended for current Harvard Chan School degree students, health professionals in training or those who are considering a mid-career change into public health and want to strengthen their skills through non-degree courses. Participants include public health professionals, primary care practitioners, physicians engaged in the evaluation of health care delivery and management, physicians in training (including preventive medicine residents and medical students in an MD/MPH joint degree program), and candidates for a part-time MPH program. Please note: Admission to or academic performance in non-degree programs does not guarantee admission to the School’s other full- and part-time academic degree programs, which require a separate application and admissions process.
