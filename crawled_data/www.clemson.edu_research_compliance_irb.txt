More information available on the InfoEd page. The IRB (Institutional Review Board) is a federally mandated body established under the DHHS regulations for the Protection of Human Subjects (45 CFR 46). Its purpose is to protect the rights and welfare of human subjects recruited to participate in research activities conducted under the auspices of Clemson University (CU). University policy requires that all research involving human subjects be reviewed and approved by CU's IRB prior to initiation of the research. This requirement applies to all human subjects research conducted by faculty, staff, and students, on- and off-campus, regardless of the funding support, if any, for the project. We at the Clemson IRB are excited about the research being done in our community, and we look forward to working with you.
