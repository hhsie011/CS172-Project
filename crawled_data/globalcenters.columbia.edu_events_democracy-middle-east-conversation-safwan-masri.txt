Marquês de São Vicente, 336 - Gávea, Rio de Janeiro - RJ) The Arab Spring began and ended with Tunisia. In a region beset by brutal repression, humanitarian disasters, and civil war, Tunisia's Jasmine Revolution alone gave way to a peaceful transition to a functioning democracy. Within four short years, Tunisians passed a progressive constitution, held fair parliamentary elections, and ushered in the country's first-ever democratically elected president. Did Tunisia simply avoid the misfortunes that befell its neighbors, or were there particular features that set the country apart and made it a special case? In Tunisia: An Arab Anomaly, Safwan M. Masri (Executive Vice President for Global Centers and Global Development at Columbia University) explores the factors that have shaped the country's exceptional experience. He traces Tunisia's history of reform in the realms of education, religion, and women's rights, arguing that the seeds for today's relatively liberal and democratic society were planted as far back as the middle of the nineteenth century. Masri argues that Tunisia stands out not as a model that can be replicated in other Arab countries, but rather as an anomaly, as its history of reformism set it on a separate trajectory from the rest of the region. On November 27, Columbia Global Centers | Rio de Janeiro and CEBRI invite you to a conversation with the author moderated by the journalist, Ricardo Gandour. At the event Safwan will answer questions about the post-Arab Spring scenario, democratic processes in the Middle East region and curiosities about his book. To RSVP, click here.
