8:30 PM Columbia Global Centers | Rio de Janeiro The Columbia Global Centers | Rio de Janeiro and the Institute for Technology and Society (ITS) are pleased to invite you to this special discussion between Professor Barry Bergdoll (Department of Art History and Archaeology, Columbia University) and Washington Fajardo (president of Institute Rio World Heritage). Arto Lindsay (Musician and Cultural Critic) and Pedro Rivera (director of Studio-X) will mediate and join the discussion. The event features a debate on Latin American architecture and urbanism. Stemming from the exhibition at New York's Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) "Latin America in Construction: Architecture 1955–1980", the discussion will expand on the Latin American architecture social and political implications, and the legacies of modernization. There will be a craft beer tasting and snacks. To RSVP, click here. Speakers Prof. Barry Bergdoll is a renowned expert on modern architectural history and recently curated a MoMA exhibit (still ongoing) on “Latin America in Construction: Architecture 1955-1980.” His scholarly research interests center on modern architectural history, with a particular emphasis on France and Germany between 1750 and 1900. Trained in art history rather than architecture, his approach is closely allied with cultural history and the history and sociology of professions. He has studied questions of the politics of cultural representation in architecture, the ideological content of nineteenth-century architectural theory, and the changing role of both architecture as a profession and architecture as a cultural product in nineteenth-century European society. Bergdoll’s interests also include the intersections of architecture and new technologies—and eventually cultures—of representations in the modern period, especially photography and film. He has worked on several film productions about architecture, in addition to curating a number of architectural exhibitions concerned with the history and problematics of exhibiting architecture, and the history of museological practices in relationship to architecture. Washington Fajardo is President of the Institute Rio World Heritage and the City Council of Cultural Heritage Protection, Washington Fajardo has a degree in architecture and urban planning from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) in 1997. Fajardo is since 2009 in the City Hall, first as Undersecretary of Cultural Heritage, Urban Intervention, Architecture and Design, and since 2012 as President of IRPH. The municipal authority is responsible for taking care of the cultural, historical and urban heritage aspects of the city, elected by UNESCO in 2012 as World Heritage Site, in the Cultural Landscape category. Fajardo is also Special Advisor on Urban Affairs of the Mayor Eduardo Paes. Pedro Rivera is the Director of Studio-X Rio. He has both a MS in Urban Design and a BA in Architecture and Urbanism from Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro. He teaches a studio at PUC-Rio and runs the office RUA Arquitetos.
