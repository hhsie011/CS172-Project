On Forbes China’s 2017 edition of “30 Under 30 China” list, 23% of startup companies are founded by inspiring women. On the panel discussion Opportunities for Women Leadership in the Digital Era held by Columbia Global Center I Beijing on Nov. 9th, Columbia alumna, Columbia Beijing Center advisory board member, and partner and CEO of ZhenFund Ms. Anna Fang-Hamm (CC '04) pointed out, “In the field of venture capital in China, 20% of businesses have female partners while in the U.S., the number is only 8%.” “She-Era” has come, and women’s leadership is redefining power in the traditionally male-dominated industries. Women are no longer characterized as only powerful consumers, but important thinkers, innovators, and explorers.
