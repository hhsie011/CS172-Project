Skip to Main Content Neuroscience Neuroscience Yale School of MedicineNeuroscience Community Research CNNR Kavli Institute News Training Events Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion Neuroscience The Department of Neuroscience at the Yale School of Medicine seeks to understand the biology and function of the nervous system at all levels of analysis. Our faculty work on aspects of neuroscience ranging from genes and molecules, to cells and synapses, to circuits, behavior, and cognition. We also have strong interests in development, disease, dysfunction, and repair of the nervous system, and in connecting basic research to translational medicine. Our multidisciplinary graduate training program allows students to gain expertise in models ranging from invertebrates to primates, and in techniques including molecular and cellular neurobiology, in vitro and in vivo electrophysiology and imaging, and studies of normal and abnormal neuronal function in behaving animals.
