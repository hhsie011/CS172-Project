The house was designed by architects Greene & Greene in 1908 for David and Mary Gamble of the Procter & Gamble Company of Cincinnati, Ohio. Realizing its artistic importance, the family deeded the house to the City of Pasadena in 1966. On this tour, participants will explore the house and its history through rooms lined with rare woods, featuring handcrafted details, fixtures, and furnishings designed by the architects and how this work contributed to Southern California’s early 20th-century artistic heritage and built environment. We will also explore the exterior gardens and gables, learning about the development of the gardens, landscape, terraces, and porches as a setting for early 20th-century outdoor living. Participation is limited to 12 people. All participants must show proof of vaccination.
