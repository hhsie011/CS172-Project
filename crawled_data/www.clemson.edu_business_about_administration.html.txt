International Relations, Stanford University Wendy York became dean of the Wilbur O. and Ann Powers College of Business in July 2018. Previously, she held the position of associate dean at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business. While at Stanford, York reorganized multiple units at the business school to bring them into strategic alignment. The resulting new organization supports faculty research activities; facilitates the creation of innovative curricula; and provides experiential learning opportunities for faculty, students and alumni. Her efforts included creating a new centralized faculty research support services resource to assist quantitative academic research using high-end analytic techniques and cloud computing. She led the new group, called the Centers and Initiatives for Research, Curriculum and Learning Experiences (CIRCLE), for five years. York also has been the managing director of Programs for Executive Education, which engages in providing leadership for executives and corporations, thereby expanding the impact of faculty research and teaching. Before Stanford, York worked for more than 20 years in for-profit and nonprofit organizations. With more than five years as a venture capitalist, York managed a private portfolio with a market capitalization of $100 million. She also started and/or led four early-stage technology and internet companies, including a database marketing company she founded and then sold to a national advertising agency. York holds an undergraduate degree in international relations with honors from Stanford University and an MBA with an emphasis on strategy and operations from Harvard Business School.
