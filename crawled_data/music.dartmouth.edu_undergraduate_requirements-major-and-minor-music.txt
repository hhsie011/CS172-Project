You are encouraged to submit this form roughly one term before you plan to officially declare so that the Music faculty will have time to collectively discuss and approve your plan. All course descriptions can be found in the Registrar's Organization, Regulations, and Courses (ORC) Catalog. Music Major The Music major functions on an open course count model. Students craft a curricular plan, in close consultation with a faculty advisor, that draws on three key areas of study (PDF): 1) critical engagement with the roots and lineages of multiple music traditions, 2) creative practice with the tools and techniques that structure sounds into forms, and 3) performance via individual instruction and/or ensemble participation. This framework centers student agency, maximizes curricular flexibility, and offers major and minor pathways as vibrant and varied as the students we serve. Requirements: Students must take MUS 99 (Proseminar) plus ten additional music courses that cover critical engagement, creative practice, and performance. Modified Major Requirements: Students must take MUS 99 (Proseminar) plus seven additional music courses that cover critical engagement, creative practice, and performance. Modified majors must be approved by the Chair of the Music Department. MUS 99 is typically offered only ONCE A YEAR DURING FALL TERM. Please plan ahead! Music Minor Requirements: Students must take seven music courses that cover critical engagement, creative practice, and performance. Example Major Concentration Pathways The course plans below approach critical engagement, creative practice, and performance from various hypothetical vantage points. They act not as roadmaps but as idea generators conveying the flexible rigor of the music major.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Music Undergraduate Music at Dartmouth Major and Minor Courses Spring 2022 Summer 2022 Fall 2022 Winter 2023 Spring 2023 Honors Honors Projects Funding Graduate Overview Apply People Current Students Performance Overview Individual Instruction Student Recitals Performance Laboratories Hopkins Center Ensembles Practice Rooms Instruments and Lockers Foreign Study Overview London FSP Vienna FSP News & Events News Events Arts Awards Leonard J.
