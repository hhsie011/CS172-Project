Collectively, this information is useful to the Pandemic Medical Advisory Team in its role as an advisory group to KU and county leaders, and to members of the university community as we engage in conversations about campus operations and strategies. Testing Results Testing reports included metrics such as total positive cases, positivity rates and KU Housing quarantine and isolation data. Current Month NOTE: As of March 2022, due to declining numbers of cases and the shifting overall COVID-19 situation, KU is no longer providing these weekly testing reports. More useful COVID-19 data and resources are available through Lawrence-Douglas County Public Health.
