The CSD is unique in its integration of diverse interests to develop creative, balanced, achievable solutions to the physical and social challenges facing the planning, construction, and preservation of buildings, neighborhoods, and regions. Vision We see the interconnected nature of the ‘sustainability challenge’ as central to our work; we attempt—through our projects, interdisciplinary teaching and ongoing working groups—to better understand the connections between environment, economic prosperity and social justice.
