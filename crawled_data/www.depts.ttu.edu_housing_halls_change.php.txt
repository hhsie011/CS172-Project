Texas Tech University Directory Raiderlink A-Z Index University Student Housing Menu Search TTU Housing Halls Room Change Before Move-In While space is available, students may change their room online. Students wishing to change their dining plan, they can fill out a dining plan change request. Once the residence halls are near capacity, students wishing to change rooms must sign in and indicate their room and roommate preferences. Housing staff will process changes as space allows. Change Room Room Swap After Move-In Students requesting room or hall changes after move-in should contact their hall staff located in the Residence Hall office. No changes are made during the first twelve class days in order for our staff to check in students and to determine if there are available spaces. For questions about this process, contact your Residence Hall office. Room Optimization Students who are changing rooms or receiving a new roommate through Room Optimization follow a different process than students who request to move. More information on Room Optimization can be found in the contract guide.
