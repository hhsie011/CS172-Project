Undergraduate Program About the Program Strategic Acumen Students majoring in Public Relations learn how to promote a client’s business, image, or product in the international marketplace. Public relations is an arena of strategic communication that focuses on the free placement of messages in the media through media releases, editorial content, and promotion. Both a major and a minor are offered in Public Relations. Classroom requirements reflect the importance of research, computers, and the relationship of all media (electronic, print, online and related digital multimedia technology) to public relations in both the public and private sectors. Students create and execute PR campaigns in a senior-level campaigns class. Demand for PR interns is high, and the internship and practicum programs for up to four semesters provide students ample opportunity to work within a professional environment after being admitted to the major.
