Send feedback or questions about this page to lisalopez@fullerton.edu Faculty SpotlighT Hannah Fraley, PhD, RN, CNE, CPH Assistant Professor, School of Nursing hfraley@fullerton.edu Research Interests: Dr. Fraley’s primary research program targets the intersection of health and human rights, focusing on youth violence prevention research and prevention of domestic youth trafficking among youth attending U.S. schools. From the findings of this work, she has developed a secondary area of research focusing on disparities among youth with disabilities and their school experiences from pre-K through college years. Current Project: Currently, Dr. Fraley is working with Dr. Gordon Capp, PhD, LCSW from the Department of Social Work, on a qualitative study exploring past school discipline experiences among adults with disabilities. Additionally, she is working on several conceptual/theoretical papers aiming to build the science in this important area of research and practice.
