HSDM educates clinicians, educators, researchers, and leaders in the profession; boasts core strength in musculoskeletal-disease research; and, offers students public health opportunities in local communities and across the globe. HSDM is the only school at Harvard that offers direct patient care, with the Harvard Dental Center welcoming more than 25,000 patients for over 57,000 dental visits every year. In a unique educational model that believes that oral health and primary care are interchangeable, HSDM pre-doctoral students (DMD) study clinical medicine with Harvard medical students and then pursue additional years of intensive, interdisciplinary clinical science education at HSDM and affiliated sites. Advanced graduate students, who work toward a doctor of medical sciences (DMSc) or master of medical sciences (MMSc) degree and/or a specialty certificate, also draw upon the richness of the educational facilities and research institutes of the broader Harvard community and Greater Boston area. HSDM graduates make their mark in prevention, discovery, and practice as they work to improve the health and well-being of local and global populations. Mission To foster a community of diverse global leaders in education, research and clinical innovation dedicated to improving human health by integrating dentistry and medicine. Vision To transform access to healthcare and advance science to prevent and find cures for oral diseases and conditions. Community Values Dedicated to being a community within which self-respect and mutual respect are understood and practiced, HSDM believes that compassion, fairness, and trust are fundamental values that enable our individual and collective well-being. We recognize the diversity of individuals within the community to be an essential ingredient to an inspiring, vigorous, and exciting culture. And we recognize that ethics and integrity provide the framework for all of our efforts.
