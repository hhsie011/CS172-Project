In addition, you should consider the following scenarios and questions: Scenario I: Integrating the Work of Others Q: Are you integrating work written or created by others in your dissertation? A: If so, is it copyright protected? If not, then you may be able to reproduce it without further assessment. Q: If the work being integrated is copyright protected, can you justify your use as a far one? A: If so, then you may go ahead and reproduce the work but keep a copy of your notes about your fair use assessment and attribute the author of the work. Q: If not fair use, then do I have permission? A: You will have to seek permission by contacting the rights holders of the work you are integrating into your dissertation should such use not be considered a fair one. Scenario II: Work Already Published Q: Are you integrating work written or created by you but having already been published or released by a third party? A: If so, is it copyright protected? If not, then you may be able to reproduce it without further assessment. Q: If copyright protected, did you sign a publishing agreement and did you assign all or part of your rights to the publisher? A: If you assigned part or all of your rights to the publisher, then you may have to contact the publisher to seek permission to integrate your work into dissertation so that it may also be distributed by ProQuest. Scenario III: Works of Joint Authorship Q: Are you integrating work that you created previously with a group of authors so that copyright in the work is owned by you but jointly with others? Q: If so, was it published previously? Q: Did you and the other authors assign your rights to the publisher? A:: If not, then you may be able to integrate the work into your dissertation. Q: If the copyrights were assisgned, did you retain the right to integrate your prior published work into your dissertation? A: If so, then you have likely protected your rights adequately for dissertation purposes. If not, you will have to seek permission from the publisher. Q: Is your dissertation going to be published and will you be remunerated? A: If so, then you need to consider your joint authors rights since they likely have rights in sharing in your remuneration.
