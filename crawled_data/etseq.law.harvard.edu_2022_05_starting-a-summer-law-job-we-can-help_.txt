Returning HLS students can sign up for our Advanced Legal Research course! Local Law Libraries Whether you’re working at a law job, or need access to legal resources to learn about a legal problem affecting your life, consider your local law library. These libraries typically focus on the laws of their region, and carry materials on a wide variety of legal subjects. Learn more about different types of local law libraries, the types of resources they have, how law librarians can (and cannot) help, and how to find legal help.
