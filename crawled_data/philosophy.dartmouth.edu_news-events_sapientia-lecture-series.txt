Upcoming Sapientia Lectures Thursday, March 31, 2022 3:30PM 246 Haldeman Alex Horne, Cambridge Title: "Agential Plasticity" Abstract: "Agnes Callard has developed an attractive and novel account of rational value-acquisition she labels 'aspiration' and deployed it to explain the 'agency of becoming'. One of the account's most important pay-offs is solving the problem of self-creation, viz. how genuinely self-directed value-acquisition is possible. Her account of proleptic rationality sets self-creation apart from both self-endorsement and self-cultivation, thereby avoiding embracing either horn of what she dubs 'Strawson's dilemma', which can be glossed as follows. Self-creation, understood as rational value-acquisition, is impossible because the new values must either be rationally continuous or rationally discontinuous with the values an agent already has. If they are continuous – in the sense that my new values are entailed by my old ones – I don't really change. But if they are discontinuous, then any change must come about accidentally or from external forces – in which case I don't really change myself. Either way, it looks like genuine self-creation is impossible. I argue Callard's solution fails; propose an alternative; and argue that not only is it well-suited to solving the problem of self-creation, it also unifies two important aspects of our doxastic lives, viz. responsibility for the acquisition of both evaluative and non-evaluative beliefs. The alternative, I label 'agential plasticity'. The unifying thesis it supports, I label 'indirect evaluative voluntarism'." Series History Term Speaker Title Date Co-Sponsor(s) 22W E.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Philosophy People Curriculum Overview Major and Minor Course Schedule Honors Past Honors Theses Foreign Study Logic Software Foreign Study News & Events News & Events Student Prizes Gramlich Prize Winners Story Prize Winners Philosophy Faculty Prize Winners Lecture Series Gramlich Sapentia Race, Gender & Justice Workshops Philosophy & The Struggle Against Racism Social Justice Research Grants My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
