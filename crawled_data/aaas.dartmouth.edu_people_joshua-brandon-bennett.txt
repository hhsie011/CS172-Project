He is the author of The Sobbing School (Penguin, 2016)—which was a National Poetry Series winner and a finalist for an NAACP Image Award—as well as Being Property Once Myself: Blackness and the End of Man (Harvard University Press, 2020), Owed (Penguin, 2020), and The Study of Human Life (Penguin, 2022). Bennett holds a Ph.D. in English from Princeton University, and an M.A. in Theatre and Performance Studies from the University of Warwick, where he was a Marshall Scholar. In 2021, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship and a Whiting Award in Poetry and Nonfiction. He has also received fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, MIT, the Ford Foundation, and the Society of Fellows at Harvard University. Dr. Bennett’s teaching and research interests include 20th and 21st century African American literature, environmental studies, black poetics, animality studies and affect theory. His first collection of critical prose, Being Property Once Myself: Blackness and the End of Man, focuses on both the literary imagination and broader set of ethical concerns that have emerged from African American experiences of being configured as socio-legal nonpersons: a sub-genre of the human, always already positioned in fraught proximity to animal life. By working at the intersections of black studies and animality studies, his goal is to illumine the ways in which the black radical tradition provides us with the tools necessary to conceive of interspecies relation anew, and to ultimately abolish the forms of anti-black thought—i.e., the figure of the black as a kind of intermediate category separating beast and Man—that have historically served to maintain the caesura between human and animal. Dr. Bennett is also currently at work on a book of narrative nonfiction, Spoken Word: A Cultural History, which is forthcoming from Knopf. + View more Contact Joshua.Bennett@Dartmouth.edu Sanborn 8 HB 6032 Education B.A. University of Pennsylvania M.A. University of Warwick M.A. Princeton University Ph.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College African and African American Studies Program Undergraduate Overview Major Minor Courses Summer 2022 Fall 2022 Winter 2023 Spring 2023 Forms Honors Student Prizes Careers Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Foreign Study Overview Ghana Foreign Study Program Paris Foreign Study Program Research Overview Thurgood Marshall Dissertation Fellowship Previous Thurgood Marshall Fellows Africa-Related Research African American-Related Research '82 Racial Justice Initiative About the Class of 1982 Racial Justice Initiative Support the Class of 1982 Enrichment Fund Events and Initiatives News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
