These new discoveries and innovations are happening all the time in research labs, studios and elsewhere across our campus. Innovations can take all forms, from new medical devices to creative works. The Office of Research and Innovation works hand-in-hand with researchers and inventors like you to spread those innovations and discoveries out to the world via technology transfer, guiding them from the lab to the marketplace through licenses, partnerships and new companies. At UofL, most technology transfer functions and translational support are handled by the UofL Innovation and Commercialization and our Translational Grant Programs team. Startups originating from UofL IP are handled by UofL New Ventures. If you believe you may have an invention, discovery, creation or other protectable idea, we can help you: Protect intellectual property resulting from your research UofL uses intellectual property protection to protect ideas and inventions that come out of research. This process is available for a wide range of disciplines, and can cover everything from a new drug or medical device, to software for measuring employee engagement, to creative works, such as a play, composition or manuscript. To learn more, please see our Intellectual Property page. Develop your technology through translational research programs UofL offers many funding opportunities to help its researchers bridge the gap between lab and marketplace. This includes a suite of prestigious grant-backed translational programs, which we've dubbed the "superfecta." The programs provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and funding. Given their shared goals, these programs work together to establish UofL as a world leader in innovation. To learn more, please see our Translational Research Grants page. Commercialize your technology with a startup or other company The University of Louisville seeks to purposefully commercialize university inventions and discoveries, often by working with an external partner or through the development of an entirely new company. Within the Office of Research and Innovation, the UofL Innovation and Commercialization office works with external organizations ranging from international corporations to local startups. The Office of New Ventures also supports startups based on UofL IP. This can take many forms, from a license to a full-fledged partnership to further develop the technology.
