Sciences, MS Comparative Biomedical Sciences, PhD Veterinary Medicine, DVM Home/ College of Arts and Sciences/ Microbiology and Molecular Genetics Microbiology and Molecular Genetics Overview Courses Undergraduate Programs Graduate Programs Minors Faculty Microbiology/Cell and Molecular Biology Microbiology is the hands-on study of bacteria, viruses, fungi and algae and their many relationships to humans, animals, plants and the environment. Cell and molecular biology bridges the fields of chemistry, biochemistry and biology as it seeks to understand life and cellular processes at the molecular level. Microbiologists apply their knowledge to infectious diseases and pathogenic mechanisms; food production and preservation, industrial fermentations which produce chemicals, drugs, antibiotics, alcoholic beverages and various food products; biodegradation of toxic chemicals and other materials present in the environment; insect pathology; the exciting and expanding field of biotechnology which endeavors to utilize living organisms to solve important problems in medicine, agriculture, and environmental science; infectious diseases; and public health and sanitation. Microbes live in every imaginable habitat. They generate two-thirds of the oxygen in our atmosphere, drive the geochemical cycles that make life on Earth sustainable and are the basis of every food web. As model organisms used for basic research, microbes have contributed more than any other organisms to the current knowledge of genetics at the molecular level and genomics. In contrast to the enormous benefits derived from some microbes, other microorganisms and viruses are the causative agents of infectious disease and hence have a devastating impact on humanity. These pathogens are the subjects of research into the mechanisms of infections, with the ultimate goal of combating or preventing diseases. Departmental courses are designed to provide comprehensive training and the skills required for working with microorganisms in a professional setting, as well as a broad understanding of all aspects of microbial life. The lecture courses are taught by tenured faculty members and the laboratory courses are designed to integrate classroom learning with hands-on research experience. Opportunities for employment exist at all scholarly levels, in many local, state and national agencies and industry. The record for employment of microbiologists has been excellent for many years and with the increased interest in biotechnology, medicine and the human microbiome, employment opportunities look even brighter for the future. Microbiology is the strongest possible foundation for students who wish to go to medical, dental, veterinary or graduate schools. We take pride in offering research and internship opportunities that prepare students for careers in the biomedical sciences. Our graduates find jobs in medicine, health care, medical laboratories, teaching, research, industry and government. Medical Laboratory Science Option This option is designed to give students the broad general education and the technical skills that are required for a successful career in medical laboratory science (MLS).

Literature research includes at least six credit hours in independent study. Candidates for the MS degree are expected to attend and participate in all departmental seminars. A final oral examination covering the thesis (or literature research for the accelerated program) is administered by the advisory committee following a public presentation of the candidate’s research. The Doctor of Philosophy Degree The study plan of a student entering the program with a bachelor's degree must include 30 credit hours in the biological and physical sciences. Those entering with a master's degree must include 15 hours in courses other than dissertation credits which were not included in the master's study plan. Three hours of microbiology seminar must be included. Candidates for the PhD are expected to attend and participate in all departmental seminars. Candidates for the PhD degree must pass both a written and an oral qualifying examination.
