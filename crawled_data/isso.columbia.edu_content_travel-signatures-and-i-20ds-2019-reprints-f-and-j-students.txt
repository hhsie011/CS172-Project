A travel signature is relevant only to F-1 students or J-1 students (and their dependents) who are planning to travel abroad and return to the U.S. in F or J status. This includes alumni who remain in F or J status for post-graduation F-1 OPT or J-1 AT. You must have an unexpired travel signature on the date you re-enter the U.S. Check to See if You Need a Travel Signature Now You don't need a travel signature to leave the U.S., but you will need an unexpired one when you return. You should use your most-recently issued I-20/DS-2019 for travel, including if it was issued for F-1 OPT or J-1 AT. See below for how long your travel signature is valid: Student Enrolled F-1 student (I-20) Validity / Length A travel signature on page 2 of your I-20 is valid for 12 months or until the program end date on the I-20, whichever comes first. Student F-1 Post-completion and STEM OPT student (I-20) Validity / Length A travel signature on page 2 of your I-20 is valid for 6 months or until the expiration date of the EAD, whichever comes first. Student J-1 Student (DS-2019) Validity / Length A travel signature on page one on your DS-2019 is valid for 12 months or until the end date on your DS-2019, whichever is earlier. Follow the instructions below for a new travel signature by logging in to Compass to request an I-20/DS-2019 reprint.
