Lawton Distinguished Professor Quicklinks Make a Report Strategic Plan Anti-Racism Resources Welcome to the FSU Drupal Site At The Florida State University, we recognize that every competitive advantage begins with people. By valuing, celebrating and leveraging the differences and similarities of our students, faculty and staff, we inspire an environment of innovation and passion—one that enables us to create a teaching, research and service environment that better reflects the needs of our students, faculty, staff, customers, constituents, communities and other key stakeholders. As detailed in the Strategic Plan our approach starts with a belief that diversity is about more than a particular head count: it must reflect the quality and depths of interactions. We will remain focused on doing all that we can to ensure FSU is the university of choice for our faculty, staff and students. title-inside title-centered 2 D&I @ FSU President’s Task Force on Anti-Racism, Equity & Inclusion Civil Rights Institute FSU Libraries – Diversity & Inclusion Diversity in Athletics Sustainable Campus DIRECTO Diversity & Inclusion Committees President's Council on Diversity & Inclusion President's Council on Diversity & Inclusion Council Mini-Grant Program Affinity Groups Affinity Groups Black Faculty and Staff Network LatinX Faculty and Staff Network Queer & Trans Employee Network Lunch and Learns Training D&I Certificate National Coalition Building Institute Learning Opportunities Page Allies & Safe Zones Request A Training For Faculty & Staff Council on Research and Creativity Faculty & Staff Resources Find a D&I Faculty Researcher For Students Power of We D&I Student Ambassadors D&I Internships Center for Leadership & Social Change Student Resources FSU was recognized by INSIGHT Into Diversity magazine as one of few colleges and universities in the nation.
