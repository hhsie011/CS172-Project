The FAFSA, short for FREE Application for Federal Student Aid, is the form that all US citizens or permanent residents must fill out in order to apply for federal financial aid each year. What information is asked for on the FAFSA? The FAFSA will ask for the following types of information: Student Demographic Information Parent Information Student and Parent Financial Information School Selections We have created a FAFSA checklist which highlights what you should gather in order to complete your FAFSA. Information you’ll need Information about yourself: Social Security Number Alien Registration Number (if you are an eligible noncitizen like a US Permanent Resident) Your federal income tax returns (if you filed a tax return) and W-2s (if you worked) from the “prior-prior” year. For the 2022-2023 FAFSA this means the tax year 2020 Sum of your cash, savings accounts, and investments Records of any untaxed income you may receive Information about your parent(s): Social Security Number Their federal income tax returns (if they filed tax returns) and W-2s (if they worked) from the “prior-prior” year. For the 2022-2023 FAFSA this means the tax year 2020 Total current balance of cash, savings, and checking accounts Net worth of investments, including real estate (but excluding primary home) Net worth of current businesses and/or investment farms Records of any untaxed income Payments to tax-deferred pension and retirement savings plans IRA deductions and payments to self-employed SEP, SIMPLE and Keogh Child support received Untaxed portions of IRA distributions or pensions Housing, food, and other living allowances Veterans non-education benefits Workers' compensation or disability How to apply The FAFSA form should be filled out at studentaid.gov or through the myStudentAid app in the Apple App Store (iOS) or Google Play (Android). You are able to complete the form after October 1st of the year prior to the one for which you are applying for aid. You, and at least one parent, should create an FSA ID at studentaid.gov/fsa-id/sign-in/landing. Your FSA ID is used as your electronic signature for the FAFSA. You do not need to wait until October 1st to apply for your FSA ID. Can I see the questions that will be asked prior to filling out the FAFSA? YES. You can print a FAFSA on the web worksheet from studentaid.gov. This form can help you organize and answer questions prior to sitting down at your computer to complete the FAFSA. My parents are not US Citizens or Permanent Residents, can I still apply for federal aid? YES. If you, the student, are a US citizen or permanent resident you are eligible for federal financial aid whether or not your parents are US citizens or permanent residents. (Note: When prompted for your parent(s) social security number on the form, you should enter all zeros.) Other helpful resources There are a number of ways that you can request help completing your FAFSA form.
