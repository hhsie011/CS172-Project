As they arrived for the event, the guests, who were at Harvard for the 2019 Reunion Weekend, gathered in Pusey Library, where they enjoyed the two exhibits on view in the Lammot du Pont Copeland Gallery, “The Rittase Touch” and “Harvard Lives” — which sparked questions about the collections both at the Archives and throughout the Harvard Library system. University Archivist Megan Sniffin-Marinoff was there to welcome the crowd and lead them to the Archives, where exciting historical treasures awaited them. Inside the Archives, the Reading Room was converted into a pop-up exhibit space, with dozens of fascinating, important documents, photographs, and objects from Harvard’s past on display. Alumni explored material from their time at Harvard, including yearbooks, student publications from the 1970s, blueprints and photographs from buildings they saw erected, and papers of notable faculty whose courses they took. In addition, alumni encountered collections that evoked the student experience at Harvard throughout its history, from Henry David Thoreau’s reflections on his time at Harvard to posters and photographs of student protests in the 1960s. The space buzzed with energy as the collections sparked memories and conversations amongst the alumni. Meanwhile, “Treasures from the Harvard Vault” were displayed in the Archives conference room. These were some of the most precious items we have from across Harvard’s history, and they were an exciting glimpse into how many people and historical events have touched Harvard. On display were materials from the colonial period, including the 1650 Harvard Charter and a rare pocket globe from the 18th century, as well as more modern items, like the doctoral thesis of W.E.B. Du Bois and letters from Winston Churchill regarding his honorary degree. Archives staff circled the rooms, answered questions, and spoke with alumni about items they were considering donating to Harvard. Several alumni shared stories of their time at Harvard, including those describing what it was like to attend Harvard soon after the merger with Radcliffe, as well as being a person of color or LGBTQ when the student body was just beginning to become more diverse and the College more inclusive. Alumni were not only fascinated by the materials (no surprise there!) but stayed until Pusey closed, chatting with one another and reminiscing about their days crossing the Yard to class. It was a great way to start the reunion weekend and for alumni to connect with old friends. This was the first time we held such an event in conjunction with a class reunion, and an alum from the class of 1973 who was present wondered why their class hadn’t had the event — a sure indicator of success! Many thanks to our partners from Alumni Reunions who helped make this a key part of the reunion weekend schedule, and a special thank you to our Archives team — Megan Sniffin-Marinoff, Ginny Hunt, Ross Mulcare, Emily Atkins, Hannah Blakeman and Samuel Bauer — for sharing such an amazing snapshot of our Archives collection with our Harvard alumni!
