Today’s information universe continues to increase, not only in scale and complexity, but in pollution. Libraries continue to lead the way through this landscape. They are crucial, trustworthy interpreters when it can be hard for the average person to source and vet information. They provide and leverage technology to make information widely available and enhance learning. They promote the relevance of the physical object in an increasingly digital world. They curate knowledge and cultivate curiosity for current and future generations to discover new insights. Equally accessible to all academic disciplines and backgrounds, the Penn Libraries brings knowledge within closer reach of all Penn’s constituents—students, staff, faculty, and the community. The fundraising priorities at the core of Power of Penn Libraries Campaign will strengthen the Penn Libraries’ position as the heart of Penn’s academic enterprise, integrating knowledge and collaboration across disciplines. As part of The Power of Penn Campaign, we invite you to champion The Penn Libraries. Together, we can create new knowledge, connect great minds, transform discovery, raise achievement, and empower the University as a whole. A gift to the Penn Libraries is a gift to all of Penn. Knowledge is access. Knowledge is discovery. Knowledge is problem-solving. Knowledge is power. Flip the switch. Make your gift to the Penn Libraries.
