BBS is a part of the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, yet its students and faculty span the entire university campus including the Yale School of Medicine. BBS students have access to courses, seminars, and faculty labs in every department. Because Yale is unusual among major universities in having its main campus and medical school within walking distance of one another, students can easily participate in research activities and courses on the main University campus as well as at the world-renowned School of Medicine. Moreover, Yale’s science-focused West Campus in neighboring West Haven is connected to the rest of the university by non-stop shuttle service. Yale in its entirety is available to BBS students. BBS students will receive a thorough, interdisciplinary, cutting edge education, and will develop career skills necessary to excel in academia, industry, business, and the many other exciting career paths our graduates pursue. Explore our website for more information about our Program. Also download our Graduate School's 2022 viewbook for an overall summary of graduate life at Yale.
