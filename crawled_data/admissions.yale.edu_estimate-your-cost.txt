Yale offers two tools for estimating what a Yale education would cost after accounting for financial aid. The Quick Cost Estimator below provides a ballpark estimate based on six simple questions. Get More Detail: Net Price Calculator The Yale Net Price Calculator generates a sample financial aid award based on your financial information and Yale’s current aid policies. It is designed to provide a first look at what a family can expect to pay. While the calculator can’t capture all the information that our officers use to evaluate financial need, its results offer a good place to start a conversation about financing your Yale education. Before using the Net Price Calculator, please note the following: The calculator is intended for applicants whose parents live and work in the United States. The calculator is not an application for financial aid; your information will not be transmitted to Yale. The calculator results are dependent on the accuracy and completeness of the information you submit and are intended to provide only a general guide to your eligibility for financial aid. Any indicated award is not guaranteed by Yale and represents a preliminary, nonbinding indication of the aid you may be eligible to receive. If you don't have exact dollar amounts to enter into the calculator, estimates are OK. These documents can help you submit more accurate information and generate a more accurate award: Student and Parent Income Tax Returns Earnings statements (W-2 forms, recent paycheck stubs) Bank and Investments Account Statements Records of untaxed income (Social Security, contributions to a 401(k) or tax deferred pension, etc.) For more information on Yale’s financial aid policies, explore Financial Aid In-Depth and the resources at the Office of Undergraduate Financial Aid, where you can find detailed instructions about applying for aid. If you have questions about the calculator’s results or any of Yale’s financial aid policies, please contact Undergraduate Financial Aid. Please note: The calculator is intended for U.S. citizens, permanent residents and international students whose parents live and work in the United States. The calculator may not produce accurate results for international students whose parents work outside the United States, primarily because the determination of financial need depends in part on country by country adjustments with respect to cost of living. The calculator is also not intended for use by Eli Whitney, Non-Degree, or Alumni Auditing Program students.
