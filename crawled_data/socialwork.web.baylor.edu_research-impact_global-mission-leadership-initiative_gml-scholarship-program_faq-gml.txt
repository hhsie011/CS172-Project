Do I have to take the GRE? No. The GRE is not a required prerequisite for participation in this initiative. 2. What is the International Social Work Concentration? Through the International Social Work Concentration, students will be responsible for a research project related to a social injustice in the country where they intend to serve. The student will have the opportunity to research systemic issues regarding a social injustice, global best practices regarding community change, and create an evidence-informed plan of intervention. 3. Do I have to take the TOEFL and/or the IELTS to apply? Yes, if you are from a non-English speaking country. A minimum required score for the TOEFL is 550 on the paper-based, 213 on the computer-based, or 80 on the new Internet-based test. This test needs to have been taken within the last two years. Our catalogue is now online, and further information can be found under the Graduate Program, Admissions. We also accept the IELTS with a minimum score of 6.5. 4. Do I have to have a bachelor's degree in social work to be accepted into the program? Having a social work degree or background is not required to enter this initiative. However, you do need to have an undergraduate degree from an accredited institution. To check the accreditation of your institution, please send a copy of your undergraduate transcript to MSW_admissions@baylor.edu 5. To be a GML Student, do I need to apply to the Baylor School of Social Work? Yes. The GML application will be sent to you as a form in an email upon completion of the Baylor MSW application. There are several additional pieces necessary to complete for the GML application. The admissions processes are separate for the GML Scholarship Program and the MSW Program, so you will receive communication from both offices. You must be accepted into the MSW Program in order to be accepted into the GML Scholarship Program. However, it is possible to be accepted into the MSW Program and not the GML Scholarship Program. All application materials for both applications must be completed by March 1, 2021 in order to be considered. 6. What are the current Global Mission Leadership program components? GML scholarship recipients will attend an orientation in Waco in late July/early August of 2021 before the start of the MSW program. They will then spend their foundation MSW year attending in-person classes and an in-person internship in Waco from August of 2021 until May of 2021. Upon completion of their foundation year, GML students will move to a location in their home region where their internship placement is assigned. Starting in August 2022 GML students will fulfill an advanced internship in their home region and begin online classes. Additionally, GML students will fulfill a two-year commitment to implement their graduate knowledge in the country where they intend to serve upon graduation. 7. How long is the MSW degree program with the International Social Work concentration? This specialized degree is two years in length. 8. What is Waco, Texas like? Waco's population is about 150,000 (including surrounding suburbs), which makes it a good-sized town that has many restaurants, stores and things to do. But it is not so big that traffic is a problem. The weather is usually mild from October to June, but is VERY hot in the summer and very cold in the winter (but there is rarely snow). The cost of living is low and the people are friendly. Baylor University is beautiful with a vast array of things to do on campus! The School of Social Work is located a few miles away from the main campus. BACK TO TOP Diana R.
