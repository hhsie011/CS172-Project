Aninat, who says he is honored by those who voted for him to serve in a second term, points to several challenges in contributing to an improved justice system to offer the Chilean public greater access to justice: advocacy, inclusion, gender equity and reactivation of the justice system. “To achieve this, we need everyone on board with this project, broadening the base of association members, especially in younger generations, while also representing the concerns and proposals of lawyers who are in the free exercise of their profession and who work in the private sector, the public sector, academia, and non-governmental organizations,” he comments. Luis Alberto is a founding partner at Aninat Abogados, and he is also a professor of Commercial Law at Universidad de Chile’s Law School. He has been featured by several specialized international publications as a leading lawyer in the areas of corporate law and mergers & acquisitions, including Chambers Global, Latin Lawyer 250, Best Lawyers, Legal 500, and IFLR 1000. He is a member of the ProBono Foundation, and a member of the board and counsel of the María del Refugio Educational Foundation.
