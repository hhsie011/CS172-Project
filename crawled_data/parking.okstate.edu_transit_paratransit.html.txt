OSU-Stillwater Community Transit provides a fixed route service to all of the citizens of Stillwater. Each bus is equipped with a lift for those passengers that cannot negotiate the steps on the buses, and service is provided at a discount fare for those with disabilities. In addition, we offer a shared-ride, door-to-door Paratransit service according to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Transportation is provided utilizing lift-equipped vehicles. Paratransit service is for individuals with disabilities which prevent them from riding the fixed route service. Individuals who may participate are those who are 5 years of age and older who have been determined eligible by the OSU Student Disabilities Service Office. The identification card issued when an individual is certified for services reflects the expiration date. The customer must reapply for recertification prior to the card expiring.
