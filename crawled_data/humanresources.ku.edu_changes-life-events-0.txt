A change in your personal or work life can impact your benefit elections, and Human Resource Management is ready to help you navigate the change process. Home Address Changes Changes to your home address can be made through HR/Pay. Please see View/Edit your personal information summary. Tax Withholding Changes Changes to your allowances or exemptions for federal and/or state taxes can be made through HR/Pay. Please see Payroll and Compensation information, Qualifying Life Events Changes in family status can be considered as an IRS Qualifying Life Event which allows you to make changes to your benefits such as applying for additional optional group life insurance or modifying your existing State Employee Health Plan elections. Family status changes include the following: Marriage Divorce Birth Adoption Death Spouse/dependent loss of other health insurance coverage Gain or loss of legal custody of a dependent If you experience any of the above family status changes, please review the steps below to make the necessary changes related to your health benefit elections. Please review the plans below and follow the guidelines to make changes. Health Insurance If you experience a family status change or qualifying event and you are covered by the State Employee Health Plan (SEHP), you have 30 calendar days from the date of your family status change or qualifying event to make the change directly in MAP, using the "Mid-Year Benefit Changes" tab and upload any required documentation to support the change (i.e., a marriage license, birth certificate, etc.) If you do not take timely action, or if you do not provide the required supporting documentation, the SEHP will deny your change request. Please contact the Benefits Office (benefits@ku.edu or 785-864-7402) if you have any questions or need assistance. For mid-year changes MAP instructions, please visit Mid Year Changes Step-by-Step Guide If you make changes to dependent coverage, you will need to provide specific instructions in the Request Note box about whether the dependent(s) will keep or be removed from medical, dental and/or Surency Vision coverage. If you add a newborn to coverage, you will need to provide a Social Security Number. Until you receive the actual SSN, you can use the number 777-77-7777 when adding family member information in MAP. Note: Employees who are newly eligible for benefit plans offered by the State Employee Health Plan (SEHP), or who make changes in coverage because of life events, may see a delay from the time they enroll or initiate a change in MAP to when the premium is deduced from their paychecks. Premium changes will be reflected on paychecks after the SEHP processes the enrollment or change and sends that information to KU. As employees generally have 30 days in which to initially enroll or to request a change because of a life event, the premium change could be retroactive and result in multiple premiums deducted from a paycheck. If the retroactive premium adjustment will be greater than $500, the Benefits Office will send an email to inform you. To minimize retroactive premium deductions, you are encouraged to enroll or make mid-year changes as early in the 30 day period as possible. Flexible Spending Accounts If you are participating in a health care and/or dependent care flexible spending account (FSA), you have 30 calendar days from the date of the qualifying life event to make the change directly in MAP, using the "Mid-Year Benefit Changes" tab and upload any required documentation to support the change. The election changes must be consistent with the family status change event. If you do not take timely action, or if you do not provide the required supporting documentation, the SEHP will deny your change request. Please contact the Benefits Office (benefits@ku.edu or 785-864-7402) if you have any questions or need assistance.
