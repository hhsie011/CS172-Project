Molecular Diagnostics class in Chile. For Off-Campus Activity Leaders In this online toolkit, Cornell University faculty, staff, and students who lead student activities abroad—whom we call Off-Campus Activity Leaders (OCALs)—can find guides, best practices, templates, and connections to experienced potential collaborators. The toolkit provides advice and resources for designing off-campus student learning experiences, arranged in bite-sized chunks for the novice to the veteran. While it is normal for program development to take one to two years and involve numerous people, this toolkit provides a one-stop shop—a how-to guide to encourage consistency across international off-campus activities and facilitate their creation and execution. OCALs: Self-enroll here for access to the toolkit If you have any questions regarding the materials in this toolkit, please email globaloperations@cornell.edu. Note: You need a university Canvas account to access the toolkit. Those without an account can request one by visiting request.canvas.cornell.edu.
