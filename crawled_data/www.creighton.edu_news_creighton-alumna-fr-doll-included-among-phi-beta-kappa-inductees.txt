Doll included among Phi Beta Kappa inductees May 26, 2022 2 min Read Image Thirty-seven students, along with 1972 alumna Barbara Fick and the Rev. Don Doll, SJ, have been inducted into the Creighton University chapter of Phi Beta Kappa. Barbara Fick, JD, BA’72 (above left), who retired from the Notre Dame Law School in 2018 after a long career in the practice and the teaching of law, was inducted as an alumni member. Fr. Doll (above right), an internationally known photographer and a professor emeritus of journalism at Creighton, was inducted as an honorary member. Fick earned a Bachelor of Arts in English literature and political science from Creighton in 1972 before earning her JD from the University of Pennsylvania in 1976. In the decades thereafter, she built a reputation as a leading lawyer and professor in the field of labor, in 2005 winning Notre Dame’s Grenville Clark Award in recognition of her professional focus on improving the position of the worker in society. Doll is a renowned photographer whose work has been featured in National Geographic magazine. His many years working with Native Americans earned him the 1997 Kodak Crystal Eagle Award for Impact in Photojournalism at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., and the Nebraska Artist of the Year Award in 2006, sponsored by the Nebraska Arts Council. Doll has lived and worked at Creighton since 1969. The Phi Beta Kappa Society, the oldest academic honor society in the United States, promotes excellence in the liberal arts and sciences. This year’s induction ceremony was held on April 22. See photos from the event online.
