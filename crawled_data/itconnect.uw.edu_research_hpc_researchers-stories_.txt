Contact UW-IT About UW-IT Researcher’s Stories Supporting world-class research at the UW is a key strategic goal of UW-IT. Read the latest about high-performance computing, and how University researchers rely on UW-IT supported high performance computing to advance their work. Learn how three professors used JupyterHub in their classrooms February 21, 2022 UW-IT’s JupyterHub service was deployed by a faculty member to help students learn data programming with live code demonstrations and powerful visualizations — without costly and complex computing setups. Read more UW’s supercomputer faster, smarter than ever April 1, 2021 Learn how major upgrades to Hyak, the UW’s supercomputer, are helping the University meet ever-growing research needs. Upgrades include a new hardware infrastructure now underway, and recent expansions in GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) capacity. Read more New IT Connect resource helps UW researchers zero in on AI research tools March 22, 2021 Learn how UW researchers can harness the power of GPUs for their research in this new IT Connect research computing resource. When GPUs are combined in a cluster, they create a sort of supercomputer that is uniquely qualified to perform certain tasks, and in particular they are ideally suited for machine learning. The UW offers several alternatives for researchers to harness the power of GPUs for their research computing needs. Read more Physics of a deadly virus uncovered with UW’s supercomputer October 12, 2020 Read how UW researchers are using Hyak, the University’s supercomputer, to speed up critical, potentially life-saving research on COVID-19. It’s because research being done by Zachary Montague in the Department of Physics could continue without interruption that Hyak was declared an essential research facility early during the pandemic. Other pandemic-related research on Hyak is under way, including a study looking at using artificial intelligence techniques to help predict which COVID-19 patients are at highest risk for heart complications from the illness. Read more UW’s supercomputer leveraged in virtual chemistry and materials sciences courses September 10, 2020 After a successful virtual lab course that used UW’s Hyak supercomputer to build simulations, two professors will be integrating the coursework into chemistry and materials science classes. The coursework was developed by materials science & engineering professor Ting Cao and chemistry professor Xiaosong Li, who are both Clean Energy Institute members and will be integrated into The class will be offered alongside senior undergraduate-level and graduate-level courses in data science and computational modeling for materials (MSE 477-479/542-544) and introductory computational chemistry (CHEM 465/565). Read more New GPU-based supercomputing cluster for machine learning prototyped August 25, 2020 The growing use of data science, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence tools in research has pushed researchers towards graphics processing units (GPUs) to accelerate computationally expensive calculations. To help meet this demand, UW Information Technology developed and deployed a prototype for a GPU-based supercomputing cluster, paid for in part by nearly $27,000 in funding provided by the Student Technology Fee. Access is available for UW students through the UW Research Computing Club and also for UW faculty and staff. Learn more about high performance computing. Read more The UW’s supercomputer now enhanced with AI November 21, 2019 Hyak, the UW’s supercomputer, has been dramatically enhanced with machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities —with savings of about $500,000 to the UW thanks to a partnership between UW-IT and the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering. Read more Building better online communities November 15, 2019 Why do some attempts at online collaborative— like Wikipedia and Linux — build large and eager volunteer communities, and why do so many others fail to attract any members at all? Learn how Assistant Professor Benjamin Mako Hill, in the Department of Communication, is using the UW’s supercomputer to find out. Read more Take advantage of UW’s on-site supercomputer for research computing needs October 2, 2019 Now anyone with a UW NetID who needs powerful computing tools to do their research can gain access to Hyak, the UW’s shared supercomputer cluster.
