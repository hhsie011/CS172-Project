BC Bookmarks Literary news from the Boston College community Skip to content Home About ← Older posts Undercover in the underworld Posted on May 31, 2022 by Bookworm Federal law enforcement agent Ken Croke tells the story of the two years he spent undercover infiltrating the infamous Pagan Motorcycle Club, a white supremacist biker gang, in the new book Riding with Evil: Taking Down the Notorious Pagan Motorcycle Gang (HarperCollins, 2022). Written with bestselling writer Dave Wedge, a Boston College alumnus, Riding with Evil delivers a nail-biting account of the secretive and brutal biker underworld—the unspeakable violence, extremism, drugs, and disgusting rituals. At great personal risk, Croke built a case that would eventually bring down the top members of the gang in a large scale federal prosecution. Wedge’s other publications include Hunting Whitey: The Inside Story of the Capture & Killing of America’s Most Wanted Crime Boss; The Last Days of John Lennon; and Boston Strong: A City’s Triumph over Tragedy.

Googins, authors of the new book Sustainability to Social Change: Lead Your Company from Managing Risks to Creating Social Value (Kogan Page, 2022). Their book outlines the strategies and practices that leaders can use to address the five biggest problems facing companies and society today: purpose, prosperity, products, planet and people. Filled with real life examples, hands-on guidelines, and self-assessments to rate your company’s performance, Sustainability to Social Change can help business leaders pivot their company’s mindset and practices in order to enhance society and the environment, and fuel their own success.

In Undoing The Knots: Five Generations of American Catholic Anti-Blackness (Beacon Press, 2022), O’Connell excavates her Catholic family’s entanglements with race and racism from the time they immigrated to America to the present, and traces, by implication, why, despite the tenets of their faith, so many white Catholics have lukewarm commitments to racial justice. O’Connell, who earned a Ph.D. in theological ethics from BC’s Theology Department, is an associate professor of Christian ethics at La Salle University. She is also author of Compassion: Loving Our Neighbor in an Age of Globalization and the award-winning If These Walls Could Talk: Community Muralism and the Beauty of Justice. Emma McDonald, a doctoral candidate in theological ethics at Boston College, penned a review of Undoing the Knots for Commonweal magazine.

Despite the enduring popularity of pilgrimages, Christian theology has not fully engaged this reality. In his new book, The Pilgrim Paradigm: Faith in Motion (Paulist Press, 2022), BC School of Theology and Ministry Associate Professor of Systematic and Spiritual Theology André Brouillette, S.J., explores the richness of the pilgrimage—its significance theologically, intellectually, and practically. This academic year, Fr. Brouillette served as the Anna and Donald Waite Endowed Chair in Jesuit Education at Creighton University.

In Pandemic Re-Awakenings: The Forgotten and Unforgotten ‘Spanish’ Flu of 1918-1919 (Oxford University Press, 2021), more than 20 scholars offer original essays from the perspectives of personal, communal, medical, and cultural histories in different national and transnational settings. The volume reveals how, even though the Great Flu was overshadowed by the commemorative culture of the Great War, recollections of the pandemic persisted over time to re-emerge towards the centenary of the ‘Spanish’ Flu and burst into public consciousness following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Beiner studies history, memory, and social forgetting and is the author of the award-winning publication, Forgetful Remembrance: Social Forgetting and Vernacular Historiography of a Rebellion in Ulster.

According to That’s Not Funny, right-wing comedy has been hiding in plain sight, finding its way into mainstream conservative media through figures ranging from Fox News’s Greg Gutfeld to libertarian podcasters like Joe Rogan. Sienkiewicz and Marx contend that the contemporary conservative comedy network–from podcasts and television to YouTube and live standup–is culturally and politically relevant and its influence cannot be ignored. An expert in media and comedy studies, Sienkiewicz is an associate professor of communication and international studies at BC. He is author of The Other Air Force: U.S. Efforts to Reshape Middle Eastern Media Since 9/11, and he and Marx are co-editors of Saturday Night Live and American TV.

Stegman, S.J., dean and professor of the BC School of Theology and Ministry. Fr. Stegman highlights some key, yet lesser known, New Testament passages, such as Letter to the Hebrews; James; 1 and 2 Peter; 1, 2, and 3 John; Jude; and Revelation. Unlike the Gospels and letters of Paul, these texts—the final nine writings in the New Testament—are rarely the subject of preaching in the Church’s Sunday Eucharistic liturgy. Fr. Stegman’s other publications include Written for Our Instruction: Theological and Spiritual Riches in Romans; Opening the Door of Faith: Encountering Jesus and His Call to Discipleship; and Paulist Biblical Commentary.

REDRESS: Ireland’s Institutions and Transitional Justice (University of College Dublin Press, 2022) focuses on the structures which perpetuated widespread and systematic abuses in the past and considers how political arrangements continue to exert power over survivors, adopted people and generations of relatives, as well as control the remains and memorialization of the dead. REDRESS explores what it might look like if survivors’ experiences and expertise were allowed to lead the response to a century of gender- and family separation-based abuses resulting from Magdalene Laundries, Mother and Baby Homes, County Homes, industrial and reformatory schools, and a closed and secretive adoption system. REDRESS is edited by Katherine O’Donnell (UCD School of Philosophy), Maeve O’Rourke (Irish Centre for Human Rights, School of Law, NUI Galway), and James Smith, an associate professor of English and Irish Studies at Boston College. Smith’s other publications include Ireland and the Magdalene Laundries: A Campaign for Justice; Ireland’s Magdalen Laundries and the Nation’s Architecture of Containment; and Children, Childhood and Irish Society: 1500 to the present.

The Handbook of Research on Creativity and Innovation (Edward Elgar Publishing, 2021) co-edited by Jing Zhou, professor of management and psychology at Rice University’s Jones Graduate School of Business, and Elizabeth (Bess) Rouse, associate professor at Boston College’s Carroll School of Management, showcases some of the most advanced and interesting work in the creativity and innovation field. The handbook also analyzes the role of social influences/team culture in the processes of creativity and innovation, as well as how to make sense of and study creativity and innovation. Rouse and O’Connor Family Professor Michael Pratt of the Carroll School co-wrote a chapter for the volume. The editors hope the handbook offers a platform for idea exchange and stimulates future research. Share this: Email Facebook Twitter Pinterest Tumblr Like this: Like Loading...

These philosophical, theological, and literary analyses bring fresh perspectives on Anselm both in his historical context and in dialogue with contemporary questions. The papers in this volume were originally presented at the Boston College conference “Reading Anselm: Context and Criticism.” The volume is co-edited by John T. Slotemaker of Fairfield University and Eileen C. Sweeney, a professor of philosophy at Boston College. Sweeney also wrote an essay for the volume titled, “Anselm on Evil and Eudaimonism.” She is the author of Anselm of Canterbury and the Desire for the Word and Words in the Absence of Things: Logic, Theology and Poetry in Boethius Abelard and Alan of Lille.
