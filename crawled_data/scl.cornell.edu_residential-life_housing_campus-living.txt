We are committed to providing information and services that result in informed housing decisions.

If you would like to speak with a Peer Advisor please send an email to offcampusliving@cornell.edu with the normal “Who, What, When and Where” along with several dates and times you are available, so a virtual meeting can be scheduled. You will be notified of the day, time and number to call. Thank you for your patience and understanding as we all find our way through this unprecedented time.
