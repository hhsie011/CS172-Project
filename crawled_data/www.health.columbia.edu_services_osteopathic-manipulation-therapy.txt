No. Osteopathy is sometimes confused with chiropractic as both use manipulations to treat patients. How do I schedule an appointment for osteopathic manipulation therapy? Due to an abundance of caution, OMT appointments will be on pause during the pandemic. When we resume these services, you must be referred by a primary care clinician from Medical Services to see our osteopaths for OMT. How many treatments will it take to resolve my problem? Each condition is unique and requires assessment by a clinician who may also determine if a referral to a specialist is required. Students who are eligible can receive a total of five sessions for OMT during their enrollment at Columbia Health. Related Resources What is Osteopathic Medicine?
