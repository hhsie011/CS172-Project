The project, called Ice Bridges, or Ikaaġvik Sikukun in the Iñupiaq language, melded Indigenous observations, aerial monitoring, ocean and marine mammal science to address questions developed with the projects Iñupiaq Elder Advisory Council. The first peer-reviewed studies have been published, as well as a 14-part film series that has been made available on Youtube. “Ice Edge” launch party is being held on Facebook, YouTube, and LinkedIn on Jan. 27, from 2 to 3:30 p.m. ET. The event is hosted by Andy Revkin, one of America’s most honored and experienced environmental journalists, with discussion by Indigenous and scientific team members. This event will celebrate the launch of the feature-length film produced by Sarah Betcher of Farthest North Films, chronicling the years-long study and the relationships it forged. The film discusses the research and explores lessons that can inform efforts around the world to bridge local and western science expertise and perspectives when tackling urgent challenges where the impacts of climate change are greatest. Guests will include Documentary Filmmaker, Sarah Betcher of Farthest North Films, and research team members: Elder Advisory Council members Ross Schaeffer, Bobby Schaeffer and Cyrus Harris (contingent on availability) Alex Whiting, Environmental Program Director, Native Village of Kotzebue Donna Hauser, Marine Mammal Scientist, UAF International Arctic Research Center Christopher Zappa, Oceanographer, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia Climate School Watch “Ice Edge” here ahead of time and join us with questions: https://youtu.be/P9RzfGtLWHo This event is presented as a partnership between Farthest North Films, the Native Village of Kotzebue, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, and the International Arctic Research Center. The research and film was funded by an innovative grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation aimed at bringing new depth to the concept of co-production of knowledge.
