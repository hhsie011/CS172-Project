There are several different loan options, from federal to private. Some loans are need-based while others are available to any enrolled student, and all loans must be paid back with interest. Eligibility for federal loans is determined by a student’s FAFSA and will be awarded as part of a student’s financial aid package. Federal loans often have lower interest rates compared to private loans, so be sure to do your research to understand all of your options. Temple’s Student Financial Services can help you navigate which loan option is the best for you. TYPES OF LOANS Federal Loans Direct Subsidized Loans Direct Subsidized Loans are available to undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need. The federal government pays the interest on the loan during certain periods of time. Learn more about direct subsidized loans. Direct Unsubsidized Loans Direct Unsubsidized Loans are made to eligible undergraduate, graduate and professional students. Unlike direct subsidized loans, you do not have to demonstrate financial need to be eligible, but you are responsible for paying all interest. Learn more about direct unsubsidized loans. Direct PLUS Loans Direct Federal Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) is an option for parents of dependent undergraduate students to help pay for education expenses not covered by other financial aid. Parents should wait to apply for the upcoming academic year until mid-June. Learn more about PLUS loans. Non-federal Loans Direct Consolidation Loans Direct consolidation loans allow you to combine all of your eligible federal student loans into a single loan with a single loan servicer. Learn more about direct consolidation loans. Private Loans Private loans are alternative loans that are managed through private lenders and issued in the student’s name. Private loans require a credit-worthy co-signer. Eligibility, rates, terms and conditions vary. Learn more about private loans. All federal loans are reported on the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS). The information is accessible to guaranty agencies, lenders and authorized users at schools. Students can access their information reported on NSLDS by vising studentaid.gov. Learn more about educational loan options through Student Financial Services.
