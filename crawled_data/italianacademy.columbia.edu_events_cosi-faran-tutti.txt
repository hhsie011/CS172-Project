Seductive sisters, brazen soldiers, a meddling maid, and a self-proclaimed master of the science of love provide the power play of COSÌ FARAN TUTTI ~ or They’ll All Do It! What really happened in the days leading up to Mozart’s and da Ponte’s Così fan tutte? What yearnings, what disguises, and what passions? With hilarious twists and sexy turns, Jonathan Dawe’s new opera premieres at The Italian Academy, December 2012 and celebrates multiple permutations of love by pulling the covers off the seemingly random combinations of desire to which all are subject.
