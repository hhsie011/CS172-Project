Battershell Denton Wood Videos Marques Jones Heather Benoit Spotlight Timeline Merchandise Baylor>Engineering & Computer Science>Get Involved Get Involved There are numerous opportunities to be involved in a meaningful way with Baylor's School of Engineering and Computer Science's (ECS) programs and students. Don Roberts, Lockheed Martin Fellow and an ECS Board of Advocates member, describes the highlight of his career working with Baylor ECS students. “To see real-world engineering challenges brought into the classroom, worked on by students with fresh ideas and new ways to approach problems, coached by faculty who inspire and encourage, followed by professionally presented solutions in the Lockheed Martin workplace, has been very satisfying to me,” Roberts said. "If through this collaboration I can convey to the students even a spark of the excitement that can be enjoyed as an engineer, then I’ve been successful.” Read more about Roberts' experience. How you can get involved: Corporate Collaboration Baylor Engineering and Computer Science has a history of working with industry to solve real‐world problems.
