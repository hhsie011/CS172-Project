Accreditation Coordinator Dr. Michael Thompson Professor and Accreditation Coordinator, Electrical and Computer Engineering (254) 710-4129 Institution Information Baylor University Waco, Texas Mission Statement The mission of the Electrical and Computer Engineering program is to educate students within a caring Christian environment, in the discipline of electrical and computer engineering. We want our graduates to be motivated by Christian ideals and to view their career as a lifelong commitment to serving others. We strive to provide our students with a strong technical foundation with an emphasis on professional, moral, ethical and leadership development. BSECE Program Educational Objectives Within a few years after graduation, Baylor BSECE graduates will: Be productive and valuable engineers; Be successful in high-quality MS, PhD, JD, MBA, and MD programs; Be mindful of the moral and ethical relationships that their engineering decisions have with society and the world; and Make positive contributions to their communities, churches, and society at large. BSECE Expected Graduate Outcomes In support of the program objectives, graduates of the program must demonstrate that they have: an ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science and mathematics; an ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors; an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences; an ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts; an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives; an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions; and an ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies.
