Truett Seminary>Programs & Centers>Spiritual Formation Program>Spiritual Direction Training Program Spiritual Direction Training Program Program Home Continuing Education Academic Credit Program Overview "The spiritual direction program at Truett was a highlight from my seminary experience. I discovered pastoral skills and passions I was previously unaware of and my entire concept of ministry and vocation have been reshaped during my two years in the program." —Chase Jensen, C.S.D. Spiritual direction is a historic practice of the church that involves accompanying others in prayerful reflection and conversation as they attend to God's presence and calling in their lives and grow in Christian maturity. Growing a life with God is an essential dimension of the Christian journey. We grow best when we make the journey with others who give the gift of "one anothering" through prayer and encouragement. The ministry of spiritual direction is one form of relationship that responds to this need. Truett Seminary now offers a training program in spiritual direction for those who are interested in strengthening their gifts for spiritual discernment. Course content includes study, prayer, and practical ministry opportunities with Baylor students and in congregations. Spiritual Direction I-IV is offered over a two-year period. Those who complete the program receive a Certificate in Spiritual Direction from Truett Seminary and can offer spiritual direction to individuals and groups in congregations, other ministry contexts, and beyond. The program is available to seminary students, Baylor faculty and staff, ministers, and lay people seeking to become spiritual directors. About the Instructor The primary instructor in the spiritual direction training program is Truett Seminary's Director of Spiritual Formation, Dr. Angela Reed. Dr. Reed has been a spiritual director for nearly two decades and has a passion for teaching others about this ministry. She is the author of Quest For Spiritual Community: Reclaiming Spiritual Guidance for Contemporary and co-author of Spiritual Companioning: A Guide to Protestant Theology and Practice which received the Dallas Willard Center book award for 2016. Additionally, Dr. Reed is joined in our courses by a staff of spiritual direction supervisors who are trained in this ministry. The class meets together in a large group to receive instruction on the history, theology, theory, and practice of spiritual direction, but also meets in smaller groups that allow for students to offer and receive spiritual direction under the guidance and direction of a supervisor. Our staff of supervisors are certified spiritual directors who bring knowledge, experience, and wisdom in teaching others how to serve skillfully in this ministry. "Being part of the spiritual direction training program at Truett was absolutely transformational. I was introduced to a new way of being with God that a part of me had been searching for my entire life. The opportunity to serve others through the ministry of spiritual direction for which this program has prepared me is a pure gift and an invitation from God to listen closely and depend completely upon him." —Carrol Crowson, C.S.D.
