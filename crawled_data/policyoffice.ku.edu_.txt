As stewards of the University Policy Program, the Policy Office is responsible for the maintenance and oversight of the Policy Library, the University’s official archive for policy. We facilitate policy development, periodic review and revision, and approval, as well as publication in the Policy Library, using the Policy Development Process. The Policy Office assists units in implementing Kansas Board of Regents policy, achieving compliance with state and federal laws and regulations, and addressing institutional interests by promoting efficiency and effectiveness. We value collaboration with subject matter experts and units across the University and strive to make each policy development process as inclusive as possible to ensure that policies address institutional need and serve our campus community.
