In proceeding to the doctoral degree, each student has the opportunity to enrich his or her knowledge of many aspects of Greek and Latin literature, history, and culture, as well as related fields (e.g., Sanskrit, archaeology, epigraphy). The major steps through which one attains this knowledge, however, vary from program to program. The following section will outline the requirements for progressing through the Ph.D. course at Brown University. Much of the information is excerpted from the departmental handbook for graduate study.
