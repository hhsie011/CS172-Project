The Biological Systems Engineering program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org/. Biological Systems Engineering integrates life sciences with engineering to solve problems related to, or using, biological systems. These biological systems may include microbes, plants, animals, humans and/or ecosystems. Biological systems engineers have a worldview shaped by an understanding of fundamental principles of engineering and life-sciences. They use their understanding of engineering to analyze organisms or ecosystems, and their knowledge of biological systems to inspire and inform their designs. They approach engineering design from a biological systems perspective, appreciating the complexity of biological systems and developing solutions that accommodate and anticipate the adaptability of biological systems. Goal: To educate students to solve problems related to biorenewables production and processing, water quality, environmental impacts of the bioeconomy, food processing, and biosensors, and in so doing to prepare students for professional practice and post-graduate educational opportunities. Student Learning Outcomes: Graduates of the Biological Systems Engineering curriculum should have, at the time of graduation: an ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics an ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences an ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions an ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies. Program Educational Objectives: Three to five years after graduation, our graduates will be using the knowledge, skills, and abilities from their biological systems engineering degree to improve the human condition through successful careers in a wide variety of fields. They will be effective leaders, collaborators, and innovators who address environmental, social, technical, and business challenges. They will be engaged in life-long learning and professional development through self-study, continuing education, or graduate/professional school. Well-qualified juniors and seniors in biological systems engineering who are interested in graduate study may apply for concurrent enrollment in the Graduate College to simultaneously pursue a bachelor of science degree in biological systems engineering and a master of science degree in agricultural engineering. Under concurrent enrollment, students are eligible for assistantships and simultaneously take undergraduate and graduate courses. A concurrent bachelor of science and master of business administration program is also offered by the department. The department also offers a bachelor of science curriculum in agricultural engineering. See College of Engineering. Additionally, the department offers bachelor of science curricula in agricultural systems technology and in industrial technology. See College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. The department also participates in interdepartmental majors in environmental science, sustainable agriculture, human computer interaction, and toxicology (see Index).
