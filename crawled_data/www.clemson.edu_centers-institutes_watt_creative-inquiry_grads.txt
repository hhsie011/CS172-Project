While CI projects must be organized under a faculty member, many are led by talented graduate students interested in furthering their research and expanding their mentoring experience. If you are interested in assisting or leading a CI please contact the CI office. Any potential mentors are encouraged to join the bi-monthly CI + UR News email dissemination for deadlines and targeted opportunities for CI projects, mentors, and students. To join this list, please email ciinfo@g.clemson.edu. Initiating a Project To get started, review the comprehensive list of active projects. Create a project that will involve students from your own and/or other departments. Many of the most successful projects are cross-disciplinary. Consider consulting your College Liaison or the CI project office, as they might know of particular areas that would benefit from a new project. Consider working with an outside business, industry, agency or private group to collaborate with your project team. Identify a course to be used for your CI project, and obtain permission from the department chair to teach this course. Submit your project proposal. Managing Your Project Use the CI project manager to edit, update information, budget and courses. Each semester you must submit course and section numbers.
