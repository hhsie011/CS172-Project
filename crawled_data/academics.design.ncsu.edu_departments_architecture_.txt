The class began by visualizing a 2020 data set from the Southern Poverty Law Center which compiled all confederate memorials in the US -- both standing and removed. The structural disparities of today overlaid with temporal and spatial patterns of memorial erection expose a palimpsest of institutionalized racism beginning in structures of slavery, reformulated through the segregationalist policies of the Jim Crow Era, and reinforced by the reactionary legislation and social practices spanning the Civil Rights Era to today. With these insights, students broadened their study to include the societal, economic and political structures that manifest and support systemic racism and ongoing oppression. ... ncstate_architecture View Apr 19 Open üî¥ Final reviews are here üî¥ ... ncstate_architecture View Apr 16 Open A group of students has taken the initiative to reexamine the floor of The Allred Gallery, which was originally inspired by Le Corbusier. Today we are learning more about Corbusier‚Äôs ties to discriminatory groups and his values that do not align with the College of Design‚Äôs mission. We do not support Corbusier‚Äôs values, especially those of homophobia, misogyny, and fascism. The School of Architecture and College of Design strive to be a safe and inclusive space for all students. This group of students has taken the initiative to rethink Allred Gallery to better reflect the values that our school represents. On March 30, a student-led charrette encouraged participants to redesign the space. More discussions about the floor will take place in the future.
