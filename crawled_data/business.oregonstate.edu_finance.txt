Alumni Nominate Alumni Recognition Alumni Where We Are Business Gold Our Team Volunteer Volunteer with the College of Business Finance Finance > Learning Goals Required Courses Four-Year Plan Advisory Council Finance The world of finance is fascinating and a non-stop global force — every business operation involves a financial decision Overview Finance Finance is harnessing the power of money to make things happen. Effective financing enables life-saving research, ground-breaking engineering, and building of infrastructure on which communities and nations depend. On a more personal scale, financial planning and markets enable home ownership, entrepreneurial successes, and comfortable retirements. Your career in finance begins with acquiring skills that set you apart from most working professionals. You thrive in that career based on the trust you earn from the people around you and the improvement you bring to their lives. Ultimately your career can take you just about anywhere. Pursuing corporate finance might lead you to become an analyst or executive at a multinational corporation or a key member of a start-up venture. Pursuing wealth management might lead you to financial planning, asset management, or insurance, either as part of a large firm or as a business owner. You might also pursue commercial banking, investment banking, or management consulting. The world continues to need finance professionals and, in many cases, to compensate them well. If you have an analytical mind, determination, and the ability to communicate complex ideas with precision, consider studying finance. Finance is a major program of study offered in Corvallis and online through Ecampus. It is also offered as a minor. Options: Once you enroll in the finance program, you can select an area of focus from the following options: Dean's Academy The Dean’s Academy is an academic forum for high-achieving first-year students, transfer students, and current undergraduate students who wish to maximize the educational and experiential aspects of their college experience. Invitation to this option is restricted to those who meet eligibility requirements. Learn more Financial Planning The financial planning option gives you the ability to help others with responsible planning that will lead to a comfortable, long-term, financial outlook. Financial planners are specialized career positions that are in demand broadly in finance, insurance, banking and business.
