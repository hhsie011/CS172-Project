While independent majors involve interdisciplinary work, many established majors within Arts & Sciences also involve studies in various fields. So be sure to do your research before deciding that your interests do not fit comfortably into an existing department or major. If you decide to pursue an independent major, you’ll work with the director and faculty in your areas of interest to develop and then refine your proposal, which will be reviewed by a board of faculty members.
