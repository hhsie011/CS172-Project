The University’s Standing Committee on the Conduct of Research implements the Institutional Policy on Misconduct in Research ("Policy"). The Office of Research Compliance and Training helps administer the Policy and is a resource for anyone with concerns or questions about possible research misconduct. Naomi Schrag, the Vice President for Research Compliance, Training and Policy, is Columbia's Research Integrity Officer. The University defines research misconduct, in accordance with federal policy, as any fabrication, falsification or plagiarism in proposing, performing or reviewing research or in the reporting of research results. Research misconduct does not include honest error or differences of opinion, authorship disputes that do not involve plagiarism, and violations of other University policies (e.g., sexual harassment policy). Type of Research Misconduct Fabrication Definition The making up of data or results and the recording or reporting thereof Type of Research Misconduct Falsfication Definition The manipulation of research materials, equipment or processes, or the change or omission of data or results such that the research is not accurately represented in the research record Type of Research Misconduct Plagiarism Definition The appropriation of another person’s ideas, processes, results or words without giving appropriate credit. It is important to recognize that plagiarism may occur not only in published work, but also in presentations of your research, and in grant proposals Expand all Collapse all University Procedures Research Misconduct Overview Confidentiality and Other Safeguards The University has a strong commitment to assuring confidentiality when investigating allegations of misconduct. This commitment is reflected in the Policy, which states: “To the extent possible consistent with a fair and thorough investigation and as allowed by law, knowledge about the identity of a Complainant, a Respondent and any Witnesses shall be limited to those persons identified in this Policy and others who need to know and all written materials and information with respect to any proceedings shall be kept confidential.” For additional safeguards, see section K in the Institutional Policy on Misconduct in Research. Resolution Process The University has a process for handling formal allegations of research misconduct that can include the following steps: Inquiry, Investigation, Adjudication and Appeal. Not every case will include each of these steps. The Resolution Process flow chart details the University’s formal process for addressing allegations of research misconduct. Findings of Misconduct For there to be a finding of research misconduct following a resolution process, three requirements must be met: There must be a significant departure from accepted practices in the relevant research community; The Research Misconduct must have been committed intentionally, knowingly or recklessly; The Allegation must be proved by a Preponderance of the Evidence If You Have a Concern The University does not tolerate retaliation against those who report a compliance concern in good faith. If you have a question with respect to possible research misconduct there are several places you can go to discuss your concern, such as: A faculty member, department Chair, Dean or other official in the relevant department, center or institute The Office of Research Compliance & Training The Office of Postdoctoral Affairs The Ombuds Office A Member of the Standing Committee on the Conduct of Research The University Compliance Hotline - (866) 627-3768 Some issues may be able to be resolved informally through a Dean or department Chair, or other official in the relevant department, center or institute before any formal allegations of misconduct are made. An individual may begin a formal misconduct proceeding by submitting a written allegation of research misconduct to the Chair of the Standing Committee or to the Executive Vice President for Research. The University takes seriously each allegation of research misconduct.
