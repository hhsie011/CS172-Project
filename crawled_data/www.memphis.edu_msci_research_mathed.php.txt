State and National level competitive grants have provided opportunities for our faculty to provide professional development for K-12 teachers from school districts in Shelby County and the surrounding rural counties. In addition, our faculty have played leading roles in the development of Common Core curriculum and assessment materials that can be found at EngageNY, Eureka Math, and PARCC. Faculty have served on State-wide Educational Advisory Boards. Members Below are the research interests and representative publications from each member.
