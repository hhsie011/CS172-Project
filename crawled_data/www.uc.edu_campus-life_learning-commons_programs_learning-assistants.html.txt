Acting as a Learning Assistant (LA) allows students to build close professional connections with faculty members, review important material for their major or post-UC career, and support their peers. Learning Assistants support faculty for remote and in-person courses. Outside of class, LAs host an office hour each week. Office hour locations vary based on course. Some office hours are held in the Math and Science Support (MASS) Center. Some Learning Assistants offer office hours through their assigned course. Information about those office hours is accessible on the specific course's Canvas page. Students acting as Learning Assistants work in a small teaching team with faculty members who are invested in implementing hands on, application-based learning in and outside the classroom. From an LA’s perspective, that might include facilitating group discussion, guiding student groups through problem sets, or meeting with students outside of class to discuss key concepts. Learn more about the requirements and benefits for students seeking to work as an LA. Faculty members interested in having a LA should read the requirements and benefits of having an LA assigned to your class. LAs can work in conjunction with other Peer Education supports such as Supplemental Instruction or Supplemental Review Sessions.
