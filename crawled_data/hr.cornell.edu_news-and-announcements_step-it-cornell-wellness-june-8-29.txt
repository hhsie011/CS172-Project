We'll meet up at the Schoellkopf stadium steps for a group warm-up, running or walking (your choice) the stadium steps, followed by a group cool-down. Before leaving the workout, you'll let the instructor know how many steps you conquered. Collectively, we'll see how high we can climb, and the instructor will email the group with the total number of steps achieved with a fun comparison to something iconic. What heights can we reach together as a group? For example, it's 354 steps to the top of the Statue of Liberty's torch. Questions? Contact the instructor, Kerry Howell.
