In fact, K-State was named one of the 50 safest large universities in America by College Choice in Sept. 2016. K-State is safe because faculty, students, and staff approach campus safety as a shared responsibility. The campus community has adopted the Principles of Community, which state the type of welcoming, safe, and inclusive community K-State strives to be. Together we make K-State what it is: a safe, supportive, and caring community where the well-being of each of us is the responsibility of all of us. <!-- intentionally non-empty iframe; for xsl --> Contact us Emergency Statements and disclosures Accessibility Kansas State University Manhattan, KS 66506 785-532-6011 © Kansas State University Updated: 1/15/20
