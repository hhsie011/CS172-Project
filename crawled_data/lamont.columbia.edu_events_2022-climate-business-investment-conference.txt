While more than 1,000 companies with combined revenue over $10 trillion have already pledged to reduce emissions to net zero, there is no clear path for effectively reaching this goal. The 2022 Climate Business & Investment Conference will hear from leading academics and practitioners on the latest net zero business strategies, and the implications for climate change. This conference — a joint effort by the Tamer Center for Social Enterprise at Columbia Business School and Columbia Climate School — brings together climate academics and business leaders to understand how new advances in research and practice can inform investments in specific sectors of the global economy. The forum explores topics that address the value and opportunity of using a science-based approach to inform and guide business and investment decisions.
