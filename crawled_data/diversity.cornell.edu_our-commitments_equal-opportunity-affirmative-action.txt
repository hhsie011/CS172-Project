View the University’s complete Equal Education and Employment Opportunity Statement. Workplace Affirmative Action Because Cornell University is a federal contractor, receiving well more than one hundred million dollars in federal research grants, Cornell is subject to the federal laws and regulations governing affirmative action in the workplace. Each year, in the affirmative action plan, the university analyzes the compositional diversity of its workforce by job group as compared to the demographics of qualified talent available based on estimates from census and other data. This analysis is used to help develop and inform proactive recruitment and retention strategies as well as to identify and eliminate any unconcious bias in the employment process. Cornell’s affirmative action obligations and archived plans are made viewable and maintained in the Division of Human Resources.
