The 6 course (18 credit hour) minor allows non-education majors to enroll in courses that will prepare you for the classroom. Learn More about the K-12 Education Minor Why Minor in K-12 Education If you are interested in teaching middle or high school classes in your undergraduate field of study, the K-12 Education Minor will help jumpstart your pathway to becoming a teacher. As an undergraduate in this minor, you will receive coursework to train you for working in the classroom and begin your preparation to receive licensure. Once you complete the minor and pass the Praxis exam area in the subject area of your undergraduate major, you will become eligible for a job-embedded practitioner’s license. This temporary teaching license will qualify you to teach in K-12 schools while completing the remaining required graduate courses to obtain the actual Tennessee Practitioner Teacher License. A specialized 5-course (15 credit hour) Graduate Certificate track will allow you to complete the courses you need to receive a full teaching license.
