These may be services provided for or by medical providers and/or victim services organizations. They may include psychological or other counseling, participation in safety planning, assistance for temporary or permanent relocation, or legal assistance in connection with such domestic or sexual abuse. Eligibility To be eligible, an employee must be either a full-time or regular part-time (20 hours or more) nonbargaining employee, and have completed at least six months of continuous service. Granting of the leave is a discretionary determination by the university. Qualifying Events An eligible employee may use this leave either for self or a family member to seek medical attention to recover from injuries caused by domestic abuse or sexual violence, obtain help and services from a victim’s services organization, obtain counseling or therapy, seek legal assistance including preparing for or participating in any civil or criminal legal proceedings related to domestic or sexual violence, or take actions to prevent future domestic or sexual violence such as safety planning or relocating. PDAL Provisions This leave can be continuous (a block of three or more continuous days) or intermittent (less than three days and sporadic). Leave under the ordinance does not extend an employee’s leave entitlement beyond the 12 weeks the employee may be entitled to under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) for a 12-month period. Temple University requires employees to use all unused sick days (if appropriate and in accordance with the university’s sick leave policy), vacation and personal holidays while on leave. If an employee has exhausted all paid leave time and is not receiving disability benefits through Temple University, the balance of the leave is unpaid. Apply for PDAL Upon submitting your request, as practical, we will contact you within 48 hours as to the decision of the request. Additional documentation, as applicable, may be required for the application. To apply, login and navigate to TUportal > Staff Tools tab > Employee Dashboard channel.
