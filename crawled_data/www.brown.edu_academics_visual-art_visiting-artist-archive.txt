Our Visiting Artist Program brings nationally and internationally acclaimed artists to campus to give lectures and critiques. This program allows students to have direct interaction with a wide variety of artists in the form of lectures, workshops, critiques, and the occasional Artist-in-Residence. In addition to printed flyers that are posted prominently throughout the building, students learn about lectures via calendar link on our website, through announcements made in class, as well as through the Department's listserv and Facebook postings. The abbreviated list of Visiting Artists for the coming academic year is listed below. All talks are free and open to the public.
