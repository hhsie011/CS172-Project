HIST 4.01 The Crusades The crusades, launched by European Christians who sought to secure military control over the Holy Land, led to a period of sustained and largely inimical contact between Christian and Muslim cultures. Covering the period from 1095-ca.1350, this course explores the cultural, religious, and ideological contexts of crusade history which shaped notions of religious violence, holy war, and ethnic cleansing, along with a long history of distrust between the peoples of Christian Europe (or the Christian West) and the Islamic Middle East.

In between, the horse has been essential to global processes of agricultural and industrial development, urbanization, exploration and conquest. In many societies horses have also been associated with the fundamentals of social stratification and gender dichotomies. For good reason, the horse as a representation has also taken on profound cultural and religious roles. Dist: SOC; WCult: CI. Major distributives (Class of 2023 and Before): INTER, pre-1700/pre-1800.

It is actually a realm of robust argument, changing interpretations, and vivid imagination. This brand-new, team-taught course explores different genres of professional historical research and writing (e.g. biography, political history, cultural history). Through a dynamic mix of lectures and small-group discussions, both History majors and non-majors will gain a new appreciation of the historian's craft. No prerequisites; first-year students welcome.

HIST 10.02 Archival Research and the Production of History The target constituency of this summer-term course will be those students admitted to History's London-based FSP who have framed an archive-based project (as most will do). Other students who wish to engage in a high-level exploration of archival-based historical knowledge are welcome to enroll; such students will pursue work for Unit Three of the class of their own choosing, in consultation with the instructor. The term consists of a three-part hybrid: an initial unit on the "epistemology of the archive" is followed by a unit on a select number of classic archival "finds." The course concludes with practical workshop format, intended to enhance a student's prospects for executing a project for 97.10 in London. Dist: SOC; WCult: W.

HIST 10.03 The Dartmouth Vietnam Project: Learning Oral History in a Digital Age This course explores the theory and practice of oral history. Oral history interviews are collaborations between interviewers and narrators (interviewees). Such interviews are used to explore both the lives of individuals and the histories of communities. In some cases, oral history provides a way to access voices and perspectives that are marginalized or absent from the materials contained in conventional archives. The use of oral history interviews as primary sources raises complex questions about narrative, subjectivity, memory, and historical truth. In this course, students will be trained to conduct an interview for the Dartmouth Vietnam Project, an ongoing oral history project that records testimony from community members about their memories of the Vietnam War and its impact on their lives.

It played a foundational role in shaping settler colonialism, racial slavery, and capitalism across the Americas and it has also framed debates around the legacies of slavery and colonial appropriation up to the present. This course explores the evolution of the plantation as an institution and an ideology of racialized exploitation, but also traces enslaved peoples' resistance to the plantation and their construction of rival geographies and institutions.

HIST 63.02 Reading Artifacts: The Material Culture of Science SPRING 2021 and 2022 Description: In addition to its written documents, the history of science can be understood through its physical artifacts: through microscopes and mastodon molars, maps and masks, armadillo shells, botanical drawings, dioramas, and even human remains. Focusing on European and American scientific inquiry and collecting, and especially the years before 1800, this course introduces students to the historical study of material culture. Through learning about the varied types of tangible things involved in scientific study, as well as the many ways historical people and institutions have approached material artifacts, students will understand more broadly how objects and collections both reflect and shape a culture's knowledge systems, identities, and values. By encountering historical artifacts and historical ways of seeing objects, students will also learn how to incorporate objects as sources into their own research as historians. Above all, in an era of technological saturation, they will learn to slow down and to look closely. Dist: TAS; WCult: W. Major distributives (Class of 2023 and Before): INTER.

What did law look like in different imperial contexts? How do the histories of empire and imperialism help us understand the history of law? Looking across regions and contexts, from early modern Iberian empires, to early colonial North America, to Africa and Asia, this course examines the relationship between law, empire, expansion, and colonialism from the 17th to 21st centuries. With a few exceptions, our readings and discussions will follow chronological order, veering off course occasionally to look at issues comparatively. Throughout, we'll be working to uncover how imperial approaches to law changed over time and how laws and legal institutions with imperial origins have shaped expectations and experiences into the present.

HIST 90.14 The Global British Empire, 1600 – The Present This course charts the long history and continuing legacies of the British Empire, an entity that has transformed every single continent over the last four centuries and is widely associated with the makings of the modern world. We examine how and why a powerful and expansive British Empire emerged and sustained itself. Equally, we zoom in on the regular contestation and even outright rebellion that this transcontinental polity inspired. This course is an opportunity to think connectively and comparatively about historical experiences in America, India, the Caribbean and Africa among multiple other British imperial spaces. Through the prism of a changing British Empire, we trace the rise and evolution of global trade, slavery, the consumption of commodities such as sugar, tea, opium, and cotton; and new ideas about governance, sovereignty, race and identity. We conclude with a discussion of the persistence of imperial institutions, laws and power relations in shaping the world we inhabit. Students will be introduced to major debates about imperialism and colonialism and the political, economic, environmental, legal and racial underpinnings of the British Empire. Students will read a combination of primary and secondary sources every week and will develop a research paper drawn from original sources over the course of the term. Dist: INT; WCult: W.

The conversion of 'barbarian' peoples in northwest Europe between the years 400 and 1000 meant Christianity had to adapt to a different environment than the Roman and Mediterranean one in which the religion developed. The northern world was without the Roman Empire, without cities, with different languages, cultures and notions of relations between the human and divine worlds.

(the emergence of palatial culture in the Mycenaean World) to 404 B.C. (the end of the Peloponnesian War). During this period, the Greeks formed individual communities and developed unique political structures, spread their culture, language, and religion throughout the Mediterranean, invented democracy (at Athens) and enshrined these values in their art and literature. This course will cover the physical setting of and the archaic legacy to the classical city-state, its economy, its civic and religious institutions, the waging of war between cities, the occurrence and ancient analysis of conflict within the city, and the public and private lives of its citizens and less well-known classes, such as women, children, slaves, etc. Dist: SOC; WCult: W.

Particular emphasis is placed on the Roman political community: the political, religious and social factors that influenced the definition of the Roman aristocracy in the fourth century, the institutions that maintained the ascendancy of the elite, the military and political values inherent in the citizenship, the social and political mechanisms that militated against civil dissent, and the role of political values in the eventual destruction of Republican government from within.

(Octavian/Augustus' success at the battle of Actium) through the accession and rule of Septimius Severus. During this period, the Roman empire (signifying the territorial extent conquered by Roman armies and administered by Roman officials) became a political community extending throughout the Mediterranean and northwards into Europe as far as Scotland. This course considers the logic of the Roman system: the mechanisms promoting the political identity of diverse peoples as Roman, and the endurance of local traditions within the Roman world; the reasoning whereby the overarching leadership of a single individual was conceived as necessary and good, and the evolving relationship between the princeps and the Roman senatorial aristocracy with a tradition of competitive participation and self identity in politics at Rome; the definition of the Roman frontiers and the role of the army in the assimilation of non-Roman peoples.

This is not an easy task, if only because of the wide gap between the national narratives and the contradictory historical views of the conflicting.

In this course, we will ask: What are human rights, and what is their history? What is the relationship between human rights and earlier languages of rights? What counts as a human right? Can there be a universal standard for human rights despite social difference? What political and ethical possibilities have been opened for marginalized communities by the language of human rights, and what possibilities have been foreclosed by the often-singular focus on human rights as a panacea against all social ills? And finally: do our demands for human rights work to make the world a more just place, and are these demands enough? Dist: INT or SOC; WCult: NW. Major distributive (Class of 2023 and Before): INTER.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of History Undergraduate Overview History FAQs for First Year and Transfer Students How to Declare a Major or Minor in History Major Modified Major Minor Transfer Credit Policy Course Descriptions First-Year Seminars Introductory Africa, Asia, Latin America & The Caribbean (AALAC) Europe (EUR) Interregional & Comparative (INTER) United States (US) Seminars & Colloquia Independent Study & Honors Course Schedule 2021-2022 Schedule 2022-2023 Schedule 2023-2024 Schedule Course Syllabi Honors Thesis Program General Timeline Guidelines for the Class of 2022 Guidelines for the Class of 2023 Honors Theses By Year Phi Alpha Theta Honors Society Prizes After Graduation Alumni Update Research Overview Faculty Research Initiatives Dartmouth History Institute Student Research Initiatives and Resources The Dartmouth Vietnam Project History Librarian Research Funding Resources Undergraduate Research Database Student Class Projects Foreign Study News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
