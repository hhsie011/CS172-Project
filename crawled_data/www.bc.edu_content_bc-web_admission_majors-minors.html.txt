Information on choosing an undergraduate division. Applicants must designate to which of the four undergraduate divisions they are making their application: Morrissey College of Arts & Sciences, Carroll School of Management, Lynch School of Education and Human Development, Connell School of Nursing. Students are only considered for admission to the division to which they applied. Students may not change divisions following admission, but may be eligible to apply for an internal transfer to a new division after: one semester for those seeking a transfer to the Morrissey College of Arts & Sciences or the Lynch School of Education two semesters to the Connell School of Nursing two semesters to the Carroll School of Management Transferring within Boston College Matriculated students wishing to transfer from one undergraduate college to another within Boston College should complete the internal transfer form. Students applying to transfer into the Carroll School of Management, Connell School of Nursing, or Lynch School of Education and Human Development, should note that enrollment is limited in the professional schools and internal transfer may or may not be possible in any given year. Can I have a major or minor in another undergraduate division? Students frequently ask us if they can have a major in two undergraduate divisions. Students in the Carroll School of Management, the Lynch School of Education and Human Development, or the Connell School of Nursing may pursue a second major in the Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences. Students enrolled in the Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences may pursue a second major in the Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences, but cannot pursue a second major in one of our three pre-professional undergraduate divisions. Therefore, if you plan to pursue two majors in different undergraduate divisions, we encourage you to apply to the Carroll School of Management, the Lynch School of Education and Human Development, or the Connell School of Nursing. Then, if you chose to enroll at Boston College, you may declare your second major in the Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences during your freshman year. Any student at Boston College may take up to eight courses in another undergraduate division. What if I am undecided? If you are truly undecided in your area of study, but your interests lie in the arts, the humanities and/or the sciences, we recommend you submit your application to the Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences. While we do require that you select an undergraduate division before you apply to Boston College, we realize that you may be undecided about the specific major you'd like to pursue. At Boston College, with the exception of nursing and engineering, you do not have to choose your major until the end of the sophomore year. Selecting "undecided" as your major will have no bearing on your admission to Boston College. What about Advanced Placement credit? Boston College participates in the Advanced Placement program of the College Entrance Examination Board. Applicants interested in advanced placement should make arrangements to take the Advanced Placement Examinations given by the College Board in May of each year.

Morrissey College, students develop the critical and analytical skills, capacity to communicate effectively, and broad intellectual foundation that they will need for a lifetime of learning and growth in a rapidly changing world.</p> The Core Curriculum is a 15-course program required of all Boston College undergraduates. About the Core The Boston College Core Curriculum guides students on journeys of interdisciplinary inquiry to discover how to think about the world. Students explore new ways of knowing and being, helping them discern who they want to be, how they want to liveâ€”and why. BC Core Courses Complex Problems & Enduring Questions Open only to first-year students, Complex Problems and Enduring Questions courses explore compelling issues and subjects crucial to the human experience. Complex Problems Courses A six-credit course, team-taught by professors from different disciplines, that satisfies two Core requirements. It consists of three 50-minute lectures and one 75-minute lab session each week, along with a weekly meeting during the evening for reflection and integration. Enduring Questions Courses Two linked courses taught by professors from different disciplines who collaborate in choosing shared readings and other class materials. The same group of 19 students takes each class, which meets for 150 minutes per week. Four evening meetings for reflection and integration take place in the semester. Taken together, the courses are worth six credits and fulfill two Core requirements.
