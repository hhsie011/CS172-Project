WHEN SHOULD I GET INTO CONTACT WITH SOMEONE FROM ISSO? You are welcome to explore the ISSO website at any point from prospective to enrolled student status. Once a student is admitted, that is when ISSO establishes communication and provides additional information on next steps. Admissions FAQs 1. IS THE ADMISSIONS PROCESS DIFFERENT FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS? No. You will need to apply directly through either SOPHAS or HAMPCAS (for Exec MHA/MPH and Part-Time MHA only) as domestic students do. However, we may need some additional materials from you. See below for further details. 2. I GRADUATED FROM A NON-U.S. UNIVERSITY. AM I ELIGIBLE TO APPLY? Yes. We will consider applicants who complete a minimum of a bachelor's degree in outside nations. This includes the three‐year bachelor's degrees from India, all European countries, Canada, England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and Israel. We will need you to provide a WES course-by-course evaluation in order to show that your coursework is equivalent to at least a U.S. bachelor's degree. The WES evaluation should also show a breakdown of your coursetitles and cumulative grade point average (GPA) based on a U.S. 4.0 scale. Please have this evaluation submitted directly to SOPHAS or HAMPCAS. If you have questions about whether your degree is acceptable for consideration for admission, contact us for more information. 3. MY COURSEWORK WAS NOT COMPLETED IN ENGLISH. DO I NEED TO PROVIDE TOEFL OR IELTS SCORES? Yes. If you completed your bachelor's degree in a country where the primary language of instruction is not English, you must provide TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) or IELTS (International English Language Testing System) scores. The minimum scores for TOEFL is 100 (or 600 paper based) and the minimum for IELTS is 7.5. TOEFL scores should be sent directly to SOPHAS or HAMPCAS using code 5688.

For doctoral programs please confirm requirements by checking the individual department page for detailed information on the application and/or department requirements. We will require evidence of quantitative and analytical ability. To demonstrate this ability, candidates must complete all questions under the Quantitative & Analytical Assessment section within the application. You will find these questions in your application under the Program Materials section under the Questions tab If choosing to send test scores, SOPHAS accepts GRE & MCAT, whereas HAMPCAS accepts GRE scores only. All other test scores should be sent directly to the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid. 5. WHEN IS THE LAST DATE I SHOULD TAKE STANDARIZED TEST SCORES FOR MY APPLICATION? An applicant should plan to take any exams in time for the scores to reach the admissions office by the application deadline. We recommend sitting for the test at least six weeks prior to the deadline. 6. IF I AM AN UNDOCUMENTED STUDENT, AM I STILL ELIGIBLE TO APPLY? Yes. Undocumented students are eligible for the same need-blind admissions policy as US Citizens, permanent residents and eligible non-citizens, which means we evaluate admissions applications. 7.

Off-Campus Housing Assistance (OCHA) assists Columbia students and affiliates in their search for housing in non-Columbia owned buildings located in the metropolitan area.

WHAT IS THE CAREER TRAJECTORY FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS? Every international student’s situation varies and employment/post-graduate outcomes vary based on a wide range of factors. The Office of Career Services conducts a survey 6 months after graduation to determine students’ post-graduate outcomes. In the 2018 survey, 87% of international student graduates were employed and 13% were continuing their studies following graduation. Because of the timing of the survey, it is not possible to know whether students eventually received H1B visa sponsorship, or whether they were hired under OPT only. You can view the most recent report on our graduate outcomes for further reference. 2. HOW DOES THE OFFICE OF CAREER SERVICES SUPPORT INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS? The Office of Career Services provides online resources and ongoing outreach to employers to help students find jobs. Additionally, they host in-person and online events specifically for international students and alumni. There is typically an event every semester which includes a guest speaker from ISSO or an attorney to discuss post-graduate employment and visa options. Career Services does not guarantee specific employment outcomes for any student.
