National Research Council, 2012 CEOs, HR executives, college presidents, faculty, and students demonstrate remarkable consensus that problem-solving is one of the most important outcomes of a college education (Bok, 2017; Hart Research Associates, 2015; Hora, Benbow, Oleson, 2016; Passow & Passow, 2017). However, nationally, a scant majority of college seniors report that they are well-prepared to be effective problem solvers -- and fewer than a quarter of employers perceive graduating students to be competent at this key skill (Hart Research Associates). The Sheridan Center for Teaching and Learning is engaged in a number of initiatives to enhance Brown University students’ capacities for effective problem solving. These initiatives are part of the Brown Learning Collaborative and include: The Problem-Solving Fellows Program is anchored by a rigorous academic course focused on helping Undergraduate TAs be effective peer teachers in STEM courses that focus on group problem-solving. The students in UNIV 1110, “The Theory and Practice of Problem Solving,” also reflect on their own learning, in order to become highly effective problem solvers themselves. Read a Brown Daily Herald article about this course. The Problem-Solving Course Design Institute offers faculty evidence-based practices for designing problems that promote student learning. Faculty participate in a series of lunchtime workshops and they are then invited to participate in an Institute, often in partnership with graduate or undergraduate TAs. Faculty receive a $2,000 grant to implement ideas developed in the institute. Please see this page for a Sheridan newsletter on strategies for teaching problem solving.
