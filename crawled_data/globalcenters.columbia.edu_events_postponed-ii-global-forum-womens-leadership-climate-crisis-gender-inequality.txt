The struggles are coming fast, and they’re coming hard. Clearly, urgent action is needed! Everyone matters when it comes to managing the impacts of climate change, particularly those who are least able to adapt. But when we are thinking about who matters, we need to recognize that people experience the impacts of climate change in different ways. Women commonly face higher risks and greater burdens from the impacts of climate change in situations of poverty. People have different adaptation needs, depending on where they live, how they sustain their livelihoods, and the roles they play in their families and communities. There is a risk that the people with the greatest need for adaptation will be left out. We need to bring diverse voices, including those that are typically excluded, into decision making to identify the best solutions for adapting to climate change. This is the only way we can build families, communities and societies that are resilient to the impacts of climate change. On March 20, the Museu de Arte do Rio will host The II Global Forum on Women’s Leadership: Climate Crisis & Gender Inequality, an event organized by the Columbia Global Centers | Rio de Janeiro. This year's Global Forum seeks to be a transdisciplinary conversation with faculty from Columbia University and national and international leaders from the public, private and NGO sectors. This year’s forum will discuss why women are affected differently and more severely by climate change. Women are not only victims but also powerful agents of change. We are expecting great names for this Global Forum: Professor Kartik Chandran from Columbia Engineering, Professor Kristy Kelly from Columbia SIPA, Professor Belinda Archibong from Barnard College, Biologist and Serrapilheira Director, Hugo Aguilaniu, and the Head of UNOPS in Brazil, Claudia Valenzuela.

É comprovado que elas são as maiores prejudicadas pelos efeitos do aquecimento global, segundo a ONU. Apesar de correrem mais riscos e sofrerem mais com os impactos das mudanças climáticas, as mulheres não são apenas vítimas, mas também são grandes agentes de mudança. É preciso, então, dar voz às mulheres nesse momento, especialmente às que vivem em áreas de risco e pobreza. No dia 20 de março, o Columbia Global Centers | Rio de Janeiro vai organizar em parceria com o Instituto República, o Instituto Humanize e a Fundação Lemann, o II Global Forum on Women’s Leadership: Climate Crisis & Gender Inequality no Museu de Arte do Rio com o objetivo de promover uma discussão com professores da Universidade de Columbia e líderes nacionais e internacionais de setores públicos e privados, e também de organizações não-governamentais, sobre como as mulheres são afetadas de maneiras diferentes pelas mudanças climáticas e quais medidas podem ser tomadas. Vamos receber grandes nomes para o Global Forum desse ano: o professor Kartik Chandran da Columbia Engineering, a professora Kristy Kelly da Columbia SIPA, a professora Belinda Archibong da Barnard College, o biólogo e director do Serrapilheira, Hugo Aguilaniu, e the a representante da UNOPS no Brasil, Claudia Valenzuela.
