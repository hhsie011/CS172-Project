However, the challenge to providing access in the 21st century lies not in the documents but rather the methods by which they are retrieved. Through the innovations of modern technology, information can be delivered in a variety of formats. The user is therefore required to have some knowledge of their subject matter as well as a measure of proficiency with these new formats, in order to navigate to a successful inquiry.
