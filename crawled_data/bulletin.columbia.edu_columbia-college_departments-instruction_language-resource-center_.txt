Quechua is the most important and most widely-distributed indigenous language in South America, with over 10 million speakers living from the high mountains to the tropical lowlands in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina. Those who speak it call the language runa simi or runa shimi, "human speech." It was the principal language of the Inca empire and the key language of cultural interaction during the colonial era. Quechua has remained central to indigenous peoples' efforts to preserve their cultural autonomy. It has gained greater force in recent years, during which indigenous movements have swept Quechua speakers into national politics, where they have succeeded in transforming constitutions to recognize cultural diversity, making Quechua an official language of state, and successfully promoting schooling in the language. Students who satisfactorily complete Elementary Quechua I and II will be well-prepared for intensive summer study at one of many summer study abroad programs in Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia that will put them in closer contact with the indigenous world.

Romanian RMAN UN1102 Elementary Romanian II. 4 points. Provides students with an introduction to the basic structures of the Romanian language. RMAN UN2102 Intermediate Romanian II. 4 points. Prerequisites: RMAN W1101-W1102 or the instructor's permission. Further explores the grammatical and linguistic structures of the Romanian language. RMAN GU4002 Romanian Culture, Identity and Complexes. 3 points. This course addresses the main problems that contribute to the making of Romanian identity, as fragmented or as controversial as it may seem to those who study it. The aim is to become familiar with the deepest patterns of Romanian identity, as we encounter it today, either in history, political studies, fieldwork in sociology or, simply, when we interact with Romanians. By using readings and presentations produced by Romanian specialists, we aim to be able to see the culture with an "insider's eye", as much as we can. This perspective will enable us to develop mechanisms of understanding the Romanian culture and mentality independently, at a more profound level and to reason upon them. RMAN GU4003 Byzantine and Post-Byzantine Elements of Romanian Culture. 3 points. Prerequisites: Reading knowledge of Romanian and French ...The Byzantine as "post-Romantic", as "eclectic", "Oriental", in its version of localized, picturesque, intra-European Orientalism appears less explored and probably less considered of importance when trying to understand the intricacies of a culture and, by expanding it, of culture in general. Our explorations of Byzantine/Byzantinism will help us develop a subtler understanding of the mechanisms of the cultural equation West/Orient and of the cultural hierarchies....
