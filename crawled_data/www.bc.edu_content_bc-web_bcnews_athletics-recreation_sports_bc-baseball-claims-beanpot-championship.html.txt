The win marked the Eagles' 14th Beanpot Championship since the tournament's inception in 1990. Boston College (15-18), playing as the visitor on its home field, scored in the top of the first and each turn at bat between the third and eighth innings. UMass (14-10-1) used a six-run third to build a 7-2 lead before the Eagles chipped away and ultimately took the lead for good in the seventh. BC tied the game 8-8 in the sixth on a two-out, two-run single through the right side by graduate left fielder Rafe Chaumette (Sugar Land, Texas). An inning later, freshman shortstop Sam McNulty (Cambridge, Mass.) earned first base on a leadoff-hit-by-pitch and scored the go-ahead run from third on a wild pitch. The Eagles pulled away with a four-run eighth, including RBI knocks from junior second baseman Luke Gold (Ballston, N.Y.) and sophomore first baseman Joe Vetrano (Shrub Oak, N.Y.). For the game, Gold hit his sixth home run of the season and drove in three runs on a 2-for-4 day, while Vetrano went 3-for-5 with three RBI. UMass right-hander Max LeBlanc went the deepest of the two starters being lifted with one out and the bases loaded in the fourth. In his 3.1 innings, LeBlanc allowed four runs on five hits with three walks and five strikeouts. For BC, freshman RHP Luke DeLongchamp (Holden, Mass.) got through three full innings, exiting after the Minutemen scored six in the third. In total, he surrendered seven runs, six earned, on eight hits and a walk with one strikeout. The second of seven Eagle relievers was junior RHP Max Gieg (Lynn, Mass.). Gieg (2-1) got the win in a hitless-sixth; walking one and striking out another. Righty Cole Koeppel (0-1) took the loss with two runs against on a hit and two walks in one inning of work.
