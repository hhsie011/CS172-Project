The stones have been connected with elite masculinity and the values of wen (culture, literature, civility) in China, Korea, and Japan for more than a millennium. However, they are virtually unknown in the West. Barnard historian and Columbia Weatherhead East Asian Institute scholar Dorothy Ko explores the hidden history and cultural significance of the inkstone and places stonecutters and artisans at center stage, showing how collaboration between craftsmen and scholars created a new social order. 212-854-5573 [email protected] Genre Nonfiction Topic Asian Studies Contact Us [email protected] Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University Â©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
