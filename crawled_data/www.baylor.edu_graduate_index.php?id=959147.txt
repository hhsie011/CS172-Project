Here research, scholarship, and faith come together in a desire to understand the fullness of God's creation and prepare students for service and leadership. We hold fast to the claim that this commitment does not imply a lack of scholarly inquiry. Rather, it inspires the pursuit of truth and new understandings across the arts, humanities, and sciences. Our Christian commitment also calls us to demonstrate openness and hospitality. Our students come from 50 states and more than 85 countries, and that diversity means a variety of backgrounds, cultures, and beliefs. As students encounter this variety reflected in the Baylor family, they are encouraged to broaden their understanding of the rich cultural diversity found throughout the world.
