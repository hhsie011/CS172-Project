The Legorreta Cancer Center at Brown University announces the awardees of the 2022 Pilot grant competition. These 10 one-year awards were made after applications were received from throughout Brown University and affiliated hospitals. The goal of the request for pilot grant applications was to encourage collaboration and basic-translational research across the academic medical center and within the Legorreta Cancer Center’s research programs in Cancer Biology, Cancer Therapeutics, and Population Science. In addition, a special request was made for projects addressing the role of nutrition, metabolism, and cancer. Two progress reports are expected from the awardees (at 6 months and at the end of the award) who will also be invited to present updates of their research at Cancer Center venues.
