Public Health Genetics Over the past decade, dramatic advances in genomics have paved the way for a fuller understanding of the impact of genetic and environmental factors on human and population health. Such capabilities must however, be put into scientific, ethical, cultural, legal and policy context in order to realize the goal of improving population health. Through its research and training programs the Institute for Public Health Genetics (IPHG) provides the context for these discoveries and also equips graduates to tackle the complex ethical, legal, policy and social issues that are required to fully realize the benefits of these advances on population health. Our faculty and graduates are working locally, nationally and globally to ensure that health benefits from genomic knowledge are maximized and harms are minimized. Public Health Genetics Faculty Over 50 faculty represent seven schools and colleges at the University of Washington plus three partner institutions in Seattle. Graduate Programs Over the past 15 years, the IPHG faculty has established a vital and highly regarded graduate training program that remains the only one of its kind. We offer four unique interdisciplinary graduate degrees: Ph.D. and MPH in Public Health Genetics (PHG),and an MS in Genetic Epidemiology, in PHG. Students enrolled in other UW graduate programs can earn a Graduate Certificate in PHG. Each of these programs has served as the standard in integrating scientific advancements with a broader interdisciplinary dialogue. All IPHG degree programs emphasize an interdisciplinary approach to using genomic advances to improve population health. Graduates of the program will have a unique set of skills that qualifies them for a range of career options, including employment in academia, government, industry, and not-for-profit organizations.
