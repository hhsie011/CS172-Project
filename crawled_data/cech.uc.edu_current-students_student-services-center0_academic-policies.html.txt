student who performed poorly upon his or her initial enrollment at University of Cincinnati the opportunity for a fresh UC cumulative grade point average. Read more about Academic Fresh Start. FERPA Information about FERPA and Privacy The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (34 C.F.R. Part 99 - commonly known as FERPA), is the federal law that governs the release of and access to student education records. FERPA affords students certain rights with respect to their education records. Student can learn how to set up delegated access on the One Stop Student Services website. Grade Replacement Form and Policy The UC grade replacement policy allows a student to repeat University of Cincinnati coursework, with the final grade awarded for the most recent class enrollment calculated into the cumulative grade point average rather than the final grade awarded for the original class enrollment. Note: grade replacement for repeated courses is not available for graduate courses The following rules apply to the Grade replacement process: The total number of replaced University of Cincinnati credit hours may not exceed twelve (12) undergraduate semester hours. Students may repeat up to a maximum of four (4) undergraduate semester courses. If you have questions regarding whether you are taking the appropriate course please consult with an academic adviser. The number of credit hours replaced is based upon the sum of the credit hours associated with the original class. Both the original and the repeated class are designated on the student's transcript as "Approved Grade Replacement." Only the final grade awarded to the most recent class, however, is calculated into the cumulative grade point average. If the final grade received for the repeat class is a lesser grade than the final grade awarded for the original class, that lesser grade will replace the original grade in the grade point average calculation. In instances where quarter credit hours are replaced by semester credit hours, excess hours previously earned will be reported as "progress" hours and will be included as "N" hours. University of Cincinnati requires students to register and pay tuition whenever repeating a class. Instructors may not alter a previously-assigned "I" grade, or any other letter grade previously reported, by allowing students to repeat classes without registering and paying tuition for those classes. The student must complete a "Grade Replacement Application" form and submit that form to the College office offering the current class. The College will review the grade replacement request and forward approved grade replacements to the Registrar's Office for processing. This approval process ensures that the requested replacement class is academically appropriate to serve as a replacement for the original class, even if this replacement class is offered by a different UC college or within different term calendars. The grade replacement application is available from the College offices. Once the student has submitted the form, thereby identifying the intent to use the current or most recent class for grade replacement, that decision is irrevocable. In the case of a current clas, if the student withdraws from the class after petitioning for a grade replacement, that class does count towards the maximum number of classes that the student may repeat— but the "W" grade resulting from the withdrawal does not replace the final grade awarded for the original class. If the student does not submit the required grade replacement application for the specific class(es) desired, both the original class final grade and the repeated class final grade will be calculated into the student's cumulative grade point average. Grade Replacement Forms can be picked up in your Student Service Center or at the One Stop Center. Full information on Grade Replacements can be found on the Office of the Registrar's website. Graduation Requirements In order to graduate from the UC College of Education, Criminal Justice, and Human Services, a student must: Complete all required course work and program requirements. Obtain the required GPA for the respective program. Be in good academic standing; that is, not on academic or disciplinary probation or suspension. Meet the University's residency requirement.
