Need-blind admission simply means that applicants' ability to pay for their education will not be a determining factor in the admission decision. Need-aware admission means that we will examine a student's financial need at the time of admission. All first-year applicants who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents of the United States will be admitted to Brown on a need-blind basis. First year, first-time undocumented and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) applicants also will be considered under Brown's need-blind admission policy, and the University will meet 100% of their demonstrated financial need. When Admissions is deciding to admit applicants who are transfer or international students, Brown is need-aware and considers financial need in these decisions.
