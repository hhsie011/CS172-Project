Print Degree Planner (opens a new window) | Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Facebook this Page (opens a new window) Tweet this Page (opens a new window) (120 units) The degree program for the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science assumes that students have already obtained a working knowledge of personal computing fundamentals and applications, including word processing, spreadsheets, database systems, e-mail systems and presentation graphics. The curriculum begins with a three-course sequence covering concepts of programming and data structures. If students have knowledge of these topics, but do not have the courses to transfer, nor AP scores to submit, they may take the Computer Science Placement Examination to waive one or more of these courses. The test may be taken only once, and scores are valid for two consecutive semesters. Computer Science Core (45 units) Lower-Division Core (15 units) CPSC 120 - Introduction to Programming (3) CPSC 121 - Object-Oriented Programming (3) CPSC 131 - Data Structures (3) CPSC 223C - C Programming (3) or CPSC 223H - Visual BASIC Programming (3) or CPSC 223J - Java Programming (3) or CPSC 223N - Visual C# Programming (3) or CPSC 223P - Python Programming (3) CPSC 240 - Computer Organization and Assembly Language (3) Upper-Division Core (30 units) Students must take and pass the Examination in Programming Proficiency (EPP) before taking most upper-division Computer Science courses. Students who do not pass the EPP will be required to take CPSC 301 . The upper-division writing course (CPSC 311 ) must be passed with a “C” (2.0) or better.

Students seeking a degree in Engineering have been provided exceptions from some of the General Education requirements. For this reason, it is important that students take the approved G.E. courses for Engineering majors that are found in their Titan Degree Audit (TDA). Additionally, they should confirm the G.E. courses that are required within their specific programs with their respective advisers.
