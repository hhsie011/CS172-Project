Development Banks Santiago Book Presentation on the Role of Development Banks January 23, 2019 Stephany Griffith-Jones in Chile (picture: La Tercera) In January, Stephany Griffith-Jones, Financial Markets Director at the Initiative for Policy Dialogue, presented the book “The Future of National Development Banks” (Oxford University Press), which she co-edited with José Antonio Ocampo, is Director of the Economic and Political Development Concentration at the School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA). The publication, which is part of the Initiative for Policy Dialogue Series, provides an in-depth study of several key examples of these institutions based in Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Germany, Mexico, and Peru. It explores horizontal issues such as their role in innovation and structural change, sustainable infrastructure financing, financial inclusion, and regulatory rules. It provides both research and policy-oriented perspectives on how these banks can make a significant contribution to a countries' development, and analyses their roles within broader economic policy, their governance, and the main instruments they use to perform their function. Her presentation was followed by a panel discussion featuring Eduardo Bitrán, Executive Vice President of Chile’s Economic Development Agency (CORFO); Hernán Cheyre, Director of Universidad del Desarrollo’s Entrepreneurship institute; and Roberto Alvarez, Director of Economics and Management division at Universidad de Chile’s School of Economics and Business (FEN). The event was chaired by Guillermo Larraín, professor at FEN.
