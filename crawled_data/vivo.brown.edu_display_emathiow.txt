Her extensive experience includes development of polymers that are used in drug and gene delivery systems and tissue engineering applications. Following her undergraduate degree in physical chemistry and graduate school at the Weizmann institute of science, Dr. Mathiowitz trained as a postdoctoral associate with Professor Robert Langer. Dr. Mathiowitz directs an interdisciplinary laboratory that focuses on developing smart delivery systems based on bioadhesive polymers, which enhance the non- specific interaction with intestinal mucosa by inducing reversible secondary bonds and prolonging the residence time of traditional and novel oral dosage forms. She has been a pioneer in the area of nanomedicine by developing spontaneously forming biodegradable nanoparticles that in contrast to traditional thinking that mucosal barrier will prevent those particles from even passing the mucosal tissue. They can be engineered by combining hydrophobic polymers with high concentration of carboxylic acid, penetrate mucosal barriers and deliver active biologics. These nanoparticles are being used as cancer vaccines as well as for the oral delivery of peptides and proteins. In addition, she has experience with polymers, vascular grafts and micro/nanoencapsulation. What characterize her work is using combination of basic scientific concepts in interfacial biophysics and applying them to improving health. During her post doc, she submitted with Professor Langer seven patent applications of which 20 patents were issued and have subsequently been licensed to many startup companies. Her work at Enzytec generated four issued patents that form the basis for the Prolease delivery systems, injectable proteins such as growth hormones. Dr. Mathiowitz’s laboratory serves as a focal point for many inventions and as an incubator for several start-up companies. Some have licensed her technologies. Technologies she has developed have formed the foundation for the launch of four biotechnology companies, two of which Dr. Mathiowitz is a Founder: Spherics, Inc. – Founder; Perosphere, Inc. – Co-Founder. Dr. Mathiowitz was the Editor of The Encyclopedia of Controlled Drug Delivery Systems (1999) and serves as an editorial board member for several journals. In 2005, she was co-Chair of the Controlled Release Society, an international society dealing with drug delivery. To date, Dr. Mathiowitz has authored 120 publications, over 75 patents, and an edited book on bioadhesion; her work has been published in over 120 conference proceedings and abstracts. Her work at Brown University has generated about 56 patent applications of which 40 were issued as patents and have been the basis for two start-up companies and have been licensed to others.

Areas of interest include development and modeling of novel drug delivery systems, particularly for the release of insulin and growth factors; designing small-diameter vascular grafts with better compliance; development of novel bioadhesive polymers for oral delivery systems; liquid crystals as smart sensors; the use of nanoparticles as novel therapeutic delivery systems (nanomedicine), tissue markings, DNA delivery. Research Statement Research in our laboratory focuses on the interface between polymer science and biology. Areas of interest include: Tissue engineering and drug ad gene delivery; Development, modeling, and morphological analysis of novel drug delivery systems, particularly for the release of macromolecules, such as insulin and growth factors; Synthesis and characterization of biomaterials for drug delivery systems; Studies of polymer-protein interactions with emphasis in the development of bioerodible polymers involving the use of mild fabrication techniques; Developing of bioadhesive polymers for use as oral delivery systems; Design and development of modulated sensors that respond to external stimuli (e.g., light heat). All of these studies are directed to create easier and more sophisticated ways to administer therapeutic agents into the body exactly where and when they are needed. Most therapeutic peptides and proteins easily degrade when taken orally and are too unstable to withstand packing in slow-release mechanisms - they all require frequent parenteral injections. Understanding the basics of delivery systems is the key for better medications in the future. Studies of polymer-cell interaction, with particular emphasis on bioadhesion; development of the basic relationship between polymer structures (molecular and morphological) and living tissue; surface modification for enhancement of cell adhesion, an area of particular importance in the development of oral delivery systems as well as small vascular grafts. Development of theoretical and experimental procedures to process microcapsules based on biomaterials; processing of polymeric composites based on microencapsulation. A wide range of polymers and polymer blends are investigated, including interpenetrating networks, amorphous, semicrystalline, and liquid crystal polymers. Impact of work Dr. Mathiowitz has worked on developing novel bioadhesive delivery systems. These systems range from basic engineering of fundamental science to the measurement of tensile forces between tissue/materials interactions, to designing smart delivery systems including the bioadhesive novel polymers. The overall aim was to develop an effective oral delivery system for peptide and proteins based on safe, biocompatible, biodegradable, nanoparticles. Specifically developing engineered bioerodible nanoparticles that, once delivered to the mucosal tissue, are capable of penetrating the barrier, reach the epithelium, penetrate the cell and distribute to internal organs. This was achieved by developing an encapsulation technique, which first stabilizes sensitive proteins for delivery after oral delivery; the polymer then degrades thereby releasing the encapsulated protein. Additionally, nanoparticles were designed using a very specific bioadhesive coating that are capable of delivering the nanoparticles to intestinal tissue in order to enhance penetration and control the uptake. Recently, two major publication (PNAS, 2013 and JCR, 2013) from her lab demonstrated that the relatively high degree of microsphere uptake in the absorptive and non-absorptive epithelium indicates that endocytosis as well as phagocytotic mechanisms are responsible for MS uptake in the small intestine. In addition, specific bioadhesive coatings can enhance particle uptake from 6% to 70%. The results of these studies provide strong support for the use of bioadhesive polymers to enhance nano- and microparticles uptake from the small intestine for oral drug delivery. This study, using nanoparticles as penetrating delivery systems demonstrated that the non-lymphoid tissue of the absorptive epithelium could absorb MS and facilitate their biodistribution throughout the rat. These findings may potentially guide research aimed at delivering specific molecules to target organs. In addition, the methods and in vivo model that was used may also be useful to toxicologists who are interested in determining the fate or tissue distribution of microparticles, including whether such particles can cross the blood-brain barrier. In the area of microencapsulation, Dr. Mathiowitz’s work focuses on using basic concepts of polymer phase separation phenomenon to design self-assembled microspheres, vascular grafts and fiber reinforced by Solvent induced crystallization. One example is the development of Multi-walled microsphere (Nature 1994); many approaches for controlled release of drugs involves incorporation of the drug molecules into the matrix of microscopic polymer spheres or capsules. Those existing methods for preparing such micro-particles do not, however, always guarantee a constant release rate. For example, drug molecules may be trapped preferentially at the surface; they have to diffuse through an increasing thickness of polymer when the particles are non-eroding, or the surface area changes for eroding particles. In other situations, pulsed release may be required—an application to which simple polymer microspheres do not readily lend themselves. Dr. Mathiowitz’s work on how to engineer Multi-walled microspheres might solve some of these problems. She has developed a one-step process for preparing double-walled polymer microspheres based on phase separation between polymer mixtures, with an appropriate choice of interfacial tensions and evaporation rate, a spherical droplet of one polymer becomes coated with a highly uniform layer of the other. Dr. Mathiowitz’s work resulted in major publications, but also translated into two starts-up companies, Spherics, Inc. and Perosphere, Inc., which focuses their efforts on developments to improve patient compliance.
