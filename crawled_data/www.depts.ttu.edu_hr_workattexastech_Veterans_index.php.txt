An individual who qualifies for a veteran's employment preference is entitled to a preference in employment over other applicants for the same position who do not have a greater qualification. Each state agency shall establish a goal to hire, in full time positions, a number of veterans equal to at least 20% of the total number of employees at that state agency. If the total number of individuals interviewed for a position is six, or less, at least one individual who is claiming veterans preference must be interviewed. If the total number of individuals interviewed is more than six then at least 20% of the total number of individuals interviewed must be veterans preference applicants. A state agency may designate an open position as a "veterans only position" and only accept applications from veteran applicants. State Agencies may also "direct hire" a veteran for a position without advertising the job opening. Note: There is no requirement if there are no qualified veterans preference eligible individuals applying for the position. An individual who qualifies for a veteran's employment preference is entitled to a preference in employment with or appointment to a state agency over other applicants for the same position who do not have a greater qualification.
