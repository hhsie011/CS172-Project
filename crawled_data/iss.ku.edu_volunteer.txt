Want to participate..? For more information or to participate in any of these services please email ISS Programs at issprograms@ku.edu. "YOU at KU - International" Orientation Volunteer Corps “YOU at KU - International” Student Orientation is held every August and January. The International Student Services office relies heavily on the gracious help of student volunteers during the orientation and check-in processes. Information about the types of volunteer duties and volunteer sign-ups are available at a volunteer meeting, which is typically held each semester shortly before orientation begins. Speakers Service Area schools, civic clubs, community organizations, KU classes, and other groups often request to have an international student speak about their home country. Presentations can take the format of an informal question and answer session, or may be a formal program, which could include showing slides, photographs, displays, or demonstrations. Performers Service Similar to the Speakers Service, this program provides students an opportunity to demonstrate a craft, skill, or talent representative of their culture. Examples include dancing, singing, playing a musical instrument, and calligraphy. This program appeals to participants who would like to share something from their culture, but who do not feel at ease making a formal speaking presentation. Media Contact Service Newspaper, television, or radio reporters occasionally request an interview with an international student from a particular country or region of the world for the purpose of gaining insights, information, or opinions related to a news story they are producing. Topics may range from personal or cultural interests to current economic and political situations. Students who wish to participate in this service will be connected by ISS to media contacts as applicable requests are received. Classroom Collaboration Service Students occasionally request to be connected with an international student for a class assignment, for research that they are conducting, or help with surveys and projects. Topics may range from personal to cultural adjustment and beyond. Students who wish to participate in this service will be connected by ISS to the student requesting assistance.(note: this is not a tutoring service) Translation Service Translators are periodically needed to assist in communicating with new students and campus visitors who may not have the knowledge of English necessary to converse effectively. This often occurs in the case of a medical emergency. Other times, someone may just have a short letter or correspondence that they would like to have read. Participants in this service are available to assist.
