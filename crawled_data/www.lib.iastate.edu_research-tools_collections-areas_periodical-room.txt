Periodical Room Location: 298 Parks Library Current issues of approximately 2,500 of the most heavily-used journals and magazines are shelved in the Periodical Room. "Current" may include anything from the past two months to the past year, depending upon the size and frequency of the periodical. The periodicals in this room are arranged in call number order; see floorplan. (The current issues of less heavily-used periodicals are shelved in the general collection, along with older bound volumes.) Unbound issues of journals and magazines are intended for use within the room, but can be removed for scanning or photocopying. Scanners and a photocopier are located in the Learning Connections Center on Floor 1. In exceptional cases, with the permission of a full-time staff member, an unbound issue may be borrowed for two hours via the Parks Library Main Desk on Floor 1. The Periodical Room is a designated "quiet zone" within the Library. Users should refrain from eating, socializing, studying in groups, or using cell phones.
