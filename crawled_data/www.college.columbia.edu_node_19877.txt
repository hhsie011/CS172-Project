While students can continue to take all of their coursework in Fall and Spring, students may also choose to distribute their coursework over the three semesters. Faculty have therefore reconsidered their curricular offerings and have distributed their courses across the three semesters, so that students will be able to make progress toward some of their majors/concentration requirements and toward some of their Core Curriculum requirements in any term. To assist students in their planning, departments and programs have created webpages that show their curricular offerings for all three semesters of the 2020-2021 academic year. Those webpages have been compiled here so that students will be able to find them easily. Students are encouraged to contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies in each department or program with any questions that are specific to their program of study.
