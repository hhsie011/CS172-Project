Discussions will review best practices, including how cross-sector dialogue on aging and health can provide valuable insights for Chinese policy makers, researchers and business leaders. The conference aims to develop a framework that enables countries to capitalize on the social capital of older adults leading to stronger and wealthier societies. Welcome Message It is our great pleasure to invite you to The Columbia-Fudan Global Summit on Aging & Health: A Dialogue on Research, Policy, Health Systems, and Industry Initiatives. As the world encounters aging societies at an accelerating pace, it is a pivotal moment in time to establish effective health policies and programs that ensure that the elderly in China and around the globe lead healthy, productive lives and societies become stronger as a benefit of longer lives. In response to the changing aging demographics in China, this three-day conference hosted by Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health and Fudan University’s School of Public Health will provide international aging experts with a common platform to exchange information on a broad range of topics from the science of health promotion to health systems to developing Age-Friendly cities to services and products promoting health to the economic opportunities of aging societies. By sharing information from across the public, private and community sectors, we seek to enhance knowledge about how to improve the quality of life not just for older adults, but for all of society. We will be joined by leaders in science, government, and industry from organizations including the World Health Organization, Shanghai’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, The Vitality Group, U.S. Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services, Microsoft, Novartis, Lilly and the World Bank. We thank you for your interest in our conference. With your active participation, this assembly will have the unique ability to consider and debate sustainable structures and supports for our new demographic realities - and help us to shape the future of global aging societies. We very much look forward to seeing you in Shanghai October 17-19, 2016.
