Honoring Nurses - The Heart Of Healthcare Nurses Month is always a special time to celebrate our nurses, but it feels especially significant this year. You've witnessed the magnitude of COVID-19 first-hand, while continuing to advocate for the health and wellbeing of patients, families, and communities. You’ve served the nation with courage, resilience, and excellence, despite immeasurable personal sacrifice. At Baylor, we are in awe of nurses: Thank you for serving the world while advancing your career and providing for your families. Clinical Placement Support At Baylor University’s Louise Herrington School of Nursing, we strongly believe in setting our students up for success. That's why we collaborate with our students to identify clinical sites and preceptors for all clinical rotations. Additionally, clinical placement sites may be potential locations for future employment opportunities upon graduation. If you already have a placement site or preceptor in mind, we encourage you to refer them to our placement team to secure. Get your DNP-FNP guide for more information. How Does This Benefit You? How Does the Clinical Placement Process Work? What is the Placement Experience Like? What Can I Expect from My Preceptor? Securing clinical placement sites and preceptors can be a challenging and tedious undertaking. It is not uncommon for students to contact 400+ sites before a preceptor agrees. That's why at Baylor, we collaborate with online nursing students on the heavy lifting to help identify clinical sites and preceptors for all clinical rotations. We'd much rather you focus on: Coursework Developing core competencies Current personal and professional obligations Shortly after enrollment, you will be provided with a placement intake form you are required to complete that captures your competencies, experience and placement preferences. Baylor University will collaborate with you to identify a quality placement site and preceptor. While the placement team is securing sites and preceptors, you will be responsible for completing clinical clearance requirements in preparation for placement, including: Drug screening Background check Recommended vaccinations You will not be permitted to begin your placement rotations without your clearances complete. Once the sites have been approved by the School of Nursing, Baylor University will share the placement site details with you prior to placement. During the placement experience, you will have access to faculty and other resources to support you: Faculty will be available to mentor and support you throughout the rotation with specific questions about procedures, patient interactions and general proficiencies. At the end of the placement rotation, you and your preceptor will review requirements, complete surveys and officially end the placement rotation. If you have multiple rotations, you will receive the next preceptor/site details. Your preceptor is your on-site role model and will help you develop as a nurse during your clinical rotation. They will: Bridge the gap between theory and actual practice Orient you to the practice setting (key personnel, organization, and institutional policies) Help you plan clinical assignments Provide one-on-one supervision and daily feedback Review and co-sign all documentation in the clinical records How Does This Benefit You?
