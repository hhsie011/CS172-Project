I've made many lifelong friends through VSA and can't imagine what my undergrad experience would have been without it. Chris Akatsuka - EAS'16 VSA is not just a club. VSA has been my family since I stepped foot on this campus two years ago. It never fails to give me the people, the experiences, and the laughter that make life worthwhile. I think I would have been very lost if I hadn't found it when I got here. VSA gave me roots. It gave me a home.. Kara Dang - C'19 I love VSA. Ton Nguyen - C'20 I love VSA.
