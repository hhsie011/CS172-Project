The intensive program blends residential and online learning, allowing you to work full-time and apply new knowledge and skills immediately in your work settings. Robust In-Person Sessions In-person coursework is the foundation of the program. Students convene during four mandatory on-campus residential sessions with the option to attend 1 voluntary International Immersion Experience in Madrid, Spain. These relationships are the foundation for the powerful network that develops, creating an environment for a lively exchange of ideas and connections that serve as expert resources during and after the program. The coursework includes a mix of lectures, class work and group projects. Each session features specially curated events such as guest speakers, visits to leading companies, social events and expert panels that enable students to learn from Brown’s deep network of experts and industry contacts. After each residential session, time is set aside for post-work — thoughtful assignments that tie courses together and empower students to reflect on key lessons they’ve learned during in-person lectures. During this time, students do not have new lessons so it provides an opportunity for you to transition back to your professional work after a period of intense study. Dynamic Distance Learning That Caters to Your Schedule Our program is tailored for professionals with career demands, family commitments and other responsibilities that cannot be put on hold. The online classroom provides a dynamic and engaging environment where students are connected through thoughtfully curated content, meaningful coursework, challenging discussions and collaborative projects, designed to inspire strong and high-impact learning. When not on campus, students complete coursework and interact with professors and classmates through an online portal. Utilizing state-of-the-art digital tools and learning strategies designed for dynamic distance learning, the online modules are built with a brief introduction, readings or videos and interactive assignments that foster thoughtful, substantive contributions from every participant. Online learning at Brown is asynchronous — so you can log in to view the course material and complete individual and team assignments at your convenience. A Connected, Diverse Community Our program is cohort-based, meaning each student follows the same path to graduation by taking each course together. This learning format forges a collaborative community of engaged and bonded students. Through sharing their personal and professional insight, cohort members create a vibrant and authentic learning experience, while building lifelong professional networks. This multidisciplinary community of peers enables you to develop a deep understanding of new industries and broadens your vision for creating innovative and practical solutions to serious science and technology challenges.
