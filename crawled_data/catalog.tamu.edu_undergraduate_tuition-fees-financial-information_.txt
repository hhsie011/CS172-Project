Locked and Variable Rate Tuition Plans Beginning with the Academic Year 2018-2019, incoming undergraduate Texas resident students at Texas A&M University will be offered the choice between a variable rate tuition plan or a locked-rate (fixed) tuition plan allowing students and their parents to better plan and budget for college expenses. You will need to select the best option for you and your family prior to registration. Incoming Non-Resident Students will default to the Variable Rate Plan. Locked rates are guaranteed for a period of time-based on college and/or major: All majors in the College of Engineering: 4.5 years from the time freshmen first enter college after high school. Landscape Architecture: 5 years from the time freshmen first enter college after high school. All Other Majors: 4 years from the time freshmen first enter college after high school. HSC: Health Science Center (HSC) programs are upper-division programs with separate budgeted rates of two-year time frames. Upon transfer/entrance to an HSC major, you will be reassigned to their current-year locked-rate cohort for two years, or your remaining time left if you are originally in a main-campus locked-rate cohort. Once you have completed the length of time in your locked rate cohort you will automatically be moved to the current year Variable Rate Cohort Non-Resident Students: Because the State of Texas does not fund "non-resident" tuition, mandates issued by the state for the fixed-rate tuition plan do not apply to non-resident students. Therefore, non-resident students will default to the variable-rate plan. Options Variable rate plan: Tuition and fees could increase each year, using the Higher Education Price Index. Locked-rate (fixed) plan: Tuition and fees are locked into a per semester rate for 12 consecutive semesters, or 4 years, from the point of initial enrollment at a public or private institution. Entering Freshman Texas Resident Students: Will choose either the variable rate or the locked-rate (fixed) associated with their first term of enrollment.

Some majors such as engineering and architecture are offered 1-2 additional semesters at the locked rate. Where do I select my tuition rate? All incoming freshmen and admitted transfer and readmit applicants must select a rate prior to registration.

White Creek Apartment Freshmen are required to have a minimum Block Plan or the White Creek Apartment Dining Dollar Plan. All Corps of Cadets members are required to have a minimum Block Meal Plan as designated by the Office of the Commandant in order to meet requirements of mandatory March-In Meals with the Corps.

Non-Corps Upperclassmen and Off-Campus students are not required to purchase a Meal Plan, but the option is available to them to aid in budgeting and provide dining discounts.

Meal Swipes: used at the 3 all-you-care-to-eat Dining Halls on campus. One “Swipe” at the front register grants access to the entire buffet! Meal Swipes can also be converted into a “Retail Swipe” once per day. Retail Swipes allow students to get whatever they like off of the menu at select retail locations (such as Chick-fil-A) for up to $7.50. This adds flexibility and variety, however for the best value, we encourage students to use a majority of their Meal Swipes at the dining halls.

Dining Dollars are not accepted at the Barnes and Noble Café in the MSC.

Each purchase is automatically deducted from the account and can be tracked at mealplans.tamu.edu. All Meal Swipes expire at the end of every semester. Dining Dollars roll over from the Fall to the Spring Semester with the purchase of a Spring Meal Plan. Dining Dollar Only Plans will automatically roll over to the Spring semester without the purchase of a new plan. All Meal Swipes and Dining Dollars expire at the end of the Spring semester and do not roll over to the Summer or Fall. We recommend students select a plan that best fits their dining habits. Downgrade/Upgrade deadlines can be found at our website. Dining Dollars can be added in increments of $25 at any time. All Dining Plans are loaded onto the Student ID to make access and use easy. Fees for the selected Meal Plan will be added to the student’s Texas A&M University student fee, and are separate from housing fees.

Note: Penalties, late registration and late add fees also apply to students who are required to re-enroll because their registrations were canceled for nonpayment. Registrations are subject to cancellation and/or financial penalties if sufficient payment is not received before 5:00 p.m. on the semester due date. Use of Collection Agencies and Credit Bureau If amounts become past due, the University reserves the right to report the account to the Credit Bureau. This will also initiate internal collection efforts and could cause the University to employ an outside collection agency to recover the debt. If any collection efforts must take place, the student will be required to reimburse the University for the fees of any collection agency which may be based on a percentage at a maximum of 30% of the debt. All costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees the University, incur in such collection efforts. Canceling Registration Once students have registered for classes, they must select one course of action from the following to remain in good standing with the University: pay all amounts due by the specified due date; use the online registration to drop all classes prior to the first day of classes; or initiate the withdrawal process online in Howdy to begin the process to withdraw from the University after the first day of classes. Following this procedure is especially important for students who have been awarded scholarships or financial aid since the aid may automatically pay tuition and fees and cause the registration to be held even though the student has decided not to attend. Failure to request cancellation of an unwanted registration may result in grades of F or I in all courses for the semester. The student will be required to reimburse the University for scholarships and other financial aid applied to his or her account and will be held responsible for paying all fees for the semester, regardless of whether he or she attended classes. Cancellation for Nonpayment of Tuition or Fees The University reserves the right to cancel registrations not paid by their due date, or the official census date for a semester or summer term, to comply with state laws requiring payment of tuition and fees, to free the classroom spaces for other students, and to ensure the most efficient use of university resources.

Refunds will not be issued for classes dropped after the 12th class day. Any credit balance on a student account as a result of dropping courses will not be refunded until after the fifth class day. As of the first day of the semester, students may not drop all of their courses through the drop/add process, but instead must begin the official withdrawal process online through Howdy (see Withdrawal from the University below for additional information regarding the withdrawal process).

Refund Delivery Texas A&M and Heartland ECSI have joined forces to deliver financial aid and other refunds to students faster through the University’s refund delivery process. You will receive information from Heartland ECSI and the University at your new student conference and in your official University email account, which will explain the process for signing up for direct deposit of refunds. Yearbook Refunds Yearbook charges are refundable in full during the semester in which payment is made. Thereafter, no refunds will be made on orders canceled in subsequent semesters. Yearbooks must be picked up during the academic year in which they are published. Students who will not be on campus when the yearbooks are published must pay a mailing and handling fee. Yearbooks will not be held, nor will they be mailed, without payment of the mailing and handling fee. Refunds will not be made on books not picked up within one semester of the publication date. Refunds will not be made before 21 days from the date of payment. Refund policies contained herein reflect policies in effect at the time of publication and are subject to change. Dining Plan Refunds and Add/Change/Drop Policies Texas A&M University Dining’s dining plans and options listed are based on information available at time of printing and are subject to change. University Dining follows the University’s refund schedule for Tuition and Fee Adjustments. Refunds are given on the percentage basis listed for students dropping fee options or officially withdrawing from the University. Students may purchase a dining plan, change to a larger plan or add on to a plan during registration for classes through University Dining. Dining Plans and additions to the plans may be charged to the student account. Changes from a higher dining plan to a smaller dining plan or requests to cancel/drop are permitted until a date designated on dining.tamu.edu. The appropriate fee is to be paid to the Office of Student Business Services. Dining plans are valid for one semester starting with the first day of campus move-in (as designated by the Department of Residence Life) and end after the last final exam day. Check with Dining for posted dates for dining plan access. Location hours may vary during class breaks and meal availability may exclude official University holidays. Following University policy, no one is authorized to use or borrow a student’s identification card (Aggie Card); therefore, dining plans are not transferable between students. The Aggie Card must be presented to Dining cashiers for dining plan participation. If an Aggie Card becomes lost, report it immediately by calling (979) 845-4661 or go to http://myaggiecard.tamu.edu to deactivate the card. For questions and assistance, please email dining@tamu.edu (include name, UIN and instructions if dining plan related) or contact our office at (979) 845-0152. Additional information on University Dining and dining plans can be found on our website or in this catalog under Campus Dining. Residence Hall and White Creek Apartment Cancellation Policy and Refunds Any cancellation after May 1st for the Fall (regardless of when the student applies) is subject to the following cancellations penalties: 1) Prior to May 1st - no penalty, 2) May 2nd to May 30th - $500, 3) June 1st to August 14th - $1000, 4) August 15th (or after move) - 100% of Fall semester rent and 5) Students who cancel their housing assignment after the student has moved in for the Fall is subject to 100% of the Spring semester rent. Exceptions to the housing charge/refund schedule may be granted for students who graduate at the end of the Fall semester, enlist in the Armed Forces of the United States, are accepted into one of the Service Academies, or participate in a cooperative education/internship, student teaching (not in the local area), or a student abroad program for the Spring semester if written notification and verification of the aforementioned condition is received in the Housing Assignments Office, Corps Housing Office, or University Apartments Office (as applicable) by November 15th. Exceptions may also be made for students who are academically restricted from re-enrollment or who become medically unable to return for the Spring (or summer if a 12 month contract) semester if written notification is received prior to the beginning of classes for the Spring (or Summer if a 12 month contract). Withdrawal from the University Once the University has accepted payment for tuition and fees, a student is considered officially enrolled unless otherwise restricted from enrolling. Stopping payment on a check for fees or allowing the check to be returned unpaid by the bank for any reason does not constitute official withdrawal. Before classes begin, you may go online to Howdy and drop your courses and options for the semester. After classes begin, you must go through the official withdrawal process in order to cancel your registration for the semester. In Howdy, go to the Student Withdrawal channel on the My Record tab to begin the online withdrawal process. Failure to complete the withdrawal process will result in forfeiture of any tuition and fee adjustments, and course work may be recorded as incomplete or failed. Failure to follow procedures for withdrawing from the University may result in financial penalties and delays with future enrollment in the University. Once a student registers, they are responsible for the total fees assessed regardless of whether the installment option is used. Refund percentages are applied to total fees assessed and not the amount paid. This means that students who withdraw before paying all installments may, in the event of withdrawal, still owe the University. International students must visit with an advisor in International Student Services before withdrawing to determine if doing so will affect visa status. Student athletes should visit with an academic advisor in Athletics before initiating the withdrawal process. Recipients of financial assistance should visit with an Enrollment Services Advisor before withdrawing. Students receiving funds awarded by Scholarships & Financial Aid should be aware of policies regarding withdrawal from the University, which may be reviewed on our Maintaining Eligibility website. Federal regulations require a return calculation for all students who receive Title IV student assistance at a post-secondary institution of higher education and withdraw during a payment period (semester). Students withdrawing prior to the end of a payment period may be required to return disbursed funds not earned. The length of time during which it must be determined whether a return calculation is needed is up to 60 percent of the payment period. Additionally, students who do not successfully complete courses for the semester may be considered unofficially withdrawn and may be subject to a return calculation based on their last date of academic engagement. This type of activity includes, but is not limited to, submitting an academic assignment or taking an exam. All disbursed funds may be returned if attendance cannot be documented. Eligibility for state and institutional funds may also be impacted by withdrawing from the University. Drops and withdrawals are considered unsuccessfully completed coursework when determining Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) and will impact completion rate. For more information, please visit our Maintaining Eligibility website. Allocating Returned Title IV (Federal Aid) Funds that are returned to the federal government due to student withdrawal are used to reduce the outstanding balances in individual federal programs. Financial aid returned (by the University and/or the student or parent) must be allocated in the following order: Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loan Subsidized Federal Direct Loan Direct Graduate PLUS (Student) Loan Federal Direct PLUS (Parent) Loan Federal Pell Grant Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) TEACH Grant Other state or institutional financial aid programs State and institutional aid awards will be calculated using the same percentage proration used by Student Business Services to determine the amount of tuition and fees to be charged to a withdrawn student. Unclaimed Title IV Refunds According to federal law, the university is required to return Title IV funds that have not been claimed (i.e., refund check that has not been cashed) within 240 days of issue. These funds will be returned to the appropriate federal financial aid program. Tuition Rebates After Graduation Certain undergraduate students who attempt no more than three hours in excess of the minimum number of semester credit hours required to complete the degree under the catalog under which they were graduated may be entitled to a $1,000 tuition rebate after graduation. Several conditions apply and students must meet all of the specified criteria. If you wish to try and qualify for this program, please see the Office of the Registrar website for a complete set of student and institutional responsibilities and other criteria. © 2022-2023 Texas A&M University College Station, Texas 77843 Web Accessibility Site Policies Webmaster Back to top Close this window Print Options Send Page to Printer Print this page.
