If you are planning to pursue professional licensure in a state other than Texas, it is strongly recommended that you contact the appropriate licensing entity in that state to seek information and guidance regarding licensure requirements before beginning an academic program. Licensure is a formal, legal recognition that an individual has demonstrated the knowledge, skills, and abilities to practice landscape architecture without endangering the health, safety, or welfare of the public. You must meet a jurisdiction’s requirements in education, examination, and experience in order to provide landscape architectural services or to use the title “landscape architect.” The Council of Landscape Architectural Registration Boards (CLARB) works to protect the public’s health, safety, and welfare by establishing and promoting professional licensure standards. Licensure boards across the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico comprise CLARB membership For more information on professional licensure requirements in the field, please contact Hope Hasbrouck or visit UT Austin’s professional licensure disclosure page.
