If you need a permit, please go to the permit section to register and check that your vehicle's license plate information is included. Virtual parking permits expire on August 15th of each year (except for faculty/staff payroll deduction permits). Signage is posted at the entrance of all campus lots. Be sure to check signage when parking your vehicle on campus. Parking in the center of campus fills up quickly. Parking is most available in the parking garages and parking lots on the perimeter of campus. To find available parking in our parking garages, download the FSUTranz mobile app. Parking is never allowed in fire lanes, bus lanes, undesignated areas (curbs, grass, etc.), or as noted by signage.
