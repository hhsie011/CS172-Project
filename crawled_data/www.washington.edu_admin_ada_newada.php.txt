This website is our information hub to help community members with disabilities navigate the campus. On this page, you can find: a map identifying accessible routes parking locations and transportation services a way to report physical barriers encountered on campus links to campus resources related to disability access Maps and accessible routes Our access guide provides information for buildings on the Seattle campus. GO TO THE ACCESS GUIDE PRINTABLE CAMPUS MOBILITY ROUTE MAP Information available on the guide includes the following: assisted entrances multilevel entrances manual entrances routes without stairs routes navigable by wheelchair elevators accessible restrooms accessible parking areas near buildings Campus terrain overview: The UW Seattle campus is deceptively steep, rising from Lake Washington on the east to an elevation of 224 feet at the northwest corner, a rise equal to an 18-story building. Spanning approximately 15 blocks north to south and 25 blocks east to west, the University encourages wheelchair users to consider using power-operated wheelchairs on campus. Since the University is located on a sloping site, many of the pedestrian pathways have conditions that do not meet accessibility requirements for slope, duration, surface and rails. Please refer to the access guide for assistance with route planning. Individuals may need to experience a given route to determine if it is accessible for them. Parking and transportation Parking: Learn how you can access accessible parking spaces and permits on campus. Dial-A-Ride: A free shuttle service that operates between 102 designated stop locations on the Seattle campus for faculty, staff and students with either permanent or temporary mobility limitations. Transit: Learn how you can use your U-PASS with regional paratransit services.
