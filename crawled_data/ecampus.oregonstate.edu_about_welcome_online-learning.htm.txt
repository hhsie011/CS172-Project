See why we're top ranked » Online When an Oregon State degree or certificate program is offered online, that means that all or nearly all of the program’s coursework is delivered online. Online courses are asynchronous, meaning there are no scheduled class meeting times and you can access courses at your convenience. In addition to online coursework, some programs or courses may require you to: Take proctored exams Visit a local library or bookstore to find a book or other resource Conduct field work for a course assignment Pursue a program-related internship in your area Enroll in a site-based laboratory class Hybrid (online + in-person) learning These hybrid courses at Oregon State blend regularly scheduled, face-to-face classroom meetings with significant online coursework and interaction. The in-person classroom sessions emphasize engaged, active learning while the online components offer guided learning activities and interaction that add flexibility to fit your personal schedule. Some graduate-level Ecampus programs supplement online coursework by requiring attendance at a site-based location at various times during the academic year such as the OSU Portland Center at Pioneer Square. Hybrid (remote + online) learning These hybrid courses feature 50% of the class meetings held at regularly scheduled times on Zoom and 50% of the class meetings conducted asynchronously online in Canvas. The weekly class meeting times are held on Zoom and will not meet on campus. With this blended learning experience, you’ll benefit from completing innovative coursework online while satisfying your preference for real-time interaction with peers and faculty. Currently, select undergraduate business courses are being delivered in this modality. Services for students with disabilities Whether you take Oregon State Ecampus classes online or in a hybrid format, you'll have access to OSU Disability Access Services. To tap into these resources, you'll need to register your documented disability with DAS to ensure your courses are accessible and instructors are notified of your particular needs.
