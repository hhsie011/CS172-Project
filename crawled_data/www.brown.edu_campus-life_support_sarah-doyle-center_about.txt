Our center provides programs, resources, and meeting space for any member of the campus community interested in examining issues around gender, especially as it intersects with other markers of identity. Values and Vision The Sarah Doyle Center for Women and Gender strives to cultivate community across difference and inspire critical dialogue and collective movement-making. Our vision is to create a world without sexism and misogyny, as well as other oppressions. We work to assure that people who enter our doors are affirmed in their humanity and are inspired to create a more just world. Intersectionality, a term developed primarily by Black feminists, is key to contemporary feminist work, and it is key to the work of the Sarah Doyle Center. Home About Staff Who was Sarah Doyle?
