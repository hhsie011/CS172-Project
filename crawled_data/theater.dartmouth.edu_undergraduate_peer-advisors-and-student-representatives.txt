These students fill a variety of functions: advising on academic questions, communicating issues or concerns to department faculty on behalf of students, connecting students with other on- and off-campus resources, offering individual support and camaraderie. Department Representative The Theater Dept's Representative serves as a spokesperson for the major/minor community. The representative is typically a senior theater major, elected each year by a majority of their peers. The Department Rep brings concerns, suggestions, and ideas from the students to the Chair or the Director of Theater, thereby enabling the student who initially brought up the concern to remain anonymous. The Department Rep is intended to give students a way to express concerns and/or communicate with the Department in any situation where they wish to remain anonymous, or if they simply do not want to speak for themselves. The position is not in any way intended to take the place of open communication between students and faculty. The office doors of the faculty are always open, beginning with Department Chair Dan Kotlowitz. Academic Year 2021—2022 Alisya Reza '22 reza_alisya_9-2021.jpg Alisya Reza (she/her) is a '22 Theater mod. English and Cognitive Science major from Jakarta, Indonesia. In the theater department, she has primarily participated as a performer and in stage management; she also writes plays and creative nonfiction. Throughout the pandemic, she starred in several Zoom productions in the theater department, interned for the Guggenheim Museum doing archival research, creative writing, and curatorial work, and most recently made her return to in-person theater performing in a summer Frost/Dodd reading and working in Vermont on JAG Productions' Next to Normal. Alisya is very excited to dive back into in-person theater and continue connecting with other wonderful people by making art together! When she's not doing theater, you can find Alisya watching trivia quiz shows and visiting diners. Reach out to her anytime to chat about anything at all -- she's really excited to get to know you all and provide an outlet for any questions or concerns! Alisya Reza is also a SAPA Advisor (see below). 2021-22 Academic Year SAPA Advisors A SAPA is a Sexual Abuse Peer Alliance Advisor: trained, confidential peer resources available to help students who have faced issues of sexual assault and/or intimate partner violence. These students have completed a 32-hour training course in order to be able to serve as a resource for survivors of abuse (recently or in the past) and secondary survivors (friends, family, partners, etc). SAPAs are available to their fellow students for peer-to-peer support, information, and referrals. Our 2021-22 Department Rep Alisya Reza '22 is also a SAPA!

Peer Advisors The department's peer advisors are intended as an academic and social resource to fellow theater students, offering advice and sharing wisdom gained from their experiences at Dartmouth. Peer advisors are volunteers, typically theater majors in their junior year. They are available to respond to questions about the theater curriculum, major/minor requirements, navigating production credits, and more.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Theater Undergraduate Overview Equity and Inclusivity Peer Advisors and Student Representatives The Major Major Requirements Honors Thesis The Modified Major Modified Major Requirements Modifying another Major with Theater The Minor Minor Requirements Courses: offerings by term Course Descriptions Instructor Permission Courses Independent Study Off-Campus Exchange National Theater Institute For Prospective Students Onstage Overview Get Involved Performing and Auditions Directing and Designing Playwriting Stage Managing The Scene Shop The Costume Shop Now Onstage: Upcoming Productions Season Archives: Past Productions Production Photos About Student Productions Workshops and Full Productions Studio Lab: Exploring Theatrical Boundaries YourSpace: Performance Spaces for Creative Minds Student Work in the time of COVID About MainStage Productions Opportunities Overview Summer Theater Lab: Cultivating New Work VoxLab Frost and Dodd Play Festival New York Theatre Workshop Residency The VOICES Program Experiential Learning with Northern Stage Testimonials Student Funding Opportunities Kingsdale Fund Need-Based Funding Goldner Mini-Fellowship Other funding opportunities Funding for Graduate Studies Internships, Fellowships, and Graduate Programs The Neukom Institute Literary Arts Award in Playwriting Foreign Study News & Events All News and Events MainStage Production News Student Production News Honors Thesis Productions Summer Theater Lab News Faculty News Student News Visiting Artist News Alumni News People Faculty and Staff Visiting Artists Alumni Tell Us Your Story Theater and Performance Studies My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
