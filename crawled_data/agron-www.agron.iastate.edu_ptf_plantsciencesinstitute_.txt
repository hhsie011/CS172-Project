Home | Members The Center for Plant Transformation (CPT) was designed to promote research advancements and foster research and training collaborations among its members. The CPT strives to develop, adapt and/or evaluate novel technologies for plant transformation and gene expression, and to train students and post-doctoral scientists in transformation and gene expression technologies. Goals of the Center for Plant Transformation are: (1) to develop more efficient methods for producing transgenic plants that will be safe for human health and the environment; and (2) to develop gene expression technologies to ensure that transgenes are stably expressed in the desired parts of plants and under the correct conditions. The Plant Transformation Facility (PTF) of the CPT provides maize and soybean transformation services in support of hypothesis-driven plant biology research projects.
