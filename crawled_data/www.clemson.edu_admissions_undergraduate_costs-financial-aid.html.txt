Students who do not submit test scores for the 2021-22 application cycle will still be considered for merit scholarships. Incoming freshmen must apply for admission by December 1, and supporting materials need to be received by Clemson by December 31 for scholarship consideration. Merit scholarship packages are communicated to students in the spring. For more information, visit Student Financial Aid. State and Federal Need-Based Aid To be eligible for federal and state need-based aid, students need to fill out the FAFSA located at fafsa.gov by January 2. Students should start the financial aid process before the academic year in which they need assistance. South Carolina State Scholarships No separate application is required for the South Carolina LIFE Scholarship. Palmetto Fellows Scholarship applications are available through each high school in the state. Student Employment Federal Work-Study The Federal Work-Study Program provides jobs for undergraduate and graduate students who have established financial need through the submission of the FAFSA. Part-time Employment On- and off-campus jobs can be found through Clemson JobLink, which connects students with employers who are directly seeking Clemson students. Co-op and Internships Clemson’s unique University Professional Co-op and Internship (UPIC) program provides over 900 paid, on-campus internships for undergraduate students. The Michelin Career Center also facilitates off-campus internships and co-op opportunities for students. Residency Clemson makes a residency decision based on South Carolina state laws and regulations. The University is required to independently verify that all students meet these regulations to qualify for in-state tuition.
