Led by Professor Zeynep Çelik, our inaugural workshop, "Politics of Archaeology" explores the entangled relationship between antiquities and imperial powers. Of Consuls and Steamers: Material Foundations of Colonial Archaeology in Late Ottoman Iraq Erhan Tamur Erhan Tamur is a Ph.D. candidate at Columbia University and a curatorial research associate at the Morgan Library & Museum. He has worked and published on late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century art historical theory, style and ethnicity, and the politics of archaeology. His dissertation, entitled “Site-Worlds: An Account of Material Lives from Tello (ancient Girsu),” brings the art history of a Sumerian site from the third millennium BC into the present and is supported by a two-year fellowship from the Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts (CASVA) of the National Gallery of Art. Ottomans and Iranians at Ctesiphon Zeinab Azarbadegan Zeinab Azarbadegan is a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of History at Columbia University. Her dissertation focuses on the myriad ways that Ottoman Iraqi space was contested between the Ottomans, the Qajars, and the British in the late nineteenth century. She is currently working as a research assistant and co-curator for the Qattan Foundation’s Palestine from the Sky Exhibition. Her work has appeared in the Journal of Ottoman and Turkish Studies (JOTSA), Jerusalem Quarterly, and the journal of Philological Encounters. The British “Antiquities Threshold” and the Muted Legacy of Ottoman Legislation Dotan Halevy Dotan Halevy is a Ph.D. Candidate in Columbia University Department of History. His research focuses on the culture, society, and environment of the late and post-Ottoman Middle East. Dotan's doctoral dissertation entitled "Stripped: Ruination, Liminality, and the Making of the Gaza Strip 1840-1950" (expected July 2021) is a study of the long "stripping" of the Gaza borderland from its historic economic and political centrality.
