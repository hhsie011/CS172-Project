The program offers an intense and prolonged immersion in research to students in six departments under the guidance of one of fifteen faculty mentors in the College of Science and the College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences. The program has supported six exceptional undergraduate researchers over the course of three years, 2019 to 2023. Each Scholar received funding from the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation for 15 months of laboratory research (two summers and the intervening academic year). Two Beckman Scholars were selected in 2019: Shaoni Dasgupta, working with Dr. Kerry Smith and Nathan Matzko, working with Dr. Michael Sehorn, both in the department of Genetics and Biochemistry. Shaoni and Nathan and their advisors are profiled in this video. Shaoni was named as a Goldwater Scholarship recipient in 2020. Three new Beckman Scholars were selected in 2020 : Luke Broughton, working with Dr. Julia Brumaghim in the department of Chemistry; Lauren Davis, working with Dr. Melinda Harman in the department of Bioengineering; and Hayden Tharpe, working with Dr. Mark Blenner. Lauren is profiled in these videos on YouTube and Instagram.
