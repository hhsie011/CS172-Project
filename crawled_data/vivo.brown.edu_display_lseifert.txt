Full Text Research Research Overview Professor Seifert's research interests include 17th-century literature, gender and sexuality studies, cultural studies, and comparative approaches to folklore and the literary fairy tale. He is the author of Fairy Tales, Sexuality, and Gender in France, 1690-1715: Nostalgic Utopias (1996) and of Manning the Margins: Masculinity and Writing in Seventeenth-Century France (University of Michigan Press, 2009). He has co-edited volumes on French and Francophone masculinities with Todd Reeser; on fairy tales by 17th-century French women with Domna Stanton; on gender, sexuality, and friendship in early modern France with Rebecca Wilkin; and on 19th-century decadent fairy tales with Gretchen Schultz. He has also edited a special issue of Marvels and Tales on "Queer(ing) Fairy Tales." Research Statement Lewis Seifert's teaching and research encompass two broad areas: seventeenth-century French culture and folk- and fairy-tale narratives from across the Francophone world. He has focused in particular on questions of gender and sexuality, both theoretically and historically, and he has also explored problems of early modern authorship, political discourse, and friendship. In his first book, Fairy Tales, Sexuality, and Gender in France, 1690-1715: Nostalgic Utopias (Cambridge UP, 1996), he explored reasons why the fairy tale genre appeared in late seventeenth-century France and in particular its ambivalent representations of femininity, masculinity, and (hetero)sexuality. He argues that the "marvelous" universe of the conte de fées is a throwback to earlier fictional forms that often allows for a critique of the past and an articulation of yet-to-be conceived identities and relations. His second book, Manning the Margins: Masculinity and Writing in Seventeenth-Century France (University of Michigan Press, 2009), investigates the struggle between the expectation of dominance and the risk of subservience and marginality that emerges in such seventeenth-century masculine types as the honnête homme, the male salon denizen, the sodomite, and the transvestite. His current research is centered around two projects. A book project, provisionally titled Unsettling Mischief: Tricksters and the Reordering of Nature in the Francophone Atlantic World, explores how tricksters from 17th-century France to West Africa and the Caribbean in the 20th and 21st centuries prompt a reframing of the basic principles by which cultures organize themselves and conceive of their relation to the natural world. His other project, with Pierre-Emmanuel Moog, is a new critical edition and translation of the fairy tales of Charles Perrault. Seifert has co-edited several volumes: (with Gretchen Schultz) Fairy Tales for the Disillusioned: Enchanted Stories from the French Decadent Tradition. Princeton: Princeton UP, 2016; (with Rebecca Wilkin) Men and Women Making Friends in Early Modern France. Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2015; (with Domna Stanton) Enchanted Eloquence: Fairy Tales by Seventeenth-Century French Women Writers. The Other Voice in Early Modern Europe, The Toronto Series, 9.
