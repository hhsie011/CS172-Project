Our scientists peer at individual molecules operating where one neuron sends signals to the next. We trace networks of interconnected neurons to map the neural circuits responsible for different brain functions. And we tap into those circuits, tracking dynamic chemical and electrical signals to understand how our brains detect, integrate and transform stimuli into action.
