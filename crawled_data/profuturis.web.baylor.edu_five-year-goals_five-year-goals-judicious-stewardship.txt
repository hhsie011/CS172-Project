In the broadest and most basic sense, our distinctly Christian mission demands excellence in all things. Meritorious characteristics of life within each aspect of our community will contribute in profound ways to the enrichment experienced by students - as well as by faculty and staff - during the time they spend at the University. Pro Futuris calls Baylor to be a place where the value generated by and derived from a Baylor experience is supported through a diversity of revenues, prudent management of our resources, and the pursuit of outstanding quality and character in every area of University life. Over the course of the Five-Year Goals, we will: Improve access and affordability: shift total operating budget expenditures to be 5% less undergraduate tuition dependent by 2018/2019 increase the endowment per undergraduate student to $110,000 partner with 10 community colleges, subject to criteria and evaluation of academic quality, to reduce the overall cost of Baylor's education for transfer students establish a fixed four-year tuition rate and fixed transfer tuition rate execute operational efficiencies and risk reduction without compromising educational quality Promote the second phase of "From Here We Build" campaign for $320 million: raise $100 million for scholarships and faculty support raise $50 million for student life enhancement (Career and Professional Development, Global Engagement, Leadership Development) raise $50 million for academic and programmatic development raise $120 million for capital-related projects (McLane Alumni Events Center, LHSON, etc.) Read more about Aspirational Statement 5: Judicious Stewardship Pro Futuris Five Year Goals: 2014-2018 Judicious Stewardship About Pro Futuris The Strategic Vision: Launched May 2012 Back Letter From the President A Name for Our Strategic Vision A Symbol for Our Strategic Vision Baylor's Distinctive Role Baylor's Commitments Back Mission Statement Foundational Assumptions Core Convictions Unifying Academic Themes Institutional and Environmental Context Back Developing Our Strategic Vision Overview of Progress During Baylor 2012 The State of Higher Education Baylor's Financial Position The Planning Process Strategic Vision: Pro Futuris Back One: Transformational Education Two: Compelling Scholarship Three: Informed Engagement Four: Committed Constituents Five: Judicious Stewardship Pro Futuris Downloads Five Year Goals: 2014-2018 Back Transformational Education Compelling Scholarship Informed Engagement Committed Constituents Judicious Stewardship Progress - July 2017 Illuminate: 2018 - 2022 General Information Academics & Research Administration Admissions Gateways for ...
