The Hilarious World of Depression is a series of frank, moving, and, yes, funny conversations with top comedians who have dealt with depression, hosted by veteran humorist and public radio host John Moe. Join guests such as Maria Bamford, Paul F. Tompkins, Andy Richter, and Jen Kirkman to learn how they’ve dealt with depression and managed to laugh along the way. The Hilarious World of Depression is not medical treatment and should not be seen as a substitute for therapy or medication. But it is a chance to gain some insight, have a few laughs, and realize that people with depression are not alone and that together, we can all feel a bit better. Mental Illness Happy Hour Comedian Paul Gilmartin hosts a weekly, hour-long audio podcast consisting of interviews with artists, friends and the occasional doctor. The show is geared towards anyone interested in or affected by depression, addiction and other mental health concerns which are so prevalent in the creative arts. Paul’s hope is that the show and this website will give people a place to connect, smile and feel the return of hope. The biggest myth about mental illness is that you are alone and there is no help. This site is not intended to replace the need for medical diagnosis. Please leave that to professionals. It’s not a doctor’s office.

Not Another Anxiety Show A podcast for all: from the always anxious to the occasionally overwhelmed to the painfully panicked. Join your host Kelli Walker – registered nurse, Certified Health and Wellness Coach, and former agoraphobe – on an anxiety adventure. Learn what anxiety really is, why the best of us can get caught in its web, and how to move past its sticky grip. Casual conversations with Kelli and other experts will include more than reciting daily affirmations or following "five simple steps" to overcome anxiety. Instead, you'll get practical tips, resources, and guidance while gaining a down-to-earth and deeper understanding of what it means to be human – an easily overlooked part of truly moving past anxiety. No experience in deep breathing, chakra alignment, or pescetarianism required. Listen in for a good laugh and start feeling a little more human today.
