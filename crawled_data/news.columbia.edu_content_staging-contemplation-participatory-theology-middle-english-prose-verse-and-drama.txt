Scholars today generally consider it to have been the highest form of devotional prayer, practiced only by the most devout monks, nuns, and mystics. Eleanor Johnson, associate professor of English and comparative literature, argues instead for the pervasiveness and accessibility of contemplative works to medieval audiences. She paints late Middle English contemplative writing as a broad genre that operated collectively and experientially and traces how it played a crucial role in the exploration of the English vernacular as a literary and theological language in the 15th century. 212-854-5573 [email protected] Genre Nonfiction Topic Religion Contact Us [email protected] Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University Â©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
