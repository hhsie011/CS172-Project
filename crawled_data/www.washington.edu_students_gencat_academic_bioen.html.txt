Students will utilize knowledge from the biological sciences as well as mechanical, chemical, electrical, and computer engineering in order to invent the future of medicine through novel, innovative, and cost-effective solutions. This program of study leads to the following credentials: Bachelor of Science in Bioengineering degree Bachelor of Science in Bioengineering degree: Data Science Bachelor of Science in Bioengineering degree: Nanoscience and Molecular Engineering Admission Requirements Engineering Undeclared Students See section on College of Engineering Admission for additional details on Direct-to-College admission and placement process for Engineering Undeclared students. The deadline to submit a request for placement in an engineering major occurs annually on July 1. If the number of Engineering Undeclared students requesting the major exceeds the department capacity for such students, a matching process is implemented. Factors considered include performance in prerequisite courses, quality of overall academic record, content of personal statement, applicable work or extracurricular activities, and other special circumstances as disclosed by the applicant. Core courses within the department form a seven-quarter curriculum designed to start spring quarter of the sophomore year. Because the curriculum is cohort-based and all students start and proceed at the same pace, Engineering Undeclared students admitted to Bioengineering after their first year are expected to start the curriculum in spring quarter of their second year. Engineering Undeclared students in good standing with respect to the continuation criteria described below may request placement into an engineering major after completion of minimum requirements as specified below: ENGR 101 English composition MATH 124, MATH 125, MATH 126 (or MATH 134, MATH 135, MATH 136) CHEM 142 (or CHEM 143 or CHEM 145) PHYS 121 (or PHYS 141) One course from the list on this website. Students are encouraged to choose a course required for graduation in the majors they are considering. Minimum 2.0 grade in all courses used to satisfy placement requirements Minimum 2.50 cumulative GPA in courses used to satisfy placement requirements Minimum 12 credits as a matriculated UW student. Some departments require more credits. See department websites for details. Students in good standing who do not meet the placement requirements by July 1 will be placed into a major on a conditional basis pending the completion of all placement requirements and readiness to begin the bioengineering core sequence of courses in the following spring quarter. Additional advising resources will be available to these students. See section on College of Engineering Continuation Policy for Engineering Undeclared Students for additional details. Current UW Students and Transfer Students The department follows a cohort model beginning in spring quarter. Transfer students, current UW students without Engineering Undeclared status, and current UW students with Engineering Undeclared status who are eligible to begin the bioengineering core sequence of courses in their first spring quarter may apply. Admission is competitive. Core courses within the department form a seven-quarter curriculum designed to start in the spring quarter. Because the curriculum is cohort-based and all students start and proceed at the same pace, students admitted to Bioengineering are expected to start the bioengineering curriculum in spring quarter immediately following admission. Admission is for spring quarter only.

Approved Engineering Electives (5 credits) Minimum 2.0 grade in each bioengineering course applied to the major Back to Top Additional Information Student Outcomes and Opportunities Learning Objectives and Expected Outcomes: Bioengineering students learn to apply engineering synthesis and analysis to biological problems and to glean design principles from nature to solve clinical challenges and create biomedical devices and materials. The department's goal is to prepare students to be leaders and innovators in improving human health and healthcare, most commonly by entering graduate school, medical school, or the growing biomedical industry. The degree program culminates in the year-long senior capstone project, in which students develop their knowledge and skills by doing cutting-edge research in faculty labs working with clinical or industry mentors to generate devices that address medical challenges. The Bachelor of Science in Bioengineering degree program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, www.abet.org. This accreditation means the B.S. degree addresses specific learning outcomes and can be counted toward a Professional Engineer certification for certain industry careers. Associated learning outcomes include an ability to apply principles of engineering, biology, human physiology, chemistry, calculus-based physics, mathematics (through differential equations), and statistics, to solve bio/biomedical engineering problems, including those associated with the interaction between living and non-living systems, to analyze, model, design, and realize bio/biomedical devices, systems, components, or processes, and to make measurements on and interpret data from living systems. Additional learning objectives and other details can be found on the department website. Instructional and Research Facilities: The department is housed in the Foege North building. Amenities include instructional laboratories, computing laboratories for class instruction and student use, a student work room, a seminar room, and meeting space. Department administration, faculty offices, and many of the faculty research labs are also located in this building. Other laboratories are located in the School of Medicine and South Lake Union research facilities. The department also hosts UWEB (University of Washington Engineered Biomaterials) and collaborates in the UW Center for Neurotechnology, Center for Translational Muscle Research, Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, and other research centers in computational bioengineering, neural engineering, biomaterials and regenerative medicine, molecular and cellular engineering, technology for expanding access to healthcare, bioinstrumentation, medical imaging and image-guided therapy, and systems, synthetic, and quantitative biology. Honors Options Available: Departmental Honors (see adviser for requirements), Interdisciplinary Honors (see University Honors Program), and College Honors (completion of both Interdisciplinary Honors and Departmental Honors). Research, Internships, and Service Learning: Many undergraduate bioengineering students participate in internships, including the College of Engineering Co-op Program. The BioEngage industry collaboration program provides networking opportunities to pursue internships and employment. Seniors are welcome to participate in the graduate technology commercialization courses and UW business competitions such as the Holloman Health Innovation Challenge. Department Scholarships: Contact adviser for more information. Student Organizations/Associations: Bioengineering students participate in many campus-wide organizations such as the UW chapter of iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machine). The department hosts the UW chapter of the Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES), which organizes professional and social events that support student wellness and preparation for medical school, graduate school, and industry. The Bioengineers Without Borders (BWB) organization, which is unique to the UW, generates solutions for global health challenges. Graduate Programs Bioengineering N107 William H.
