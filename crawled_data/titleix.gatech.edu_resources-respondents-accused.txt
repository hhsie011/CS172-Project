Having a support person or an advisor can help you navigate the process and provide emotional support. An advisor may be anyone of your choosing, including an attorney. Your advisor may be present at meetings and proceedings that you attend during the investigation and resolution process, but may not participate directly. In certain types of sexual misconduct hearings, however, the advisor is permitted to ask questions of the other party and that party's witnesses. The additional resources listed below are also available to help you through the process. When seeking support from any of these resources, you should confirm whether your communications with that resource are legally confidential.
