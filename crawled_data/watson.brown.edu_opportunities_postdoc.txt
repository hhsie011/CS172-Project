The making of the modern world was in part constituted by the historical injustices of colonialism and racial slavery. These injustices have played out in contemporary phenomena such as apartheid, displacement, discrimination, and other forms of domination in which substantial portions of the human population have been deprived of rights, economic opportunity, social mobility, or even their very lives. All these forms of historical and contemporary wrongs have generated a plethora of scholarship around different forms of justice: reparative, redistributive, transitional and, of course, reparations. However, how do forms of historical and contemporary injustices shape practices of democracy? Are forms of democracy adequate responses to historical and contemporary forms of injustice? This joint collaborative project between the Watson Institute of International and Public Affairs and the Center for the Study of Slavery and Justice seeks a two year post-doctoral fellow who will anchor the project. The candidate should be trained in any social science field and have an interest in questions of human rights as well as theories of democracy. The candidate should also be interested in the ways in which historical injustices have worked in different countries, and should have wide knowledge about the different practices which challenge historical and contemporary wrongs. The candidate would be required to teach one course per year, and should be ready to work in collaboration with the Watson and the CSSJ to create a public program around these issues. More Information Postdoctoral Research Associate in Climate Solutions 2021-2023 Brown University invites applications for a two-year Postdoctoral Research Associate in Climate Solutions at the Watson Institute for International & Public Affairs. Two positions are available, associated with the Climate Solutions Lab and the William R. Rhodes Center for International Economics and Finance. We seek scholars to help us address one of two major topics: climate and trade, and financing decarbonization. The first position will lead task forces looking at questions like how climate should fit into the United States’ China strategy, and how US policymakers can work with the EU on issues such as carbon tariffs and border adjustment measures. The second position will focus on how state sand market actors can work together to finance decarbonization, with a specific focus on ameliorating the distributive politics inherent in such a transition. There are no teaching responsibilities for these positions. The selected candidate will devote 50 percent time to Watson’s projects, under the supervision of Professors Jeff Colgan and Mark Blyth, and 50 percent time to his or her own (climate-related) research projects.
