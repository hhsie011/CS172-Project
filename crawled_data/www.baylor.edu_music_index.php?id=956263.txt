The audition is the most important factor in determining whether or not a student will be accepted as music major. Please remember, students must apply to both Baylor University and the School of Music. We highly encourage you to email our piano faculty to set up a virtual visit or sample lesson. The audition committee consists of keyboard faculty members. Memorization is required. Although not needed for the audition, applicants should have studied major/minor scales and arpeggios, sight reading, accompanying, harmonization, and transposition as preparation for these programs. All candidates are welcome to communicate directly with Dr. Brian Marks with questions regarding their application, repertoire, audition date, etc. Undergraduate Audition Requirements B.M. in Piano Performance or Piano Pedagogy - three contrasting solos prepared by memory are required: a selection from the Baroque Era, such as a prelude and fugue by J. S. Bach or a sonata by Scarlatti the first or last movement of a major sonata by Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, or Schubert one substantial composition from either the 19th or 20th Century B.M.E. in Music Education with Piano Concentration Prepare at least three contrasting pieces by memory similar to those suggested for B.M. in Piano Performance (above).

B.A. in Music (Applied Track with Piano Concentration) Prepare at least three contrasting pieces by memory similar to those suggested for B.M. in Piano Performance (above). Scholarships Keyboard scholarships are based upon outstanding accomplishment in performance, potential for artistic development, and commitment to a career in music. Scholarships are awarded to piano majors in the Bachelor of Music degree programs only (e.g., B.M., B.M.E.). Qualifications are determined by either a campus or recorded audition, and awards are announced by letter in late March or early April. All undergraduate students who apply and audition are automatically considered for a keyboard scholarship. Graduate Audition Requirements M.M. in Piano Performance An audition program, at least 30 minutes in duration, of memorized solo repertoire from three style periods is required for admission in Performance. The program should include at least two major works, such as a complete sonata, substantial variation set, major single-movement work, etc. M.M. in Piano Pedagogy and Performance An audition program, at least 20 minutes in duration, of memorized solo repertoire from three style periods is required for admission in Pedagogy and in Church Music. The program should include at least one major work, such as a complete sonata, substantial variation set, major single-movement work, etc. All Piano Pedagogy candidates are welcome to communicate directly with Dr. Lesley Sisterhen McAllister with questions regarding their application, repertoire, audition date, etc. M.M. in Church Music with Piano Concentration An audition program, at least 20 minutes in duration, of memorized solo repertoire from three style periods is required for admission in Pedagogy and in Church Music.

The option of a video performance may be approved when distance to the audition would be a hardship. When the audition is by video, the student must present a live audition before a designated faculty committee during the first semester of residence in order to be fully accepted into the program. The audition will require sixty minutes of solo repertoire representing the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries and will include at least two major works and two virtuoso etudes from the literature. The audition committee may choose from the repertoire prepared.
