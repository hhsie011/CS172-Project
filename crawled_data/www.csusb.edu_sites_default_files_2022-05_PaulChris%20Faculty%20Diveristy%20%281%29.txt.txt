[ Music ] >> Diversity expands student education by making them be more creative and problem solvers. And they achieved these two goals because they interact with students that have different life experiences. What it means to have diverse in the classroom is that we are preparing our students for diverse workplace. What this means also is that we are preparing our students to know how to interact with other people that have different cultural and traditional values. Diversity to me means a lot. It means that my values will be appreciated. It also means that I'm required to collaborate with other people from different ethnic and social background. It also means that my opinion and suggestions to ideas or issues will be valuable. And then that really affected my choice to come to Cal State San Bernardino, because here on campus, we celebrate diversity. [ Music ]
