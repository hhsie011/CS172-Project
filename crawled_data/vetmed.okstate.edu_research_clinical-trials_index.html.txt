Brock Memorial Library Animal Use in Research & Teaching Clinical Trials Clinical trials help bring bench research to practical application. These trials allow research based discoveries to be applied to a wider group of patients with the potential to improve the health and welfare of animals. Results of clinical trials add to medical and surgical knowledge regarding the care of animals. In clinical trials, patients receive specific interventions determined by the research protocol. These interventions may compare a new medical approach to a standard one, to a placebo that contains no active ingredients, or to no intervention. The goal of the clinical trial is to compare the efficacy and safety of the intervention by measuring specific outcomes in the patient.
