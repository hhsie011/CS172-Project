Request Records The Government Records Access and Management Act (GRAMA), Utah Code section 63G-2-101 et seq., is Utah's open records law and the state equivalent of the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Through GRAMA, the public may request access to certain records maintained by the university. GRAMA requests are coordinated through the Office of Legal Affairs. Submit a records request. Crisis Communications USU sends important information about crimes on campus, threats to safety, and emergencies through USU Alerts. All alerts are sent through USU's campus alert system, which includes text to cell phones, email, and push alerts through the Utah State Safe App. Those who are not members of the university community may sign up for text alerts or download the app to receive the same alerts.
