These ceremonies are initiated and led by student organizations with administrative support from an affinity graduation ceremony committee and key partners across campus. These efforts recognize and celebrate the accomplishments of graduates from historically marginalized and underrepresented communities. They provide an opportunity for graduates to honor those who have helped them achieve their milestones while centering their cultural traditions and values.
