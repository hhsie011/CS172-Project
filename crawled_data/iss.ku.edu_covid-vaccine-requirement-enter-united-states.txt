The CDC webpage Requirement for Proof of COVID-19 Vaccination for Air Passengers lists the acceptable vaccines. Before boarding a flight to the United States, you are required to show a negative COVID-19 test result taken no more than 1 day before travel. The CDC webpage Requirement for Proof of Negative COVID-19 Test or Documentation of Recovery from COVID-19 Meaning of "fully vaccinated" The CDC webpage Requirement for Proof of COVID-19 Vaccination for Air Passengers describes the meaning of "fully vaccinated" for this purpose: You are considered fully vaccinated: 2 weeks (14 days) after your dose of an accepted single-dose COVID-19 vaccine. 2 weeks (14 days) after your second dose of an accepted 2-dose series COVID-19 vaccine; or 2 weeks (14 days) after you received the full series of an “active” (not placebo) COVID-19 vaccine in the U.S.-based AstraZeneca or Novavax COVID-19 vaccine trials 2 weeks (14 days) after you received 2 doses of any “mix-and-match” combination of accepted COVID-19 vaccines administered at least 17 days apart* If you don’t meet these requirements, you are NOT considered fully vaccinated. *CDC has not recommended the use of mix-and-match COVID-19 vaccine primary series. However, such strategies are increasingly common in many countries outside of the United States. Therefore, for the purpose of interpreting vaccination records for travel to the United States, CDC will accept combinations of accepted COVID-19 vaccines." Travel Assessments Find out if you can board a flight to the United States using a travel assessment on the CDC webpage.
