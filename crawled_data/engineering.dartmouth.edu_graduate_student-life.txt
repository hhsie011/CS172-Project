Students take pride in balancing the challenges of earning an engineering degree with the benefits of enjoying other interests along the way. Beyond Thayer's walls, engineering students have access to all that Dartmouth and the surrounding communities have to offer. (To find out more, see the I'm an Engineer and... video playlist.) On This Page Graduate Student Life Student Spotlight Sports & Activities Housing & Apartments Graduate Student Life Student Groups & Councils A variety of student groups offer opportunities to get involved and make a difference outside the classroom, and several student councils foster communication and participation throughout the School. In addition, the Dartmouth Society of Engineers (DSE) Student Chapter organizes outreach activities including exam study sessions and intramural sports teams. The Great Outdoors Hanover and the surrounding area offer opportunities for outdoor adventure and recreation in all seasons. The Connecticut River is just one of many nearby rivers and lakes, and you can take advantage of opportunities for rock climbing, biking, camping, and hiking, including on the Appalachian Trail, which passes directly through Hanover. The winter holds many possibilities too, with nearby skating, sledding, alpine skiing at the Dartmouth Skiway and at many other top-rated ski resorts of NH and VT, and cross-country skiing in open settings or along serene, wooded trails. Arts & Culture The Hopkins Center and the Hood Museum of Art are centers for the performing, visual, and creative arts at Dartmouth. The Hopkins Center, affectionately known as The Hop, is a multidisciplinary academic and extracurricular visual and performing arts center. Students can use the Hop's woodworking and jewelry workshops and participate in a wide range of musical ensembles. The Hop serves northern New England and beyond as a cultural center, presenting some of the world's finest artists and ensembles in music, film, theater, and dance. The Hood Museum comprises ten public galleries, classrooms, research and conversation facilities, and is a permanent home for Dartmouth's fine art collections.
