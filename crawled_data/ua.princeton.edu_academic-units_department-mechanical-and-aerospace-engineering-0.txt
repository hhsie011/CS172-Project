Program Information Information and Departmental Plan of Study The Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering recognizes that students have a variety of career objectives. Some enter industry directly in an engineering capacity and some continue their studies in graduate school in engineering or applied science. Other MAE graduates pursue careers in business, law, or medicine. The department offers sufficient flexibility to students planning an undergraduate program that meets any of these objectives and guides them to build fundamental knowledge in key engineering disciplines and develop practical skills in problem-solving and design. The subjects of solid and fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, dynamics, control systems, materials, and applied mathematics, combined with the experience of engineering design, are core to the department's curriculum. Both the mechanical and aerospace engineering programs are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET. General Requirements Requirements for study in the department follow the general requirements for the School of Engineering and Applied Science. In addition, the following four courses and one laboratory are normally completed by departmental students before entry into the junior year. Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Programs 206 Introduction to Engineering Dynamics 221 Thermodynamics 222 Mechanics of Fluids 223 Modern Solid Mechanics 224 Integrated Engineering Science Laboratory Some of the above can be satisfied by equivalent courses. For example, students with an interest in structures may take CEE 205 Mechanics of Solids in place of MAE 223; and students with an interest in engineering physics may take PHY 205 Classical Mechanics or PHY 207 Mechanics and Waves in place of MAE 206. Each departmental student will be introduced to instrumentation and computer-based data acquisition in the MAE 224 laboratory. Departmental Requirements In order to qualify for graduation each departmental student must satisfactorily complete the following: One upper-level course involving applications of mathematics: MAE 305 Mathematics in Engineering I Eight upper-level departmental courses A. Among these are engineering science courses selected from the following list: Dynamics and Control 331 Aircraft Flight Dynamics 341 Space Flight 433 Automatic Control Systems (required for all students) 434 Modern Control Fluid Mechanics/Thermal Sciences 328 Energy for a Greenhouse-Constrained World 335 Fluid Dynamics 336 Viscous Flows 423 Heat Transfer 426 Rocket and Air-Breathing Propulsion Technology 427 Energy Conversion and the Environment: Transportation Applications 552 Viscous Flows--Viscous Flows and Boundary Layers Materials/Structures 324 Structure and Properties of Materials MSE 301 Materials Science and Engineering CEE 312 Statics of Structures CEE 361 Structural Analysis and Introduction to Finite-Element Methods B.

The remainder of the 36 courses required for the B.S.E. may be chosen from a wide variety of options. At least seven of these must be in the humanities or social sciences, as required by the School of Engineering and Applied Science. The rest of the courses may be used to pursue a specialty within the department, combine studies with another department, follow one of the topical program curricula, or further expand studies within the humanities or social sciences. Each student's program is planned individually in consultation with the class adviser. Suggested plans of study for each of the programs in the department are available from the director of undergraduate studies. Program of Study The department offers two programs of study: mechanical engineering and aerospace engineering. These programs draw on courses in the underlying fundamental sciences and mathematics during the first year, which lead to broad introductory engineering science courses during the second year, where students are introduced to the creative application of this knowledge to the solution of technical problems. Aspects of engineering design, the process of devising a system to meet a need, are introduced to the student through laboratories in the second year and continue through the upper-level years. During the third year all students take a two-semester design sequence as well as further engineering science courses dealing with analysis and application in the areas of energy sources and power systems, structures, aerodynamics and flow systems, and the dynamics of machines and their control. The introduction of design during the third year, combined with further depth in engineering science, enables students to undertake realistic design projects during their senior year. The programs are designed to prepare the graduate for an engineering career and give him or her the ability to continue to grow professionally. Mechanical Engineering This program deals with the analysis and design of machines, their motion, power sources, and control. The curriculum is based on dynamics, thermodynamics, and the study of the structure and behavior of fluid and solid materials; it is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET. Students are exposed to the process of engineering design through 321 Engineering Design, 322 Mechanical Design, or 412 Microprocessors for Measurement and Control, and one additional design elective, which is fulfilled by Senior Thesis, Senior Independent Work or Senior Project. All mechanical engineering students must take: 423 Heat Transfer or 335 Fluid Dynamics or 336 Viscous Flows; and 433 Automatic Control Systems and a mathematics elective normally selected from the following list: Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering 306 Mathematics in Engineering II Operations Research and Financial Engineering 245 Fundamentals of Engineering Statistics 307 Optimization 309 Probability and Stochastic Systems 363 Computing and Optimization for the Physical and Social Sciences Mathematics 330 Complex Analysis with Applications 393 Mathematical Programming Computer Science 302 Mathematics for Numerical Computing and Machine Learning 340 Reasoning about Computation Physics 403 Mathematical Methods of Physics The dynamics and controls option is recommended for students desiring an emphasis on the study of the motion and control of vehicles and machines. The design option is recommended for students desiring an emphasis on mechanical engineering design. The departmental requirements (II. A. above) for both of these options are normally satisfied by a selection of courses from the following list: 331 Aircraft Flight Dynamics 340D Junior Independent Work with Design 341 Space Flight 344 Biomechanics and Biomaterials: From Cells to Organisms 345 Introduction to Robotics 423 Heat Transfer 434 Modern Control The energy sciences option is recommended for students desiring an emphasis on power sources.

Aerospace Engineering This program deals with the analysis and design of aerospace vehicles. The curriculum is based on the applications of principles from dynamics, control, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics and solid mechanics; it is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET. Part of the departmental design requirement (II. B. above) is satisfied by 321 Engineering Design and 332 Aircraft Design or 342 Space System Design. The departmental requirements (II. A. above) are normally satisfied by: 331 Aircraft Flight Dynamics or 341 Space Flight 335 Fluid Dynamics 427 Energy Conversion and the Environment: Transportation Applications OR 426 Rocket and Air-Breathing Propulsion Technology 433 Automatic Control Systems Independent Work All seniors are required to participate in a research or engineering project by completing at least one semester of independent work. A year-long senior thesis or senior project also meets this requirement. All projects must include engineering design (engineering design is the process of devising a system, component, or process to meet desired needs). The following courses satisfy this requirement: senior independent work (439) (one semester offered in fall); senior independent work (440) (one semester offered in spring); senior thesis (442) (year-long individual effort); senior project (444) (year-long team or group effort). Any of these courses may satisfy the third design requirement in either the Aerospace or Mechanical programs. Students are strongly encouraged to select the year-long thesis or project. For the senior thesis or project, a final grade is issued in the spring. Preparation for Graduate Study Students who are considering graduate work in applied science may elect the engineering physics option by combining the engineering courses in the department with the requirements of the interdepartmental engineering physics program. Program in Sustainable Energy. This program provides an understanding of Earth, global climate, and environmental change from the perspective of engineering, technology, and policy. The future of societies, the global economy, and the global environment depend on collaborative research into renewable energy, alternative fuels, advanced energy conversion and storage systems, technology transfer to developing countries, and prudent judgment on policies to support sustainable energy technology. Innovations and inventions require multidisciplinary approaches and entrepreneurship, as well as grounding in theory and practice, in topics that are not covered by a single department. This certificate program offers an integrated set of core and elective courses, introducing students to fundamental concepts, providing depth in specific fields of interest, gaining laboratory and site visit experiences, and setting the stage for further work in the field. See the Program in Sustainable Energy entry or view program information online. Program in Robotics and Intelligent Systems.

New approaches for analysis, design, and synthesis of systems are being developed using symbolic representation of knowledge, electronic neural networks, and parallel supercomputers. Students have an opportunity to learn the theory and practice of automation and to pursue independent study projects in related areas. The mechanical and aerospace engineering department offers a number of courses in this area and is preparing a new generation of engineers in robotics and intelligent systems. For more information, see the Program in Robotics and Intelligent Systems entry or view program information online. Program in Materials Science and Engineering. The materials concentration in mechanical engineering is designed to provide a coherent understanding of the structure, properties, and performance of materials from a mechanics and materials perspective. The materials concentration will provide a foundation in basic and applied science, as well as an introduction to the design and applications of materials. Students are given the opportunity to specialize in areas such as structural materials, biological materials, micro- and nanotechnology, and materials modeling and simulations. This can be achieved by taking a sequence of electives drawn from different departments, and also by engaging in a materials-related senior thesis topic designed to facilitate the specializations. This course of study will prepare students for graduate education in a wide range of areas, or the beginning of a professional career in materials engineering. Students electing this concentration will receive a degree in mechanical engineering. Students are encouraged to simultaneously participate in the Program in Materials Science and Engineering.
