(GAB) 405.744.1156eeo@okstate.edu STAFF TITLE IX TRAINING TRANSCRIPT What is OEO? Title IX is the right for any person on the basis of sex, be included in participation, allowed the benefits of, or not be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. Equal Employment Opportunity is the right of all persons to work and to advance on the basis of merit, ability, and potential without regard to race, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, genetic information, gender identity, gender expression, religion, disability, age or status as a veteran. Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is the civil rights law that allows individuals with disabilities access to areas of public life, including jobs, schools, transportation, and all public and private places open to the general public. Affirmative Action requires the employer to do more than ensure employment neutrality. As the phrase implies, Affirmative Action requires employers to make additional efforts to recruit, employ, and promote qualified members of groups formerly limited or excluded.
