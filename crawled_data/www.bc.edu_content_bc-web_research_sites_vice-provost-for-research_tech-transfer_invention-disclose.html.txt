All of these elements are critical to the proper management of the University’s intellectual property portfolio. Any member of the College who believes that they have created something of value should contact OTTL to submit an invention disclosure form well before a public disclosure or transfer to a third party. In the case of a patentable invention, some rights can be lost if an invention is publicly disclosed (even in a non-confidential conversation) before a patent application is filed, so early disclosure is important.
