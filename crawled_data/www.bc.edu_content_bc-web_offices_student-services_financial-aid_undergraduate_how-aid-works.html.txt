Students who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents, who are not in default on a Federal student loan and who demonstrate financial need, will be assisted in meeting that need through different financial aid funds. A family's demonstrated financial need is the difference between the cost of attendance and the expected family contribution. College Board Net Price Calculator Who Is Eligible for Aid Cost of Attendance Family Contribution Cost of Attendance The cost of attendance is the average cost of attending Boston College. It is based on whether you will be living on campus, off campus or commuting. The cost of attendance includes costs that will appear directly on your bill, such as tuition, fees and, if you are living on campus, room and board. It also includes allowances for indirect expenses that will not be on your Boston College bill, such as books, supplies, personal expenses, travel expenses and, if you will be living off campus, room and board. Your cost of attendance will not match your bill because it includes these indirect costs that are not billed by Boston College. Students must plan ahead and be prepared to pay for books and/or off-campus living expenses until the funds have been disbursed.

We meet 100% of the need that is based on our determination of your institutional expected family contribution.

Boston College verifies sibling enrollment each fall semester through the Sibling Enrollment Verification process. Expected Student Contribution Federal Methodology includes factors such as: Income (prior-prior tax year) Assets Family size (if student is considered independent) Number in college (if student is considered independent) Institutional Methodology includes factors such as: Income (prior-prior tax year) or minimum contribution* Assets Family size (if student is considered independent) Number in college (if student is considered independent) *The student income portion of the Institutional Expected Family Contribution is based on the expectation that each student will work during the summer to invest in his or her own education. Minimum standard income contributions for the academic year are $2,400 for incoming students and $2,500 for returning students. If the student earned higher than the minimum standard contribution during the prior-prior tax year, then the determined student contribution will be based on a percentage of their actual earned income.
