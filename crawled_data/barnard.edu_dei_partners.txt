Center for Engaged Pedagogy Ombuds Office The Barnard College Ombuds Office is available as a campus-wide resource to assist students, faculty and staff. The Ombuds Office provides a confidential and informal environment in which possible options for dealing with a variety of Barnard-related issues and concerns can be explored.

The ombuds provides generalized information on the campus climate to inform the work of DEI@Barnard.
