They are improving food security and human health, healing the natural environment, strengthening local economies, and addressing inequities across the food system. OSU Extension is engaged in the local, regional, and community food systems movement through the Center for Small Farms & Community Food Systems, the OSU Small Farms team, and the interdisciplinary Community Food Systems team within Extension. We partner with communities and organizations across the state, including the Oregon Community Food Systems Network. This section provides information, educational resources, and applied research related to building equitable, health-promoting, and ecologically and economically resilient food systems across Oregon.
