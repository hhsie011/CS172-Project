The final exam week includes the Saturday and Monday-Friday after the last day of classes (fall and spring only). Exams offered during finals week must be held during the assigned time on the final exam scheduled for the course. Find the usual start time and day for your course in the unshaded area of the table below. The exam day for that course can then be found at the top of that column, and the exam time is found in the extreme left-hand block on the same line. EXAMPLE: a course which usually meets at 9:30 MWF will have its exam on Monday, 9:00-10:50 AM. A course which meets 8:00-9:15 TR, will have its exam on Tuesday, 7:00-8:50 AM. Ten-Week or shorter classes will have their exam during the last (or last two) regularly scheduled class periods, at the discretion of the instructor. Second eight-week courses may hold their exams during finals week. Online course final exams may be administered at the discretion of the instructor but should still take place during finals week. All courses/finals, including online, are subject to catalog policy requiring students to take no more than 2 final exams in one day. Instructors with questions regarding this policy can contact the Office of the Registrar at 316-978-3090. NOTES T = Tuesday; R = Thursday. MTWF or MWRF classes follow the MWF exam schedule. *MW or MWF is the same as M or W unless specified; TR is the same as T or R, etc.* Lecture classes that meet 5 days a week, or MTWR classes not covered by a block exam, can follow the MWF or TR exam schedule, at the discretion of the instructor. Friday-only classes will have finals on Thursday.
