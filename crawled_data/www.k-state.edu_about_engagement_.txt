What this means is that K-State is known for teaching, learning and scholarship that engage faculty, students and our community alike. At K-State, we take our mission of service and outreach seriously, always looking for opportunities that live up to our Carnegie designation and offer a mutually beneficial exchange, exploration and application of knowledge, information and resources. And the impact we have on our community is unmistakable; K-Staters are difference makers.
