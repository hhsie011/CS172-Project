Oberlin, Quine, Sumners, Wright; Courtesy Professors: Absil, Fusaro, Goldberg, Henry De Frahan, Hironaka, Huang, Marchand, Marcolli, van Dooren The Department of Mathematics (https://www.math.fsu.edu/) offers programs of study leading to the Bachelor of Science (BS) and Bachelor of Arts (BA) degrees, the Master of Science (MS) and Master of Arts (MA) degrees, and the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree. (For details of the master’s and doctoral degrees, see the Graduate Bulletin.) A combined bachelor’s/master’s pathway may be developed for a strong undergraduate, especially one entering with advanced credit. This allows a student to earn both a bachelor’s and a master’s degree in about five years. A degree in mathematics can be regarded as the central component of a liberal education, or as preparation for graduate study in mathematics or another field. Students can pursue careers in industry, finance, government, or teaching in a secondary, college, or university institution. The Actuarial Science program is professionally oriented toward the insurance and financial sectors. The department has a widely recognized research faculty, all of whom teach undergraduate students. Under the direction of a faculty member, selected students may choose to pursue an individual research project under Honors in the Major. The department operates its own network of computers and computer labs. Faculty and students in the department have access to a variety of mathematical software, which is used in courses and in research. For additional information, see the departmental Website. The department offers opportunities for its majors to participate in learning activities outside the classroom. The Society of Undergraduate Mathematics Students provides a venue in which undergraduate students meet monthly to share interests and collaborate. Future Seminole Actuaries benefits from a first-rate professional relationship with actuarial employers; actuaries from government, insurance, and consulting firms often visit the department to describe the field and interview students for summer internships and employment. The students share experiences about summer internships and prepare for actuarial examinations and well-placed graduates of the program help current students. The department fields a team for the William Lowell Putnam Examination, a nationwide competition among mathematics students conducted annually by the Mathematical Association of America. A Fall seminar is held for students to become familiar with Putnam-style problems and to hone their skills. Departmental Programs There are five majors leading to the bachelor’s degree: applied and computational mathematics, pure mathematics, biomathematics, mathematics/FSU-Teach, and actuarial science (please consult the “Program in Actuarial Science” section of this General Bulletin). Under the direction of a faculty member, a student may also pursue a flexible major program to fit particular interests. Combined BS/MS Pathways There are two approved mathematics BS/MS pathways which allow a student to get both a BS and an MS by double-counting up to twelve graduate credit hours. The two pathways are the Pure Mathematics pathway and the Applied and Computational Mathematics pathway. Applicants are eligible to apply for admission when they have at least 60 undergraduate hours completed, at least 24 of which at FSU. The minimum GPA is 3.0, with at least a 3.2 in mathematics courses above MAC 2311. Note that satisfying these requirements does not guarantee admission. Early planning is advised. Consult with the mathematics graduate advisor or the mathematics Associate Chair of Graduate Studies if interested. Computer Skills Competency All undergraduates at Florida State University must demonstrate basic computer skills competency prior to graduation. As necessary computer competency skills vary from discipline to discipline, each major determines the courses needed to satisfy this requirement. Undergraduate majors in actuarial science, applied mathematics, biomathematics, mathematics, and mathematics/FSU-Teach satisfy this requirement by earning a grade of “C–” or higher in COP 3014 or ISC 3313. Admission Statement All State Common Program Prerequisites listed as Term 1–4 Milestones must be completed with a “C” range (C–, C, C+) grade or better. Students earning less than the necessary grade in any of these courses will be required to retake those courses until the standard is met. Note: retaking a course may delay graduation and incur increased fee liability (i.e., repeat course surcharge and excess credit surcharge). State of Florida Common Program Prerequisites The state of Florida has identified common program prerequisites for this University degree program. Specific prerequisites are required for admission into the upper-division program and must be completed by the student at either a community college or a state university prior to being admitted to this program. Students may be admitted into the University without completing the prerequisites, but may not be admitted into the program. At the time this document was published, some common program prerequisites were being reviewed by the state of Florida and may have been revised. Please visit https://dlss.flvc.org/admin-tools/common-prerequisites-manuals for a current list of state-approved prerequisites. The following lists the common program prerequisites or their substitutions, necessary for admission into these upper-division degree programs: Mathematics COP XXXX: one scientific programming course for three credit hours designed for computer science majors MAC X311 MAC X312 MAC X313 BSC X010/X010L or BSC X010/X010L or CHM X045/X045L or CHM X045C or GLY X010/X010L or GLY X010C or PHY X048/X048L or PHY X048C: one laboratory based science course for four credit hours designed for science majors MAP X302 COP X271C or X210 or X272 or X001 or X006: one scientific programming course designed for computer science majors Note: A “C” grade or better in all coursework is required for admission.

Students should complete the state of Florida common program prerequisites, including the physics (all the Mathematics majors) or the economics (Actuarial Science majors) requirements, during the first two college years. Actuarial Science majors should also complete the accounting course during the first two college years. Note that all majors have a computing requirement that can be used as the computing prerequisite course, but not vice versa. A student who expects to continue on to doctoral work in mathematics is encouraged to complete the foreign language requirement in French, German, or Russian. Mathematics courses at the 4000 level applied toward any departmental major must be taken at Florida State University unless specifically exempted by the chair on written request. All majors must complete an exit survey. Honors in the Major The Department of Mathematics offers honors in the major designed to introduce the student to the process of independent and original research. For requirements and other information, see the “University Honors Office and Honor Societies” chapter of this General Bulletin. FSU-Teach Program in Teaching Mathematics For those interested in teaching mathematics, FSU-Teach is an innovative approach to teacher education that involves collaboration between scientists, mathematicians, and education faculty at Florida State University. In FSU-Teach, students will develop deep science or mathematics knowledge and the knowledge, skill, and experience needed to be an effective science or math teacher. The program will pay for tuition for the first two courses, and work study positions with scientists, mathematicians, and local schools are available. For more information, see our Website: https://fsu-teach.fsu.edu/. Requirements for a Minor in Mathematics A minor in mathematics consists of twelve semester hours in courses with prefixes MAA, MAC, MAD, MAP, MAS, MAT, MGF, MHF, and MTG, but not including any of the courses numbered 1XXX, or MAC 2233. A grade of “C–” or better must be earned in each course counted toward the minor. Prerequisite Courses Before taking any mathematics course, the student must complete with a grade of “C–” or better the listed prerequisites to that course. Moreover, a student who earns a “C–” or better in a course with one or more stated or implied prerequisites may not subsequently earn credit in the prerequisite course(s). For example, a student who has earned a “C–” or better in MAC 2312 may not subsequently enroll in MAC 1105, 1114, 1140, or 2311. Credit Note 1. In exception to the preceding paragraph, a transfer student may take MAC 1105 for credit even though the student has a “C–” or better in a transfer course that has been equated to a course for which MAC 1105 is prerequisite, provided the student has taken an approved placement test and has not yet satisfied the liberal studies requirement in mathematics. Credit Note 2. In cases in which a student has earned a “D+”, “D”, or “D–” in a course and subsequently takes a similar course at the same level, the hours toward graduation for the first course will be disallowed as soon as the student passes the second course. These cases are: MAC 2233 after MAC 2311; MAC 2311 after MAC 2233. Baccalaureate Degree in Mathematics Courses required for each of the four degree options in mathematics are MAP 2302, MAS 3105, and MGF 3301.
