Books: Beam, C. (2013). To The End of June: The Intimate Life of American Foster Care. New York, NY: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company. “Who are the children of foster care? What, as a country, do we owe them? Cris Beam, a foster mother herself, spent five years immersed in the world of foster care looking into these questions and tracing firsthand stories. The result is To the End of June, an unforgettable portrait that takes us deep inside the lives of foster children in their search for a stable, loving family. Beam shows us the intricacies of growing up in the system—the back-and-forth with agencies, the rootless shuffling between homes, the emotionally charged tug between foster and birth parents, the terrifying push out of foster care and into adulthood. Humanizing and challenging a broken system, To the End of June offers a tribute to resiliency and hope for real change.” Chipman, T. (2019). Until Every Child is Home: Why the Church Can and Must Care for Our Orphans. Chicago, IL: Moody Publishers. “Your church is doing so much already. Trying to convince people to do foster care or adoption can feel like just another daunting, impossible task. It’s hard enough to get volunteers for the nursery, much less volunteers to foster or adopt a child! But what if we’re thinking about it the wrong way? What if orphan care actually increases your church’s capacity to do ministry? What if this one ministry opens doors to many others? Discover how orphan care transforms 6 key aspects of your ministry, meet dozens of families and churches who have experienced the transformative power of orphan care, and learn how you can get involved even if you’re not ready to foster or adopt. After catching the vision for this vital ministry, you’ll be ready to join them!” Johnson, J. (2018). Reframing Foster Care: Filtering Your Foster Parenting Journey Through the Lens of the Gospel. Grand Rapids, MI: Credo House Publishers. “Foster parents face a unique set of circumstances and experience a wide array of emotions that few can relate to. Their journey is one of equal parts beauty and brokenness, joy and heartache, excitement and exhaustion. There is no textbook on how to be a foster parent, no formula, no simple three-step guide.” Moore, R. (2015). Adopted for Life: The Priority of Adoption for Christian Families and Churches. Wheaton, IL: Crossway. “The doctrine of adoption—God’s decision to adopt sinful men and women into his family—stands at the heart of Christianity. In light of this, Christians’ efforts to adopt beautifully illustrate the truth of the gospel. In this popular-level and practical manifesto, Russell Moore encourages Christians to adopt children and to help other Christian families to do the same. He shows that adoption is not just about couples who have struggled to have children. Rather, it’s about an entire culture within evangelicalism—a culture that sees adoption as part of the Great Commission mandate and as a sign of the gospel itself.” Parish, P. (2014). Ready or Not: 30 Days of Discovery for Foster & Adoptive Parents. Carol Stream, IL: Tyndale House Publishers. “Entering the journey of foster care and adoption can be one of the most daunting decisions that you make as a parent. Parenting a child who has experienced trauma and loss is a rewarding experience, but it’s not easy. In this biblically-centered and straight-forward book, Pam Parish helps parents to: consider the impact of foster care and adoption on their lives and families, evaluate their motives and expectations for the foster care and adoption experience, and explore foster care and adoption through the lens of scripture. Ready or Not, 30-day Discovery is sure to challenge, inspire and encourage you in your foster care and adoption journey. “ Purvis, K. B., Cross, D. R., & Sunshine, W. L. (2007). The Connected Child: Bring Hope and Healing to Your Adoptive Family. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill. “The adoption of a child is always a joyous moment in the life of a family. Some adoptions, though, present unique challenges. Welcoming these children into your family--and addressing their special needs--requires care, consideration, and compassion. Written by two research psychologists specializing in adoption and attachment, The Connected Child will help you: build bonds of affection and trust with your adopted child, effectively deal with any learning or behavioral disorders, and discipline your child with love without making him or her feel threatened.” Research Articles and Editorials: Chanmugam, A., Madden, E.
