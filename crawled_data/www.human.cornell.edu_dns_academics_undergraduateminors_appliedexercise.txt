Students who complete all specified courses receive a certification letter from Ithaca College (IC), which is a useful credential for job and school applications. Program completion is good preparation for the examination for Fitness Instructor Certification by the American College of Sports Medicine (a certification that also requires American Red Cross Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) Certification or the equivalent). Although the Applied Exercise Science minor is only available to DNS majors, any Cornell student may complete up to 4 credits of Ithaca College coursework in a semester through the CU-IC Exchange Program in the Cornell University School of Continuing Education and Summer Sessions. For advising questions about the Applied Exercise Science minor or NS course enrollment questions, please contact dnsstudentservices@cornell.edu. Requirements for the Applied Exercise Science minor The Applied Exercise Science minor requires 6 prerequisite course credits at Cornell followed by 12 course credits at Ithaca College. Students can choose to complete all the requirements for the minor or take some courses as long as they have met the course prerequisites. Applied Exercise Science students must take both prerequisites (NS 3410 Human Anatomy and Physiology and NS 3420 Human Anatomy and Physiology Laboratory) before enrolling in three required Ithaca College courses: Kinesiology: Examines the anatomical structures and mechanical aspects of human movement. Emphasis is placed on the functional anatomy of the musculoskeletal and articular systems. Exercise Physiology: Examines physiological changes during exercise, after exercise, and during a training period. Also considers efficiency, needs, and limitations of body systems, and their interrelationships. Biomechanical Principles of Human Movement: The study of biological and mechanical factors that affect humans as they move in exercise and sport. Kinematic and kinetic descriptions of selected motor skills receive careful consideration. Note: Prerequisite is Physics (was formerly Kinesiology). Further information about the program and courses may be found at the Ithaca College Course Catalog; search for Exercise and Sport Sciences. In addition, a physics sequence is required for advanced study in most related areas. Students should take the IC courses as early as possible once pre-requisites are completed (see sequence below), and check for conflicts between Cornell and Ithaca College courses in advance and plan accordingly. Careful planning of course schedules is required to complete both the minor and major, and students are responsible for ALL logistical arrangements (e.g. city buses or carpooling arrangements). YEAR COURSES FRESHMAN Introductory biology courses (Cornell) SOPHOMORE NS 3410 Human Anatomy and Physiology (Spring, 4 cr) (Cornell) NS 3420 Human Anatomy and Physiology Laboratory (Spring, 2 cr) (Cornell; also counts as advanced NS elective or HBHS selective) JUNIOR / SENIOR Kinesiology (F/S, 4 cr) (Ithaca College) Exercise Physiology (F/S, 4 cr) (Ithaca College) Biomechanical principles of Human Movement* (Ithaca College) (Fall/Spring, 4 cr; prerequisite: Physics [formerly Kinesiology]) * Advanced Biomechanics also available (Spring, 4 cr; prerequisites: Kinesiology and Physics) Application, Pre-registration, & Registration (and minor intent form) Application: Indicate the intent to participate by submitting an Applied Exercise Minor Intent form to dnsstudentservices@cornell.edu or bring it to B36 Kinzelberg Hall. After this form is submitted, DNS keeps track of the student’s progress and informs both Ithaca College and the student’s College registrar upon completion (see below under “Minor Completion, Grades, Transcripts, and Transfer Credits”) Ithaca College will then send a paper letter to the student’s home address confirming the completion of the minor. Pre-Registration: Each semester during pre-registration, request from dnsstudentservices@cornell.edu in B36 Kinzelberg Hall the course(s) you wish to take at Ithaca College the following semester. Electronic enrollment forms are sent with other NS course information during pre-enrollment. This is so that DNS can negotiate the desired number of spaces, which will be assigned based on availability/program seniority. Have the required prerequisites to register for a course. Ithaca College is very strict about prerequisites, and you must indicate how you have met them on the form you file at pre-registration. Please note that spaces are limited; not all requests can be met. Because of high demand for places in the Ithaca College courses for this minor, the Division will not request a place in additional courses for any student who has earned a grade of less than C in an Applied Exercise Science minor course. Registration: After being approved by Nutritional Sciences to enroll, pick up an IC-CU Exchange petition from the CU School of Continuing Education Office (B20 Day Hall). Complete the petition, secure all required for approval signatures (faculty advisor and CALS or CHE Registrar, as appropriate), and return the signed form to the CU School of Continuing Education Office. Present the approved petition to the continuing education office at Ithaca College during the first week of classes, BEFORE attending the first class (G72 Peggy Ryan Williams Center). Pick up registration/add-drop forms at Ithaca College and take the registration form to the first class meeting. IMPORTANT NOTE: It is the student’s responsibility to find out when classes start at Ithaca College—sometimes before Cornell classes begin—and to accommodate their schedule to fit with Ithaca College and Cornell fall/spring breaks. You are required to be there during these times, unless you personally make other arrangements with the Ithaca College course instructors. Minor Completion, Grades, Transcripts, and Transfer Credits Completion: DNS only reports minors to College Registrars once they are complete, including all relevant forms. The College Registrar then adds the minor to your transcript when the degree is conferred (but it will not appear on the diploma). If there are any problems regarding completion, we will contact you. If you do not see the minor on your transcript after your degree is conferred, please contact your College Registrar’s Office to inquire. The minor in Applied Exercise Science is possible through a long-standing exchange agreement between Ithaca College and Cornell through which students may take up to 12 credits at Ithaca College (and vice versa) without additional cost during the school year. Within this agreement, Ithaca College courses: …count toward 120 Cornell graduation credits as elective credits, but only if a grade of “C” or above has been achieved. However, CALS students who start but do not finish the minor must petition to count the credits. …count toward the 12 needed in a semester for full-time status and good academic standing. …do not appear on the Cornell transcript and are not included in the Cornell GPA. Students must obtain separate transcripts from Ithaca College to reflect courses completed at this college. …are only free to Cornell students up to 12 credits. Students must pay for any credits taken at Ithaca College beyond 12, and may not take a course at Ithaca College under the exchange program if that course is offered at Cornell. …count toward the 60 credits that external transfer students need to take at Cornell to earn a Cornell degree.
