Four steps are involved in obtaining approval for transfer credits: Get the forms for transfer credit approval from the registrar’s office. Fill out the forms with the courses you intend to transfer and obtain documentation on course content from the student course guide at the institution you will visit—or even better, obtain a sample syllabus. Bring the completed transfer credit approval forms and the course content documentation to the Vice Chair for formal approval during office hours. Return the signed forms to the registrar. All steps should be completed before the transfer term. Normally, no more than three courses transferred for Dartmouth credit from other institutions will be credited toward fulfillment of a regular or modified major in economics. However, students are strongly discouraged from taking more than two courses toward the Economics major at another institution. Students are also discouraged from transferring the equivalents of Economics 20, 21 and any prerequisites for the culminating experience. Finally, it is not possible to satisfy the culminating experience requirement through transfer credit for a 40-level or an 80-level course.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Economics About Why Econ?
