Baylor University has adopted updated protocols for Isolation and Quarantine in 2022. Students and employees should follow the University's Isolation and Quarantine procedures outlining what you should do if you are exposed to or test positive for COVID-19. 3. I read that every student "should develop a plan" if they test positive or have to self-isolate or quarantine. What should be in a student's plan? Students should have a plan if they become infected, as quarantine and isolation services will be severely limited. The University's isolation housing is prioritized for those on-campus residential students who live out of state or a significant distance from Waco and cannot return home to safely quarantine at home or in another safe location. Baylor contact tracers and Residence Hall staff will provide guidance and instructions to students who test positive. A student's plan should include: a location to complete the self-isolation/quarantine period, including returning home if feasible, a plan for transportation, such as using your own vehicle or transportation by a family member, but no use of public transportation, access to groceries/meal delivery, access to necessary medications, a plan to communicate with your professors, numbers of emergency contacts, and contact information for their preferred healthcare provider. Please note that if students have a meal plan, the plan would still be in effect, and the university has a process in place for students in isolation and quarantine to receive meals. However, a limited selection of meals might be offered. 4. I am an on-campus student who tested positive and am now completing the isolation period (1) in university isolation housing or (2) in my room. I have a meal plan so how will I receive my meals? If you are a student in university isolation housing, you will given instructions and have meals delivered to you by the Bear Aid team. Students in quarantine or isolating in place do not have delivered meals. They are to remain in their rooms at all times. If they are around roommates or have to leave for the restroom or dining hall, they must remain masked, preferably with an N95. For meals, they should go to the closest dining hall, masked preferably with an N95, to get a meal to-go only and then return immediately to their room. If they have not received an N95, they should call the front desk of their building or their CL if they need an N95. 5. What should an employee do if they have a positive test? Students and employees who test positive or have been exposed to a positive test should continue to reference the Spring protocols for direction on quarantine/isolation. Employees should notify their supervisor of any needed sick time or remote work time. 6. Can I test out and leave isolation early if I receive a negative test after a positive test? Our current COVID policy on retesting is that we cannot accept a negative retest (antigen or PCR) to overturn a recent positive test. Anyone who tests positive is required to isolate for the 5 days following their positive test regardless of any instance of testing negative after that initial positive test. 7. Does the University clean or disinfect residence hall rooms if a student tests positive? What we know now about curtailing the spread of the virus is that it is less important to sanitize surfaces and more important to maintain regular ventilation and air flow. The University does not provide room cleaning, however, if a student does not have regular cleaning supplies in their room, they should contact their hall front desk for available supplies. The University's Custodial Services team has continued its focus on implementing improved ventilation practices, including increasing building fresh air, maximizing filtration and disinfecting coil systems. The University has a limited number of air purifiers that are available upon request for temporary use in a residence hall room or department. Baylor Custodial Services also conducts cleaning and disinfection in accordance with current CDC recommendations, including increased disinfection in multiple locations with an emphasis on restrooms, common spaces and common high-touch contact points across campus. Any disinfectant used on campus is approved as effective against the coronavirus by the EPA. 8. Does the University conduct contact tracing? Effective May 16, 2022, Baylor will no longer provide contact tracing. All contact tracing will be conducted by the Waco/McLennan County Public Health District. Students and employees who test positive or have been exposed to a positive test should continue to reference the Spring protocols for direction on quarantine/isolation. Employees should notify their supervisor of any needed sick time or remote work time. 9. The Baylor Health Center is open for student healthcare. Does Baylor also offer phone or telehealth options for students? Please check the Baylor Health Center for updates to their summer hours.

What about classes if a student tests positive for COVID-19 and has to isolate or is a close contact and instructed to quarantine? Baylor University began the spring 2022 semester on Jan. 18 with in-person instruction. The University is not receiving or granting requests from students to take their courses online. Due to our high vaccination rates (over 82%), availability of testing and following public health protocols, we believe the safest place for our faculty, staff and students from the latest variant is on the Baylor campus. The University has continued with COVID-19 precautionary measures from the fall as we closely follow the spike and projected decline of this latest variant. Baylor faculty are being asked to work with students who test positive for COVID or who must quarantine due to contact tracing, but, unless a student is officially registered with the Office of Access and Learning Accommodation (OALA) and has an accommodation that merits online coursework, students are expected to be in Waco for in-person courses. Students who have tested positive for COVID-19 and are isolating or are identified as a close contact and instructed to quarantine should follow their plan and communicate directly with their professors directly.
