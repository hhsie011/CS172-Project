All SMU students, faculty and staff traveling abroad on SMU programs or business are automatically covered under the university’s membership at no cost to the individual. ISOS responds to critical medical or safety emergencies and can also help resolve non-critical day to day travel problems any time you are traveling outside your home country on SMU programs or business; it should not be confused with international travel insurance- that is different. In the event of an emergency, large or small, ISOS should be one of the very first calls you make so you can receive immediate assistance. Download the brochure for more information. Be sure to also download the ISOS Assistance App. In all emergencies, ISOS should be your first call.
