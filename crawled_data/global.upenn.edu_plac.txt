Today, Penn students have a wealth of opportunities to engage with Latin America & the Caribbean both in the region and on campus, and faculty from across multiple disciplines are collaborating to produce innovative research on this vitally important part of the world. Learn more about Penn's engagement in Latin America and the Caribbean. Penn's efforts in the region are bolstered by a cross-campus, interdisciplinary group, made up of faculty and administrators, the Penn in Latin America and Caribbean (PLAC) Steering Committee. Together, members of this diverse group seek to foster and highlight engagement in the region by organizing annual symposia and workshops, supporting student opportunities like the Pulitzer International Reporting Student Fellowship, and facilitating networking opportunities among colleagues whose work focuses on Latin America and the Caribbean. Who We Are Since 2015 we have collaborated across campus to organize a number of events, including conferences, symposia, and information sessions for student opportunities. PLAC is led by a Steering Committee with diverse membership. If you are interested in helping to guide our efforts, please contact plac@upenn.edu. Meet the Steering Committee What We Do The PLAC Steering Committee seeks to deepen engagement in the region by organizing an annual convening for the Penn community to share their work and connect with colleagues, and by partnering with the Pulitzer Center and Penn Global to offer opportunities for students to become Pulitzer International Reporting Student Fellows.
