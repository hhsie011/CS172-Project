Jones - Coordinator of music theory & Composition Our students encounter new ideas, gain professional experience, and benefit from supportive, collaborative interaction with faculty and each other. The Florida State University College of Music features one of the largest and most distinguished theory and composition faculties in the United States, including a Guggenheim Fellow and a Pulitzer Prize winner. Our students gain valuable experience in teaching and research, working with faculty members who care deeply about both pursuits, and our program is one of the most successful in the country in terms of professional placement. The College offers a range of assistantships, sponsors student travel, funds frequent visits from guest theorists and composers, and hosts a biennial Festival of New Music, featuring special guests as well as competitively selected compositions. The Warren D. Allen Music Library offers one of the largest collections of musical scores and books in the southeastern U.S., including the Allen Forte Treatise Collection, acquired in 1998 and representing 67 volumes dating from 1715 to 1894. Teaching assistants meet regularly with faculty supervisors and gain valuable pedagogical experience in a variety of contexts, including freshman/sophomore theory and aural skills classes as well as a range of other teaching opportunities. Both the FSU Music Theory Society and the FSU chapter of SCI meet on a near-weekly basis and are student-run, with assistance and oversight from faculty; SCI schedules regular concerts of student compositions and MTS hosts a one-day, peer-reviewed conference (the Music Theory Forum) every spring.
