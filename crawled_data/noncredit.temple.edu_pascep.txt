Learn More In Our Brochure The History of PASCEP PASCEP was founded in 1975 by the late Annie D. Hyman, a Temple University graduate and North Philadelphia community activist who sought to bring the University to the community. Prior to coming to Temple, the Community Education Program was held in community schools, churches, and centers. University faculty volunteered their time to teach classes. Ms. Hyman later obtained the support of Dr. Odeyo Ayaga, who was then Chairman of the Pan-African Studies Department, to seek Temple University's sponsorship of the Community Education Program. In the Spring of 1979, the University adopted the Program and it came to the campus under the auspices of the Pan-African Studies Department of the College of Arts and Sciences of Temple University. Faculty of the Pan-African Studies Department and other faculty continued to volunteer time to teach courses for PASCEP: Dr. Rita Smith, Dr. Audrey Pitman, Dr. Tran Van Dinh, Professor Sonia Sanchez, Professor Jacqueline Mungai, Dr.Wilbert Roget, Dr. C. T. Keto, Dr. Barbara Hampton, and Dr. Thaddeus Mathis, among others. Today the vast majority of PASCEP's courses are taught by volunteers from the community whose purpose is to give back to others what was given to them in knowledge, skill, inspiration, and example. Community self-help is no better exemplified than in the PASCEP philosophy and practice.
