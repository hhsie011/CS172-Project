It opens a world of interaction with other students, faculty, and staff members in many social, developmental and academic activities. New students, including those transferring to the University from another institution, who have been admitted to the University are eligible to apply for housing and make payment arrangements for the housing prepayment via the On-Campus Housing Portal accessed from CaneLink for Student by selecting the “Housing and Dining” dropdown from the menu. A $500 prepayment (payable by credit card) is required to complete the application. Housing Application Deadlines Applying soon after verifying admission to UM will determine, in part, a student's future priority to access single rooms, being considered for room changes, and having earlier room selection appointment times. Please consider applying for housing right after your enrollment deposit transaction is processed (please wait a few hours for the transaction to be completed) in order to access the housing application portal in CaneLink. For Fall Semester Housing Students admitted for the fall semester should apply for housing no later than May 15. Housing applications received after this date are accepted but will be waitlisted until an available space can be identified. For Spring Semester Housing First-year students admitted for the spring semester can apply for housing using the Spring-Only Housing Application available in the On-Campus Housing Portal beginning the first Monday in November. Spring housing applications are due December 1. Review the Road to UM checklist for other important details and deadlines. Personal Property Insurance Personal property insurance is strongly recommended and is available from GradGuard, a service of Next Generation Insurance Group. The University is not liable for loss or damage to property caused by fire, rain, windstorm, hurricane, theft or vandalism, or other act of God or casualty or any causes beyond the control of the University. Applicants are able to opt-in through the housing sign-up process or decline coverage should the student be covered by the family’s homeowner’s insurance or decides to choose a different company. Renters insurance from GradGuard is designed specifically for college students and provides valuable protection if a student’s personal belongings are stolen or damaged by a covered peril, including laptop computers, smartphones, bicycles, game consoles, textbooks, clothing, and other items. Renters insurance also protects students financially for unintentional damage to the student’s residence or bodily injury to others for which the student is legally liable, within the residence premises. Live-On Requirement All non-local first-year students are required to live in University housing for two academic semesters, as long as space is available. This policy does not apply to first-year students living with parents or legal guardians in Miami-Dade or Broward counties. For spring admitted students, on-campus housing is neither required nor guaranteed. Although transfer students are not required to live on campus, housing is provided to transfer students on a space-available basis in one of our residential colleges.
