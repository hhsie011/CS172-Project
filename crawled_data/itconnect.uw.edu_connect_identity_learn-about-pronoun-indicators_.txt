Contact UW-IT About UW-IT Learn more about pronoun indicators Current status (June 30, 2021) — Pronouns aren’t yet available in Identity.UW. This page is being made available prior to release, so that implementers and other contributors can refer to it, and the community is aware of the general approach to governance and integration of pronoun data. Notes (in italics) are added where coordination with data stewards and other stakeholders continues. Feedback is welcome. Pronoun indicators make sharing, displaying, and learning pronouns easier. Many people use them online, in person, on buttons and elsewhere to refer to the pronouns they or someone else goes by — e.g. “Hi, I’m Sam, and I use they/them pronouns”. What do these pronoun indicators mean? Select a pronoun indicator to learn more about its use: she/her Description: A pronoun indicator for she pronouns.

Alternate formats: Any pronouns What about indicators for other pronouns? Is there a pronoun indicator for "Ask me"? It isn’t clear that a single pronoun indicator is used widely and across many contexts by people who want to invite others to ask them about their pronouns. “Ask me my pronouns”, “ask me about my pronouns”, and (abbreviated) “ask me my prns” are examples. More time and further innovations in language expression and formatting may result in a short pronoun indicator whose semantics are widely known and shared. (Pioneers, do your thing!) Is there a pronoun indicator for "No pronouns"? It isn’t clear that a single pronoun indicator is used widely and across many contexts by people to indicate to others not to use any pronouns when referring to them. Some individuals use “No pronouns”, while others use “no prns”, by itself or combined with other pronoun indicators, “any/no prns”, “he/it/no prns”. What about non-English pronouns? Non-english, heritage language, and bilingual speakers use pronoun indicators too, sometimes in combination with English pronoun indicators. For example, “she/ella” or “they/el” (both with Spanish third person pronouns) or “she/they/siya” (with Tagalog third-person singular gender-fluid pronoun). What about neopronouns? Pronoun indicators are often used when sharing neopronouns, as well as nounself and emojiself pronouns. As with other new or rare words, pronoun indicators for neopronouns may vary.
