Campus Resources Student Services Center The Student Services Center in CECH has been recognized for outstanding advising quality. All students are assigned an advisor who is there to help your student succeed. Advisors can also connect students to valuable resources across campus like study-abroad opportunities, campus jobs, and internships. All students are required to meet with their Academic Advisor throughout their program to ensure they are meeting degree requirements and are on track to graduate.

Financial Aid information for Families To obtain financial aid information about your students' tuition, access must be granted that will allow the parent to retrieve and inquire about a student's account. Our financial aid website walks you through the steps of gaining access. Send a care package For some, transitioning from home to a college campus can be difficult. Show your student that you are thinking of them by sending a care package! Our Campus Market offers care packages throughout the year that can be sent to your student to brighten their day.
