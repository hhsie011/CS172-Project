Start a search in WorldCat and we'll search BruKnow and BorrowDirect. If we can't find a circulating copy at Brown or from one of our direct borrowing partners, we'll place an Interlibrary Loan request for you. Tracking Your Requests After you place an easyBorrow request, you will receive a follow-up email with tracking and contact information. You may track and view all of your easyBorrow requests in a single interface. If, instead of using easyBorrow, you prefer to make your own selection among our borrowing partners, use our borrowing options guide. You will have to re-key your search and re-authenticate for each service. For questions about easyBorrow, contact rock@brown.edu or call 863-2165. Please send feedback to libweb@brown.edu.
