The positive energy of student staff adds to the vitality of the Straight while providing practical information and guidance regarding events, activities and meetings. They serve as a resource to help answer questions and guide people throughout campus as well as support the programmatic aims of registered student organizations. Staff can assist other students with: reserving a space in R25; event registration; what to consider when planning a program/event; basics for budget management; and, assistance with some SAFC/GPSAFC items. Willard Dickerman Straight, Class of 1901, was an artistic, boisterous architectural student with a derring-do attitude who got things done. To raise money for athletics, he established what became Spring Day—a precursor to Slope Day—and organized a College of Architecture Day on St. Patrick’s Day – precursor to today’s Dragon Day. The staff live daily the words written in his will to his wife Dorothy “do such things for Cornell University as you may think most fitting and useful to make Cornell a more human place”. When you think you have solved a riddle and come to us to ask the answer or we hand you a bag of warm, delicious popcorn, recall that we are engaging you in this sense of your humanness, a sense that you matter and that your day is better for crossing the path of the staff.
