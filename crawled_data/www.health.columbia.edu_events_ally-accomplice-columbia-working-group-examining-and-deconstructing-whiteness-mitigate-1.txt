This virtual group aims to begin to equip students with the time, space, and skills for the self-reflection and processing of privilege that is necessary to meaningfully dismantle systems of racial oppression from a position that has privilege. Through increasing self-awareness and centering justice, as well as the recognition of history and its impact on the present, students will build skills around empathy, responsibility in action, and interrogation of knowledges we use and value while centering compassion, healing, and vulnerable, open dialogue. * We ask that you be able to attend all 5 sessions in Zoom on 7/7; 7/14; 7/21; 7/28, 8/4. Although this space is not private, confidential, or considered a support group, participants are asked to be respectful and mindful of each other and practice discretion.
