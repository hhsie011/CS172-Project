While with Cincinnati Opera, the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, and Des Moines Metro Opera, she worked on newly composed works and in various theatrical mediums, which inspired her to explore the ways theatre can be used as a vehicle for social change. She is focused on creating art that highlights the nuances of lived experience, encourages common ground, and promotes increased social engagement. Joyner currently lives in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Recently, she performed the role of The Countess in The Little Theatre of Winston-Salem’s production of Agatha Christie’s Murder on the Orient Express, and performed the role of Corvina in Volpone at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts in April. Outside of the arts, Joyner is passionate about fighting human trafficking and currently serves as a volunteer student coordinator with the International Justice Mission. She wants to partner with anti-trafficking organizations to engage survivors with the arts, providing an opportunity for survivors to tell stories, assist in finding their voices, and help inspire a sense of compassionate community. Prior to her studies at UC, she attended Boston University and graduated Summa Cum Laude in 2018 with a degree in Voice. She is a member of Pi Kappa Lambda.
