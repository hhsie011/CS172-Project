Bruce Duthu NAS Course Descriptions in the ORC NAS 85 & 86 Rules Share Honors Program Students interested in completing a sustained independent research and writing project may apply to the Honors Program. NAS 86 and 87 NAS 86: Independent Research in NAS and NAS 87: Honors Program. This course sequence entails the writing of a thesis as part of the NAS Honors Program. Students seeking admission into NAS 86 and NAS 87 must submit a written proposal prior to the end of spring term of their junior year. To qualify for admission into the NAS Honors program, students must meet the college minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.00 and must also have at least a 3.33 cumulative grade point average in NAS courses. The proposal is submitted to the chair of the program and must be approved by vote of the full-time faculty of the program. It must include the following components: an overview of the project that clearly explains your academic plan in some detail, including the subject matter and the essential research question(s) to be investigated. Thesis projects that take the form of a traditional research paper must be about 100 pages in length (excluding endnotes, bibliography, tables, etc.); a description of your preparation for undertaking such work; here, your basic goal is to show that you're prepared to undertake a project of this magnitude & have the requisite academic and personal qualifications to do so, working mostly independently (though supervised by a faculty member). Your evidence could include prior coursework; other independent study projects; work experiences, etc. that respond to the points above; a description of prior research in your proposed research area, including a bibliography of source material (primary and secondary sources) that you have or will consult as part of the research for this project; identifies your faculty supervisor (you should consult with and confirm the agreement of an NAS faculty member to serve as your thesis advisor before submitting your proposal); describe the academic work remaining on your schedule for the coming year to meet graduation requirements; this is to ensure that you'll have the necessary time to devote to your thesis project. This should also include a statement of your plans to reduce your extra-curricular activities to maximize the time available to focus on this major project. A senior thesis is a huge investment of your time and energy and radically more demanding than most students imagine. All Terms: Arrange This course is open only to majors and double majors by arrangement with the Chair. The course requires the completion of a formal thesis. Please consult the rules for this course as detailed above. Prerequisite: Native American Studies 85, 86, and permission of the Chair of the program and the faculty member who will be advising the student. NAS Department Chair: N.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Native American and Indigenous Studies Undergraduate Overview Major and Minor Courses Honors Program Waitlists and Applications NAS 85 Independent Study Rules & Procedures NAS Students Writing Prize Award Recipients Alumni - Tell Us Your Story 2020 2021 Funding for Internships and Independent Research Off-Campus Program Research Overview Gordon Russell Visiting Professorship Gordon Russell Visiting Professorship Alumni Charles Eastman Fellowship Eastman Fellowship Alumni Tribal Scholar Fellowship Program Tribal Scholar Fellowship Alumni Resources News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
