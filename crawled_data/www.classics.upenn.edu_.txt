(pre-COVID) Penn Senior Olivia Wells experiments with ancient Roman cookery ‹ › The study of antiquity is full of surprises. We constantly learn new things about the ancient Greek, Hellenistic, and Roman worlds, and their interactions with multiple other cultures. Our work is inherently interdisciplinary: we use historical, linguistic, literary and archaeological methods to understand ancient societies in their entirety. We celebrate opportunities for dialogue with colleagues in other fields, and with contemporary artists and writers. Premodern cultures were very different from any in the contemporary world. They can also seem similar, often in unexpected ways. In looking to the distant past, we are challenged to ask new questions about the present. Interpretations of the ancient past have shaped, and continue to shape, modern identities. We repudiate the uses of Greek and Roman antiquity in both scholarly and popular contexts as tools for oppression and exclusion. In our teaching, research and public engagement, we work for a more equitable and inclusive study of antiquity.
