Denning T&M Curriculum Program Faculty & Staff Admissions T&M Corporate Affiliates Denning T&M Program News The Denning Technology & Management (T&M) Program creates cross-functional leaders of the future through a rigorous curriculum, training in business communications, and frequent interaction with Corporate Affiliate executives. The Denning T&M Program now has three minors available to Georgia Tech undergraduate students: Computing & Business, Engineering & Business, and Technology & Business. Please find your curriculum based on your major college and concentration below.

In an integrated capstone project course, interdisciplinary teams focus on a specific problem posed by one of the program's Corporate Affiliates. These projects address problems of significant technical and managerial issues.
