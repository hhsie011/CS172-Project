Please review the information below to confirm your eligibility for Room Selection. Who is Eligible for Room Selection? Expand all Collapse all First-Year Students, Sophomores, and Juniors Room Selection is open to all currently enrolled First-Year, Sophomore, and Junior undergraduates in Columbia College or the School of Engineering and Applied Science who reside in Columbia Housing, are studying abroad with a Columbia-approved program, or First-Year students approved to commute. Fifth-Year Seniors Students who are enrolled in the specific 4-1 SEAS programs or ASP program are guaranteed 10 semesters of Housing, provided they meet all other eligibility requirements. These students participate in Room Selection with rising-Senior status (30 points). 3-2 Combined Plan Students Students who entered Columbia with the 3-2 Combined Plan SEAS program are guaranteed housing only their first year of the program. For their second year, only 74 students are selected through the 3-2 Combined Plan lottery that takes place prior to Room Selection. Students selected will be able to participate in Room Selection with rising-Senior status (30 points). Who is Ineligible? Expand all Collapse all Non-Guaranteed Students Non-guaranteed students are not eligible to participate in Room Selection. Students lose their guaranteed housing status if they have taken a voluntary leave of absence, moved off campus, were forced to withdraw, or lost housing for another judicial reason. Non-guaranteed students must submit a Housing Application at the beginning of May. See Housing calendar for dates. Applicants are prioritized on the Waitlist according to class standing, their permanent residence's proximity to campus and date of application. Waitlist applicants are assigned to vacancies once all guaranteed students are assigned as rooms become available, either prior to or after the start of the semester. Housing availability for non-guaranteed students is generally not known prior to the start of the academic year. Availability will be assessed over the course of the summer. Students on Leave Students who are readmitted by their school’s Advising Dean may apply for Housing for the upcoming year. As part of the Housing application, students can indicate their room preference and will be assigned according to their class standing, preferences and Housing availability. The application will be posted at the beginning of May. See Housing calendar for dates. Non-Senior Barnard Students Barnard Students, with current Junior, Sophomore or First-Year standing are not eligible to participate in Columbia Housing Room Selection. Visiting and Exchange Students Visiting and exchange students are not eligible to participate in Room Selection. Students Living Off Campus Students who moved off campus are not eligible for Room Selection, but may apply as a Non-Guaranteed student. The application will be posted at the beginning of May. See Housing calendar for dates. Seniors Entering a Graduate Program Current Seniors in Columbia College or SEAS who have been accepted into a Columbia graduate program are not eligible.
