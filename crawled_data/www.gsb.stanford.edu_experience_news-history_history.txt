Image Since its creation in 1925 as a west coast alternative to eastern business schools, the school has continued to innovate its curriculum, build a legendary faculty known for its cutting-edge research, and establish centers and academic programs to achieve its mission. As the school continues to flourish, we will strive to remain at the forefront of management education. Significant Events in Stanford GSB’s History 1925 – 1930 1925 Following a gathering of business leaders at the Bohemian Grove convened by Stanford alumnus and future U.S. President Herbert Hoover, the Stanford Graduate School of Business is established. The aim of the school is to halt the trend of bright business students going east for a degree and never returning. Willard Hotchkiss, first dean of Stanford GSB, arrives in July. The School opens its doors on October 1. 1927 First two MBAs awarded to Charles Harold Overfelt and Melvin Stephen Sanguinetti, sole members of the first graduating class. 1930 Gertrude Benedict and Helen Carpenter are the first women graduates of Stanford GSB. 1931 – 1940 1931 Jacob Hugh Jackson becomes the second dean of the business school, a position he will hold until 1956. Students establish the Business School Club, which sponsors a weekly 50-cent dinner and guest speaker program for students and faculty. First GSB PhD awarded to Harrison Val Hoyt. 1933 The Stanford GSB Library opens with 7,000 books. Business School Club members donate $200 for a fund to support needy students with small loans. By 1940, the fund grew to $4,537. 1937 The school moves from Jordan Hall to new quarters in the History Corner of the Quad. 1939 Professor Paul Holden completes the first survey of business school alumni. 1941 – 1950 1941 World War II affects the school as MBA enrollments dip. As special war emergency measures, degrees are offered in industrial administration and in business administration. By 1944, the U.S. Office of Education also sponsors a course focused on wartime economics and the war industries. 1946 Students flood back from World War II. A housing shortage and an increase in married students changes student living patterns. The Stanford Business School Alumni Association (known as the Stanford GSB Alumni Association today) is organized to bring together the 700 graduates the school has in 1946. The association holds its first postwar annual dinner in July 1946. 1948 With servicemen and women returning in droves, the employment picture for the class of 1948 is rosier than at any time in the school’s history. 1951 – 1960 1952 The Executive Development Program offers its first classes to business managers. It will become known as Executive Education in a few years. 1954 The University Board of Trustees approves creating the Stanford Business School Fund. Business school faculty help rehabilitate the School of Administration in Manila after the end of World War II. 1956 Dean J. Hugh Jackson retires after 25 years, succeeded by Acting Dean Carlton A. Pederson. The school’s library is named the Jackson Library in his honor. Willard Eugene Hotchkiss, first Dean of Stanford GSB, dies as a result of an automobile crash near Salinas, CA. 1957 The Sloan Program (renamed the Stanford MSx Program in 2013) is founded under a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. 1958 Ernest C. Arbuckle becomes third dean, and puts the school on the road toward recognition as one of the nation’s best. 1959 Dean Arbuckle creates the school’s Advisory Council. Two major documents on business education, the Gordon-Howell Report (co-authored by James Howell) and the Pierson Report, suggest a new, more academically rigorous direction for business education in America, and influence the growth of the school. 1961 – 1970 1961 To help train faculty members from business schools in emerging countries, the ICAME program is established under a grant from the Ford Foundation. By 1967 the program has 214 students representing 63 universities in 25 countries. 1962 Death of J. Hugh Jackson, longest serving dean in the school’s history. 1963 Under a U.S. State Department initiative, the ESAN program is founded, directed by Gail Oxley, to create a school of business in Peru. A project is set up through ESAN, the business school, and the Peace Corps to train recent MBA graduates and send them to Columbia and Peru. Class of 1965 applicants soar to 976, representing greater geographic diversity. Faculty teach summer courses in Paris, Rome, and Frankfurt. 1966 The business school dedicates its new building (later named GSB South), and moves out of the Quad. Stanford GSB and the Stanford Law School launch a joint degree program. 1967 The Stanford Business School Trust is established with $85,000 in pledges and gifts. 1968 Ernest C. Arbuckle steps down as dean, establishing a tradition of decade-long tenures by famous saying it’s time to “repot.” He is succeeded by Acting Dean Pete Pond. That year, Arbuckle is the first recipient of the Arbuckle Award for leadership, created by the business school’s Alumni Association. Under a grant from the Ford Foundation, the school creates management education programs in Yugoslavia for executives and educators. A committee on minorities chaired by Professor Gail Oxley recommends that the school include material on racial and urban problems in courses and increase its recruiting of disadvantaged students. 1969 Arjay Miller becomes fourth dean. A volunteer student group called the Business Development Association helps more than 100 small businesses, including several minority-owned businesses in East Palo Alto. The class of 1969 dwindles to 252 students as the Vietnam War rages on. Twenty-seven students leave school to enlist and avoid being drafted. 1970 By a margin of 3 to 1, business school students approve a three-day strike to protest U.S. troops in Cambodia. Stanford President Kenneth Pitzer orders the University closed on May 8 as a cooling-off period. With nine other U.S. business schools, Stanford forms a council to encourage increased minority enrollment. At the business school, enrollment of minority students increases from 4 in 1968 to 37 in 1970. 1971 – 1980 1971 Computers become available for student use. Under the leadership of Arjay Miller, an MBA Program is launched to prepare students for careers in government and other nonprofit organizations. It will become known as the Public Management Program. 1972 The number of women students continues to grow — 34 are enrolled in the Class of 1974 (in contrast, there were two in the Class of 1964.) The Student Association earmarks 20 percent of its revenue to establish fellowships for minority students. 1974 MBA applications increase 25 percent: 16 percent of the enrolled students are international and 20 percent are women. 1977 The first of the View From The Top speaker series is held, featuring Ron Daniels, CEO of McKinsey & Company. 1978 The university purchases a DEC System 20 computer. 1979 Arjay Miller retires in June. He is succeeded by Acting Dean Robert Jaedicke. 1980 Rene McPherson is named fifth dean. McPherson, who had been in a serious auto accident in 1979, resigns as dean in 1982.

The ‘Pillars of Hercules’ sculpture is installed in front of the school. 1983 George Leland Bach, a key figure in building the quality of the school’s faculty, retires. Three courses in entrepreneurship are offered at the school. The Spring Fling continues as one of the most lighthearted and enduring business school traditions. 1984 The school offers two elective courses designed around microcomputers. A computer-driven course-bidding system for students, known as “Le Grande,” is introduced. A donation from Edmund W. Littlefield launches a fund drive for a new business school building. Joanne Martin becomes first tenured female faculty member. The first Challenge for Charity is held. 1986 Former Dean Ernest C. Arbuckle and wife, Kitty, are killed in an auto accident in Monterey, CA. 1987 The Challenge for Charity raises $30,000 for Special Olympics. MBA alumnae Debbie Pine and Alison Elliott create the Alumni Consulting Team (ACT) to provide pro bono consulting for nonprofits. A loan forgiveness program is created for MBA graduates working in the nonprofit sector. Fifty MBA students take a study tour of Japan. 1988 The Littlefield Management Center, built to house a growing faculty, is dedicated. 1989 The 7.1 Loma Prieta earthquake damages school buildings; the library is especially hard hit. 1990 A. Michael Spence becomes seventh dean of the business school as a sagging economy causes a budget squeeze at the University. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev visits the Stanford campus and the business school. William F. Sharpe becomes the first at the business school to win the Nobel Prize. Charles T. Horngren, Edmund W.
