Kozelka Academic Appointments The Robert A. 1925 and Catherine L. McKennan Postdoctoral Fellow My research interests include the US-México border; the phenomenology of healing; migration and health; ethnographic methods; and global mental health. My previous research focused on therapeutic experience in community-based (non-biomedical) drug treatment in the United-States-Mexico border zone. My ongoing research explores cross-border conceptions of mental illness and substance use as well as their relationship to care-seeking and therapeutic experience.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Anthropology Undergraduate Overview Major Modified Major Minor Global Health Minor How to Declare an Anthropology Major or Minor Courses Introductory Courses Archaeology Biological Anthropology Cultural Anthropology Independent Study Culminating Seminars Past Teaching Schedules Honors Program Honors Proposal Submission Form Transfer Credits Careers Alumni: Where Are They Now?
