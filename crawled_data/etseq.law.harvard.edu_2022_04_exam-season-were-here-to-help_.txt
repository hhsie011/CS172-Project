Prepare for Exams Research Librarian Catherine Biondo has updated her guide to help you prepare for law school exams. It contains links to study aids, past exams, research guides, ideas for study breaks and wellness, the HLS Registrar’s exams information site, and pictures of the late lamented Grumpy Cat in full exam denial mode.

Keep Calm and Carry On Did you know that the Harvard Center for Wellness offers Harvard community members a wealth of wellness resources? Offerings include courses on yoga, meditation, and more; bodywork such as massage and acupuncture; a list of quiet places on campus; and free recorded meditations.
