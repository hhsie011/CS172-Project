Graduates in this 2016 photo celebrate their achievement.Denise Wise/University of Washington University of Washington’s 147th commencement ceremonies are scheduled to return this June to in-person celebrations in Alaska Airlines Field at Husky Stadium for the first time since 2019. Similar in-person commencement ceremonies are being planned for UW Bothell and UW Tacoma. Two afternoon celebrations are planned in Seattle: The first, on Saturday, June 11, 2022, will recognize the class of 2022; the second, on Sunday, June 12, 2022, will welcome graduates from the classes of 2020 and 2021 who return to the Seattle campus to walk in person. “We are thrilled beyond words to not only celebrate our outstanding class of 2022, but to at last come together with the classes of 2020 and 2021 and honor their extraordinary achievements and sacrifices during uniquely challenging times,” said Denzil Suite, UW’s vice president for Student Life. “This is a celebration of what’s to come, a recognition of what has been and really a tribute to the dynamism and resilience of our students and our UW community.” Commencement ceremonies in 2020 and 2021 were held online due to public safety concerns related to the coronavirus pandemic. Campus officials pledged on-campus, in-person ceremonies for the classes of 2020 and 2021 once safety could be ensured. This year’s events will be held in accordance with local public health guidelines. Each of UW’s three campuses plan to return to in-person commencement ceremonies.

There are also plans for two ceremonies each for UW Tacoma and UW Bothell to accommodate graduates from 2020, 2021 and 2022. UW Tacoma will host two ceremonies at the Washington State Fairgrounds in Puyallup on Monday, June 13.
