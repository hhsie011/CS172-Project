Campus tours are only offered for groups of 10 or more members of students in their sophomore, junior and senior years of high school only. Our visits include an information session and tour. These two hour visits, led by current BC students, will introduce your students to our community, academic buildings, and several academic, social, and spiritual resources to help them envision being a student at Boston College. Attendees will be encouraged to ask questions. Summer group visits begin on Tuesday, June 27th and will be available through Thursday, August 12th. Advance registration is required. We will not be able to accommodate walk-in visitors. To prioritize the health and safety of our staff, visitors, and the University community, we have incorporated new visitor policies and guidelines. This includes mandatory proof of vaccination against COVID-19. Please review these policies in advance of scheduling your visit to campus. Please register below and help us learn more about your group. All forms must be completed at least two weeks prior to your requested date. We will reply to your request within 10 business days.
