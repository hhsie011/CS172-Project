The Core Curriculum enhances the individual degree program and university graduation requirements, and all three areas must be met by every student. Given the rapid evolution of necessary knowledge and skills and the need to take into account global, national, state, and local cultures, the core curriculum ensures that students will develop the essential knowledge and skills they need to be successful in college, in a career, in their communities, and in life. The core curriculum acts to enrich and broaden the University’s tradition of providing thorough preparation in each student’s academic major and preparing students for a lifetime of learning. The University Core Curriculum requirements are described in the section that follows. These requirements must be met by every student entering Texas A&M University on or after the 2014 fall semester. Students entering earlier will be guided by the core curriculum in the catalog upon which they entered the university. Individual degree programs may require that specific courses from the core curriculum be used to satisfy core curriculum requirements. Please check with individual program advisors for details. Students transferring course credit to satisfy the Core Curriculum requirements should refer to the Texas Common Course Numbering System. Texas A&M University branch campuses in Galveston and Qatar do not offer all of the courses included in the Texas A&M core curriculum. All campuses offer courses in each Foundational Component Area so that students can complete the core curriculum at their home campus. However, the Galveston and Qatar campuses have a limited number of courses in each Foundational Component Area. Students should consult their academic advisors for information on core curriculum courses available at their specific campus. The core curriculum focuses on the development of six skills that have been shown to be effective in preparing students for the job market and their role in a diverse world and democratic society. Critical Thinking Skills – to include creative thinking, innovation, inquiry, and analysis, evaluation and synthesis of information. Communication Skills – to include effective development, interpretation and expression of ideas through written, oral and visual communication. Empirical and Quantitative Skills – to include the manipulation and analysis of numerical data or observable facts resulting in informed conclusions. Teamwork – to include the ability to consider different points of view and to work effectively with others to support a shared purpose or goal. Personal Responsibility – to include the ability to connect choices, actions and consequences to ethical decision-making. Social Responsibility – to include intercultural competence, knowledge of civic responsibility, and the ability to engage effectively in regional, national, and global communities. Students develop and practice these skills in the context of 42 semester credit hours assigned to eight Foundational Component Areas, each made up of a selection of courses that meet the definition provided by the Texas Core Curriculum.
