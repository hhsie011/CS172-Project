Interactions and collaborations among its members and other scientists, engineers and mathematicians have made the Lefschetz Center for Dynamical Systems one of the leading groups in dynamical systems and control theory in the world. The Lefschetz Center for Dynamical Systems originated in 1964, when a large group of mathematicians and control theorists came to Brown from the Research Institute for Advanced Studies (RIAS) in Baltimore. Solomon Lefschetz (1884-1972), its first director, was one of the most outstanding mathematicians of this century. The Center has been privileged to name itself in his honor for these many years.
