Students learn to ask questions, challenge assumptions, and explore answers to promote the health and well-being of communities, locally, nationally, and globally. By integrating the diverse areas of public health, students are introduced to the determinants of health, emerging diseases, access to health care and modes of health-care delivery, the geography of health, and the effects of environment on health and disease. The major provides undergraduates with competencies in health, ethics and social justice, social science, natural science, policy and politics, and environment with particular emphasis on collaboration, communication, and critical thinking across these domains. An undergraduate degree in public health provides a grounding in science, values, passion, and commitment which is valuable for a range of career and educational options across multiple disciplines. Instructional and Research Facilities: The School of Public Health has five departments -- Biostatistics, Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, Epidemiology, Global Health, and Health Services -- as well as interdisciplinary programs such as the Public Health major, Maternal and Child Health, Nutritional Sciences, Pathobiology, and Public Health Genetics. The School has over 30 research centers, including Institute for Public Health Genetics, Northwest Center for Public Health Practice, Center for Public Health Nutrition, Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, and the Health Promotion Research Center. Administration and teaching are primarily in the Magnuson Health Sciences Center. Honors Options Available: With College Honors (Completion of Honors Core Curriculum and Departmental Honors); With Honors (Completion of Departmental Honors requirements in the major). See adviser for requirements. Research, Internships, and Service Learning: Majors are encouraged to engage in experiential learning. See adviser for details. Department Scholarships: See adviser for details. Student Organizations/Associations: Undergraduate Student Public Health Association (USPHA). Public Health Dawgs (PhDs).
