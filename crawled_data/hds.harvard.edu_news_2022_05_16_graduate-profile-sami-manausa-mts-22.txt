Memorable Moment The first week of fall classes of my second year was surreal since it was the first time I could gather in person with the HDS community. After a year on Zoom, it was wonderful (and a little bizarre) to see so many people in 3D for the first time. Message of Thanks Every interaction I had with HDS community members impacted and inspired me. In particular, I’d like to thank Professor Diane Moore for always challenging me (in the best ways!) as both my advisor and my teacher. Thanks as well to Professor Jon Levenson, who I met when I first toured HDS in 2019 and whose classroom and office hours I have enjoyed so much since. What I Hope to Be Remembered By I hope to be remembered as someone who was passionate and enthusiastic about learning and being a student. I hope I am remembered for always trying to listen and remain open to the perspectives of others.
