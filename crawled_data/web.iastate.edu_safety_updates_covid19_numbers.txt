Iowa State University provides weekly updates on campus COVID-19 testing results as well as county- and state-level data provided by the Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Updates are published on Wednesdays. The CDC has developed new COVID-19 Community Levels to help communities decide what prevention steps to take based on the latest data. The three levels (low, medium and high) are based on the number of hospital beds being used, hospital admissions and the total number of new COVID-19 cases in an area. These data act as an early warning indicator of potential increases in health system strain in the event of a COVID-19 surge. The CDC implemented the new levels because community transmission indicators don't reflect medically significant disease nor healthcare strain accurately under the current circumstances. Take precautions to protect yourself and others from COVID-19 based on the COVID-19 Community Level in your area. As the pandemic has evolved, so too has Iowa State's public health infrastructure. COVID-19 vaccines are now widely available and the university has modified its testing strategies. Thielen Student Health Center (TSHC) provides testing for symptomatic students. This is a significant difference from the 2020-21 academic year when the university provided centralized testing for symptomatic and asymptomatic students, faculty and staff. Testing is now widely available in the community and state. For more information see the university's COVID-19 testing page. The campus data listed below should not be compared to data from last year. Campus testing Campus data is for the prior week (Monday-Sunday) and includes symptomatic student testing and NCAA-required athletics testing. The campus positivity rate is specific to on-campus testing and does not include self-reports from the residence halls, sororities and fraternities.
