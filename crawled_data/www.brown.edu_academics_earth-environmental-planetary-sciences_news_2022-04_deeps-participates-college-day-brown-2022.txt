The immersive one-day program introduced these students to the world of higher education and explore a wide range of opportunities through three interest-based tracks: STEM, Liberal Arts, and Social Impact. DEEPS was proud to participate in the College Day program STEM with two engaging options. The first was led by Kristin Kimble, facilitated by Iman Khanbhai, Duncan Jurayj, and Weimin Su, and organized by Outreach Coordinator Olga Huber. Participants had a hands-on opportunity to answer the question, “how do we know our climate has changed over time?” by looking at foraminifera through microscopes to learn about ancient climates. The second was led by Associate Professor and Interim Director of the NASA Rhode Island Space Grant Ralph Milliken, in which students learned about the nature of asteroids, NASA’s missions to explore nearby asteroids, and their importance for future deep space exploration. Samples of asteroid were passed around for closer inspection, and students asked questions about working with NASA and other space-field opportunties.
