Beware of Fraudulent Emails Requesting Quotes or Submission of Fraudulent Purchase Orders! Texas Tech University (TTU) Procurement Services Department wishes to alert suppliers/contractors of recent activity involving scams that appear to be asking for price quotes or submission of fraudulent purchase orders on behalf of TTU. We regret we are not able to prevent this illegal activity but will remain diligent in our efforts to report these scams to law enforcement to actively investigate this internet crime. Suppliers/contractors may also want to report this to your local law enforcement department. Please be aware of a few of the common signs of these fraudulent emails and be very suspicious of emails that include the following: Emails requesting extension of credit. This is not a normal practice for TTU to request this. Emails that request shipment or delivery to another address that appears to be off campus or to another state (we do have some out-of-state/out-of-town ship to addresses). TTU email addresses all end with “ttu.edu.” All communication from TTU Procurement Services will come from an email ending in @ttu.edu or the phone call will be from area code 806. To verify that you have received a valid purchase order, please check the following: The ship to section must reference the TTU ship-to code (that will start with a “T”). Purchase orders receive via email from Texas Tech University will end with one of the following domain names - sciquest.com or @ttu.edu. Faxed purchase orders are faxed from our e-commerce vendor." The “TechBuy” seal is in the upper left-hand corner. The Vendor Protest Procedures must be followed when a vendor is aggrieved in connection with a solicitation, evaluation, or award of a purchase or contract Protest Procedures. If you are unsure of the validity of a request or a purchase order, please contact the TTU Procurement Services Office directly at techbuy.purchasing@ttu.edu or at (806) 742-3844.
