Eligibility is limited to University of Kansas faculty and academic staff as defined by the Handbook for Faculty and Other Unclassified Staff. Graduate and undergraduate students may participate on teams as long as the primary researcher or instructor is a faculty member or academic staff. What is the selection criteria? Our selection criteria stipulates that proposals relate to an applicant's research or teaching agendas must be scaled to be accomplished in a week. Additionally, applicants must demonstrate how that the project will utilize librarians' skills. How many applications will be accepted? KU Libraries typically accepts between two and four proposals. What do I have to do to apply? Applicants should provide a brief narrative of their project and explain and detail their partnership with the Libraries. Applicants may find submission details and upload their application. What is the selection process? The Sprints Week organizing committee and relevant experts within KU Libraries will review the applications. To score the applications, referees will use our selection criteria rubric. What if I don't have an entire week for a Sprint or my project wouldn't require the full week? We are happy to still work with you! Email the Research Sprints committee at researchsprints@ku.edu and we will set up a consultation. What if I have further questions?
