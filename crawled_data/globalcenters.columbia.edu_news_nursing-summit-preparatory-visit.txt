July 09, 2015 Jennifer Dohrn, Assistant Professor of Nursing at Columbia University Medical Center and Director of the Office of Global Initiatives and its World Health Organization Collaborating Center for Advanced Practice Nursing, made a brief visit to Jordan on July 12-15, 2015. Her visit comes after the Global Nursing and Midwifery Research Development Initiative Summit Meeting, which was held on July 9 at the Columbia Global Centers | Africa (Nairobi). This visit was Professor Dohrn’s first to Jordan, made possible by the President’s Global Innovation Fund, which she was awarded in 2014, along with Elaine Larson, Anna C. Maxwell Professor of Nursing Research and Professor of Epidemiology at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University. The aim of the trip was to initiate preparations and planning for the Global Nursing and Midwifery Clinical Research Development Initiative that will take place in July 2016 at the Columbia Global Centers | Amman. Towards that purpose, the Amman Center organized a meeting on July 12 for leading academics and experts in the field of nursing and midwifery in Jordan to discuss the upcoming initiative. During the meeting, Professor Dohrn briefly introduced the concept of the initiative, and the group identified opportunities for future collaboration. The discussion informed the overall planning of the research summit to take place next year. During her stay, Professor Dohrn followed up on separate meetings with those identified as the potential core collaborators in Jordan: the WHO Collaborating Center in Amman, the Jordanian Nursing Council, and the University of Jordan. Professor Dohrn visited Zaatari Refugee camp near the city of Mafraq, to see the various health facilities and learn about some of the challenges and intricacies of urgent medical responses during crises. She met with various health care providers, social workers and government officials, and heard their different perspectives on Jordan’s response to the Syrian refugee crisis.
