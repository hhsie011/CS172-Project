(The 5th class day for Fall/Spring, and 3rd day for Summer I, II and Full). Dear Baylor Faculty, I hope the Spring semester is off to a great start for all of you. I am writing to ask for your help in ensuring that your Class Rosters are accurate for all of the classes that you are teaching. Accurate information about who is attending your classes is critical for a number of reasons, including the University’s ability to continue to receive the federal financial aid that benefits many of our students. Incorrect or incomplete information on our official class rosters can be quite detrimental, not just to our students, but to Baylor as a whole. A new Class Roster Verification System was implemented in Spring 2017, replacing the email process from the past. Please click on the following link to access the Class Roster Verification System for the classes you are teaching this semester: https://www1.baylor.edu/verifyroster For your convenience, a Class Roster Verification System link has been added to the Faculty & Staff webpage (you’ll see it listed on the right-hand side of the page toward the bottom). Once you have accessed the Class Roster Verification System, you will notice that you are being asked to “Report Attendance” of those students who are registered for your classes and to “Report Students Not Registered” who are attending. Please submit your attendance report for each class section that appears under “Report Attendance”. In addition, if there is a student who is attending but not on your class roster, please submit that information via the “Report Students Not Registered” tab. Brief instructions appear at the top of each page in the Class Roster Verification System. In addition, detailed instructions, including screenshots, can be found under the Help tab within the system. Also, I ask that you discreetly inform students who have enrollment discrepancies that they need to contact the Office of the Registrar, as soon as possible, to ensure that all records are accurate. Please submit the attendance reports for your classes as soon as possible, but no later than Wednesday, January 24, at 5:00 p.m. Thank you very much for your careful attention to this matter, and please let me know if you have any questions.
