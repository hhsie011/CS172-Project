A GSAPP student group was invited to present a basic introduction on their "Global Campus" project in Wenzhou, China. By introducing the campus' facilities, public spaces, and methods of transportation, they shared the planning process and goals of the project with the audience. They hoped these three aspects could connect and interact with each other to accommodate and serve the University, link Chinese and Western culture, as well as inspire and cultivate more people. Professor Maxine Griffith, the senior advisor to the president, delivered a detailed introduction on Columbia's Manhattanville campus. She started with the university's reasons for building a new campus and also shared information on locations, plans, and benefits. According to Professor Griffith, the Manhattanville campus reflects the most advanced ideologies of urban planning perfectly and has also brought positive impact on neighboring communities. Mr. Tom Wright presented a summary of the Regional Plan Association's Fourth Regional Plan through online connections. Mr. Wright serves as the president of the Regional Plan Association in New York. He introduced the three previous Regional Plans, and through pointing out problems faced by the New York-New Jersey-Connecticut metropolitan region, he explained how the Fourth Regional Plan would help build a better community. At last, the audience interacted actively with speakers during the Q&A session. They asked questions on the new campus' location, security, funding of urban planning, etc. Image Carousel with 11 slides A carousel is a rotating set of images.
