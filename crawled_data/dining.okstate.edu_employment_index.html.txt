Hear From Our Students The best part about working with Student Union dining is convenience. I am able to schedule around class times and club meetings, and it's only a five-minute walk to work from my dorm. Also, working at the Union has introduced me to some of my best friends in college. - Daniel Metroka I was fortunate enough to be a scholarship winner through Dining, which was very helpful in paying my college tuition. They have been very giving and very flexible throughout my three years of service. - Braeden Fields Working for UDS gave me an opportunity to build my teamworking and time management skills in a way that a classroom environment never could. - Christina Hulett APPLYFor a position today Fill out the application and a manager will be in contact with you.
