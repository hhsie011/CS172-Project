The Arabic Café invites you to our weekly meetings on Thursday evenings at 6:30 pm in Reed 311 to practice Arabic over tea, cookies, and an assortment of fun cultural activities. From honing our calligraphy skills to exploring the Arabic rap scene, our activities aim to ground learning Arabic in real-life contexts that showcase the rich diversity of the Arab world. Past events have included game nights, folktale readings, and musical performances, in addition to guest speakers ranging from author and AUC professor Lisa White to Mashrou' Leila's Hamed Sinno. Students and Dartmouth community members of all language levels are welcome and encouraged to attend. See you there, inshallah!
