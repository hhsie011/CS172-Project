Dartmouth students will carry a similar course load. Some departments may not allow you to take courses unless you have already had a course in their field prior to arriving in Copenhagen or if you have not fulfilled the prerequisites at Dartmouth. For example, if you never took a sociology course before, the Department of Sociology at the University of Copenhagen may not let you register for their courses. Also, some courses may be more advanced than their titles indicate. This may be especially true for courses in the economics department. If you are unsure about whether a course is too advanced for you, check with the international coordinators of each department. Finally, because Danish university students normally complete their Bachelor’s degree in three years, first year Master’s level courses are sometimes equivalent in difficulty to fourth year Bachelor’s courses at Dartmouth. Students from Dartmouth may take first year Master’s courses at Copenhagen University if they have the appropriate prerequisites. But again students should be careful not to get in over their heads in such courses. Transfer Credits Students can receive up to three credits at Dartmouth for work completed successfully at Copenhagen. You will receive 1 credit at Dartmouth for every 7.5 ECTS worth of credits at Copenhagen. (ECTS is the way Danes count credits for courses.) If you take 22.5 ECTS worth of credits, you will recieve three credits at Dartmouth. Obtaining Transfer Credit Approval Dartmouth requires students to obtain written approval of courses they wish to take at other universities in order for them to receive transfer credit for these courses. This includes the Dartmouth-Copenhagen exchange program. This must be done before the course is taken. Do not wait until the last minute to do this. It involves obtaining the appropriate transfer credit forms from the Registrar's Office, and seeking permission for transfer credit from the relevant department. Sociology courses are approved by the Sociology Department; government courses by the Government Department; and so on. At the department's discretion, students must often provide a copy of the course syllabus from Denmark and share it with the department from which transfer credit approval is being sought. This may take weeks to do so do not wait until the last minute. Grades received at Copenhagen are not recorded on the Dartmouth transcript. Instead, Dartmouth only records transfer credits as TR. Courses taken TR can be used for distributive credit at Dartmouth, if approved by the relevant department. A partial list of courses offered in Copenhagen and approved in the past for transfer credit to Dartmouth includes the following. Not all courses are necessarily available every year: Approving Dept.

A grade of 4 is equivalent to a C at Dartmouth. The Danish system of grading uses a 7 point scale with 12 being the highest grade—one achieved by only a small fraction of students. The Danish-U.S. equivalences and performance requirements as stipulated by the University of Copenhagen are as follows: Danish Scale Danish Performance Requirements USA Scale 12 For an excellent performance displaying a high level of command of all aspects of the relevant material, with no or only a few minor weaknesses A+ 10 For a very good performance displaying a high level of command of most aspects of the relevant material, with only minor weaknesses A, A- 7 For a good performance displaying good command of the relevant material but also some weaknesses B+, B 4 For a fair performance displaying some command of the relevant material but also some major weaknesses B-, C+, C 02 For a performance meeting only the minimum requirements for acceptance C-, D+, D 00 For a performance which does not meet the minimum requirements for acceptance D-, F -3 For a performance which is unacceptable in all respects F Transcripts and Reporting Grades to Dartmouth Grades for courses taken at the University of Copenhagen on available on-line in late January. Transcripts with these grades are sent to the Dartmouth Registrar by about mid-March.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Sociology Undergraduate Overview Majors Minors Honors The Thesis Proposal Past Honors Theses Courses Course Schedule by Term First Year Seminars Introductory Courses Methods Theory Lower Division Upper Division Culminating Experience Prizes & Awards Research Awards Transfer Credit Careers Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story What is Sociology?
