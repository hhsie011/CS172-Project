The survey is used to assist college health service providers, health educators, counselors, and administrators to collect data about their students' habits, behaviors, and perceptions on the most prevalent health topics: alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use sexual health weight, nutrition, and exercise mental health injury prevention, personal safety, and violence While other health surveys of college students cover a single topic area, such as alcohol and drug use, the ACHA-NCHA offers the broadest range of health issues, as well as the ability to map the results over an extended period of time. The assessment is conducted at UC every three years. 2016 NCHA Results 2020 NCHA Results For earlier survey data, email wellness.center@uc.edu.
