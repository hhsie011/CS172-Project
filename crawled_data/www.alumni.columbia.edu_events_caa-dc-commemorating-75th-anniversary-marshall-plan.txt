Marshall on June 5, 1947 in his Commencement speech at Harvard University has rightly been hailed as a decisive contribution to the reconstruction of war-ravaged Europe after the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945. Stalin, the wartime ally of the West, was originally included in the American reconstruction strategy but refused, so the Eastern Europeans, now firmly integrated into the emergent Soviet Bloc, were also unable to join the program. However, while the Western European nations were generally anxious to be part of the Marshall Plan, it took some quite heavy lifting to get the massive foreign aid package through Congress in Washington. This talk will therefore be divided into three parts covering the development, ratification, and American response to the Plan.
