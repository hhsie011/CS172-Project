Smalley Veterans Memorial Scholarship Clemson Veterans Living Library Clemson University Veterans Commission Clemson Corps Contact Us Military Credits for Clemson Students In an ongoing effort to increase veteran inclusiveness for Clemson military-connected students, we are creating ways to recognize the advanced training and schooling achieved through military service. Academic Credit for Military Training Clemson currently has a task force working to create a policy for reviewing Joint Service Transcripts and similar military documents to grant academic credit during the admissions process. Until that policy is established, student veterans are encouraged to work with their academic advisors to see if their military training can apply for credit using a Course Substitution Form or Credit-By-Exam. Cross Cultural Awareness (CCA) Credit for Overseas Military Experience If you have 3 or more months of overseas military experience, you may qualify for IS 1010, a one-credit pass/fail online course that, once complete, will grant Cross Cultural Awareness General Education credit. To enroll in IS 1010, contact Clemson Abroad at abroad@clemson.edu. For more information, visit the Study Abroad website.
