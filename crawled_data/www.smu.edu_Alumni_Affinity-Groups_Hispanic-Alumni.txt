The evening honors one or more deserving student scholarship recipients and celebrates the year's Distinguished Hispanic Alumni of SMU award winners. Fund scholarship From 1996 to 2012, college enrollment among Hispanics have more than tripled (240% increase), outpacing Blacks (72%) and whites (12%). However, while 45.8% of Hispanic students finish college within six years of initial enrollment, 62% of white students finish their degree in the same timeframe. Economics play a key factor. In 2009, we established the Hispanic Alumni Scholarship to help change that. Each year we award at least one scholarship. From 2009 to 2020 we awarded a total of 36 scholarships to deserving Latino or Latina upperclassmen or graduate students in need of financial assistance to complete his or her SMU degree.
