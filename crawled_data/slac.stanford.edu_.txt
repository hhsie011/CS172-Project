Job Seekers SLAC Staff Users Research Partners Media Suppliers SLAC Home Page COVID-19: Latest Information | Research at SLAC News Researchers aim X-rays at century-old plant secretions for insight into Aboriginal Australian cultural heritage By revealing the chemistry of plant secretions, or exudates, these studies build a basis for better understanding and conserving art and tools made with plant materials. Superconductivity and charge density waves caught intertwining at the nanoscale Scientists discover superconductivity and charge density waves are intrinsically interconnected at the nanoscopic level, a new understanding that could help lead to the next generation of electronics and computers. SLAC’s superconducting X-ray laser reaches operating temperature colder than outer space The facility, LCLS-II, will soon sharpen our view of how nature works on ultrasmall, ultrafast scales, impacting everything from quantum devices to clean energy. How a soil microbe could rev up artificial photosynthesis Researchers discover that a spot of molecular glue and a timely twist help a bacterial enzyme convert carbon dioxide into carbon compounds 20 times faster than plant enzymes do during photosynthesis. The results stand to accelerate progress toward converting carbon dioxide into a variety of products. What drives rechargeable battery decay? Depends on how many times you've charged it How quickly a battery electrode decays depends on properties of individual particles in the battery...
