Mentors would attend a minimum of one mentoring session per month. ELLIS Preparatory Academy is a resource-strapped high school in the Bronx for English learners who recently immigrated from countries all over Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. There are no lab rooms in the school, but its students are eager to learn and engage in scientific research! ELLIS Science Club, primarily run by Columbia students, provides high school students with the opportunity to pursue yearlong independent research projects in topics ranging from computer science to water chemistry to microbiology with additional opportunities for lab tours at Columbia or guest workshops. Columbia science and engineering students serve as mentors to help guide the student projects and teach experimental skills, data analysis, and presentation of scientific work as they develop meaningful mentoring relationships with the students.
