Kris Snibbe/Harvard Staff Photographer. Starting from the first day they arrive on campus, students are provided with both formal and informal opportunities to interact with faculty members on a deeper level. Professors will often spend time with students before and after class in addition to their weekly office hours. They have meals with students in dining halls and accept invitations to the First-Year Faculty Dinner. Many professors will attend House events, cheer students on during their athletic competitions, and support student theater performances and art showcases. Some students work closely with a professor in a research lab or act as an assistant for their work. In addition to these informal interactions with faculty, Harvard has a variety of Faculty-Student Initiatives that support first-year academic life and increase student-faculty engagement. These initiatives include workshops about study skills or library research, events like the First-Year Faculty Dinner, and more. Learn more about connecting with faculty.
