Maya recently worked as an undergraduate research assistant through the UHP Discover program and completed an internship with a federal judge from the Eastern District of Michigan. Additionally, she has been a long-time intern with the Ohio Innocence Project and aims to attend law school after graduating. She is particularly interested in criminal justice and hopes to spend some time working as a public defender. Outside of her studies, Maya is passionate about music: she has studied piano for 17 years, enjoys composing, and has begun learning sitar and tabla during her time at UC.
