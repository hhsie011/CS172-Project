The Student Government Association and the Office of Student Life have joined efforts to sponsor a coordinated community service project at least once a month for that organization. These events are one Saturday or Sunday a month for approximately four hours. Volunteering in this program is a great way to get to know students who have a heart for making a difference in the community and finding your volunteering niche! Past volunteering activities include Epworth Villa Retirement Community, Pumpkinville at the Myriad Botanical Gardens, and the Oklahoma Regional Food Bank. These community hours can be counted toward the SHINE program goal of 100 hours of community service beginning at the start of your college experience until graduation. All community service hours should be documented by completing the OSU-OKC Volunteer Form below. If you are interested in getting involved in SOS through our SGA, please contact the Office of Student Life at okc.studentlife@okstate.edu.

Individual Volunteer Activities and Projects We know that many of our students are community-minded and volunteer because they are passionate about a cause and recognize the importance of contributing to society by volunteering. Do you serve as a Sunday school teacher at your local church? Do you volunteer as a Big Brother or Big Sister? Do you take the time to mentor school children at your child’s school? All of these are examples of activities that can be included as hours counted toward the SHINE program goal of 100 hours of community service beginning at the start of your college experience until graduation. All community service hours should be documented by completing the OSU-OKC Volunteer Form below. If you are interested in reporting your individual community service volunteer experiences, please contact the Office of Student Life at okc.studentlife@okstate.edu. Student Organizations Student clubs and organizations provide students a wealth of volunteer opportunities throughout the year by organizing community service events, participating in organized community events (such as the seasonal Litter Blitzes, mentor programs, etc.) or volunteering at nonprofit agencies. Each organization is encouraged to engage in community service throughout the year and chooses service projects as an organization. These community hours can be counted toward the SHINE program goal of 100 hours of community service beginning at the start of their college experience until graduation. Current student clubs can be found here with a link to enroll in their respective Canvas groups (enrolled students only): https://osuokc.edu/studentengagement/organizations .
