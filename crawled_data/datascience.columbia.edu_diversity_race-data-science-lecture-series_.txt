With this series of events, our goal is to improve how we as data scientists and data-adjacent researchers speak about race. Through wide distribution of our speaker’s research, we envision that these talks can lead to the discovery of important resources about race, inequity, and emerging applications. This series is funded by support from the MacArthur Foundation and New America. Recordings View the archive of past lectures here. Lectures will be posted at the close of each event on DSI’s YouTube channel.
