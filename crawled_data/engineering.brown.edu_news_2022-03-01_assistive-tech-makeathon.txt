The makeathon was the brainstorm of Frances Imarhia ’22 and Benjamin Phelps ’22, both engineering concentrators who are members of H-Tech, an engineering-based club led by Brown undergraduates whose goal is to design, create and build for people in need. H-Tech was in need of a new project. Imarhia, a biomedical engineer, and Phelps, who will earn his A.B. in engineering with a mechanical and projects-based focus, are both monitors in the BDW. Simultaneously, Maddie Jacks, a Brown-RISD Master of Arts in Design Engineering graduate student who serves as the education representative of her cohort, had been reaching out to Tikkun Olam Makers and investigating the possibility of developing a community on campus. The threesome joined forces to offer an Assistive Tech makeathon that would run from Friday evening until Sunday afternoon. “STEAM used to do one, but hadn’t in a few years, and there were no plans to have one,” said Phelps, referencing the Brown-RISD student-led effort to ignite interaction between STEM and the Arts. Phelps used his contacts with Makers Making Change, a local maker community focused on economic and social inclusiveness for all people with disabilities, for a list of project ideas. As the makeathon progressed, project themes addressed such topics as mobility, inclusivity, and fine motor control issues. Raul Ayala and Lina Halim, both undergraduates leaning toward engineering concentrations, joined with professional engineers Michael Acton and David James to investigate a hands-free dog walking system, specifically for humans using crutches. MADE students Mark Aruajo and Raghav Rmadya connected with RISD’s Arvind Bhallamudi to begin building a software platform for reporting problems and documenting inaccessible spaces in built environments. The idea behind “Accessio” is to go beyond the bare minimum of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in a diverse and complex world, so that preventative measures can be taken before problems arise. A toilet paper dispenser empowering independence for someone with low fine motor skills was presented by MADE’s Seth Eiseman, undergraduate Sarosh Nadeem ’24 and Braingate research engineer Rekha Crawford. “Jack the Ripper” is portable and has a sharp edge for one-handed operation. “We were very pleased with the projects,” Imarhia said to the group at the conclusion of the presentations on Sunday. “And recognize that this is where Brown students thrive - creating and making things that will help others.” Brown University Providence RI 02912 401-863-1000 Quick Navigation Visit Brown Campus Map Footer Navigation Reservations Accessibility Careers at Brown The campaign for building on distinction Give To Brown Social Navigation Facebook Flickr Instagram LinkedIn Twitter YouTube © Brown University School of Engineering Brown University For You Prospective Students Current Students Faculty & Staff Alumni Parents & Families Search Menu Mobile Site Navigation Mobile Site Navigation Undergraduate ABET Accreditation Admissions Concentrations Contacts and Resources Courses Internships, Jobs, and Grad School New Student Information Student Organizations Undergraduate Awards Undergraduate Research Graduate Admissions Courses Programs and Deadlines Programs Guide Graduate Student Organizations Student Awards Entrepreneurship People Faculty Staff Advisory Boards Graduate Students Research Centers and Institutes Core Facilities Hibbitt Fellows Hope Street Fellows Industry Engagement Laboratories NIST PREP Research Interests Undergraduate Research Get Involved Alumni and Friends - Ways to Connect Contact Us Employment Make a Gift Prospective Employers Social Media Visit Us Mobile Secondary Navigation Navigation About Events News For You Give Now This Site Only All of Brown.edu People Search Search people Advanced Search Search Close Search Assistive tech makeathon takes over design workshop for weekend Open details for Assistive tech makeathon takes over design workshop for weekend Bookmark this Page
