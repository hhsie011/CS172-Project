How to Pay Your Bill Medical students are billed twice each academic year on a semester basis. The fall bill is available in early July and payment is due August 1. Spring bills are available in December and payment is due January 1. The billing process is paperless with on-line statements available at the Brown Payments website and the Self-Service Banner (SSB). Students may make payments, view billing information and may add authorized users to view their student account statement. For detailed instructions, please visit the Bursar Office website. Billing questions should be addressed with the Bursar Office (401-863-2484 or via email.) Refunds Once funding has been credited to your Bursar student account and all Brown charges have been paid for the semester, your account may reflect a credit balance. Credit balances are intended to cover part or all living expenses for a given semester. The amount of your credit balance will depend upon the aid amounts you accepted. Refunds are available electronically by completing a Refund Request Form and setting up the request to a US checking or savings account through the Brown Payments website. Students should receive the refund in their bank account 3-5 days from the date the request form is submitted.
