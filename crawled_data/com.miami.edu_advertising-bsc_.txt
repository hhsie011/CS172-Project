Undergraduate Program About the Program Strategic Acumen The Advertising program at the University of Miami offers students a strong foundation in the fundamentals of advertising, while at the same time, allowing them to specialize in the area of the advertising business that best suits their skills and talents. Students may pursue a degree in one of two curricular tracks: advertising creative and advertising management. Students in both tracks will learn how to create an effective, strategically sound advertising campaign for a real-world client. In addition to our exciting and contemporary curriculum, the Advertising program also offers students the chance to engage in out-of-the-classroom experiences to enrich their education. For example, qualified students may elect to participate in the internship program, which provides the opportunity to work in the professional community in the Greater Miami area or other regions. UM Advertising students regularly complete internships with major advertising agencies such as Crispin Porter + Bogusky, Ogilvy & Mather, Leo Burnett, Beber Silverstein, Alma DDB, and Young and Rubicam, among others. In addition, our students have interned at exciting places such as Cosmopolitan, and Glamour magazines, the Rachael Ray Show, MTV, Stella McCartney, and Universal Music Latin Entertainment.
