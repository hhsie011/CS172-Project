Graduate Degrees Master of Landscape Architecture, First Professional Degree (Public Policy Information) Master of Landscape Architecture, Post-Professional Degree Landscape Studies Minor (Undergraduate Students) The landscape studies minor provides a foundation in concepts related to the designed landscape for undergraduate students outside the School of Architecture. The landscape studies minor introduces environmental and cultural issues concerning the design, planning, and management of the built environment. The minor specifically targets undergraduates who desire exposure to how designed change impacts the places in which we live. The minor exposes students to the discipline of landscape architecture before pursuing graduate study in the design professions. The minor does not qualify a student for practice or professional landscape architecture licensure. The University's Undergraduate Catalog provides a complete description regarding the Landscape Studies Minor. ACCREDITATION, RANKING, + ACHIEVEMENTS The Master in Landscape Architecture, First Professional Degree is accredited by the Landscape Architecture Accreditation Board. The Landscape Architecture Program completed a self-evaluation report and on-site evaluation in the Fall of 2019. The program received a term for renewal of accreditation for six (6) years, in March of 2020. The program’s students have received numerous American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA) design awards at both state and national levels. Two of the faculty have been recognized nationally for their teaching. Hope Hasbrouck was named one of “The 25 Most Admired Educators” by Design Intelligence in 2012. Allan Shearer was included in the list of “Most Admired Educators” by the Design Futures Council in 2013. PUBLIC POLICY INFORMATION LAAB accredited programs are required to provide reliable information to the public. Programs must report on accreditation status and its performance. This information is to help students make informed application decisions. UT MLA Public Policy Document The Graduate Program in Landscape Architecture adheres to the Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Action Program Policy Statement established by The University of Texas at Austin. SUPPLEMENTAL EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS Students may choose from several programs to supplement their professional design education and specialize in particular topics of interest. These programs, offered through the University and the School of Architecture, build on a wealth of resources and faculty talent. Each can be pursued in tandem with the MLA. The Graduate Portfolio Program in Sustainability provides graduate students with a trans-disciplinary framework to study and research issues related to sustainability. Students may take courses from the School of Architecture, the LBJ School of Public Affairs, McCombs School of Business, College of Liberal Arts, College of Engineering, College of Natural Sciences, Jackson School of Geosciences, and the School of Education. The Certificate in Latin American Architecture gives students a unique opportunity to focus their studies on pressing urban issues common to all the Americas. Offered in conjunction with LLILAS and the Benson Library; and taught by School of Architecture Faculty – including Fernando Lara, Sarah Lopez, and Benjamin Ibarra-Sevilla – the certificate allows students to develop a comparative approach to architectural education and scholarship, and provide tools to engage in the effect that globalization has on architecture and place more broadly.
