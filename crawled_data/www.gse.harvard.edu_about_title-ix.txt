Instagram About HGSE Title IX Information Policies and Procedures Harvard instituted two University-wide policies, the Interim Title IX Sexual Harassment Policy and the Interim Other Sexual Misconduct Policy, on August 14, 2020. In addition, the University’s Sexual and Gender Based Harassment Policy addresses sexual harassment and other sexual misconduct alleged to have occurred between September 1, 2014 and August 14, 2020. HGSE Students HGSE has adopted the University-wide Interim Title IX Sexual Harassment Policy and Interim Other Sexual Misconduct Policy, as well as the Sexual and Gender Based Harassment Policy for sexual harassment and other sexual misconduct alleged to have occurred between September 1, 2014 and August 14, 2020. HGSE has also incorporated the University’s Interim Procedures for Handling Formal Complaints Against Students Pursuant to the Interim Title IX Sexual Harassment Policy and Interim Procedures for Handing Formal Complaints Against Students Pursuant to the Interim Other Sexual Misconduct Policy. The University’s Procedures for Handing Complaints Against Students Pursuant to the Sexual and Gender-Based Harassment Policy address sexual harassment and other sexual misconduct alleged to have occurred between September 1, 2014 and August 14, 2020. In all such cases, the Harvard University Office for Dispute Resolution (“ODR”) and the Harvard University Title IX Office are responsible for implementing the University’s grievance procedures, which will determine whether a student committed a policy violation. Whenever a formal complaint of sexual harassment or other sexual misconduct is investigated and the University’s grievance procedures result in a finding that a policy violation has occurred, the HGSE Committee on Rights and Responsibilities (CRR) must accept that finding as final and non-reviewable. The only opportunity to appeal the determination of a policy violation is provided within the grievance procedures implemented by the ODR and the Harvard University Title IX Office. Appeals within HGSE pertain only to the decision of the HGSE Committee on Rights and Responsibilities (CRR) in determining discipline. HGSE Staff The University-wide Interim Procedures for Handling Formal Complaints Against Harvard Staff Members Pursuant to the Interim Title IX Sexual Harassment Policy and Interim Procedures for Handling Formal Complaints Against Harvard Staff Members Pursuant to the Interim Other Sexual Misconduct Policy are now effective. Additionally, the Procedures for Handling Complaints Against Harvard Staff Members Pursuant to the Sexual and Gender-Based Harassment Policy (Procedimientos para el Manejo de Denuncias Contra Miembros del Personal) address sexual harassment and other sexual misconduct alleged to have occurred between September 1, 2014 and August 14, 2020.
