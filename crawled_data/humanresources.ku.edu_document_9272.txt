Applies to: Eligible faculty and staff appointed to regular positions as defined herein. Campus: Edwards Lawrence Juniper Gardens Parsons Yoder Topeka Policy Statement: Holidays are designated by the Governor and the Kansas Board of Regents eligible faculty and staff. University offices are closed for the majority of holidays, and most employees are not required to work unless they provide vital services. Pursuant to Kansas Board of Regents policy, University offices must remain open if classes are in session during designated or observed holidays. For example, the University will remain open on Veterans Day when scheduled classes will be in session. The University also may remain open and have scheduled classes on other designated holidays, i.e. Labor Day. Only those employees required to conduct necessary business should be required to work. In order for departments to ensure appropriate staffing levels, employees are required to request leave from their supervisors on such holidays. Departmental heads and supervisors shall take such steps as may be necessary to ensure that all employees required to work on holidays will be informed of the requirement to work in advance of the holiday. Holiday Eligibility: To be eligible for the paid holidays an employee must: hold an appointment to a “regular” position; work a “regular” schedule; and must be 48% or more full-time-equivalent (FTE). Paid Holiday Time: All eligible employees shall receive paid hours equal to the number of hours regularly scheduled to work for a holiday (e.g., If the employee is regularly scheduled to work ten (10) hours on the day this holiday is taken, the day is worth ten (10) hours; if the employee is regularly scheduled to work five (5) hours on the day this holiday is taken, the day is worth five (5) hours). Holiday Compensatory Time Eligibility: Fiscal-year employees appointed to regular positions who are required to work on a holiday will be eligible for holiday compensation as denoted by their employment category and position status as described herein. Salaried (exempt) and hourly (non-exempt) university support staff and hourly unclassified professional staff who work on a holiday earn one and a half (1.5) hours of holiday compensatory time for each hour worked on a holiday. Salaried (exempt) unclassified professional and academic staff who are required by their supervisors to work on a holiday earn one (1) hour of holiday compensatory time for each hour worked on a holiday. Otherwise they do not earn holiday compensatory time for working on a holiday. An employee shall be paid for the remaining balance of holiday compensatory time upon transfer to another department or agency, change in Fair Labor Standards Act status, resignation, retirement, or death. Exclusions or Special Circumstances: When a legal holiday falls upon a Saturday or a Sunday, the holiday will be observed on either Friday or Monday, respectively. Academic year faculty/academic staff, temporary employees (including student employees), and non-exempt, part-time, employees who work irregular schedules are not eligible for paid holidays. Employees that are furloughed or not in an active paid status on the designated holiday or the day before and after the holiday are not eligible for holiday compensation. Please review the Holiday Report Guide for more information regarding holiday eligibility and reporting. Contact: Department of Human Resource Management 103 Carruth-O’Leary Hall 1246 W.
