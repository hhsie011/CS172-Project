Campus Facilities and Services The proposed scope of work includes taking down St. Vincent Hall to construct a new energy efficient academic building with  active learning  classrooms, laboratories, simulation facilities, office space,  collaborative spaces and outdoor terraces. “The University’s new Health Sciences Center will enable St. John’s to train the next generation of caregivers at a time of tremendous change and opportunity in health care,” said  Rev. Brian J. Shanley, O.P., President. The design process is currently underway and work is expected to commence in the first quarter of 2022. The building is slated to be ready for occupancy and available for students and classes by Fall 2024. Health Sciences Center Construction Live Stream A building designed not just for today’s conditions but for tomorrow’s unimagined needs The building will be designed around an interior multi-story social common space. This “living room” will act as the heart of the academic program and promote both planned and chance interactions between students and faculty. Outside the building, new plazas and terraces will tie  directly into the campus walkway system and be populated with furniture, serving, and connecting with the greater campus community. Get to Know the Health Sciences Center The new building will feature a holistic and scalable approach to sustainability. It will be designed to accommodate an evolving series of  both campus and New York City sustainability initiatives.  It focuses those strategies on saving energy and contributing  mightily to the carbon reduction efforts for the entire University. The structural and mechanical systems will  allow for reprogramming of the spaces within the building. Individual teaching spaces can be easily reconfigured, and remote learning  seamlessly integrated into the curriculum. 70,000 Square Feet 2024 Expected Opening Date “The new Health Sciences Center will provide state-of-the-art technology and flexible room layouts to allow for a multitude of teaching and learning styles,” remarked  Russell J. DiGate, Ph.D., Dean, College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences. Enhancing the Queens Campus The Health Sciences Center will replace St Vincent Hall. The site is situated between the residential and the academic zones of St. John’s campus. The new building will act as a part of the larger ensemble, to positively shape and define the physical space of the Great Lawn. As such, its architectural character is quieter with respect to the more classical nature of St. Augustine and St. John Hall. And it takes on a more sculptural and colorful personality when facing the residential precinct.   Contact us The project will be led and overseen by the Office of Design & Construction.
