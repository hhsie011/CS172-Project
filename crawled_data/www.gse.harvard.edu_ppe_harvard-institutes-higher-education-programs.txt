The Harvard Institutes for Higher Education The Harvard Institutes for Higher Education (HIHE) offers comprehensive leadership development programs designed for higher education administrators — from directors, department heads, and deans, to vice presidents, provosts, and presidents. Because the leadership issues you face depend on your position, we group you with peers who share similar experiences and perspectives. Participants bring multiple perspectives from a broad range of institutions, including large research universities, comprehensive regional institutions, small liberal arts colleges, and community colleges — creating a rich, multi-layered and dynamic learning environment in which your thinking and approaches will be challenged and you will gain insight from the research and teaching of our outstanding faculty and your peers. With a world-renowned faculty, an almost 50-year history of advancing the practice of higher education administrators, and a vibrant network of thousands of alumni who maintain long-term relationships and return to HIHE as their careers advance, our programs will have a transformative impact on your practice.
