First, to support scholarly research among faculty and advanced students and to extend research networks for scholars on campus and beyond. Second, to host academics and artists as well as pundits and critical thinkers external to Brown who address not only timely and cutting edge research topics, but also persistent and pressing issues regarding race, ethnicity, and/or indigeneity in society. Our recently announced grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation has enabled CSREA to significantly expand its programs and opportunities. We have increased the resources to support existing programs and we have added new programs and initiatives related to supporting faculty research, hosting faculty visitors and artists, and facilitating dynamic and experimental teaching opportunities.
