Current Students Current: Student Advisory Board Student Advisory Board The Student Advisory Board is composed of students representing each academic department within the Wilbur O. and Ann Powers College of Business. These representatives are actively engaged in the college and provide a sounding board for student concerns. The Board works with the Dean and faculty of the college on projects to improve student learning and to enhance the student experience. Other responsibilities of the Board include selecting the Undergraduate Excellence in Teaching Award and Student Service Award recipients. Let Your Voice Be Heard Do you have questions, concerns, comments and/or opinions about the college? Please share your thoughts with the Student Advisory Board through the virtual Wilbur O. and Ann Powers College of Business suggestion box. Upcoming Events The SAB is sponsoring various events this year to allow students the opportunity to learn more about the college, express their opinions and meet with the Dean in a more personal setting. We welcome all students to take advantage of these opportunities. Dinner with the Dean Dinner with the Dean is an opportunity for students to have dinner with the Dean at Rick Erwin's restaurant providing a small setting to discuss the college, its future and what you, as a student, want and need. Space is limited to 10 students. Participants will receive an email invitation to the event. Open SAB Meetings The SAB meets every other Wednesday and invites you to attend open meetings. This provides an opportunity to not only learn more about the SAB but voice opinions directly, in person to the Board. Contact the SAB to join a virtual meeting. Student Advisory Board Representatives Your board members are here to help you. Utilize your assigned members to express your thoughts and opinions about the College. Students can also e-mail the SAB directly.
