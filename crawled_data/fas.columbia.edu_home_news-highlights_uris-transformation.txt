The building sits on the footprint of what was planned, in the 1890’s, to be a grand University Hall, a building that was finally built on a small scale (and to general ridicule—it was called “The Steamboat on the Hill”) in the 1920s due to lack of funding and then demolished in 1959 when Uris was built. Its central location, if not its architecture, has thus long been understood to be special, with the potential to define the university community and gather its people in an inspiring space at the heart of Morningside. President Lee Bollinger’s gift of Uris to the Arts and Sciences represents a once-a-century opportunity to seize this potential, to unify Morningside campus with truly common space. A transformational renovation of the lower floors of Uris Hall would allow the building to unite and inspire Columbians for the century to come. Just as Low Steps serve as the beloved outdoor common space for students, faculty, and community, a commons at Uris, occupying the lower floors of Uris Hall, could become their indoor counterpart. If resources are not available for transformational renovation that would make the space itself more inspiring, a more modest renovation, focusing on the priorities of common space and classrooms, can still fundamentally change the sense of unity in Arts and Science.

The committee will evaluate, among other things, the opportunities for student and faculty space conducive to innovative forms of research and teaching, and the question of when and if outside consultation might be useful to the program design process. It will be informed by the report of the Uris Visioning Committee from 2019 and by ongoing consultation with faculty, students, research librarians, CTL and other research and teaching supports on campus.

The AG will begin by understanding the current classroom inventory, including seating capacity, seating arrangements (e.g. fixed versus flexible), and the technology provided in these rooms and how those meet pedagogical needs. The AG will work with departments, institutes and centers, to identify the types of classrooms and technologies most needed to meet the demands for modern pedagogy. In addition, the AG will explore possible scheduling models to maximize use for classes as well as provide sufficient flexibility to meet the needs of academic units for conferences. The AG will report its findings to the EPPC, department chairs and at a faculty meeting(s) and will work closely with the Uris Design Faculty Group (to be established soon) and the architects for the renovation of Uris Hall (to be selected soon).
