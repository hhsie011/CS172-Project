Graduate students are guided through advanced coursework and research projects to a more theoretical understanding of the field. Our faculty educates individuals to use chemistry, physics, mathematics and engineering for the advancement of and solutions to social problems through technological innovation. TU’s chemical engineering degree program is historically tied to the energy industry but because students are educated broadly in their approach to design problems, graduates establish careers in many different areas. Students are also well prepared for graduate studies in chemical engineering or in professional programs such as medicine, law or business. As chemical engineering majors, students are encouraged to become members of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE). Learn more about TU’s AIChE chapter.
