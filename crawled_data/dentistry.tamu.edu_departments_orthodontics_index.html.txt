Historically, while the college taught the subject of Orthodontics in its undergraduate curriculum as far back as 1905, it was several decades later when Dr. Robert Gaylord, and his colleagues Drs. Tom Matthews and Tommy Williams recognized the need to establish a graduate training program. In 1959 the College of Dentistry set aside sufficient space for the new graduate orthodontic program and additional funds and equipment were solicited from several generous benefactors in the Dallas community to establish the new facility. The Orthodontic Department accepted its first class of five residents in the summer of 1961. Our Mission The Advanced Education Program in Orthodontics has as its mission to educate dentists in the specialty of Orthodontics in accordance with the guidelines set forth in the Standards for Advanced Specialty Education Programs prepared by the ADA Commission on Accreditation and the American Association of Orthodontists. Our Objective To provide the resident with a well-balanced educational experience, integrating a strong foundation in the basic sciences with a diverse clinical experience. Graduate a specialist with the highly refined analytical, clinical and management skills necessary to provide optimum oral health care.
