We understand the need for engaging, high-quality engineering content in our community and can’t wait for you to check out the new, digital formats for these two programs. While we unfortunately aren’t able to host lab visits on campus this year due to the ongoing pandemic, we’re delighted to bring you hands-on, engaging engineering design activities that you can do right in your own homes and classrooms. Each of these activity lessons tie in directly with NGSS standards and are inspired by Columbia Engineering research labs who have hosted visitors through our programs in the past.
