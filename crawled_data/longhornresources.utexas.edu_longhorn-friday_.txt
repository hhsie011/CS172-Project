It’s a way for Longhorns everywhere to show their Texas spirit, and it’s as simple as wearing burnt orange or the Longhorn silhouette every Friday. All Longhorns are invited to participate in Longhorn Friday: students, faculty, staff, alumni, fans, families, friends — even kids and pets! And there are lots of ways to join in on the Longhorn Friday fun: – wear your burnt orange best, – enjoy your morning coffee out of your favorite UT mug, – take a selfie with your horns up. However you celebrate, share a photo on social media using the hashtag #LonghornFriday! Longhorn Friday is a campus-wide effort to showcase the strength of the UT community and create a sense of belonging for Longhorns everywhere. Collaborating units include the Office of the Provost; the Division of Student Affairs; Student Government and the Senate of College Councils; University Communications; Texas Athletics; Texas Exes; Texas Development; the Office of Brand, Trademarks and Licensing; and the University Co-op.
