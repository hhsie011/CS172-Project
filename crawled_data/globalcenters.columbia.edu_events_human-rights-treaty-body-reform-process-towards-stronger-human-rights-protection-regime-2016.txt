6:30 PM Meeting on United Nations Treaty Body Strengthening Process with Prof. Elazar Barkan In 2014, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 68/268, the cornerstone of the current United Nations Treaty Body Strengthening Process, which establishes a process by which to evaluate the ten human rights treaty bodies and identify further recommendations to enhance their long-term viability. The current Strengthening Process will culminate in 2020, with a final review by the UN General Assembly. To contribute to the ongoing process and the General Assembly’s 2020 review, Columbia University will convene a series of regional consultations during 2016 and 2017, in partnership with the Geneva Academy and local universities and institutions. The purpose of these consultations is to engage experts from around the globe to identify opportunities and generate innovative ideas to improve the functioning and deepen the impact of the UN human rights treaty bodies. The focus will include strengthening relationships, communication, and coordination among the treaty bodies as well as identifying opportunities for building relationships and leveraging synergies between the treaty bodies, other UN human rights mechanisms, and the regional human rights systems to enhance global human rights protection. Columbia University will invite experts from academia, civil society, and persons with experience working in the UN and regional human rights systems to contribute to this process. Further information about this initiative can be found in the attached document. The meeting in Istanbul on June 15, 2016 with Professor Elazar Barkan of Columbia University’s Institute for the Study of Human Rights, will be an informal initial discussion to help identify local perspectives on diverse issues including on compliance, deterrence, and facilitating capacity to both report and implement. What would improve the system, and what would local actors need help with?
