The Institute for Information Security & Privacy has joined the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy! In order to ensure we continue as a coordinating body for cybersecurity research, we are migrating our content to the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy website. We hope to see you there! This website will come down after the start of the new year. Policy Effective cybersecurity and privacy require good public policy in addition to good technology. Policy is a core research area for the Institute for Information Security & Privacy at Georgia Tech, led by Associate Director Peter Swire -- a professor, Atlanta-based attorney and nationally regarded expert who has twice served in the White House on these issues. Other prominent Georgia Tech professors leading national research in this area include Annie Antón, Hans Klein, and Milton Mueller.
