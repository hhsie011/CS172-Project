Understanding the basis of heredity is fundamental to all aspects of the life sciences, from the most basic molecular study to applied studies of agricultural species. At Iowa State University the study of the life sciences is interdepartmental, involving faculty in the basic, agricultural, and veterinary sciences. Faculty in 20 different departments are involved in genetics research. This large group of faculty presents a broad range of possibilities for students to learn from faculty who are at the forefront of research in many areas of genetics. UNDERGRADUATE STUDY Undergraduate study in genetics is jointly administered by three departments: the Roy J. Carver Department of Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Molecular Biology; the Department of Genetics, Development, and Cell Biology; and the Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology. Undergraduate degrees are offered through both the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and the College of Liberal Arts and Science. Programs of study for genetics majors leading to a B.S. degree are available. Training in genetics may lead to employment in teaching, research, or a variety of health-related professions. Although some students find employment directly after their baccalaureate training, many students continue their education in graduate or professional programs. Students with the B.S. degree may find employment in the biotechnology, health, or food industries. Recent graduates have also developed careers in conservation biology, technical writing, science journalism, technical sales, and business. The required course work and associated electives provide students with the foundation in basic life sciences, mathematics, chemistry, and physics that is essential for professions involving modern biological/biomedical sciences. As part of these courses students develop skills in problem solving, critical thinking, writing, and research-related activities in the biological sciences. Specific entrance requirements for medical and health-related professions are established by the professional schools. Students interested in fulfilling pre-professional requirements for such professions as dentistry, human medicine, genetic counseling, optometry, pharmacy, physical therapy, physicians assistant, and veterinary medicine can major in genetics while fulfilling the pre-professional requirements. Student Learning Outcomes: Upon graduation, students earning the BS degree in Genetics are expected to have achieved the following skills and capabilities: Comprehensive, detailed understanding of the chemical basis of heredity. Comprehensive and detailed understanding of genetic methodology and how quantification of heritable traits in families and populations provides insight into cellular and molecular mechanisms. Understanding of how genetic concepts affect broad societal issues including health and disease, food and natural resources, environmental sustainability, etc. Understanding the role of genetic mechanisms in evolution. The knowledge required to to design, execute, and analyze the results of genetic experimentation in animal and plant model systems. The ability to recognize the experimental rationale of genetic studies as they are described in peer-reviewed research articles and grant proposals to federal and other funding agencies. The ability to evaluate conclusions that are based on genetic data. Insight into the mathematical, statistical, and computational basis of genetic analyses that use genome-scale data sets in systems biology settings. Understanding the role of genetic technologies in industries related to biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, energy, and other fields. Communication skills required in the discipline including oral presentations of research data, published research articles, grant proposals, and poster presentations at conferences. Teamwork and leadership skills including group analysis of data, working together in the research laboratory, joint compositions of written reports, substantive participation in research group meetings, etc. CURRICULUM IN GENETICS - REQUIREMENTS Total Degree Requirement: 120 cr. .A maximum of 65 cr. from a two-year institution can be applied that may include up to 16 technical cr.; up to 9 Pass-Not Pass cr. of free electives can be applied; a cumulative GPA of at least 2.0 is required for graduation.
