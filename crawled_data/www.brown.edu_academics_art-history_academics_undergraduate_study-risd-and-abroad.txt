Concentrators in the History of Art and Architecture can count a maximum of two concentration electives from courses taken outside of Brown, including Study Abroad courses. These courses must be approved for concentration credit by the Director of Undergraduate Studies. (They may, of course, take further courses for general University credit.) Rhode Island School of Design Brown University's proximity to RISD provides a unique opportunity for students to experience a world-class Art and Design college. Concentrators in the History of Art and Architecture and in Architectural Studies are encouraged to take RISD studio courses. Students register for RISD courses through Brown's Registration portal. Concentrators may also take RISD art history courses if these courses cover material not taught at Brown. These courses will count towards the maximum of two concentration electives taken outside of Brown and must be approved by the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Study Abroad The University supports a variety of study abroad programs that augment learning in the department by providing opportunities to perfect another language and to engage directly with works of art and architecture. The Department of the History of Art and Architecture strongly encourages concentrators to gain fluency in the languages of the countries where they intend to study abroad, and to continue learning the languages while they are studying abroad.
