In some cases, this may be well after course grades are visible to the student. Normal processing time once we receive this transcript is 3 business days. For previous participants: For your UM transcript, you may access your unofficial transcript on CaneLink. If you require an official transcript, you need to follow the UM Registrar process for ordering transcripts. For the partner university transcript, you need to follow their process to request an official transcript. If you are unable to find this information on the partner university website, you may contact the appropriate advisor to inquire about the procedure. In many cases, we will need to contact the partner before we will be able to provide an answer.
