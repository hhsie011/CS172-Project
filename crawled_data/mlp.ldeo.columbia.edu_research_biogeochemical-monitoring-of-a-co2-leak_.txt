Goldberg, Jurg M. Matter, Taro Takahashi, Martin Stute, Gregory O’Mullan, Qiang Yang, M. Elias Dueker and Natalia V. Zakharova The project investigates a shallow potable water aquifer system in sand/clay sequences of the Newark Basin group using laboratory and in situ experimental methods. The primary goal is to understand the fundamental biogeochemical processes caused by CO2 enrichment of aquifer water. The methodologies developed in this work will also be directly transferable to other sites affected by increased CO2 levels induced from CO2sequestration in subterranean rock formations.
