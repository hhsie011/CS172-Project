Universities must preserve core academic values—the pursuit of knowledge, freedom to publish, and open discourse—while adequately addressing industry's need for competitive advantage. However, decades of experience have shown that academia and industry can work together effectively and that these collaborations improve the health, wealth, and security of our citizens. Trustees of Columbia University have authorized Columbia Technology Ventures (Tech Ventures) to manage the intellectual property assets of the University. On behalf of the University, Tech Ventures is responsible for the expenses and risks of patenting and licensing. Tech Ventures acts as a business liaison when researchers interact with industrial and corporate enterprises. Its services are available to anyone at the University conducting research as defined in the Faculty Handbook.
