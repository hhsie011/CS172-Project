Millions of Americans already contending with critical water shortages now face the prospect of black outs as energy demand grows during heatwaves just as hydroelectric power supply is strained. A US power regulator this week warned that a big swath of the US was at risk of blackouts, partly as a result of drought conditions curtailing hydroelectric supplies. May 19, 2022 Light Dawns on Sunrise Columbia Beyond just the impact on other institutions, the urgency with which Columbia takes climate action bears on its educational mission, says Professor Jason Smerdon, an Earth Institute faculty member and the co-director of the undergraduate Sustainable Development program. May 09, 2022 Arianna Varuolo-Clarke's paper on the South American low level jet and centennial precipitation trends has been published Austral summer precipitation increased by 27% over the past 120 years in southeastern South America (SESA), a region including southern Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and northern Argentina. This trend has driven widespread increases in agricultural production, making it important to understand if the trend will continue or reverse over the coming decades. A new paper led by Arianna Varuolo-Clarke, a 4th-year Ph.D. student in the Smerdon Climate Lab, investigates the influence of the South American low-level jet on SESA precipitation.
