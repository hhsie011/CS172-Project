The BIC spans 3 locations in the Norman Hackerman (NHB) and the Health Discovery (HDB) Buildings on the UT campus and hosts a range of systems for MRI, PET, CT and optical imaging. The Center accommodates both independent and assisted use (for human MRI and PET/CT) is on its instruments and provides in-house training in scanner safety and operation (for independent users). The facility also supports a range of task / response paradigms for functional MRI (fMRI) studies and provides back-end support for data archiving, management and common analyses. COVID-19 Information The BIC is currently following all recommendations set forth by the University of Texas at Austin administration. Up to date information can be found at Protect Texas Together including guidelines for Faculty, Students, Staff and Visitors. Current Austin-Travis County Risk Level: Stage 2 Current UT Research Restart Status: Level 0 Specific policies, protocols and forms for research at BIC during COVID-19 can be found at our Wiki. BIC Citation Policy Please support the mission of the BIC by acknowledging the use of our facility, equipment and resources using our unique research resource identifier number (RRID:SCR_021728). Citation by you will ensure the BIC is recognized as a key resource at UT Austin and will promote institutional support and future funding. For example: “This work was performed with the support of the Biomedical Imaging Center (RRID:SCR_021898), a core facility within the Center for Biomedical Research Support at the University of Texas at Austin.” Events Jun01 BIC Virtual Open Office Hours 10:00 am - 12:00 pm Jun02 MRI Level 1 In-person Training: Skyra 10:00 am - 11:00 am Jun06 BIC-MRI: 102 - MRI Safety Screening Training 11:00 am - 11:45 am Jun06 MRI Level 1 In-person training: Vida 12:00 pm - 1:00 pm Jun08 BIC Virtual Open Office Hours 10:00 am - 12:00 pm Jun09 MRI Level 1 In-person Training: Skyra 10:00 am - 11:00 am View All Events Biomedical Imaging Center Resources Facilities Systems Equipment Data Training Education BIC Wiki News & Announcements Equipment Status Publications Volunteer Staff Contact Us Home Center for Biomedical Research Support Cores Biomedical Imaging Center Return to top of page Animal Resources Center Applied Research Labs Austin Technology Incubator Bridging Barriers Bureau of Business Research Center for Biomedical Research Support Center for Identity Energy Institute IC2 Institute Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences Texas Advanced Computing Center UT Austin Home Emergency Information Site Policies Web Accessibility Policy Web Privacy Policy Adobe Reader
