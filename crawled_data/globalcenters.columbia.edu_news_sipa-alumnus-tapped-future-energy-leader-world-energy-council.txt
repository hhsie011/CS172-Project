With the appointment, Guggisberg – who is the Head of the E-Mobility Group at Chile’s Energy Sustainability Agency – will represent the country together with 100 other young adults from around the world to discuss the energy sector’s main future challenges, in order to identify the construction of new public policies that integrate emerging technologies, population growth, and other challenges such as Covid-19. “In particular, I will participate in the ‘market of ideas’ whose focus this year is on new solutions for energy storage, hydrogen use, and the future of mobility,” he said. “My studies at SIPA were key to understanding emerging technologies that affect people's lives (Civic Tech), and I also formed part of an ecosystem of global innovation… Where I quickly learned that good ideas always get resources,” the WEC Future Energy Leader added.
