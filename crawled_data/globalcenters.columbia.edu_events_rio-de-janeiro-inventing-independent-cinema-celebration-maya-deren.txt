a celebration of Maya Deren Events Past Event Rio de Janeiro | Inventing the Independent Cinema - a celebration of Maya Deren Share Add to Calendar: Google Yahoo August 30, 2017 7:30 PM - 9:00 PM Academia Internacional de Cinema (AIC) - Rio de Janeiro Unsettling, enigmatic, provocative: the short films of Maya Deren are among the treasures of American cinema, deeply influential to several generations of filmmakers and just as daring when seen today as when they were first screened. Attracted to the radical politics of the Depression-era, Deren worked as a political organizer until deciding to devote herself to poetry, dance and later photography, becoming part of the New York bohemian art scene. But it was only with her meeting and subsequent marriage to Alexander Hammid in 1940 that Deren discovered the cinema; together, they created Meshes of the Afternoon in 1943, the work which more than any other launched the American avant-garde cinema. Several other films, these created by Deren herself, followed in quick succession, yet Deren’s importance goes beyond her artistic brilliance. Unable to find a venue in New York to screen her work, she rented her own theater, installed a projector and a screen, and advertised her show through small ads and flyers. To everyone’s amazement, the program was a huge hit, and was repeated over several weekends. Deren’s daring, and success, encouraged other independent filmmakers to screen their works, and thus began the creation of an entire alternative network of distributors, exhibition spaces and even producers, a development with which Deren was passionately involved until her untimely death in 1961. This talk will explore the life and achievement of Maya Deren, screening and analyzing three of her films (Meshes of the Afternoon, At Land, A Study of Choreography for the Camera), as well as placing her art and activities within the context of postwar America.
