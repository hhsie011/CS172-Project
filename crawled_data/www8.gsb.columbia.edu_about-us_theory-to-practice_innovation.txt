Because we are so connected to business, on both the theory and practice sides, we understand how and when the business world is shifting, and we regularly introduce new programs to challenge and prepare our students for success in a rapidly changing landscape. Research Columbia faculty, students and business executives work together on numerous innovation projects. For instance, every semester students are applying the concepts of the Strategic Intuition to solve the real-world business challenges of the Fortune 500 companies under the supervision of the top consulting executives in one of our numerous master classes. We've also inaugurated Innovation and Entrepreneurship @ Columbia, which invites applications from students, faculty members, and staff members from across the University. Over a semester, selected participants learn the venture process and develop fundable business proposals for their disruptive entrepreneurial ideas. Courses Our core curriculum includes integrated case study of company strategies used across several courses simultaneously. The study examines one company from a variety of perspectives: accounting, management, marketing, operations, and more. Working collaboratively and cross-functionally, MBAs gain a holistic understanding of real-world business problems, which trains them to develop more effective and creative solutions.
