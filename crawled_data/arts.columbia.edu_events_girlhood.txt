GIRLHOOD is a dark comedy that follows a diverse and tight-knit group of friends navigating the tragedies of adolescence, and the small cruelties they inflict upon each other while they look for their places in the world. They are funny. They are strong. They are deeply flawed. And they are figuring it out. This is a play about friendship. This is a play about growing up. This is a play about power, in a world where young women are told they don’t have any.
