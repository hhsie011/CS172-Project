We’ll not only help you discover what moves you. We’ll support you every step of the way. About Butler Menu Maps & Directions At a Glance Graduate Outcomes Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion Community & Engagement Office of the President Strategic Direction Give to Butler Mascot Blue IV Careers Discovery happens here. At Butler, you’ll study with faculty members who are deeply passionate about what they do. They’ll encourage you to find that same passion within yourself. We put the resources at your disposal—the labs, the studios, the athletic fields, the trading rooms—to help you uncover what you’re really good at (and maybe even what you can do without.) We put you in a position to take advantage of internships and real-world experiences that show you what to expect from a particular field and to build the work ethic that it takes to pull ahead of the pack. That’s a once-in-a-lifetime journey. It also takes a lot of work on your part, since blazing a trail is harder than somebody telling you exactly where to go. We’ve found that Butler students are looking for that kind of challenge. Because ultimately, it’s not our education. It’s yours. Read About Our Student-Focused Approach Pause/Play The Butler Blueprint Your plan for the future No matter which of our six colleges you’re in—Communication, Education, Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Liberal Arts and Sciences, Arts, or Business—we ensure you graduate with the tools to get your career off on the right foot. Whether it’s creating a résumé, writing a personal statement for grad school, or building a website or portfolio to showcase your work, we’ll be there to help you make your way into the working world. BUBeWell Take care of yourself If you’re not the best version of yourself outside of class, how can you be the best version of yourself inside it? The BUBeWell program ensures you get the all-around nourishment you need to blossom, blending intellectual growth, service, career skills, diversity and inclusion, and more. Learn more about BUBeWell Small Classes We push, You’ll shine Until you’re in college, it’s hard to imagine just how important an influential professor can be in your life. But when you make a connection with a faculty member who really makes you fall in love with a subject—who makes you want to know more and pushes you to excel—well, it’s a little like magic. At Butler, where the average class is just 24 students and we have a 12:1 student-to-faculty ratio, those connections happen all the time. Academic Advising By your side, no matter what Not long after you get to campus, you’ll meet your faculty mentor—a professor from the department that houses your major who will work with you to reach your academic, career, and personal goals. Every one of us at Butler wants you to thrive; your mentor is there to make sure you get the support you need.
