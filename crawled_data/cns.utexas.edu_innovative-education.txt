Innovative Education Texas Institute for Discovery Education in Science Freshman Research Initiative International Study Internships UTeach Volunteering & Outreach TIP Mentor Academy Home Students in the College of Natural Sciences have interests and abilities that span the breadth of science and technology, yet few have had the opportunity to do what they love in addition to studying it. We are committed to offering authentic and meaningful experience to students as early as possibly in their time here, so that they can make the best decisions about their careers, their future areas of study, and where to invest their passion and skill. We know that when students participate in hands-on research, real-world leadership opportunities, and other experiential learning, such as studying and researching abroad, they get higher grades, are more likely to stick it out in the sciences, are more likely to get into graduate and professional schools, and have a greater impact in the world.
