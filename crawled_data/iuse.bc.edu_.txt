Our work is grounded in social justice through which we strive to engage youth in using scientific practices and knowledge to solve problems that are most relevant to them. Our team designs, implements, and researches innovative educational approaches that target under-represented populations in the sciences with the goals of providing all students the opportunity to engage in meaningful and interesting scientific experiences. Teens put science and math to work to become hydroponic farmers and successful green entrepreneurs Read More at Science Nation Watch youth as they explain their hydroponics work and their work at farmers markets in Boston. Read More at Edible Boston We are creating programs that engage youth in learning science to engage with food and social justice issues in their community Read More at NSF Discoveries Engaging the public in air quality data through interactive touch screens and low cost air quality sensors.

Read More on Boston.com With funding from the National Science Foundation and in partnership with MassBay Community College we are engaging youth in Coding, Robotics, Engineering, and Technology (iCREAT) projects. You may have seen our work on ATE Grant Awarded Pleased to announce that the I-USE lab in collaboration with MassBay Community College has received a $891,999 grant in partnership with MentorNet to develop a longitudinal program to support under-represented youth to pursue STEM Careers. Read More Here Seeding the Future With support from the National Institute In collaboration with Groundworks Lawrence, Salve Regina University, we are expanding our high school hydroponics program to an additional 100 schools. Scaling to China The I-USE team has conducted a curriculum analysis of Chinese and our curriculum materials and created a suite of curriculum materials that are mapped to the Chinese curriculum. Watch Sinovison about the work Science Nation We were delighted to be filmed this past summer by NSF's science nation. Be on the lookout for the video which will be airing in early October. Our Mission We focus on increasing student engagement in STEM through after-school programs and innovative curriculum grounded in social justice. We strive to design programs that provide youth opportunities science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics that promote critical thinking skills, problem-solving and effective communication skills.The focus of our work is to support youth of color, low-income, at risk, and other under-represented populations in science to have the confidence and skills to succeed in not just science but in whatever endeavors they undertake.
