Crossing the Consumer Chasm by Design. Technologies have shaped human life since tools were sticks and flints to today's hydrocarbon powered, silicon managed era. Some spread throughout society; bread, cell phones, airlines, but most never do; personal jet packs, Apple Newton, freeze dried ice cream. Space Tourism, the Segway, electric cars: Can we predict which ones will cross the chasm to broad application? Can we help them to by combining design, engineering, marketing, communications, education, art, and business strategies? Student teams identify potential new products, conceptualize, package, and define their business mode. By plotting their course across the chasm, we confront the cross-disciplinary barriers to realizing benefits from technology. Enrollment limited to 18 first year students.

Five decades of human activity in space has provided the world community with benefits including instant global communications and positioning, human and robotic exploration of the moon, planets and sun, and a perspective of earth which continues to inform and influence our relationship with our environment. Unlike other technical revolutions of the 20th century space has not transitioned to a commercial, consumer market commodity. Rather its users and applications remain primarily large and institutional. To experience the challenges of engineering design and of changing an industrial paradigm, we will work in one or several groups to identify a use of space, and a plan for its implementation, that could help transition space from its status as a niche technology. Through the process of design, we will confront the technical, economic, societal and political barriers to obtaining increased benefits from technologies in general, and space in particular, and to making new technologies beneficial to a wider range of users. Enrollment limited to 18 first year students. Spr ENGN0120B S01 24990 MWF 1:00-1:50(06) 'To Be Arranged' ENGN 0120C. Power: From Early Engines to the Nuclear-Powered Artificial Heart.

Rosler Senior Research Associate in Engineering Qisheng Wu Senior Research Associate in Engineering Engineering Engineering and Physics Biomedical Engineering Entrepreneurship Engineering The concentration in Engineering equips students with a solid foundation for careers in engineering, to advance the knowledge base for future technologies, and to merge teaching, scholarship, and practice in the pursuit of solutions to human needs. The concentration offers one standard Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) program and eight Bachelor of Science (Sc.B.) degree programs. Of these, the Sc.B. programs in biomedical, chemical, computer, electrical, environmental, materials, and mechanical engineering are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET. The engineering physics program is also offered, but is not accredited by ABET. Other programs leading to the Sc.B. or A.B. degrees in Engineering may be designed in consultation with a faculty advisor. These programs must meet the general requirements for concentration programs in the School of Engineering. Students interested in an individualized program should consult with an Engineering faculty member willing to serve as an advisor and obtain the approval of the Engineering Concentration Committee. Please note that all students concentrating in Engineering need to file a concentration declaration using the University’s ASK advising system. This declaration must be first reviewed by the relevant Concentration Advisor and then approved by the Director of Undergraduate Studies after assuring compliance with all relevant program and accreditation requirements. Mathematics Requirements Since mathematics is a cornerstone of all engineering programs, there is naturally significant attention given to early preparation in mathematics in all of the engineering concentrations. It is recognized that students entering Brown will have different levels of mathematics preparation, and the following is offered as general guidance, though the actual choices of courses should be made in consultation with a freshman advisor. Mathematics 0190, 0200 is the preferred sequence of courses to be taken in the freshman year. Students who would prefer a more introductory level calculus course may start in MATH 0100 and take MATH 0200 or MATH 0180 in their second semester. Students without secondary school level preparation in calculus should consider taking the sequence MATH 0090, MATH 0100 in their first year, and should begin their sequence of engineering courses with ENGN 0030 in the sophomore year. Students who have taken Advanced Placement (AP) courses in high school and/or have shown proficiency through Advanced Placement examinations are often able to start at a higher level than suggested above and shown in the standard programs below. If a student has advanced placement credit (e.g., placing out of MATH 0190 or MATH 0200), it is quite common for them to enroll in a higher-level math course as a replacement. Examples of such courses are MATH 0520 (Linear Algebra), MATH 1260 (Complex Analysis), MATH 1610 (Probability), MATH 1620 (Statistics), APMA 1170 (Numerical Analysis), APMA 1210 (Operations Research), or APMA 1650 (Statistical Inference). Note that in addition to the above options, the student with advanced placement in calculus courses may choose to enroll early in APMA 0350 and APMA 0360 which are normally taken in the sophomore year (not all engineering concentrations require APMA 0360, so the choices should be guided by the concentration guidelines below). Note: Students who completed APMA 0330 and/or APMA 0340 prior to academic year 2021-22 may count those courses as satisfying the APMA 0350 and/or APMA 0360 requirements. The student with advanced placement credit for MATH 0190 or MATH 0200 also has the further option of replacing the math course with an advanced-level science course, subject to the approval of the Concentration Advisor. Advanced Placement Courses that have been taken at the secondary school level are typically only used for placement into the appropriate course level at Brown. The examples of how this can be done in mathematics are given above, and there are other instances (such as in selection of the appropriate introductory chemistry course) where AP credit is considered. It should be noted, however, that advanced placement credits cannot be used to substitute for any Engineering concentration requirements; they are instead used to ensure that students are placed into the correct level of courses. Transfer Credits Some students will also complete courses at other universities during the time they are Brown students (sometimes during summers while they are not in residence at Brown; sometimes during a junior semester abroad). Students who have successfully completed college courses elsewhere may apply to the University for transfer credit. (See the “Study Elsewhere” section of the University Bulletin for procedures). In addition to the general rules governing such transfers, there are specific rules governing courses that will be offered as satisfying Engineering concentration requirements. If the course proposed for transfer credit is offered by another department at Brown (i.e., that it carries a course number that does not start with ENGN), then the equivalent of the course must be established by that other department. This is done by submitting a formal request through the ASK system (https://ask.brown.edu/transfer_credits/information/index). Once this approval has been received from the other department, the student’s internal transcript will show the equivalence and the course in question can be shown in the Engineering concentration declaration as having been completed elsewhere. If the equivalence to a Brown course is not approved, then there may still be “unassigned credit” given for the course. In this case, the situation relative to how it does or does not count for concentration credit needs to be discussed with the Concentration Advisor. In rare cases, students may petition the Engineering Concentration Committee to use courses that do not have an equivalent offered at Brown in order to meet a concentration requirement. Substitutions of this nature can only be approved if the student’s overall program meets published educational outcomes for the concentration and has sufficient basic science, mathematics, and engineering topics courses to meet relevant accreditation requirements. Students should consult their Concentration Advisor for assistance with drafting a petition. The decision whether to award concentration credit is made by majority vote of the Engineering Concentration Committee. If the student wishes to transfer a course taken outside of Brown that would normally carry an Engineering course number, the sequence is a bit different. First, the student needs to fill out an Engineering Transfer Credit Approval Request (see https://engineering.brown.edu/undergraduate/concentrations/concentration-options/study-abroad). This routes the request to the relevant Brown Engineering faculty member for approval. Once this has been obtained, then transfer approval is requested through the ASK system, as described above. This process ensures that the transcript will capture the equivalence of the externally completed course. Substitutions for Required Courses Students may petition the Engineering Concentration Committee to substitute a course in place of a defined concentration requirement. Such substitutions can only be approved if the student's modified program continues to meet the published educational outcomes for the concentration and has sufficient basic science, mathematics, and engineering topics courses needed to meet accreditation requirements. If the substitution involves taking an equal or higher level course in substantially the same area, whether at Brown or elsewhere, it can be approved by the Concentration Advisor without requiring a formal petition to the Concentration Committee. (For courses taken elsewhere, the credit must be officially transferred as described above.) Students wishing to make substitutions of a broader nature should consult their Concentration Advisor for assistance in drafting their petition to the Engineering Concentration Committee. Such petitions may be approved by a majority vote of the Committee. Standard Program for the A.B. Degree Please note that the A.B. degree program is not accredited by ABET. Candidates for the Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) degree with a concentration in Engineering must complete at least eight approved Engineering courses. The eight courses must include at least two 1000-level Engineering courses. Of these 1000-level courses, one must be a design or independent study course and the other an in-classroom experience. The set of Engineering courses must be chosen with careful attention to the prerequisites of the 1000-level courses. Not all engineering courses may be used to satisfy the Engineering course requirement for the A.B. degree. For example, the following courses cannot be used to satisfy the Engineering course requirement for the A.B. degree: ENGN 0020, ENGN 0090, ENGN 0900, ENGN 0930A, ENGN 0930C, ENGN 0130, ENGN 1010, ENGN 1931Q, ENGN 1931W, ENGN 2110, ENGN 2120, ENGN 2130, ENGN 2140, ENGN 2150, ENGN 2160, ENGN 2180 . Therefore, the program of study must be developed through consultation with the Concentration Advisor. The A.B. program also requires preparation in Mathematics equivalent to MATH 0200 and APMA 0350, as well as at least one college-level science course from the general areas of chemistry (except CHEM 0100), life sciences, physics, or geological sciences. A programming course is also recommended, but not required. The entire program is subject to approval by an Engineering Concentration Advisor and the Director of Undergraduate Programs in Engineering. Note: Students who completed APMA 0330 prior to academic year 2021-22 may count that course as satisfying the APMA 0350 requirement. Standard Program for the Sc.B. degree: All Bachelor of Science (Sc.B.) program tracks build upon a common core of engineering knowledge and skills applicable across all engineering disciplines. The goal of this engineering core curriculum is to prepared to practice engineering in an age of rapidly changing technology. Two-thirds of this four-year program consists of a core of basic mathematics, physical sciences and engineering sciences common to all branches of engineering, including a thorough grounding in programming and technical problem solving. This core provides our graduates with the basis of theory, design, and analysis that will enable them to adapt to whatever may come along during their careers. At the same time, the core courses assist students in making informed choices in determining their areas of specialization, at the end of their sophomore year. To this end, first-year students are given an introduction to engineering - featuring case studies from different disciplines in engineering as well as guest speakers from industry. This aspect of the program is different from that at many other schools where students are expected to select a specific branch of engineering much earlier in their academic program. In addition, all Sc.B. programs in Engineering must be complemented by at least four courses in humanities and social sciences. The minimum four-course humanities and social sciences requirement for the Sc.B. in Engineering cannot be met by advanced placement credit. Special Sc.B. Concentrations (non-accredited): In addition to the standard programs described above, students may also petition the Engineering Concentration Committee to pursue a special engineering Sc.B. degree of their own design. Such special Sc.B. programs are not ABET-accredited. Students with a special concentration will receive an Sc.B. degree in engineering, but a specific area of specialization will not be noted on their transcript. A special Sc.B. concentration is intended to prepare graduates for advanced study in engineering or for professional practice, but in an area that is not covered by one of the existing Sc.B. programs. Accordingly, special concentration programs are expected to consist of a coherent set of courses with breadth, depth and rigor comparable to an accredited degree. A total of 21 engineering, mathematics, and basic science courses are required. The program must include at least 3 courses in mathematics, at least 2 courses in physical or life sciences; and at least 12 courses in engineering. At least five of the engineering courses must be upper level courses, and one must be a capstone design course or independent study, which must be advised or co-advised by a member of the regular engineering faculty. Note that not all Engineering courses may be used to meet Sc.B. requirements: for example, the courses not allowed to count toward the A.B. will not qualify. Petitions should be prepared in consultation with an engineering faculty advisor, who will submit the petition to the Engineering Concentration Committee. Petitions must include: (i) a statement of the objectives of the degree program, and an explanation of how the courses in the program meet these objectives; (ii) course descriptions for any courses in the program that are not part of standard Sc.B. Engineering concentrations; (iii) a detailed description of any independent study courses used for concentration credit, signed by the faculty advisor for this course; and (iv) an up-to-date internal transcript. Professional Tracks While we do not give course credit for internships, we officially recognize their importance via the optional Professional Tracks. The requirements for the professional tracks include all those of the standard tracks, as well as the following: Students must complete full-time professional experiences (or part-time experiences of equivalent total effort) doing work that is related to their concentration programs, totaling 2-6 months, whereby each internship must be at least one month in duration in cases where students choose to do more than one internship experience. Such work is normally done at a company, but may also be at a university under the supervision of a faculty member. Internships that take place between the end of the fall and the start of the spring semesters cannot be used to fulfill this requirement. On completion of each professional experience, the student must write and upload to ASK a reflective essay about the experience addressing the following prompts: Describe the organization you worked in and the nature of your responsibilities. Which courses were put to use in your work? Which topics, in particular, were important? In retrospect, which courses should you have taken before embarking on your work experience? What are the topics from these courses that would have helped you if you had been more familiar with them? What topics would have been helpful in preparation for this work experience that you did not learn at Brown? What did you learn from the experience that probably could not have been picked up from course work? Is the sort of work you did something you would like to continue doing once you graduate? Explain. Would you recommend your work experience to other Brown students? Explain. The reflective essays are subject to the approval of the student's Concentration Advisor. Entry to the Professional Track requires a simple application form to be completed by the student and approved by the Concentration Advisor at the time of the concentration declaration. If the student has not yet declared a concentration, the form may be approved by the Chair of the Concentration Committee. The Concentration Advisor will certify that all Professional Track students have completed the necessary internships and will grant approval for the associated reflective essays. All other requirements remain identical to those in the standard tracks in the concentrations. Degrees with Honors in Engineering Honors are granted by the University to students whose work in a field of concentration has demonstrated superior quality and culminated in an 'Honors Thesis of Distinction.' Honors recipients in the School of Engineering must meet the following criteria: (1) Demonstrate a strong academic record (60% A’s or “S with Distinction” in their concentration through the seventh semester); (2) Propose and execute an independent research project under the guidance of a faculty member; (3) Complete a written thesis to the satisfaction of the Honors Program Committee; (4) Give a scientific/technical presentation at the Undergraduate Research Symposium in the spring semester; and (5) Fulfill all deadlines for applying for or completing honors to the satisfaction of his/her research advisor and the Honors Program Committee.

Engineering and Physics The Sc.B. program in Engineering and Physics is sponsored jointly by the School of Engineering and the Department of Physics. The program is designed to ensure that students take a significant portion of the usual curriculum in Engineering and in Physics, obtain substantial laboratory experience, and take several upper-level elective courses, focusing on applied science. Students may take either the standard Physics or Engineering programs during their freshman and sophomore years and then switch to this combined program. The Sc.B. degree program in Engineering and Physics is not accredited by ABET. The following standard program assumes that a student begins mathematics courses at Brown with MATH 0100 or MATH 0190. Students who begin in MATH 0200 can substitute an additional science, engineering or higher-level mathematics course for the MATH 0190 requirement. To accommodate the diverse preparation of individual students, variations of the following sequences and their prerequisites are possible with permission of the appropriate concentration advisor and the instructors involved. We recommend that each student’s degree program be submitted for prior approval (typically in semester four) and scrutinized for compliance (in semester seven) by one faculty member from the Department of Physics and one faculty member from the School of Engineering. Select one of the following two course sequences: 2 ENGN 0030 & ENGN 0040 Introduction to Engineering and Dynamics and Vibrations (ENGN 0031 may be substituted for ENGN 0030) PHYS 0050 & PHYS 0060 Foundations of Mechanics and Foundations of Electromagnetism and Modern Physics PHYS 0070 & PHYS 0160 Analytical Mechanics and Introduction to Relativity, Waves and Quantum Physics MATH 0190 Advanced Placement Calculus (Physics/Engineering) 1 or MATH 0100 Introductory Calculus, Part II MATH 0200 Intermediate Calculus (Physics/Engineering) 1 or MATH 0180 Intermediate Calculus or MATH 0350 Honors Calculus Select three additional higher-level math, applied math, or mathematical physics (PHYS 0720) courses. 3 CSCI 0111 Computing Foundations: Data 1 or APMA 0160 Introduction to Scientific Computing or CSCI 0150 Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming and Computer Science or CSCI 0170 Computer Science: An Integrated Introduction or CSCI 0190 Accelerated Introduction to Computer Science ENGN 0510 Electricity and Magnetism 1 or PHYS 0470 Electricity and Magnetism ENGN 1560 Optics 1 or PHYS 1510 Advanced Electromagnetic Theory PHYS 0500 Advanced Classical Mechanics 1 or ENGN 1370 Advanced Engineering Mechanics PHYS 1410 Quantum Mechanics A 1 PHYS 1420 Quantum Mechanics B 1 PHYS 1530 Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics 1 or ENGN 0720 Thermodynamics ENGN 1620 Analysis and Design of Electronic Circuits 1 CHEM 0330 Equilibrium, Rate, and Structure 1 or ENGN 0310 Mechanics of Solids and Structures or ENGN 0810 Fluid Mechanics or PHYS 1600 Computational Physics ENGN 0410 Materials Science 1 or ENGN 1690 Photonics Devices and Sensors or PHYS 0560 Experiments in Modern Physics PHYS 1560 Modern Physics Laboratory 1 or ENGN 1590 Introduction to Semiconductors and Semiconductor Electronics or an approved 2000-level engineering or physics course.

Entrepreneurship Offered by the Nelson Center for Entrepreneurship, in partnership with Brown's School of Engineering, the Certificate in Entrepreneurship equips students with an understanding of the fundamental building blocks of the entrepreneurial process: i) understanding and validating an unmet need; ii) developing a value proposition that addresses an unmet need; and iii) designing a sustainability model that allows the value proposition to be delivered repeatedly at scale. Two core courses introduce students to foundational entrepreneurial concepts. Two elective courses will extend students' foundational work into areas of particular interest. Finally, students will complete an entrepreneurship practicum that enables them to apply what they have learned in the classroom to a real-world project of interest. As with all undergraduate certificates, students may only have one declared concentration and must be enrolled in or have completed at least two courses toward the certificate at the time they declare in ASK, which must be no earlier than the beginning of the fifth semester and no later than the last day of classes of the antepenultimate (typically the sixth) semester, in order to facilitate planning for the entrepreneurship practicum. Students must submit a proposal for their practicum project by the end of the sixth semester.
