Teno, M.D., M.S. is a Adjunct Professor of Health Services, Policy, and Practice. She is a health services researcher, former hospice medical director, and board-certified internist with added qualification in Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine. Dr. Teno has served on numerous advisory panels including the Institute of Medicine, World Health Organization and American Bar Association and as grant peer reviewer for the National Institutes of Health. She has been the recipient of funding from the National Institute of Health (NIH) and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Dr. Teno's focus has been on measuring and evaluating interventions to improve the quality of medical care for seriously ill and dying patients. Dr. Teno led the effort in the design of the Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments (SUPPORT) intervention analysis and was lead author in twelve publications from that research effort, which ranged from the role of advance directives to describing the dying experience of seriously ill and older adults. Both as a researcher and clinician, Dr. Teno has devoted her career to understanding how to measure and improve the quality of end of life care for vulnerable populations. She was the lead investigator in a research effort to create a Toolkit of Instruments to Measure Care at the End of Life (TIME). In this grant effort, she created the Brown University Family Evaluation of Hospice Care, that is currently being used by hospice across the nation and internationally to examine the quality of hospice care. She has led a state wide effort to improve pain management in nursing homes, for which she has received an award from the American Cancer Society. Over 280 research articles have been published in leading medical journals focusing on examining medical care for dying persons and frail persons residing in nursing homes.

Full Text PubMed Research Research Overview Dr. Teno's focus has been on measuring and evaluating interventions to improve the quality of medical care for seriously ill and dying patients. Both as a researcher and clinician, Dr. Teno has devoted her career to understanding how to measure and improve the quality of frail, older and dying persons. She has led a statewide effort to improve pain management in nursing homes, for which she has received an award from the American Cancer Society. Research Statement Joan M. Teno, M.D., M.S. is a Adjunct Professor of Health Services, Policy, and Practice and Medicine. She is a health services researcher, former hospice medical director, and board-certified internist with added qualification in Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine. Dr. Teno has served on numerous advisory panels including the Institute of Medicine, World Health Organization, American Bar Association and as grant peer reviewer for the National Institutes of Health. Both as a researcher and clinician, Dr. Teno has devoted her career to understanding how to measure and improve the quality of end of life care for vulnerable populations. Her current research is focused on the quality of care for persons with serious illnesses, especially those residing in the nursing home setting: Development of actionable measurement tools to guide both quality improvement and public accountability for seriously ill and dying persons. Dr. Teno is the recipient of National Institute of Aging and National Cancer Institute research grants to develop measurement tools based on her work in creating measurement tools to evaluate hospice care. She was the lead developer of the Brown Family Evaluation of Hospice Care that is currently being used by hospice programs across the USA and internationally to examine the quality of end of life care. Improving pain management in the nursing home setting. Dr. Teno, with funding from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, conducted a successful 21 Nursing home quality improvement collaborative that resulted in 41% reduction in pain. For this work, Dr. Teno received recognition from the RI American Cancer Society Cancer Pain Initiative and the Meritorious Award from the Rhode Island Public Health Association. Her work continues in this area with an R21 from the National Institute of Aging that is developing a computer decision support system to assist nursing homes in care planning, decisions regarding pain management, and ongoing quality monitoring. Describing the role of public policy and local health care market on the quality of care for seriously ill and dying nursing home residents. In collaboration with colleagues at the Center for Gerontology and at Harvard Medical School, Dr. Teno had an R01 from the National Institute of Aging to examine the influence of public policy, the local health care market, and individual characteristics with the decisions to insert a feeding tube in nursing home residents with advanced dementia. Over 280 research articles have been published in leading medical journals focusing on examining medical care for dying persons and frail persons residing in nursing homes.
