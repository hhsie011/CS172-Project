Programs Cooperating Raleigh Colleges (CRC) Inter-Institutional Program Study Abroad Cooperating Raleigh Colleges The Department of Registration and Records encourages all eligible students to take part in one of the inter-institutional registration programs offered at NC State. Under the Cooperating Raleigh Colleges (CRC) program, any enrolled degree-seeking graduate or undergraduate student (excluding non-degree students) may register for courses with appropriate approval at the following institutions: Meredith College Shaw University St. Augustine’s University Wake Technical Community College William Peace University Graduate Fall and Spring Terms Graduate students are allowed to take two courses per term, provided that the student is also registered for at least three credit hours per semester at NC State. Summer Sessions There is no CRC registration during summer sessions. Students who wish to take a summer course must register directly with the institution offering the course. Graduate students are not allowed to register for any undergraduate level courses. Graduate students must obtain approval from their academic advisor and complete the information on the Cooperating Raleigh Colleges Approval Form. Undergraduate Fall and Spring Terms Undergraduate Students are allowed to take two CRC courses per regular term, providing the student is registered for at least 12 credit hours during the same semester as the requested CRC registration. Summer Sessions There is no CRC registration during summer sessions. Students who wish to take a summer course must register directly with the institution offering the course. Undergraduate students must obtain approval from your academic advisor as well as your college academic dean and complete the information on the Cooperating Raleigh Colleges Approval Form. NOTE: If the course has registration restrictions, you will need to obtain approval from the instructor or department at the host institution. Tuition North Carolina State University will bill the student for all courses taken (including CRC courses) at the prevailing tuition rate. The host institution will receive no fees from the Inter-Institutional student unless there is a special fee associated with a particular course. Grading/Reporting Undergraduate Students Grades will be reported by the registrar’s office at the visited school. The student will receive transfer credit for the courses only if they earn a grade of “C” or better. Cooperating Raleigh Colleges courses transfer as credit hours only and are not used in the computation of the grade point average for undergraduate students. Graduate Students Graduate students receive both credit hours and grades for Cooperating Raleigh Colleges courses. The grades received from the visited school will be converted to the NC State grading scale and added to the student’s transcript. Students are not allowed to register for CRC classes on a Pass/Fail or Audit. This process takes approximately three weeks from the time the Department of Registration and Records receives the grades from the visited school. Refer to the Graduate Catalog for more information on grading. NOTE: Students are not allowed to register for CRC classes on a Pass/Fail basis. Registration NC State students wishing to take courses at the participating CRC schools must obtain appropriate signatures of approval and complete the Cooperating Raleigh Colleges Approval Form. Once you have received all of the appropriate signatures, bring the completed CRC Approval Form to the Department of Registration and Records, 1000 Harris Hall, where your registration will then be completed between the participating Institutions. Please register for the courses you are planning to take at the home institution before submitting the form to Registration and Records. The last day for a student to submit a CRC request to the Office of the Registrar will be the last day to add a course without departmental approval. This information corresponds to that term’s Academic Calendar. If a student is interested in a course that begins after this deadline, due to differing University schedules, or separate modules that the course is being offered in, the deadline will be the fifth day after the start of that class. Start dates will be verified with the school offering the course. A copy of your completed Approval Form will be sent to the host institution. Once their registration date opens for visiting students, they will attempt to register you. If you are closed out or denied a seat in the course due to enrollment restrictions, please notify the CRC coordinator at NC State. You will receive confirmation of your status from the host institution. Important: Registration in a requested course must be confirmed by the visited institution for enrollment to be complete. CRC courses cannot be added on a post-semester basis for any reason. Dropping To initiate a drop please contact the CRC coordinator in the Registrar’s office.
