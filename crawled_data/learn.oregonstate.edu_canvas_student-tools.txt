These Help options include reporting a problem via email and live chat or phone calls with a Canvas support agent. The phone number for Canvas Student Support is (833) 822-0336. We encourage all students to use Canvas Support to report issues with Canvas instead of contacting the instructor first. Since Canvas Support is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, students can get help and, generally, get resolution of the issue immediately. If the issue was not able to be resolved in the moment, a tracked and documented ticket now exists that the student can use to report the issue to the instructor of the course, if the issue interfered with timely completion of the student's work.
