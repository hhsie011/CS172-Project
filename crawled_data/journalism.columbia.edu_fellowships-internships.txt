Funded by The Tamer Center for Social Enterprise/ Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting | Post-Graduate Reporting Fellows At a time when the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 epidemic continues to affect students and employers across the nation, Columbia Journalism School is collaborating for a third year with the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting to provide graduating students with reporting grants to support their transitions to professional newsrooms. Columbia Journalism School established a $50,000 fund in 2022, 2021 and 2020, administered by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, to award individual grants to graduates so they can continue work on their theses or develop other freelance stories to be pitched for publication. These reporting grants have also funded local news reporting and international reporting. The Pulitzer Center is soliciting proposals from the class of 2022, and solicited proposals from the class of 2021 in Spring 2021 and from the class of 2020 in Summer 2020, to report on enterprising stories focused on crises anywhere in the world. Reporting Fellow selections are made jointly by the Columbia Journalism School and the Pulitzer Center based on applications that include project proposals. Fellows receive mentorship from the Pulitzer Center team, which also pairs each Fellow with an adviser who has a particular interest or expertise in the Reporting Fellow's proposed project. The reporting grants are funded by generous alumni of the school, and the international reporting grants are funded by the Simon and June Li Center for Global Journalism, a new center at Columbia committed to preparing journalists to work, think and report globally. Recipients of the international grants are known as the Li Center for Global Journalism Fellows. The Pulitzer Center, founded 15 years ago, is dedicated to raising awareness of underreported global issues through direct support for quality journalism across all media platforms and a unique program of outreach and education to schools and universities. The Columbia Journalism School is a member of the Pulitzer Center‚Äôs Campus Consortium, with an emphasis on support for the school‚Äôs documentary filmmaking students. In the inaugural year, 18 reporting grants were awarded to members of the Class of 2020. 2020 Post Graduate Reporting Fellows and Project Topics Stories included: Food Revolution in New York's Latino Community (Grub Street/New York Magazine) | Muriel Alarc√≥n '20 A Quiet Revolution: Female Imams Taking Over an LA Mosque (The Guardian) | Amel Brahmi '20 Pandemic and Human Rights Abuses in Uganda: Deaths, Injuries, and Broken Promises (Pulitzer Center) | Musinguzi Blanshe '20 Non-Unanimous Juries in Louisiana (The Nation) | Zoe Chevalier '20 Environmentalists Target Mountains of Fertilizer Waste (Undark Magazine) | Bianca Fortis '20 Homeless in a Pandemic-stricken Chicago (Chicago Reader) | Sarah Gelbard '20 The Former Soviet Union Immigrant Vote (Pulitzer Center) | Anastassia Gliadkovskaya '20 Pills in the Post: How COVID Reopened the Abortion Wars (The Guardian) | Sarah Hurtes '20 Credit unions for formerly incarcerated persons in New York (in progress) | Kirsti Karttunen '20 Autism and ECT (in progress) | Astrid Landon '20 In Politically Torn Tbilisi, Transgender Sex Workers Fight to Survive (POLITICO Europe) | Chloe Lula '20 COVID-19 and Indigenous Communities in Latin America (Goats & Soda/NPR) | Sofia Moutinho '20 One Woman‚Äôs Quest to Defy the Odds of Addiction (Belt Magazine) | Aryana Michelle Noroozi '20 Sustainable Farming Revolution in Puerto Rico (Miami Herald) | Syra Ortiz-Blanes '20 The Olive Trees Apocalypse (Atlas Obscura) | Agostino Petroni '20 Special Needs and COVID-19 (in progress) | Sadia Rafiquddin '20 A Year of Pandemic Pivots: An Exhausted Fine Dining Industry Inches Toward Reopening After a Year of Unimaginable Losses (Eater) | Sara Sheridan Abuse, Neglect and Institutional Racism in Ireland: The O'Reilly Sisters (in progress) | Isobel Thompson '20 In the second year, 10 reporting grants were awarded to members of the Class of 2021. 2021 Post Graduate Reporting Fellows and Project Topics Stories included: Ghana‚Äôs new draconian anti-LGBT law (in progress) | Kwasi Gyamfi Asiedu '21 In Lockdown With Their Rapists (PassBlue) | Damilola Banjo '21 Land, Water, Blood (in progress) | Richard Brown '21 South Africa: PrEP and HIV/AIDS Interventions (in progress) | Shane Burke '21 COVID-19 in Nandi County, Kenya (in progress) | Anna Gordon '21 Reconstruction in Diyarbakƒ±r, Turkey (in progress) | Monica Hunter-Hart '21 Who Holds Halfway Houses Accountable?

Institute for Nonprofit News | Internship Program Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, responding to a news media job market in crisis due to the COVID-19 virus, collaborated with the Institute for Nonprofit News (INN) in 2020, in 2021 and in 2022 to provide graduating students with paid internships to support their transitions to professional journalism. The internship program provides 10- to 12-week paid internships at non-profit news media companies, through a partnership with the Institute for Nonprofit News. Recent graduates are placed at regional news outlets to cover local communities, as well as at national outlets, where they will work in international reporting. Graduating students work as reporting interns covering issues ranging from local to international, during the summer or fall months. In the collaboration, INN arranges for some of its 300-member news organizations to recruit and select graduates from the graduating class into paid editorial reporting jobs. Students in all of the school‚Äôs master‚Äôs degree programs, including international scholars, are eligible to apply directly to the employers who will oversee their work. The local news internships and reporting grants are funded by generous alumni of the school, including through the Dean‚Äôs Fund for Post Graduate Reporting Opportunities, a new multi-donor fund that honors outgoing Dean Steve Coll and anticipates the arrival of a new dean. The international reporting internships and reporting grants are funded by the Simon and June Li Center for Global Journalism, a new center at Columbia committed to preparing journalists to work, think and report globally. In 2022, there will be four Li Center for Global Journalism Fellows, two at PBS NewsHour, one at Coda Story, and another at Honolulu Civil Beat. The Scripps Howard Foundation supports three internships, two at Religion News Service and one at Jewish Telegraphic Agency, all to be administered through INN. INN was founded in 2009 as an investigative news consortium. It works to strengthen the trusted sources of news by growing a network of nonprofit, nonpartisan news organizations. With more than 2,000 journalists in the INN network now generating some 150,000 original reports a year, the network‚Äôs news footprint is now similar in scale to NPR and the NPR affiliate network. INN members share news coverage, editorial and business resources and function as an innovation network developing new models for news media. In the inaugural year, internships were awarded to members of the Class of 2020 at the following INN-member newsrooms. In 2021, internships were awarded to members of the Class of 2021 at the following INN-member newsrooms. In 2022, internships will be awarded to members of the Class of 2022 at the following INN-member newsrooms: Employers: Join Us Partner with us to create a post-graduate fellowship or internship position in your newsroom.
