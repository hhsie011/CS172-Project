Periods of inactivity associated with sitting for long periods of time can increase your risk of diabetes, obesity, and heart and lung disease. Taking just five minutes to stand up and walk around every hour could prevent some of the health issues associated with prolonged sitting.

"Nix Your Sugar Fix" The “Nix Your Sugar Fix” challenge encourages you to substitute 4 healthy choices for sugary foods and drinks for at least 3 days each week of the four week challenge. Addicted to sugar? It can be a tough habit to kick as it’s in many foods and beverages. The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends the maximum amount of sugar consumed should be 9 teaspoons for men and 6 teaspoons for women. An effective way to begin to reduce your sugar intake is to start reading food labels as sugar is often disguised as sucrose, dextrose, rice syrup, and high fructose corn syrup.
