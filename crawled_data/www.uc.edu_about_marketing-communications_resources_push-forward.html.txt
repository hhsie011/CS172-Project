Many prospective students are uncertain of their future and are struggling with the idea that a hybrid or virtual college experience will be as good as an on-campus experience. Many future Bearcats are ready and willing to grow—becoming confident, self-made and courageous, despite not arriving that way their freshman year. What should they think? UC is a welcoming environment supporting those who want to build things better. This is my time to make my mark, and there’s no better place to do that then at UC. “The world can’t wait to see what we can do.” What should they feel? Inspired and empowered to act, change and improve Excited and encouraged to attend UC Tone: Courageous, Supportive, Gritty, Fearless Optimistic, Excellent, Serious, Uplifting, Bold Rationale: Push. Forward. UC Bearcats always push the limits of what’s possible, letting nothing stop them on their way to create a better tomorrow, every day. When you’re a UC Bearcat, you push forward. Push boundaries. Push progress. You’re forward thinking. Forward looking. Forward moving. Never stopping and never settling. You. Push. Forward.
