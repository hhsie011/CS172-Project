The process of determining reasonable and appropriate accommodations relies heavily on the interactive process between the student and Accessibility Resources. Our Online Application for Services represents an important piece in that process and provides Accessibility Resources with valuable information to determine accommodations now and possibility in the future, should a need arise. When completing this application please take the time to thoroughly answer all the questions. This application must be completed by a student seeking accommodations and services from our office. Documentation is not required to register for services, however, if it is available, it can be a useful tool and help to ensure that the full consideration of the impact of your disability on the academic environment is considered. Additionally, the reasonableness and necessity of requested accommodations may not be able to be determined without it, so students may be requested to provide documentation if: Documentation would help the student and AR staff identify barriers and workable solutions for accommodations Documentation would make the connection between the academic environment and the disability that is not readily apparent through the student’s narrative If you would like to submit documentation, please use our Documentation Submission Form. If documentation is submitted, we accept documentation from a variety of sources including: IEPs, 504 Plans, psychological evaluations, medical records, letters provided by qualified medical professionals or a Medical Professional Disability Verification Form. If available, documentation can be uploaded to this application for review. Please refer to our documentation guidelines for more information. An application cannot be saved and completed at a later date, therefore we recommend completing the form in one sitting. If you need assistance in completing this form or require accommodations to do so, please contact Accessibility Resources 513-556-6823 or email accessresources@uc.edu.
