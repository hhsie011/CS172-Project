As we start the last week of 2020, we would like to acknowledge and thank the vaccination teams that continued administering COVID-19 vaccines through the holiday break, working every day except on Christmas. We are deeply grateful to the Workforce Health and Safety, Operations, Pharmacy, IT, Supply chain, Transportation, Communications, Security, Regulatory, and Finance teams who have never stopped working. As of this morning, more than 16,000 staff at NewYork-Presbyterian, Weill Cornell, and Columbia have been vaccinated. This includes nearly 2,700 Columbia personnel in patient-facing roles and 101 students who are working in patient care areas. We have been administering both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. According to the CDC COVID Data Tracker, as of December 27, more than 1.9 million people in the U.S. have received their first dose of the vaccine. Currently, we are vaccinating more patient-facing teams and support staff and we will keep everyone updated as more groups are added. The FAQ and other information materials continue to be updated, so please check the CUIMC Vaccine Information Page to stay up to date. Thank you!
