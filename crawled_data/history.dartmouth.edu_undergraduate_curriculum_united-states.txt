HIST 2 #EverythingHasAHistory: Understanding America Today This introductory course will explore the historical roots of current events in the United States. This course demonstrates how history is woven into the fabric of our everyday lives and why understanding history is important for understanding the present and navigating the future. We will focus on case studies—such as immigration and borders, computers and society, and race and whiteness—and expect the syllabus to evolve in real time depending on what is in the news during the quarter. This class serves as an introductory course for History majors, but is open to all students. Dist: SOC; WCult: W. Major distributives (Class of 2023 and Before): US.

HIST 8.04; X-LIST: WGSS 26.03 History of Sexuality in America How have historical processes produced distinct sexual practices and identities over time? This course engages 300 years of a history that often evaded the historical record or was deliberately purged from it and asks how more traditional topics of U.S. historical inquiry—immigration, citizenship, economic organization, intellectual and artistic production, racialization, formal politics, law, religious practice—can yield new insights when sexual history is included as a legitimate dimension of analysis.

HIST 11 The Age of the American Revolution This course begins with an examination of relations between England and its American Colonies in the middle of the eighteenth century. It deals with the collapse of British authority in America, emphasizing the social and intellectual sources of rebellion. Treatment of the war years focuses more on the problem of political and economic adjustment than on military history. The final topic covered is the adoption of a federal Constitution.

HIST 12 The Civil War Era: From Rebellion to Revolution History 12 explores the most revolutionary and consequential period of U.S. History. It does so by pairing a close and critical reading of primary texts with a survey of leading scholarly interpretations. Across the term, we will also consider how the legacy of the American Civil War still looms large in contemporary American life. The 1860s and 1870s provide an indispensable framework for urgent disputes about the authority and role of government and the persistent inequities of anti-Black racism. Students can expect the course to equip them to track such discussions; a term of sustained historical inquiry will, indeed, allow them to make their own meaningful contributions.

HIST 13 Planters, Pirates, and Puritans: 17th-Century English America This course explores the many different forms of English colonialism in America. It considers their differences and similarities. It probes the ways they were shaped by shifting ideas back in Europe, the requirements of different American environments, and the influence of indigenous and enslaved people. It grapples with English America not as a precursor to the United States, but as a place where new ideas were tested and traditional hierarchies were broken down and reformed. Dist: SOC; WCult: W.

HIST 31.01; X-LIST: LATS 20 Latina/o Social Movements People of Latin American descent (aka "Latina/os," or the gender neutral, more inclusive "Latinx") have been at the forefront of a variety of social movements over the last century. In some cases, they have insinuated themselves into existing movements, while in others, they have built movements that uniquely speak to their concerns as soldiers and anti-war activists, undocumented residents, racial minorities, farm workers and/or perceived impediments to economic progress. Always, they have asserted their rights to protest. Frequently, they have taken these actions regardless of their citizenship status. This class charts the growth of these movements and anticipates the future of social protest and Latinx politics in the United States. Dist: SOC; WCult: W.

HIST 32 The Life, Death and Rebirth of Great American Cities This course takes a thematic and multi-media look at the history of four iconic American cities: New York, New Orleans, Los Angeles and Las Vegas. Two are old cities, centuries old, that grew in fits and starts organically over a very long time. Two are new cities, each of which mushroomed dramatically after World War II. Two are cities that have come to characterize American creativity and diversity. One of these is a city that has largely created and marketed American popular culture nationally and globally. One of these cities was America's fastest growing city for half a century and now is one of the hardest hit places in the U.S. by the 2008 crash and ensuing Great Recessions. There is no way to do justice to the history of four such complex cities, Instead, we examine and compare how key issues in the lives of these cities played out over time and space: founding and growth, enslavement, immigration and migration, labor and politics, arts and counterculture, sexuality, disaster and recovery.

HIST 33.01 Walmart to Wall Street: Excavating American Capitalism since 1970 This course takes on fundamental transformations in economic life from the end of the Bretton Woods system to the crisis of 2008. Rather than a chronological survey, it is an historical excavation of three key trends in the period: technological innovation; globalization; and financialization. Readings and lectures will contextualize each of these developments in the specific history of the post-Bretton Woods United States, and then trace their longer intellectual, political, and social origins.

It also has a past, and in order to imagine what will come next we need to understand how we got here. While primarily concerned with the U.S. in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries—the era of petro-intensive growth in the country that consumes 30% of the earth's resources for 5% of its population--our inquiry will require explicit reflection on the longer historical roots of energy use and the global framework of resource extraction.

HIST 35 The Creation of 'America' in the Age of Jefferson The years between the close of the American Revolution and the start of the Age of Jackson have been described as the "most neglected, if not the most despised period of American history." Without the drama of the Revolutionary years or the ominous tension of the Civil War's approach, the Early Republic has been seen as a dull interval between the country's defining events. Now, new methods in the study of American history have completely changed the way we understand the period. This course will focus on the seminal task of nation building, when distinctively American political parties, cities and villages, gender roles, educational systems, decorative arts, cultural institutions, attitudes toward Native peoples, architecture and economic policies took form. Thomas Jefferson actively shaped the debates over these issues, and he serves as the pivotal figure in our study of the formation of a new and specifically American culture in the Early Republican period.

HIST 36 Health Care in American Society: History and Current Issues This course is designed to provide students with a basic understanding of critical issues in health care through the study of the historical development of the United States health care system. The course illuminates the influence of historical forces and cultural factors on the delivery of health care and on the discourse about health care reform in American history. By studying the components and relationships within the American health care system, students are enabled to acquire an understanding of the relationship between American history and the health care system, and also enabled to obtain a working contextual knowledge of the current problems of the American health care system and their proposed solutions. Each topic is presented from an historical perspective. Through an historical investigation of health, disease, and medicine students should be able to understand and discuss the changing organization of health care delivery in American history, the changing methods of financing of health care, the distinctive role of technology in health care, primary ethical issues in health care, comparative features of health care systems of other cultures, the historical changes in public health precepts, images of health care in popular culture, and the process of health care reform in American history.

HIST 37; X-LIST: AAAS 24 Black Radical Tradition in America Throughout the history of the United States, African Americans have offered alternative visions of their nation's future and alternative definitions of their nation's progress. Not limited to reforming the worst social ills, these discourses have called for a fundamental restructuring of our political, economic, and social relations. A radical tradition provided the intellectual continuity and ideological coherence of these critiques, and it allowed African Americans to cultivate and pass on a legacy of social resistance.

HIST 38.03; X-LIST: NAIS 51 Pan-Indianism in American History This course provides the history of pan-Indian movements in Indigenous North America from 1680 to the present. In the current era of self-determination, tribal sovereignty, and Indigenous nationhood, we perhaps sometimes forget that pan-Indian movements have played a significant part in the history and experiences of Native peoples of North America. We will explore the many ways in which Native peoples have aligned themselves with other tribal nations religious, military, educational, economic, and environmental movements, in the process cutting across linguistic, cultural, religious, and national lines. Indigenous North Americans have deployed pan-Indianism as a strategy to confront both international such as colonialism and the struggles for control of contested Borderlands, and more regional and localized forces. Taken in its entirety, understanding pan-Indianism is essential to understanding the history of Native North America. Dist: SOC; WCult: NW.

Viewing Native America as an incredibly complex series of borderlands is a useful interpretive model for better understanding the history of Native peoples. Lectures, readings, and class discussion will focus on elements such as cultural contact, conquest and colonialism, missionization, citizenship, gender, and nation. While exploring these various themes, we will touch on some familiar territory such as frontiers and middle grounds, but we will also question our own personal, and often, region-based expertise in order to unpack a more nuanced view of Indigenous borderlands and their significance.

HIST 90.10 Liberalism and Its History: World War II to the Present The 2016 election of Donald Trump, Brexit, and what appears to be a global turn to nationalism, have led to the publication of endless columns and myriad books proclaiming liberalism to be in a state of international crisis. Liberalism is not in its death throes, but what talk over a crisis of liberalism has initiated is a discussion about its historical origins, and how liberalism has evolved over time given new political contexts and challenges.

HIST 90.13; X-LIST: NAIS 30.22 Placing History: An Exploration of Local History through Archives, Fieldwork, & Digital Maps This course will explore two related questions: how can spatial and place-based thinking benefit historical scholarship? More specifically, how can we combine fieldwork, archival research, and the use of digital tools to help us recover hidden aspects of local history? To answer these questions, this course will include three parts. First, a seminar component will allow students to think global and act local. Students will analyze and discuss spatial history and place-based history projects from around the globe while also evaluating primary historical sources on local and regional history. Second, a fieldwork component will allow students to visit local archives and the places they are studying and examine the way history has alternatively been inscribed in or erased from the landscape. Third, a lab component will offer students the chance to learn new skills using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software to map local history over space and time. Dist: SOC; WCult: NW.

HIST 90.18 Reproductive Health in U.S. History This lecture course surveys the history of reproductive medicine and health in the United States from the nineteenth century to the present. It focuses on histories of childbearing, pregnancy, fertility, contraception, reproductive biotechnology, and reproductive healthcare, centering their significance within overlapping political, social, cultural, medical, and scientific contexts. Topics include the management of reproduction within U.S. slavery and empire, reproductive medicine and concepts of race, competing assertions of professional authority over pregnancy and childbearing, eugenics and sterilization, movements for reproductive rights and community healthcare, technologies of reproductive medicine (including prenatal screening and assisted reproductive technology), and present-day disparities in access to and quality of reproductive care. Throughout the term, we will pay particular attention to intersections with historical and present-day formations of race, gender, disability, citizenship, and kinship. Dist: SOC; WCult: W.

HIST 96.04; X-list LACS 80.60 Seminar: Ethnic Los Angeles This course will focus on the history, culture and literature of Los Angeles, California, the second largest city in the United States. We will briefly examine its founding in the eighteenth century as a Northwest outpost of the Spanish empire in the Americas, and its origins and evolution as a Mexican pueblo and U.S. city in the nineteenth century. The majority of our attention will be on the historical and contemporary struggles of people of color in metro-Los Angeles throughout the twentieth and into the twenty-first centuries.

HIST 96.08; X-LIST: NAIS 81.03 Seminar: Pen and Ink Witchcraft: Native American History Through Treaties Treaties enabled European colonists to establish a foothold in North America and charted the territorial expansion of the United States. Indian people were often deceived by treaties and they referred to them as "pen and ink witch-craft." But the hundreds of Indian treaties generated unique records of cultural encounter. Each treaty had its own story and cast of characters. Working with the records of key treaties, this seminar will examine the protocols of Indian diplomacy, the maneuverings and agendas of the different participants, as well as the outcomes and legacies of Indian treaties.

HIST 96.12 Seminar: Race, Ethnicity and Immigration in U.S. History This seminar examines the evolving meaning of the U.S. border, the history of whiteness as a spoken and unspoken requirement for full American citizenship and the ways that stereotyping has been used to enforce race, gender, ethnic labor hierarchies from the first European/First Peoples contacts, through the era of slavery and early nineteenth century immigration. The second half of the course examines how race, ethnicity, class and gender have shaped the self-identification of many different kinds of immigrant groups from the mid-nineteenth century through the late twentieth century with a continued focus on evolving meanings of whiteness. In the course's final unit, we examine racial and ethnic tensions in U.S. cities that have been the destination for large waves of immigrants through the 1990s. Dist: SOC; WCult: CI.

HIST 96.21 Seminar: Political Thought in Colonial America This seminar investigates the ideas and practices that constructed and deconstructed empire in North Americas during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It explores the perspectives of those involved in advancing and resisting European colonialism as they debated how to manage political, economic, and religious structures that bridged the Atlantic. The course traces evolving scholarly approaches to analyzing political culture and equips students to undertake research in early American political history with published and archival records.

HIST 96.28 Seminar: America in the 1970s Formerly dismissed as the decade when "it seemed like nothing happened," the seventies are increasingly understood as a decisive period when a new political economy took shape, new forms of citizenship competed for influence, and new cultural forms emerged. Even disco has gotten a second look. By shedding light on a significant incident, movement, art form, cultural phenomenon, debate, organization, or development of the era, you will contribute to this ongoing project of historical reassessment.

HIST 96.29 Seminar: Debating Democracy in Nineteenth Century America This seminar examines the ideas and practices of American democracy at the moment of its emergence. After an initial couple weeks of defining terms and orienting ourselves in the larger context of modern democracy, our readings and discussions will consider such key issues as: expansions and contractions in voting rights; the role of public opinion; the place of minorities in majoritarian government; the tensions between American democracy and American slavery; and the contested debates over the citizenship of women and African Americans.

HIST 96.38 Seminar: Crisis and Continuity in Twentieth-Century U.S. Social Movements This course invites students to study the history of twentieth-century social movements through close primary source analysis and historiographic debate. We'll identify the precipitating events or crises that cultivate particular social movements, but we'll also examine their quieter dimensions, including their aftermaths, "half-lives," and influence on subsequent movements. We begin by considering how historians define social movements, as well as theoretical frameworks that circulate between history and other disciplines to understand them. Through our close study of four social movements (and your own research) we'll explore the relationship between individual experience and collective mobilization. We'll ask how social movements have been received and reshaped by the institutions they target, and identify the means by which opponents resisted social movement claims. In so doing, we'll ask the following questions: How have scholars decided when a social movement begins and ends? How does periodization shape our understanding of their impact? How have changes in broadcast media and digital technology altered the organization, communication, and historical record of social movements? Do they pose particular interpretive challenges for historians? Throughout the course, we'll identify continuities in worldviews, moral commitments, narratives, and historical memory that have characterized social movement genealogies across the twentieth century. Coursework will immerse students in historiographic debates and extend those conversations through assignments in which students identify and present primary sources to the class. We'll continue our collective preparation for primary source analysis through visits to Rauner Archive and Special Collections. The course will culminate with a 20-25 page research paper on a social movement of your choosing. Dist: TMV; WCult: W. Major distributives (Class of 2023 and Before): US.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of History Undergraduate Overview History FAQs for First Year and Transfer Students How to Declare a Major or Minor in History Major Modified Major Minor Transfer Credit Policy Course Descriptions First-Year Seminars Introductory Africa, Asia, Latin America & The Caribbean (AALAC) Europe (EUR) Interregional & Comparative (INTER) United States (US) Seminars & Colloquia Independent Study & Honors Course Schedule 2021-2022 Schedule 2022-2023 Schedule 2023-2024 Schedule Course Syllabi Honors Thesis Program General Timeline Guidelines for the Class of 2022 Guidelines for the Class of 2023 Honors Theses By Year Phi Alpha Theta Honors Society Prizes After Graduation Alumni Update Research Overview Faculty Research Initiatives Dartmouth History Institute Student Research Initiatives and Resources The Dartmouth Vietnam Project History Librarian Research Funding Resources Undergraduate Research Database Student Class Projects Foreign Study News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
