The Center aims to contribute to the academic and research environment of Turkey across a variety of fields, while also allowing members of the Columbia community to increase their knowledge and explore academic opportunities within Turkey. The Center works in collaboration with local universities, non-governmental organizations and public institutions to design cross-cutting, innovative programs and partnerships with different Schools, Centers and Institutes within Columbia. Ongoing events, lectures and seminars hosted by the Center also act towards building a lively and engaged community of local and international alumni, students and faculty. Columbia Global Centers | Istanbul was launched in November 2011 and became fully operational in January 2012. The Center is governed by a Board of Directors comprised of Columbia University senior administrators, and receives guidance from a University-wide Faculty Steering Committee and the Office of Columbia Global Centers.
