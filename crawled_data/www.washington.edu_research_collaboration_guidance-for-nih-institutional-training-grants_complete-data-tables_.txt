Preview the variety of tables and identify those which you are required to complete and submit with your NRSA Institutional Training grant. NIH provides an introduction and overview of all Data Tables on their website. Create a data table tracker with contacts and the list of tables you will need from each contact. Send requests via email using your department contact list, track requests via your data table tracker. Use these Email Templates to Request data for tables when you contact faculty and administrators. TIPS Leverage data from other units You may be able to get fully formatted and completed tables from departments working (or who have recently completed) on a NRSA Institutional Training grant proposal. Share data between grants Refer to the School of Medicine list of training grant programs including those funded through the T32 mechanism to find whether or not there are faculty who are overlapping on multiple training grants. Leverage existing older tables Ask contacts to update information on tables from past training grant submissions rather than create a whole new table Ask department administrators for information before you contact faculty. They may have some of the information already on hand (e.g., current NIH biosketches) Send ONE email to each department or participating mentor. Make a list of the items you need from each participating mentor or department. Send them ONLY the tables they need to complete for you. Tell them need the data in a particular font and size? Do you want a particular formatting of your table’s data? It is your goal to be as clear and concise as possible the first time, and not to bother departments with constant amendments and changes. Don't forget to request information that proves you are in compliance with IACUC approvals, Bioethical Training for trainees, etc. Collect Data Organize and track your data using a Training Grant Data Table Tracker created to track responses from departments. TIPS Organize items in individual folders on your computer. Keep a list with each folder identifying the contents and missing items. Keep track of what has been received on your spreadsheet. Some training grant administrators use color coding in their spreadsheet cells: one color when the item has been received from the department, one color when the item has been reviewed, formatted and edited, and one color when it is ready to submit. Be careful to add a date to all file names. You will have many renditions of the same table and will want to make sure you don’t use an old file in your final upload. Prepare Tables Download the original tables from the NIH website, along with the sample and instructions. Use the table tips and tricks provided below (tips and tricks have not been developed for all tables). Each downloadable document contains suggestions for gathering and proofing the data, and links to resources. The tables in these documents are for illustration only and should not be used in place of the original tables you download from the NIH website.
