They partner with farmers to improve livestock breeding, ensure adequate nutrition over the animal’s lifespan and prevent disease. They look out for the environmental impact of animal agriculture, check meat and milk for pathogens, find better ways to manage rangeland and even study the ways our house pets communicate with us. As an expert in animal biology and behavior, you’ll spend your days improving the way we keep and employ the animals in our care.
