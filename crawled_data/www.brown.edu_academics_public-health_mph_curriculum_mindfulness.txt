This includes a vibrant core of interdisciplinary faculty focused on the full spectrum of mindfulness ranging from theory to measurement to treatment delivery to teacher training. The establishment and expansion of a world-leading Mindfulness Center at Brown ([email protected]) under the leadership of Eric Loucks, PhD, presents new opportunities for expanding mindfulness research and education programs at Brown. With the expanded faculty, critically important mindfulness courses have been implemented, and the MPH Concentration in Mindfulness is being launched starting with the class entering Fall 2020.
