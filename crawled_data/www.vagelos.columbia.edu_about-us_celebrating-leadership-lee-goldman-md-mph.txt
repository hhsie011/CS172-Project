Lee Goldman MD, MPH Following 14 years of exemplary leadership, Lee Goldman, MD, MPH, stepped down from his posts as dean of the Faculties of Health Sciences and Medicine and chief executive of the medical center on June 30th, 2020. When President Lee Bollinger appointed Dr. Lee Goldman to lead the Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) in 2006, Dr. Goldman reflected on the tremendous responsibility of captaining a preeminent medical center. “My responsibility,” he said, “is to create a diverse environment where the best clinicians, researchers, teachers and students can have the resources and institutional support to expand the frontiers of scientific knowledge, improve health care for our society, and train the next generation to sustain and enhance this mission.” He acknowledged that his new post represented both a tremendous challenge and a wonderful opportunity. More than 14 years later, we reflect on an unparalleled legacy in meeting the diverse challenges and opportunities that emerged in swiftly evolving landscapes in academia and healthcare. We recognize the achievements made under Dean Goldman's leadership and we invite all of you to watch the video below as we reflect back on the last fourteen years with deep appreciation. fourteen_years_of_transformations_under_lee_goldman Columbia University Irving Medical Center NewYork-Presbyterian ColumbiaDoctors About VP&S Careers Education Research Administration Inside VP&S Columbia University Irving Medical Center Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons 630 West 168th Street New York, NY 10032 United States Follow Us Facebook Twitter YouTube Instagram Back to top
