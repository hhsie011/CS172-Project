The program offers a major and a minor for undergraduate students wanting to learn about theory and practice in the study of language. Linguistics is the study of how human languages are structured and used. This may involve discovering patterns for how words are created, how sounds are combined to create meanings, how sentences are formed, and how speakers use language to communicate meaning. Students explore topics including the sounds and grammar of language, languages of the world, computational analysis of language, and language teaching.
