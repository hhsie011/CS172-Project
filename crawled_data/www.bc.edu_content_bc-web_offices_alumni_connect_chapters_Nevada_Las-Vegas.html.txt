Why did you get involved in your local chapter?: My 1964 Class Correspondent and really good friend, John Moynihan, really kept me abreast of our Alumni Association network, and I’ve remained involved helping local students interested in learning about Boston College and even helped them apply in a few cases. Fun Fact: I loved ice skating growing up near Branch Brook Park, in Newark, New Jersey. I took my skates to BC because of McHugh Forum on campus, and I needed to work, so I accepted a job during general skating hours and felt great stress needing to slow down skaters who were going too fast. I had to quit when I fell forward skating backward and needed stitches in my chin from that fall! What are your local favorites?: Las Vegas has numerous eateries that attract me, especially of the Thai, Mexican, Middle Eastern, and Italian varieties.
