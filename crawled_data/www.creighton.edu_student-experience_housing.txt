Sleep soundly. Crush college. You can’t expect to do well in class if you’re not at your best. Our award-winning dining halls mean that you won’t just eat—but you’ll eat well. And our residence halls are more than a place to rest your head, but a place to find the community you always expected from college. #Protip: living on campus makes you smarter. As a freshman, you’ll live in one of three residence halls: Deglman, Kiewit or Swanson halls. As a sophomore, you'll be able to choose between Heider, McGloin, Kenefick, and Davis. After your sophomore year, you can move off campus. But students who live in a residence hall or campus apartment for four years get better grades and are more likely to earn a degree. See On-Campus Options Image Can’t-Miss Dining Variety is great—as long as the food is, too. Don’t take our word for it, though: Creighton ranks as one of the nation’s 50 best college dining experiences. It’s all in the (meal) plan. All on-campus residents are enrolled in a meal plan. You’ll have the option of eating in a traditional dining hall or using dining dollars at one of our to-go options -- including not one, but two Starbucks locations on campus. Good for you. Good for the planet. Try the Simple Servings menu based on recipes that avoid gluten, nuts and other common allergens, or Mindful menu created for good health and taste. We’ve also gone trayless, adopted green packaging and taken other eco-friendly steps.
