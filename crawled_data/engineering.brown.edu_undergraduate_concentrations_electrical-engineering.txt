Bachelor of Arts Concentration Options Declaring a Concentration Electrical Engineering Electrical engineers design and manufacture computer hardware; sensors; biomedical instrumentation; communication systems; control systems; radar and navigation equipment, as well as power generation equipment and propulsion systems. Brown's Sc.B. degree in Electrical Engineering is designed to allow students to construct a program tailored to their interests. Building on the broad scientific foundation provided by the core curriculum, students may select combinations of upper level courses designed to prepare them for seven areas of specialization within Electrical Engineering. It is possible to switch between these specializations as late as senior year. The program has the following general structure: The interdisciplinary engineering core, taken during the first two years; Three advanced Electrical Engineering courses (ENGN1570 ‘Linear Systems,’ ENGN1620 ‘Design of Electronic Circuits,’ and ENGN1630 ‘Digital System Design’) One advanced Electrical Engineering foundation course that serves as a gateway to the traditional Electrical Engineering specializations of bioelectrical engineering, communication systems, computer engineering, multimedia signal processing, microelectronic systems, and solid-state electronics and photonics. Two additional upper level courses may be selected from a list of Electrical Engineering elective courses to define a student-designed specialization. A capstone design course An advanced science course Four approved humanities courses Sample course plan For complete requirements, please see the University Bulletin. SEM.
