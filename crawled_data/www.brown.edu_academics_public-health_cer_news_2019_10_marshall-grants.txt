[Brown University] — With opioid drug overdose deaths skyrocketing in recent decades, researchers at Brown University’s School of Public Health are confronting the epidemic in multiple ways. Two new five-year grants from the National Institutes of Health, totaling $6.8 million, will expand those efforts. The first will launch a partnership with the State of Rhode Island that will result in neighborhood-based intervention strategies across the state’s cities and towns informed by a new predictive forecasting model. The second will enable researchers to evaluate the effectiveness of test strips used to detect fentanyl, a highly potent prescription opioid often used to lace other heroin or cocaine, but hard for drug users to detect Center for Epidemiologic Research Center for Epidemiologic Research Brown University Box G-S121-2 121 South Main Street 2nd Floor Providence, RI 02912 Phone: 401-863-2918 Twitter Twitter Brown University Giving to Brown 121 South Main Street, Providence, Rhode Island 02903, USA 401-863-3375 Contact Us Newsletter Maps Directions Career Opportunities Campus Safety Accessibility Brown Social Media © 2022 Brown University | Back to top
