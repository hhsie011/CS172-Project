The curriculum consists of 18 credits of required core coursework, and a minimum of 42 credits of elective courses. No transfer credits from other institutions may be applied toward the MBA degree. Students who exempt out of core courses replace them with electives to fulfill the MBA requirement of 60 credits of graduate-level courses taken in residence at the School in four terms of study. Fifty-four of these credits must consist of in-classroom business courses. Students may count a combined maximum of six credits of Independent Study, Cross-Cultural Seminar, and graduate-level courses from other Columbia schools toward the MBA degree. While students generally register for 15 credits per term, full-time residence at the Business School is strictly defined as a minimum of 12 credits. Students are permitted to take up to 18 credits per term, and may graduate with more than 60 credits. A failed core course must be repeated; a failed elective must either be repeated or replaced by another. Requirements differ for dual degree programs. FAQ How many terms are in the MBA program?
