Gateway is funded by the Provost Office and jointly administered by the Associate Deans Office, in collaboration with the Biology, Chemistry, and Mathematics Departments, along with the Learning to Learn Office and the Thea Bowman AHANA and Intercultural Center. Students in the Gateway Scholars Program are connected to a faculty advisor in a STEM Department and enrolled in science classes that facilitate one-on-one interactions with science faculty and teaching assistants. The program is designed to provide academic support as well as specific activities to build a vibrant community of students who collectively work together on common STEM goals throughout the entire four years at Boston College. Gateway allows students to persevere within the STEM majors, explore various careers and paths, and develop a sense of community and belonging at Boston College. The program is designed to help prepare students to take the next step toward their academic and professional development by exploring their unique course sequencing and Gateway programming. This may also include working in a faculty lab doing research or taking on an internship in a variety of science or clinical disciplines.
