This working group discusses, identifies, and develops resources, curriculum examples, and innovative pedagogies as research on data science education for improving Columbia’s overall capacity in teaching data literacy, data ethics, empirical reasoning skills, advanced computational, and data-driven research skills. Both federal agencies and private sectors are dedicating more resources in curriculum development and training at both undergraduate and graduate levels. There is also interest in informal training for researchers. Our hope is to eventually establish a center on data science education to bring together creative educators in data science across campus, pool resources and efforts, promote data science teaching and learning efforts, and increase Columbia’s visibility in this domain. The mission of this working group is separate from DSI’s education committee which oversees the governance of DSI programs and facilitates formal educational collaboration between DSI and other units of the university.
