Quality Improvement Program The IRB conducts quality improvement initiatives to evaluate and strengthen the quality of our human research protection program. The primary purpose of these initiatives is to increase the efficiency of our performance and ensure compliance with federal regulations for the protection of human subjects in research. Compliance Oversight The IRB has the responsibility to oversee the conduct of research that it approves. Consistent with this responsibility, the IRB may audit research studies conducted at Columbia University or Columbia University Medical Center as well as research in which faculty and/or staff of Columbia University are engaged outside the institution. The Compliance Oversight Manager is responsible conducting audits at both campuses and reports to the Executive Director of the IRB. When, as a result of an audit, or in the course of routine IRB business, incidents of noncompliance by investigators with federal regulations or Columbia University Medical Center IRB policies are identified, they are brought to the attention of the Executive Director of the IRB and the Chair of the Board to which the protocol is assigned. The incidents of non-compliance are then reviewed and managed in one of several ways depending on the severity of the non-compliance. A plan of corrective action is documented for each incident of non-compliance. Federalwide Assurance The Federalwide Assurance (FWA) is the institution's commitment to comply with federal regulations for the protection of human subjects in research.
