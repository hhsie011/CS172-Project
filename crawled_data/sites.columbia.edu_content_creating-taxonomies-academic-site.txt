You can add pages as needed at any time. However, setting up your taxonomy first will save you a lot of time down the road. Many pages use taxonomy in their setup. If you create these pages before creating the taxonomy referenced, you will need to go back and update the page later or, in some cases, not be able to create the page in the first place. For the academic Columbia Sites website, there are four taxonomy groups that need to get set: Graduate profile taxonomy term: cohort years Faculty profiles taxonomy term: faculty rank News taxonomy term: news topics Publications taxonomy term: publish type, research projects From the main menu, click Shortcuts and then Taxonomy to see all the taxonomy categories. Explanation of terms Cohort Years: Used when creating a graduate profile. Cohort year is used for organizing graduate profiles. Faculty Rank: Used when creating a faculty profile. These terms become the mechanisms from which users can sort faculty profiles. News Topics: Used when creating a news article. This creates a news kicker above the article title. Publish Type and Research Projects: Used for creating publications. These terms become the mechanisms from which users can sort the list of publications. Click List terms for the taxonomy you want. Click Add term if you need to create another item for the category. Add terms. Click Save.
