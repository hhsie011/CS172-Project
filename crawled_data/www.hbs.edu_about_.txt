"For the first time in my life, I stepped foot onto a land I did not call my own. To give me a better education, my family immigrated from China to Canada, a country where we knew not a single soul. I still remember the evening we moved into our new home. We could not figure out why children with scary costumes were roaming menacingly around the neighborhood, or worse, knocking on our door and panhandling for candy. We were so scared that we turned off the lights and pretended not to be home. "Twenty years later, you may be surprised when I tell you that my feeling of being a stranger in a strange land has grown stronger than ever. Borders between nations may no longer divide us, but global battle lines are being drawn on issues like gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic, and political beliefs. No matter where I go, the world I see today is barely recognizable from the one I grew up in. "Only this time, armed with an HBS education, I refuse to turn off the lights in my house. I believe our differences are too important to just hide away, I choose to embrace tolerance rather than intolerance, and I will be the change I wish to see in the world." - Keven Wang (MBA 2022) Click the link in our bio to read more student stories from the Asian Affinity Business Association in honor of #AAPIHeritageMonth HBS MBA Admissions @hbsadmissions Be Social Facebook Instagram Snapchat Tumblr Twitter Youtube Nancy M. Williams (MBA 1992) shares how she leveraged CPD career coaching to make a career switch, launch a venture (Auditory Insight) and find true fulfillment in her professional and personal endeavors. "My business has a deeply personal aspect for me: I have a progressive, genetic hearing loss. In addition to wearing powerful hearing aids (I was fitted with my first aid at age 12), I lip-read and use captioning in order to communicate effectively with others."
