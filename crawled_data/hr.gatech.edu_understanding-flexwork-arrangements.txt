Although not every position can take advantage of these arrangements, there are a variety of ways that flexibility can be leveraged while maintaining productivity. The Flexwork Arrangements policy covers a variety of work arrangements, including hybrid and fully remote work scenarios. As stated in the policy, decisions to implement flexible work will be made by an employee’s unit leadership. What Flexwork Options Exist? There are three types of flexible work arrangements available. Compressed Workweek allows an employee to work a traditional 40-hour work week in less than 5 days. Flextime allows employees to change their arrival, departure and/or lunch times to come in earlier or leave later than the organization's normal hours. Telecommuting allows employees to work away from the conventional or main office. Things to Consider Flexible work arrangements can have significant benefits for both the Institute and employees. Although not all jobs allow for such arrangements, when appropriate, flexwork can reduce time spent commuting and bring more balance to employees’ work and personal lives–in some cases improving employee productivity and morale. While the Institute is committed to embracing flexibility, it is imperative that we prioritize the needs of our student population and recognize the distinction between work that can be completed remotely and work that cannot. Benefits to Employees Enhanced Flexibility – Employees have greater flexibility regarding where they work, as well as hours in which they perform their job functions. Cost Savings - Employees can save on many expenses such as gas, food, and car maintenance expenses. Improved Inclusion – With a larger number of employees exercising flexible options, greater attention is placed on including voices both on- and off-premises. Greater Productivity – A greater sense of productivity is achieved when employees can dedicate time that would have been spent commuting or engaged with in-person distractions. Increased Well-being - Employees can dedicate time to their jobs, while also engaging in activities that promote their health and well-being. Benefits to Georgia Tech Overhead Cost Savings – As employees utilize flexible work arrangements, the Institute can reduce spending on electricity, water, property insurance, office supplies, and much more. Competitive Recruiting – Flexible work opportunities create a desirable experience that attracts competitive talent. Increased Engagement – Engagement and staff retention can increase through employing flexible work arrangements. Reduced Emissions - Less commuting and business travel decreases the Institute’s carbon footprint.
