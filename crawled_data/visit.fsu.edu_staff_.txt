Position Overview The University Ambassadors are a distinguished group of student leaders who share their student and academic experience with prospective applicants, parents and guests. By sharing their unique student perspective and university knowledge, Ambassadors assist the Office of Admissions in student recruitment. This includes, but is not limited to, leading campus tours, serving on student panels and connecting with both prospective and admitted students/families. In response to current safety regulations and guidelines, we have adapted our program to offer virtual events.
