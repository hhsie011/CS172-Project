Penn accepts the Common Application and Coalition Application. We have no preference for either format and treat both applications equally in our process. We encourage you to review the features of each application format and use the platform that suits you best. You should submit only one application per admissions cycle and not mix-and-match across platforms. Apply Via The Common Application Apply Via The Coalition Application QuestBridge Applicants Penn is a proud QuestBridge partner institution and participates in the National College Match program for high-achieving students with significant financial need. We will accept the QuestBridge Application from QuestBridge National College Match Finalists in lieu of the Common Application or Coalition Application. For more details on QuestBridge and the National College Match program, please visit their website. Apply via the QuestBridge Application Application Dates & Deadlines Early Decision: November 1, 2021 Regular Decision: January 5, 2022 Application Fee: $75 or fee waiver for those who qualify. First-Year Checklist & Deadlines Admissions Plans (Early vs. Regular) Early Decision Penn’s Early Decision program is binding, meaning that if you are admitted, you are obligated to accept our offer of admission. By mid-December, you will receive one of three possible outcomes from your Early Decision application: You are admitted into the University of Pennsylvania. As part of our Early Decision program, you are committed to accepting our offer of admission. You must withdraw any active applications you have to other colleges/universities. The only instance in which you could request to be released from our Early Decision binding agreement is if your financial need can’t be met, which would be determined only after consulting with Penn’s Student Financial Services office. You are deferred for consideration during Regular Decision. Your application will be considered among our Regular Decision candidates and you will no longer be bound by the Early Decision binding agreement. You will receive final notification of our decision in late March/early April. Instructions on how to provide updates to your application will be found on your applicant portal. You are denied under the Early Decision program. Your application process for this cycle year is complete. If you are still interested in Penn, you are welcome to re-apply during the next application cycle. *We will notify all Early Decision applicants of the exact time and date of our decision release at least one week ahead of time so that they can be aware of when to expect their admissions decision. We appreciate that attending Penn is a tradition for many families. The Admissions Office identifies legacy applicants based on the information provided in a student’s application and defines “legacy” as being either a child or grandchild of alumni. Legacies who apply to Penn—like all applicants—receive thorough consideration in the application process. Although applicants considering applying through Early Decision must submit their applications earlier (November 1st) than Regular Decision applicants (January 5th), the process of applying is no different. Please refer to our Checklists & Deadlines page for more information. Regular Decision If you’re a Regular Decision applicant to the University of Pennsylvania and are accepted by another school under a binding Early Decision program, you must inform the Office of Admissions and withdraw your Penn application. You are admitted into the University of Pennsylvania. You have been accepted and are now invited to join the incoming first-year class. You will have until the admitted student reply date to accept or decline our offer of admission. You are waitlisted. You have been placed on the waitlist and do not currently have a seat in the incoming class. If you choose to remain on the waitlist -- and if space allows -- you will be considered for admission later in the spring or summer. You are denied admission under the Regular Decision program. Your application process for this cycle year is complete. If you are still interested in Penn, you are welcome to re-apply during the next application cycle. To learn more about our admitted students, please refer to our Admitted Class of 2025 webpage. Decision Notification Timeline Notification of Decision Early Decision: Mid-December 2021 Regular Decision: By April 2022 Admitted Student Reply/Enrollment Confirmation Early Decision: January 5, 2022 Regular Decision: May 2, 2022 Pre-college Credit Please note: These polices are in effect for students entering in the Fall of 2018 and beyond. They remain under ongoing review by the faculty of the University and are subject to change without notice. Current students should consult their home school offices for policies in effect at the time of their matriculation. COVID-19 Update: Penn will continue to grant credit and placement for these exams. We understand some scores will now be based on online tests, while other scores will be based on year-long academic coursework. Testing agencies are making prudent decisions to prevent large gatherings of people. We are in communication with testing agencies around the world and we support them in the decisions they feel they need to make. The University of Pennsylvania may award credit or advanced course standing to students who have taken Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or other internationally-recognized examinations. Scores warranting University credit vary by department. Matriculating students seeking credit for Advanced Placement (AP) exams must have official score reports sent directly to the Office of the University Registrar by the Educational Testing Service. See Advanced Placement chart below. Matriculating students seeking credit for International Baccalaureate (IB) exams must have official score reports sent directly to the Office of Admissions by the International Baccalaureate Organization. See International Baccalaureate chart below. Matriculating students seeking credit for A-Level exams must email their original A-Level certificates to the Office of Admissions (Attention: Eddrena Owens, eddrenao@upenn.edu) in order to have their scores evaluated for credit. See GCE Advanced (A) Level Exam Policy chart below. Pre-College and Dual Enrollment Course Work Credit is not awarded for college-level coursework undertaken at other institutions while a student is enrolled in high school or in the summer after high school. Such coursework is considered a part of a student’s preparation for a Penn education. It is used in consultation with the student’s academic advisor to inform decisions about placement into appropriate courses at Penn. Students who enroll in regular undergraduate courses at Penn prior to their matriculation into an undergraduate degree program at the University, during the academic year or in the summer sessions, may elect to have that coursework merged with their undergraduate transcript, in which case it will count toward their undergraduate degree requirements, and the grades will be included in their grade point average.
