Important Notice for GI Bill Recipients A new emergency bill has granted the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) the authority to continue GI Bill payments uninterrupted in the event of national emergencies (such as COVID-19). The new law allows the VA to continue to pay benefits even if your program delivery method has changed from resident training to online training. You will also continue to receive the same monthly housing allowance payments that you received for resident training until January 1, 2021, or until UofL resumes normal operations.
