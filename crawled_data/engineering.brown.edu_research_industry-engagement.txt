These partnerships are mutually beneficial in advancing R&D efforts and spurring innovation. We seek these connections to help facilitate faculty and student interactions with industrial and thought leaders in the U.S. and globally, and focus our research on the most relevant and impactful applications. Collaborations may take the form of industrial sponsored research projects, discretionary funding in support of faculty research, faculty consulting, access to shared research facilities, or sharing of material samples, data sets, or pre-commercial devices. Ways to Get Involved The Brown School of Engineering actively encourages students and faculty to engage with industry and provides various opportunities for industrial partners to gain access to the wealth of intellectual potential of our faculty and students.

Successful Partnerships General Motors/Brown Collaborative Research Laboratory for Computational Materials Research The laboratory for computational materials research at Brown University was founded in 2001 by General Motors to accelerate the pace of innovation in strategic technology areas. More than 10 faculty, 15 postdocs, and 30 students, along with 12 staff members from GM R&D have participated in the lab since its inception. The goal of the laboratory is to use a combination of computer simulations and experiments to develop and assess new materials that could lead to low-cost, high-performance and environmentally friendly components for vehicles. Notable achievements of the laboratory include computer aided design of advanced high-strength steels and aluminum alloys with improved strength and formability, and the development of new experimental and theoretical methods to characterize and predict damage in battery electrode materials. The laboratory currently focuses on developing lightweight aluminum alloys with improved strength and fracture resistance for vehicle body structures, as well as battery materials with improved charge capacity and life for electric and hybrid vehicles. “General Motors has one of the top industrial research labs in the world, and Brown’s partnership with GM over the past 20 years has helped us to solve problems that we could not have tackled on our own. Our students and faculty are excited to be part of a team working with GM to help make vehicles safer, lighter, and more fuel efficient.” Allan Bower, co-director Collaborative Research Laboratory, Brown University School of Engineering Cognex- Brown Connection Cognex Corporation, in Natick, Mass., is the world’s leading provider of vision systems, vision software, vision sensors and industrial ID readers used in manufacturing automation. The company designs, develops, manufactures, and markets a range of products that incorporate sophisticated machine vision technology that gives them the ability to “see”, including barcode readers, machine vision sensors, and machine vision systems. During a 2012 recruiting event, Cognex’s President and CEO Rob Willett ’89 traveled back to his alma mater, and decided it was time to start working with the engineering talent on College Hill. The partnership between Cognex and engineering and computer science professors Gabriel Taubin and Pedro Felzenszwalb began when the company was looking for research related to three-dimensional vision. The cooperative agreement has expanded into a mutually beneficial collaboration between the two entities, giving Cognex a unique opportunity to work with Brown faculty and gain valuable resources and technologies, while at the same time providing real-world educational and research opportunities to both faculty and students on campus. The partnership supports students, equipment purchases, and research breakthroughs such as more affordable and accessible 3D scanning. Among several patented applications, is a system and method to capture the surface geometry of a three-dimensional object in a scene using unsynchronized structured lighting. In addition, over the past five years, several Brown engineering undergraduate and graduate students have gone on to work at Cognex. “It seems trite to describe the collaboration between Cognex and Brown as a win-win situation, but that’s truly the case,” Michael said. “This association is important for Cognex because it gives us insight into quality student researchers and approaches that are germane to our business of applying machine vision technology to robotics and automation. For Brown, it provides unrestricted gift funding to faculty - and through them to students – that can be used to further their research.” Dr. David Michael Cognex’s Director of Core Vision Tool Development Brown University Providence RI 02912 401-863-1000 Quick Navigation Visit Brown Campus Map Footer Navigation Reservations Accessibility Careers at Brown The campaign for building on distinction Give To Brown Social Navigation Facebook Flickr Instagram LinkedIn Twitter YouTube © Brown University School of Engineering Brown University For You Prospective Students Current Students Faculty & Staff Alumni Parents & Families Search Menu Mobile Site Navigation Mobile Site Navigation Undergraduate ABET Accreditation Admissions Concentrations Contacts and Resources Courses Internships, Jobs, and Grad School New Student Information Student Organizations Undergraduate Awards Undergraduate Research Graduate Admissions Courses Programs and Deadlines Programs Guide Graduate Student Organizations Student Awards Entrepreneurship People Faculty Staff Advisory Boards Graduate Students Research Centers and Institutes Core Facilities Hibbitt Fellows Hope Street Fellows Industry Engagement Laboratories NIST PREP Research Interests Undergraduate Research Get Involved Alumni and Friends - Ways to Connect Contact Us Employment Make a Gift Prospective Employers Social Media Visit Us Mobile Secondary Navigation Navigation About Events News For You Give Now This Site Only All of Brown.edu People Search Search people Advanced Search Search Close Search Industry Engagement Open details for Industry Engagement Bookmark this Page
