Until recently, SMU had its own print directory, Mustang Connections sponsored by SMU Student Media, that featured listings for students, faculty, staff members, and even department information. This directory served as SMU’s own reliable “yellow pages” – even though the pages were blue or gray – for some time, but eventually, technology innovations and environmental concerns caused SMU to move on. For internal staff, we are now introducing an online directory that contains an employee’s office contact information that is searchable within my.SMU! This new tool replaces the old “blue pages” section from the paper directory that featured individual faculty/staff listings. You can access the directory by clicking the Employee Directory tile on your Employee Self-Service page. From there, you can search for employees by name, campus location, department, number, etc. Results will include detailed contact information as well as ID photo, if available. Employee Profile Within my.SMU, you have two names types – legal and preferred. The legal name, displayed at the top left, is used for paychecks, W-2’s, and other legal documents while the preferred name is used for Skype and other systems supporting the preferred name and is displayed in the contact information section. If you don’t care for your ID photo, you can always opt-out of displaying your picture within Microsoft products like Skype for Business. To opt-out, click the Personal Information tile in your Employee Self-Service page, then click Photo Opt-Out, and follow the instructions. Please be aware, this is not a publicly available directory and is only accessible to SMU employees within my.SMU. Feel free to give the IT Help Desk a call if you have any questions. We hope you enjoy this convenient addition!
