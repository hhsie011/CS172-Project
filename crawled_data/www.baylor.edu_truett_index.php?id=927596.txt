This has provided rich learning and depth as I hear from professors and peers as well as opportunity to understand others better." Dr. Angela Gorrell Assistant Professor of Practical Theology "I aim to create healthy learning communities that welcome vulnerability. This requires vulnerability on the part of me and the students...As students learn to embrace vulnerability and share who they are and learn from one another, my hope is that students feel not just part of a course, but part of a community." Matthew Davis Alumnus "At Truett, you are able to ask questions in class. You are heard. You are seen. Your opinion matters. Seminary is not a place where you come in with all of the answers, and it's also not a place where you're expected to have all of the answers when you leave. This is the training ground."
