To be eligible for need-based scholarships at UOM, you must file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The government uses the FAFSA to calculate an Estimated Family Contribution (EFC). The UofM Financial Aid Office develops a Cost of Attendance (COA) for college-related expenses each aid year, which is a comprehensive estimate consisting of Direct Costs and Indirect Costs related to educational expenses. Direct Costs can include tuition/fees and a housing/meal plan if you are living on campus. Direct Costs are only those expenses billed by the UofM. Indirect Costs include books, travel and miscellaneous expenses. Indirect Costs are those college expenses not billed by the UofM. The financial aid office subtracts your EFC from your COA to determine your financial need. If you are determined to have financial need, you may be eligible for some need-based scholarships.
