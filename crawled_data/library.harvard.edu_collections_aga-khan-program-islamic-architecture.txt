HOLLIS Record The program funds acquisitions and cataloging, as well as research and reference services. It has helped build comprehensive collections that combine visual and printed documentation in all languages and formats on the art, architecture, archaeology, and epigraphy of the Islamic world. The Aga Khan Program has made possible the acquisition of research materials not commonly found in other collections in North America due to their expense or rarity. These include: a wide range of specialized periodicals and art monographs museum and exhibition catalogs sale catalogs of art dealers and auction houses documents of preservation and planning authorities and archaeological excavations facsimile editions of illuminated manuscripts. The Middle East & Islamic Photographs include more than 150,000 photographs and slides documenting Islamic art and architecture, as well as ethnographic views, plans, and maps. The collections are complemented by the Aga Khan Documentation Center at the MIT Libraries, which concentrates on architecture and urban development in contemporary Islamic cultures. “Courtiers in attendance by a stream” from a dispersed Shahnama HOLLIS Record Accessing These Materials Collection holdings are represented in HOLLIS and selections of visual materials have been digitized and are available in HOLLIS Images.
