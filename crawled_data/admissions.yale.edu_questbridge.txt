Review Yale’s current policy on standardized testing. Close QuestBridge Program for First-Year Applicants Yale is proud to partner with QuestBridge, a national non-profit program that links talented low-income students with educational and scholarship opportunities at some of the nation’s best colleges. Yale seeks students of every background, interest, outlook, and talent. But thousands of high-achieving students from low-income backgrounds never apply to top universities like Yale, even though they offer some of the most generous need-based financial aid. QuestBridge helps low-income students navigate the process of applying for admission and financial aid at Yale and 41 other partner institutions. Yale’s financial aid policies and admissions criteria are the same for all first-year applicants. If you are a student from a low-income background and are interested in applying to selective colleges that offer generous need-based financial aid, you should consider applying to the QuestBridge National College Match. Students selected as QuestBridge Finalists may share their application with Yale for free. Review Applying to Yale Through QuestBridge and our Frequently Asked Questions for more information. As a first generation, low-income student, I didn’t believe that any prestigious schools would be an option for me. But then I found out about QuestBridge during junior year of high school and knew I had to apply. When I matched with Yale through the QuestBridge National College Match, I was thrilled. Now I’m a student at one of the best colleges in the nation with a “full ride” financial aid award that doesn’t require my parents to pay anything and doesn’t require me to take out loans. I couldn’t be happier for this amazing opportunity. Every day I feel newfound excitement, because at Yale, I know that anything is possible. I have QuestBridge to thank for allowing me to discover my potential, and for turning my dreams into reality. -Kristen, Yale Class of 2018 Apply to the QuestBridge National College Match Learn how to Apply to Yale through QuestBridge QuestBridge Podcast Learn about Yale’s QuestBridge Partnership from Yale Admissions Officers and QuestBridge CEO Ana McCullough on “Inside the Yale Admissions Office.” $80,520 Scholarship for QuestBridge Matches 2021-2022 134 QuestBridge Matches and Quest Scholars in the Yale Class of 2025 $2 billion QuestBridge students have received over $2 billion in full financial aid offers from 45 partner institutions.
