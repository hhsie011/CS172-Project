If victims do not opt for forensic evidence collection, health care providers still can treat injuries and take steps to address concerns of pregnancy and/or sexually transmitted diseases. Obtaining a forensic exam does not require a person to file a police report, but it will help preserve evidence in case he or she decides at a later date to do so. Time is of the essence because certain types of evidence can dissipate or become unavailable. To preserve evidence prior to a sexual assault exam: Do not change clothes, bathe, shower or douche; do not eat, drink or use toothpaste or mouthwash; do not wash clothing, bed sheets, pillows or other potential evidence. Where to go for a forensic exam At Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, 8200 Walnut Hill Lane, a certified Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) will provide medical care and a sexual assault exam; call 214-345-6203 or visit https://www.texashealth.org/Community-Health/Texas-Health-Sexual-Assault-Nurse-Examiner. The Dallas Area Rape Crisis Center (DARCC) is a community resource that provides confidential counseling and can assist students at Texas Health; call 972-641-7273 (available 24/7) or visit https://www.darcc.org/. SMU Police officers, who are trained in sexual assault issues, are available to transport and accompany students to the hospital; call 214-768-3333. Officers will not be present during the exam. Students may bring a friend or family member for support. Please note that if asked to provide transport, SMU Police will file a police report; see “Report to Police” for more information.
