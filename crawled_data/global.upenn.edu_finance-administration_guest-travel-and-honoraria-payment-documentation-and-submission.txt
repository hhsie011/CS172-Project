This will guide you on the information that needs to be submitted at the time of the reimbursement request.

Before submitting to Business Office: Compile all documentation required for the reimbursement or honoraria. Check documents for proper signatures and matching receipts.

Email requesting reimbursement with banking information included Reimbursements to Businesses, Charities, or Affiliated Groups: When a guest of Penn Global requests their reimbursement or honoraria be paid to a business, charity, or group they are affiliated with, that payment goes in the supplier portal as a Non-PO payment request to the business, charity, or group.

Honoraria Honorariums are payments designed to confer distinction or symbolize respect for the recipient. They are given at our discretion only, and rules govern that this should not be a negotiated amount or corresponding to an amount the individual has requested (i.e.- no invoice should be received!). *The activity they are being paid for must last no more than 9 days. Honoraria, Non-Affiliate, US Citizen/resident alien: Signed W-9 Honoraria Memo (from Perry World House) Should include the reason for the payment, and date/location of the activity or event Taxability: Taxes will not be automatically withheld in this situation, although it is still reportable income to the recipient- who bears the burden of reporting and paying taxes each year. Honoraria, Non-Affiliate, Non-US Citizen: W-8BEN signed. Link to: W-8BEN Honoraria Memo (see above) Signed FINF form. Link to: FNIF Form Foreign Visitors Honoraria Eligibility Certification. Link to: Honoraria Eligibility Form Copy of Visa or Passport including entry stamp If payment is being sent to individual who resides outside the US, payment will be issued via wire (see attachment with required banking information). Taxability: Honorariums paid to foreign, non-affiliates default to having an automatic federal tax withholding (30% of the payment). In some cases, tax treaties may be available that will reduce the tax rate, or entirely exempt the payment from the automatic US federal tax withholding. This will be determined by meeting all of the following conditions: Individual must be resident of a country that has a current tax treaty with US. Link to: Current Tax Treaty List by Country. Individual must have a US provided SSN (social security number) or ITIN (Individual Taxpayer identification number). The payment may not be for an activity that lasts longer than 9 days. If they entered the country on a visa, we must confirm their visa will allow them to receive an Honorarium We will notify the tax office they are likely eligible for the tax treaty. The tax office will confirm and provide the IRS Form 8223. The individual will have to verify the information is accurate and then sign off on the form. Once returned, their payment will be processed with the tax treaty benefits applied. *If an individual does not claim the tax treaty, but is eligible, they may always claim the treaty exemption on a US income tax return directly with the IRS. 1 College Hall Suite 122 University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia, PA 19104 global@upenn.edu Penn WebLogin Â©2022 University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104 Footer Menu Office of the Provost Report Accessibility Issues and Get Help Privacy Policy
