I work alongside the two graduate assistants for Fraternity Sorority Housing to co-facilitate the development of the Fraternity & Sorority Housing Community's environment. In my work, this can be working with chapters to create academic environments outside of the classroom, to challenging the students we work with to hold their brothers and sisters accountable for any number of things that come along living in a community space. What do you like about working at Clemson Home? Because the folks at Clemson Home are my Ohana. They have truly shown me the meaning of, "Ohana means family, family means nobody gets left behind or forgotten." I moved 10 hours away from home and I would not know it with the support that I have been shown within Clemson Home. What's your background? My background is Misty Mood by Leonid Afremov, adapted to include the Tardis and the following quote from Doctor Who, âWe're All Stories in the End. Just make it a good ONE." The Doctor. However, I am sure the more in the box answer to this question would go something like: I am just a small town guy, who grew up in Pocahontas, Arkansas. Marching to my own beat, I studied at the University of Central Arkansas (Go Bears!) in instrumental music education; however, I seemed to have gotten off beat when I started working as a student in Residence Life. From there I followed my passion for working with students to the University of South Alabama (Go Jags!). Now, Moon Pies and Mardi Gras aside, to complete my M.Ed. in Educational Leadership as the Community Director for Fraternity & Sorority Housing at the University of South Alabama. From there I was able to find my Clemson Home as the Coordinator for Fraternity Sorority Housing, and continue following my passion for working with students. What are the values that drive you? I value support and relationships. While these seem to go hand in hand you can have both without the other, however, when they work in harmony they truly enhance the workplace. Working with people and interacting for more than a transactional reason. What do you enjoy doing when you are not working? When I am not working, I find my harmony in life by either fostering an appreciation for (torturing my partner) Disney+, or painstakingly ensuring we keep up with any TV/Movie universes we have set out to conquer. Additionally, I like to find myself on the other side of an empty plate, either going to or from somewhere new; or one of us makes something at home, as we both like to cook! Somewhere in there I also find time to work on getting my way through different literature. I cannot say whether I am shaken or stirred, but I am building my knowledge on these things. Nonetheless, I like to travel, and one of my favorite places to go is to see my godchild.
