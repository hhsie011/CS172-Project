Cybersecurity IT Policies News & Events Message from the CIO As we navigate through the rest of the academic year, our TTU IT bulletin highlights the acceptable use of TTU IT Resources policy. As a reminder, all software installed on TTU-owned systems must have legitimately acquired and approved software license(s). Current international climate create opportunities for Internet criminals to exploit, so please note that we are all responsible for staying alert and recognizing scam emails and phishing attempts. TTU systems must be kept updated with current versions of operating system applications, and endpoint protection (Microsoft Defender). Carrying on our spring tradition, the TTU IT Division plans to host an “IT Spring Cleaning Week” in the next few weeks. Now is a good time to begin planning to rid your office environment of unnecessary clutter and properly dispose of all electronic and paper documents that are no longer needed, especially those that contain confidential or sensitive information, while still complying with TTU OP 10.10, Records Retention. Watch for further details in our next bulletin. Go Tech! Sam Segran Vice President for IT and Chief Information Officer IT Bulletin | Vol. 18 No. 6 Read Online | Download PDF.
