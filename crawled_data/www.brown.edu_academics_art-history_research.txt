Faculty are allied by the fact that they are active and productive scholars engaged in work that crosses disciplinary boundaries and diverse areas of specialization. They are each committed to graduate and undergraduate teaching as part of their research. The nature of departmental research reflects changes in the discipline and in the Humanities at large, while areas of publication shift when new faculty join the department. But consistently, most faculty carry out projects that traverse the boundaries between traditional subjects of art historical inquiry and other forms of historical, visual and material culture and the built environment. Please see the Field Work, Digital Projects, and Faculty pages for more information on current research carried out in the department.
