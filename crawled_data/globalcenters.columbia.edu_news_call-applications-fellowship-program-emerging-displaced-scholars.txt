Mellon Foundation’s Program in Higher Education and Scholarship in the Humanities, Columbia Global Centers | Amman has established a fellowship program starting on January 1, 2019 that offers 12-month fellowships for emerging displaced scholars interested in the humanities to continue and further develop their scholarly pursuits. This opportunity can serve as a vital component in ensuring that emerging displaced scholars obtain relevant skills and embark on viable career paths in academia or other sectors serving the public good. The Amman Center will help foster the skills and abilities of scholars, facilitate their successful integration into the academic community, and create opportunities whereby they could also contribute to advancing the conditions of other refugees worldwide. The 12 month fellowship will provide support for exceptional emerging displaced scholars’ working in the humanities and humanistic social sciences. The program is intended to enable fellows to focus on issues that are of interest to their scholarship. A major consideration in the selection process is the expectation that each scholar’s period of residency at the Center will result in research of significance and originality. Through the various support mechanisms that will be made available to fellows by the Center, it is hoped that the fellows, upon completion of the program, will have a better opportunity to continue their academic pursuits and integrate into academia. To support the fellows the program will: Build academic capacity of incoming fellows through access to online courses at Columbia University and other platforms, and/or through training workshops held at the Center; Support the academic development of fellows by matching them with a relevant faculty member that would provide mentorship, advice and support; Strengthen global connectedness by linking emerging displaced scholars to academics, practitioners, and experts across the Columbia Global Centers’ network; Facilitate experiential learning opportunities for fellows, where they could assume a supporting role in program administration and implementation; Support fellows with convening roundtable discussions, planning conferences, and giving talks related to their subject areas; Enable emerging displaced scholars to embark on academic projects, including publication of their work, in a safe environment; and, Highlight the research work of emerging displaced scholars by disseminating their intellectual products and facilitating exchange through the Columbia Global Centers’ network and with relevant Columbia University schools and institutes. Eligibility requirements Eligible candidates are PhD students who have had their doctorate disrupted, post-doctoral fellows who were awarded a doctorate in the humanities or humanistic social sciences, or early career scholars who were employed at an accredited institution of higher learning and were forcibly uprooted from their home countries and respective academic institutions for reasons related to the emergence of security concerns and/or armed conflict.
