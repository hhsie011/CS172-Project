Fueled by 20 NCAA Division 1 men's and women's athletic teams, we possess an undeniable spirit. The stadium is home to the Syracuse Orange football, basketball and lacrosse teams. It has also played host to some of the most memorable concerts, championships, and events in the region. In fact, more than eighteen million people have passed through its doors since the building’s first event. View upcoming events Otto’s Army Excitement at the Stadium sometimes starts weeks before the game, with students lining up and sometimes building resilient “tent towns” in subzero temperatures for front row seats. Led by the passionate Otto’s Army, this group of student fanatics shows off a level of dedication that’s almost unmatched in college athletics. Every university arena has a student section, few have organizations meant to keep the section as fair, fun, and—of course—loud as possible.
