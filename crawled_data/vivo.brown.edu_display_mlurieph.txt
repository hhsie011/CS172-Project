PubMed Research Research Overview Mark Lurie, PhD, is an infectious disease epidemiologist working on HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted infections, silicosis and tuberculosis in sub-Saharan Africa. He has studied the role of migration in the spread of HIV in South Africa, examined the evidence for concurrency as a major driver of the HIV epidemic, and examined the impact of antiretroviral therapy on HIV epidemic dynamics in Sub-Saharan Africa. His current work focuses on training the next generation of socials scientists in South Africa able to impact the HIV epidemic, an NIH funded R24 and D43 that is a collaboration between Brown and the University of Cape Town; a sudy aimed at improving men's access to HIV testing and treatment services; a study examining treatment access for a unitization among mogrants and non-migrants in South Africa; and a study examining XDR-TB transmssions in KwaZulu/Natal, South Africa. Research Statement Dr. Lurie's main research focuses on the following topics: 1. What impact does expanding access to antiretrovial therapy for the treatment of HIV/AIDS have on epidemic dynamics and new infections in South Africa. First through a NIMH funded K01 and more recently through a R01, we aim to quantify the impact of antiretroviral therapy on HIV epidemic dynamics in sub-Saharan Africa. This project is a collaboration between Brown University, the Africa Centre for Health and Population Studies in KwaZulu/Natal, South Africa and Erasmus Medical College in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. We use primary data and mathematical models to estimate the impact of interventions on reducing new infections an the eventual elimination of HIV/AIDS. 2. Can we improve rates of partner notification and reduce the number of new sexually transmitted infections among STI patients in Cape Town. In collaboration with Seth Kalichman at the University of Connecticut and Cathy Mathews at the University of Cape Town and the South African Medical Research Council, we are conducting a 3-arm randomised controlled trial on a brief, single-session, one-on-one intervention aimed at assisting STI patients notify their partners that they may have been exposed to an STI. 3. iALARM: an NIH-funded R01 that examines ways to use health information systems to improve men's access and adherence to HIV testing and treatment services in Gugulethu Township, South Africa. 4. SASH: An NIH-funded R24 in collaboration with the University of Cape Town, aimed at training the next generation of South African social scientists in order to more effetively address the HIV epidemic. 5. Brown University / Moi University Partnership for biostatistics training in HIV. A NIH D43 Fogarty project aimed at improving biostatistics and epidemiology training at Moi University in Eldoret, Kenya. In addition to the above collaborations, Dr. Lurie also works closely with colleagues at the Agincourt Demographic Surveillance System in Limpopo Province, South Africa (examining issues of migration and health); the Perinatal HIV Research Unit at Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto, South Africa (focusing on behavioral issues among a clinical cohort of HIV-infected urban and rural patients); The South African Medical Research Council's Health Systems Research Unit in Cape Town (examining the feasibility of a HIV prevention among a group of HIV-positive patients).

NICHD: R01HD083374 (White) 07/15/2016 – 06/30/2022 Migration, Urbanization and health in a Transition Setting. The proposed study will examine the contemporary health transition in South Africa, helping to resolve confusion in the migration-urbanization-health nexus, with direct policy implications for South Africa and lessons for a broad array of scientific and policy concerns in Low and Middle Income Countries. Our aims are designed to better understand, at the individual level, how a complex pattern of migration and urbanization helps drive the health transition in these settings. Our study devotes particular attention to how migration and urbanization help determine both risk factors for health conditions and care access to treatment. Lura Cook Hull Trust 12/18/20-12/18/21 Tuberculosis Prevention in South Africa: Understanding the role of population movement This is a pilot study to test the feasibility of using GPS-devices to track participants in a TB trail and accurately record their mobility. Connecting these real-time mobility data to the existing social network and genomic data will enable a new understanding of how and where XDR-TB transmission occurs.
