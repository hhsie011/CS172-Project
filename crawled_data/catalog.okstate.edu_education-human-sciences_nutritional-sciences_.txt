Sciences, MS Comparative Biomedical Sciences, PhD Veterinary Medicine, DVM Home/ College of Education and Human Sciences/ Nutritional Sciences Nutritional Sciences Overview Courses Undergraduate Programs Graduate Programs Minors Faculty The Department of Nutritional Sciences advances health and quality of life of individuals and communities and prepares professionals through discovery, education and application of scientific knowledge. Graduates are prepared to apply nutrition knowledge in dietetic internships, healthcare professional schools, graduate programs and food and nutrition-related professions. Four degree options and a minor are offered through the department. The human nutrition/premedical sciences option is ideal for students desiring greater depth in the physiological and biochemical sciences in preparation for medical and other professional schools, graduate study and research in human nutrition. It includes the prerequisites for admission to most medical, dental, optometry and pharmacy schools. The allied health option provides required coursework for most nursing schools, physician assistant programs, schools of physical and occupational therapy, dental hygiene and other health professions. The public health nutrition option offers coursework for positions in nutrition education, wellness, school food service management and other areas as well as the prerequisites for the MS in Athletic Training. The dietetics option provides the coursework required to become a Registered Dietitian (see OSU Didactic Program in Dietetics below). The mission of the OSU Didactic Program in Dietetics is to promote human health and quality of life by preparing students for supervised practice leading to eligibility for the CDR credentialing exam to become a RDN. The dietetics profession is diverse and dynamic, integrating human nutrition, food service administration, food science, chemistry, physiology, management and interpersonal skills. The dietetics option is the only option that includes the Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) coursework required to apply for competitive dietetic internships (DI). When students successfully complete the academic requirements (DPD) and supervised practice component (DI), they are eligible for the national Registration Examination for Dietitians administered by the Commission on Dietetic Registration (CDR) of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (the Academy). Individuals who successfully complete the examination become Registered Dietitians/Nutritionists and are entitled to use the initials “RD” or “RDN” to signify professional competence. Many states, including Oklahoma, also require a license to practice dietetics in the state. Each state law varies in its scope. Didactic Program in Dietetics information and the DPD Student Handbook are found at https://education.okstate.edu/departments-programs/nutritional-sciences/didactic-program-dietetics/index.html. The Didactic Program in Dietetics is currently granted continuing accreditation by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, 120 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 2190, Chicago, Illinois 60606-6995, 312.899.0040 ext. 5400. Nutrition professionals work in a wide range of settings, in both the public and private sectors and assume an array of challenging responsibilities. Career opportunities for a registered/licensed dietitian include: health care dietitian and administrator, nutrition researcher, fitness/wellness consultant, public health nutritionist, school nutrition director, Cooperative Extension educator, entrepreneur in dietetic programs and services, and corporate dietitian/nutritionist. DPD Graduates who do not enter dietetic internships may work in related fields which do not require the RD credential such as school food service, Cooperative Extension, pharmaceutical or food sales, food service management and government programs; take the certified dietary manager (CDM) exam; or enter related graduate programs such as Master of Science in Public Health. Upon earning the DPD “verification statement,” students may take the CDR exam to become dietetic technicians, registered (DTR). University teaching and research in the field of nutrition and some specialized careers require advanced degrees or additional course work. Admission Requirements Transfer students must have earned a 2.5 retention GPA in order to be admitted to the NSCI undergraduate program. Further information may be found at https://education.okstate.edu/departments-programs/nutritional-sciences/index.html. Dietetic Internship The dietetic internship (DI) at Oklahoma State University requires a bachelor’s degree and prior completion of the DPD requirements for admission and meets the Academy’s 1200-hour supervised practice requirement for registration eligibility. Its mission is to advance health and quality of life of individuals and communities by preparing dietetic professionals for competent practice through education, discovery and application of scientific knowledge. The internship provides experience in clinical, management, and community practice settings where interns develop entry-level practice competence. Entry into the dietetic internship is competitive, requiring an application to the OSU DI and NSCI Master’s of Sciences degree and participation in the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics computer matching or pre-selection process. All students admitted to the Dietetic Internship must earn the departmental Master of Science in Nutritional Sciences (Dietetics Research option) or enter with at least an MS which is essentially equivalent to the NSCI MS (Dietetics Research option). The Dietetic Internship at OSU is currently granted continuing accreditation by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, 120 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 2190, Chicago, Illinois 60606-6995, 312.899.0040 ext. 5400.

Graduate study in NSCI emphasizes the conduct and application of research to the field of human nutrition. Graduate students work with an advisor and advisory committee to develop flexible, yet rigorous programs of study and research that meet the degree requirements and each student's professional goals within an area of specialization in the field. The Graduate Certificate in Dietetics The Graduate Certificate in Dietetics builds competencies in the area of Dietetics and provides a path for eligibility to sit for the Registered Dietitian Nutritionist credential examination. The Graduate Certificate in Dietetics is designed for students who are concurrently enrolled in a Master of Public Health (MPH) or related graduate program. Applicants must have completed an Accreditation Council for Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) accredited Didactic Program in Dietetics and have a verification statement. The Plan of Study (POS) includes 18 credit hours, including the dietetic internship practicum courses. The practicum courses fulfill the supervised practice requirements of ACEND. The Master of Science Degree The MS degree program is designed to develop research skills, stimulate independent thought and critical thinking, and provide up-to-date knowledge in a variety of areas of human nutrition. Admission to the MS graduate program is selective and is based on a variety of factors including the student's grade-point average (overall and science GPA), letters of recommendation and goal statement; Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores are optional. The prerequisite for the MS program is a BS in nutritional sciences. Students with a BS degree in a subject area other than nutrition are required to have a minimum of 30 credit hours of undergraduate/graduate coursework related to nutritional sciences, including at least one course in biochemistry, one course in physiology and one upper-level nutrition course prior to full admission. Applicants who do not meet these requirements may be considered for conditional acceptance and required to take prerequisite courses and/or demonstrate academic ability. Students in the MS NSCI program may select from two options: Dietetics Research or Nutrition. Both options include a thesis and non-thesis plan. The Dietetics Research option is designed for students who aim to earn a M.S. degree and complete the accredited Dietetic Internship program. It requires a minimum of 36 credit hours. Students applying for this option must have completed an ACEND accredited Didactic Program in Dietetics and have a verification statement. The Nutrition option is designed for students who aim to enhance their career with a graduate degree or to prepare for a doctoral program. The thesis plan requires a minimum of 30-credit hours; the non-thesis plan requires a minimum of 34 credit hours. In both options, thesis research is conducted within the advisor’s area of interest and is approved by an advisory committee. The non-thesis MS degree plan requires three credit hours of NSCI 5843 Non-thesis Graduate Capstone including a written research paper and an oral presentation. The student's plan of study and research is determined in consultation with his/her advisor and advisory committee. An online Master of Science degree in Nutritional Sciences with an option in Dietetics is also offered to Registered Dietitians (RD) or individuals who are RD eligible. OSU offers this degree program as a member of the Great Plains Interactive Distance Education Alliance (Great Plains IDEA) which provides the opportunity for Registered Dietitians to study with faculty from eight universities in the Alliance via Internet-based courses. The MS in Dietetics requires completion of 36 credit hours, including nine core credits, six OSU Nutritional Sciences Core credits, 18 elective credits and NSCI 5843 Non-thesis Graduate Capstone. A faculty advisor and the graduate committee from the Nutritional Sciences department must approve a student’s program of study. More detailed information can be found at: gpidea.okstate.edu. The Doctor of Philosophy Degree The PhD degree is awarded in Nutritional Sciences. Two programs are available: a 60-hour program for MS graduates and an 80-hour program for BS graduates. The focus of the program is to prepare individuals for careers in a variety of areas including higher education, industry, healthcare and governmental programs. Admission to the program is competitive and applicants are expected to provide evidence of exceptional academic ability and preparation, a statement of goals and letters of recommendation. Grade-point average in previous undergraduate, professional school and graduate coursework are considered in the evaluation of the applicant; Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores are optional. If a thesis was not required as a component of the applicant's MS program, the student's advisory committee reserves the right to determine if a thesis or thesis-equivalent project must be completed. Students accepted into the 60-credit hour PhD option must have completed 30 hours of graduate coursework in nutrition or an area of specialization such as biochemistry, biology, dietetics, public health, exercise science, food science, hospitality/restaurant management, or other major field related to the desired area of study. A master’s degree is highly preferred but not required. If a thesis was not completed as a part of the graduate coursework, the student’s advisory committee reserves the right to determine if a thesis or thesis-equivalent project must be completed. Students with a degree or graduate coursework in a subject area other than nutrition may be considered for provisionary admission with courses completed in the first year of admission to assure a basic nutrition foundation and earning a 3.0 or higher GPA. The graduate faculty committee will determine which courses must be completed within the first year of admission; the courses will be indicated in the applicant’s admission letter. Students accepted into the 80-credit hour PhD option must hold a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in nutrition or an area of specialization such as biochemistry, biology, dietetics, public health, exercise science, food science, hospitality/restaurant management, or other major field related to the desired area of study. Students with a degree in a subject area other than nutrition may be considered for provisionary admission with completion of courses in the first year of admission to assure a basic nutrition foundation and the student earns a 3.0 or higher GPA. The graduate faculty committee will determine which courses must be completed within the first year of admission and will be indicated in the applicant’s admission letter. The PhD program includes a strong emphasis on research in areas ranging from basic molecular and cellular sciences to clinical and community applications. Students also gain experience in resource generation, knowledge sharing and community engagement. Each program of study is designed by the student under direction of his/her faculty advisor and advisory committee to develop the student’s competence in an area of specialization and research methodologies. Doctoral training includes 15-30 hours of dissertation research, a qualifying examination covering core nutrition knowledge, a comprehensive examination focused on the area of specialization and participation in research throughout the program.
