Transition Act Faculty Archived BulletinsToggle Archived Bulletins Print Options Enrollment and Courseload Undergraduate The School of General Studies permits students to study at their own pace, whether it be on a full- or part-time basis. Full-time status is defined as taking a minimum of 12 points per term in the fall and spring. Students may not register for more than 18 points in a given semester. Requests to exceed the 18-point cap must be submitted to the Committee on Academic Standing, and exceptions will be granted only in rare and unavoidable circumstances. International students on an F-1 student visa are required to attend full time. Summer Enrollment Participation in the summer term is optional. Students who choose not to enroll in summer are still considered current students and do not need to request a leave of absence. Students can enroll in up to 15 points total during the summer, including no more than 9 points in a six- or seven-week session. Requests to exceed the 15-point cap, or the 9-point cap per session, must be submitted to the Committee on Academic Standing. Exceptions will be granted only in rare and unavoidable circumstances. Summer courses are administered by the Columbia University School of Professional Studies. Students should consult with their academic advisors for course selection. Postbac Premed While there is no academic or program requirement for full-time enrollment, some students may need to maintain full-time status because of visa requirements, or to remain eligible for University Housing. Full-time Enrollment Option One Full-time status in the Postbaccalaureate Premedical Program is defined as registration for 12 or more points per term. This enrollment status is required for all international students. Certification Certification for this option is provided by the University Registrar. Option Two A postbac student who is registered for fewer than 12 points may be regarded as equivalent to full-time if enrolled in at least 9 points and participating in unpaid, volunteer work in a health care setting for at least three hours per week and 42 hours per semester. If the position is paid or a stipend is awarded, students will not qualify for full-time status. This option is not available to international students. Certification Certification is provided by the Postbaccalaureate Premedical Office. In order to receive a certification letter from the Postbac Premed Office, students must provide a letter to their Postbac Premed advisor from their volunteer supervisor stating that they are working in a volunteer and unpaid capacity for a minimum of three hours per week, with a minimum commitment of 42 hours during the 14-week semester. This letter must be on letterhead, dated, and signed by the volunteer supervisor. Students should allow one week between the submission of the letter from their volunteer supervisor and the availability of a letter of certification from the Postbac Premed Office. International Student Enrollment: Application/Glide Year During the application year, international students with F-1 (or J-1) non-immigrant status who wish to remain in the United States must either be enrolled in a program of full-time study or be on optional practical training (OPT) if F-1 status or academic training (AT) if J-1 status, authorized by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). In planning the application year, it is advisable for students with F-1 or J-1 status to consult with the International Students and Scholars Office (ISSO), as well as with their premedical advisors, early in their final semester of study to ensure compliance with U.S. immigration laws. Summer Enrollment Preparatory Courses Some Postbac Premed students may need to begin their studies in the summer to prepare for fall courses in mathematics, chemistry, and/or physics. Some preparatory coursework is also offered throughout the academic year. With few exceptions, the only summer session courses admitted students will be allowed to take are Preparation for College Chemistry, Basic Physics, English, Psychology, or a mathematics course. Please see the grading policy for Preparation for College Chemistry, Basic Physics, Basic Math, and College Algebra & Analytic Geometry. Required Courses Premedical students are generally advised against taking the required science courses in the summer in the six-week course format (with the exceptions of preparatory courses, math courses, and lab courses). The reason for this recommendation is that the compressed summer term schedule is extremely demanding for even the most well-prepared students. For most premedical students, science courses offered in the twelve-week format (Physics II, General Chemistry II) are more appropriate. Premedical students should make sure they have the approval of their premed advisors prior to enrolling in summer term science courses. Registration for Summer Courses Summer courses are administered by the Columbia University School of Professional Studies. For courses offered during the summer semester that fulfill requirements of the Postbac Premed Program, please visit the Premed section of the SPS website.
