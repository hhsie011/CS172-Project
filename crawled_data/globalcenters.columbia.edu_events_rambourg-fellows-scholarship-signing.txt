The Foundation’s work is aligned with the spirit of article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which states that: everyone has the right to education, education should aim at the full development of the human personality and the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Established in 2011, the Rambourg Foundation promotes education, art, and culture in Tunisia. Mrs. Rambourg firmly believes that the battle against violence and extremism can only be won by winning hearts and minds, by giving hope, and helping young people achieve their full potential through education, art, and culture. The Rambourg Foundation focuses on the protection and enhancement of human rights as well as the promotion of education, art, and culture in Tunisia— the most effective tools that will enable Tunisia to defeat extremism and build a better future for the country. “…only enlightened and educated people, the spirit of creation, innovation, will lead Tunisia to more prosperity and development.” The Foundation supports art and cultural exhibitions in Tunisia and the Rambourg Prize for Art and Culture, a cash prize for Tunisian visual artists, writers, performers, and creators. The Foundation supports scholarships for students to attend universities, previous awardees have attended the Yehudi Menuhin School and Imperial College in London. The Foundation has supported local elementary schools providing resources and helping rehabilitate physical spaces.
