Our very own Prof. Helfand had given us well-attended talks on how to survive the misinformation age by cultivating scientific habits of mind, and on evidence-based climate change. We are fortunate to have Prof. Helfand coming back, this time to give us a talk on how both stable and radioactive isotopes allow atoms to act as microscopic historians. Learn how atoms and their nuclei, through a wide variety of physical and chemical techniques, can be used to reconstruct quantitatively the past, from twentieth-century art forgeries to the beginning of time itself.
