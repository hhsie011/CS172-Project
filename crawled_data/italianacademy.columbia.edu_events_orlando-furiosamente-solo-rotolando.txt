Ludovico Ariosto’s epic poem Orlando furioso is celebrated in this original event that also incorporates the earlier work, Orlando innamorato by Matteo Maria Boiardo. Emperor Charlemagne’s troops battling the Saracens and Orlando’s unrequited love for Angelica are brought to life by Enrico Messina in this performance (in Italian, with staging assistant Micaela Sapienza), which is drawn from the text Hruodlandus: libera rotolata medioevale by E. Messina and A. Nicolino. Passages from Orlando Innamorato will be performed in English by Victoria Giler, Katrina Goldowsky-Dill, and Stephen Chacon, all students in the course “Acting Medieval Literature,” taught by NYU Prof. Evelyn Birge (Timmie) Vitz.
