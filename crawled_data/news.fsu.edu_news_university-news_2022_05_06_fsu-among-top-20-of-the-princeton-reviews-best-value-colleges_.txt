FSU ranks No. 18 for “Best Value” among public schools in the education-services company’s Best Value Colleges for 2022. The rankings also include FSU in the Top 20 among public schools in five additional categories: 3 in Best Schools for Financial Aid 10 in Best Schools for Internships 15 in Best Alumni Networks 18 in Best Schools for Making an Impact 20 in Best Value for Students with No Demonstrated Need for Financial Aid The Princeton Review ranked institutions based on surveys of administrators at more than 650 colleges in 2021-2022. Schools that made the rankings share “three exceptional features,” according to The Princeton Review – stellar academics, affordable cost and strong career prospects for graduates. Jim Clark, provost and executive vice president for Academic Affairs, hailed the rankings as further evidence of the university’s growing reputation as a top-tier public institution that offers an accessible education and prepares students for successful careers. “We’re excited to see yet another report that spotlights our success in providing a quality education that’s accessible and affordable,” Clark said. “We remain proud to be counted among the top schools in the nation, whether it’s for the impacts of our research and academics, the engagement of our alumni and business partners, or the value of our education and degrees.” “We’re excited to see yet another report that spotlights our success in providing a quality education that’s accessible and affordable. We remain proud to be counted among the top schools in the nation, whether it’s for the impacts of our research and academics, the engagement of our alumni and business partners, or the value of our education and degrees.” — Provost Jim Clark Last September, FSU placed as the No. 5 Best Value College among public colleges and universities, according to U.S. News & World Report’s “Best Colleges 2022” guidebook. For academics, the same publication last fall ranked FSU No. 19 among national public universities – marking its third straight year in the Top 20. In its rankings, The Princeton Review considered more than 40 data points that covered academics, costs, debt, financial aid, graduation rates and career information. The company said it factored in data from its surveys of students and from PayScale.com surveys of alumni about starting and mid-career salaries and job satisfaction. Clark emphasized FSU’s efforts to help students launch careers through internships and alumni networks and to provide opportunities for students to get involved in causes important to them. Three years ago, FSU became the largest university in the nation to require experiential learning for undergraduates. The university offers career fairs and workshops and networking events throughout the year, and its Career Center – recognized as one of the best in the country – provides students with free individual career advising and counseling. FSU also boasts more than 750 registered student organizations that inspire students to become active on campus and in their communities. Also, the university’s Center for Leadership & Social Change offers training on topics such as service learning, leadership development and community change. The Princeton Review trumpeted FSU and the other schools on its list as a “select group” that makes up about 7% of the nation’s four-year undergraduate institutions. “We commend their administrators, faculties, staff, and alumni for all they are doing to educate their students and guide them to success in their careers,” said Rob Franek, editor-in-chief of The Princeton Review. “These colleges are also exceptional for the generous amount of financial aid they award to students with need and/or for their comparatively low cost of attendance.” Clark said the latest rankings reflect the university’s vision to transform the lives of its students and to help shape society through exceptional teaching, research, creative activity and service. “We continue to strive to provide, at a reasonable price, a quality education that includes transformative, career-building experiences for our students,” Clark said. “We also hold true to our core values: We inspire a strong sense of belonging for our students in a welcoming place where they connect with and learn from people of different backgrounds and experiences. “The Princeton Review’s rankings support our standing as a Top 20 public university that puts students first. At FSU, our students inspire us to work hard each day to achieve even greater milestones moving forward.” Posted in: University News | Tagged: Best Value, Provost Jim Clark Post navigation Previous Article Previous Article: FSU awards honors medallions to spring 2022 graduates Next Article Next Article: Three Florida State University students earn Critical Language Scholarships Sidebar Related Stories Nine FSU students earn Fulbright Scholarships FAMU-FSU College of Engineering names esteemed scholar, innovator as new dean FSU statistician named fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics FSU to offer new bachelor’s degree in human rights FSU faculty expert discusses Florida’s fragile homeowners-insurance market Recommended Stories FSU Expert Pitch: FAMU-FSU College of Engineering center pushes preparation for storm season Nine FSU students earn Fulbright Scholarships Triumph Gulf Coast board approves $7.6M grant for FSU PC’s Collegiate Laboratory High School Florida Center for Reading Research partners with Maya’s Book Nook to strengthen reading development in Leon County FSU dance professor continues to be recognized as trailblazer in performing arts Search Florida State News Search for: Categories: Any Category Announcements COVID-19 Announcements Multimedia FSU Headlines Photo Galleries Radio Stories Video Stories News Arts & Humanities Business, Law & Policy Education & Society Expert Pitches Faculty/Staff Briefs Health & Medicine Science & Technology Students & Campus Life University News Student Stars The Big Story Uncategorized News Archives News Archives Select Month May 2022 April 2022 March 2022 February 2022 January 2022 December 2021 November 2021 October 2021 September 2021 August 2021 July 2021 June 2021 May 2021 April 2021 March 2021 February 2021 January 2021 December 2020 November 2020 October 2020 September 2020 August 2020 July 2020 June 2020 May 2020 April 2020 March 2020 February 2020 January 2020 December 2019 November 2019 October 2019 September 2019 August 2019 July 2019 June 2019 May 2019 April 2019 March 2019 February 2019 January 2019 December 2018 November 2018 October 2018 September 2018 August 2018 July 2018 June 2018 May 2018 April 2018 March 2018 February 2018 January 2018 December 2017 November 2017 October 2017 September 2017 August 2017 July 2017 June 2017 May 2017 April 2017 March 2017 February 2017 January 2017 December 2016 November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 July 2010 June 2010 May 2010 April 2010 March 2010 February 2010 January 2010 December 2009 November 2009 October 2009 September 2009 August 2009 July 2009 June 2009 May 2009 April 2009 March 2009 February 2009 January 2009 December 2008 November 2008 October 2008 September 2008 August 2008 July 2008 June 2008 May 2008 April 2008 March 2008 February 2008 January 2008 December 2007 November 2007 October 2007 September 2007 August 2007 July 2007 June 2007 May 2007 April 2007 March 2007 February 2007 January 2007 December 2006 November 2006 October 2006 September 2006 August 2006 July 2006 June 2006 May 2006 April 2006 March 2006 February 2006 January 2006 December 2005 November 2005 October 2005 September 2005 August 2005 July 2005 June 2005 May 2005 April 2005 March 2005 February 2005 January 2005 News Topics Arts & Humanities Business, Law & Policy Education & Society Health & Medicine Science & Technology Students & Campus Life University News All News Faculty/Staff Briefs Expert Pitches Multimedia Video Stories Radio Stories Photo Galleries FSU Headlines All Multimedia About FSU The Big Story Student Stars Publications Highlights/Rankings Seminole Tribe For Journalists News Contacts Media Resources Experts Expert Categories Title IX © Florida State University Tallahassee, FL 32306 FSU Directory Assistance Questions or Comments Privacy Policy Copyright Like Florida State on Facebook Follow Florida State on Instagram Follow Florida State on Twitter" Follow Florida State on Youtube Connect with Florida State on LinkedIn More FSU Social Media
