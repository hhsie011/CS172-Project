How I've Changed My peers at HDS challenged me to be a better person and to live more fully. In delicate moments, I've learned to love carrying my and others' complexities. Within community, I've learned how we can ask more of each other out of love for each other, and grapple with the limits of the institution that brought us together. Finally, I've come away with a much deeper appreciation for my religious and intellectual heritages. Message of Thanks I thank all my teachers who nurtured me over the last years. I especially thank Professor Mayra Rivera, my advisor and teacher, who taught me (by example) that the most critical thinking requires care, patience, and deep moral sensibility. I thank Dr. Gloria White-Hammond for teaching me how to provide care with attention to the whole richness and depth of life, and my chaplain mentors, Bruce Aguilar and Amanda Harmeling, who exemplified this many times in our spiritual care work. I also thank my teachers of social medicine who helped me radically reconceptualize illness and health. I thank the Muslim community at HDS for the collective presence, chai, and karahi. Finally, I thank the friends who pushed me to think and be more deeply and authentically, with whom I shared countless moments of laughter, snow, sunshine, and music. I love you all and look forward to a life of further being, thinking, and laughing together.
