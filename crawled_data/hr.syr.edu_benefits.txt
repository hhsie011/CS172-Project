Qualified employees are eligible for the majority of the benefit plans immediately upon hire. Review the 2022 Benefits Guide for New Hires [PDF] for an overview of the standard benefits package. Eligibility Link Most plans allow the employee to cover a legal spouse or an eligible domestic partner, children under age 26, and disabled dependents that meet the criteria listed in the benefits eligibility policy. Please consult the full benefits eligibility policy and the specific plan document or contact HR Shared Services with any questions about eligibility rules for yourself or your dependents. Enrolling in Benefits Link Eligible employees may enroll or change benefit elections through MySlice within 31 days of hire, or during the annual Open Enrollment period held each fall, typically in early November. Outside of the Open Enrollment period, no changes may be made without a qualifying family status change.
