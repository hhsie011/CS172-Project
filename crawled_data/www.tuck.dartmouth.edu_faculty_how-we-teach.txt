But they have another side: they uniformly strive to be great classroom teachers. All our full-time faculty teach in the MBA program, so students have direct access to broad perspectives that encompass a world of experience. The classroom experience at Tuck is invigorating and truly life-changing. Tuck professors know your background, anticipate your questions, and challenge your assumptions. Thanks to our scale, students benefit from superior faculty-to-student ratios, small-size elective courses, and unparalleled person-to-person access to professors. Beyond the classroom—at school events, over lunch, and even in their homes—our faculty make themselves available to you. More than facts and skills, our classes offer strategic perspective. They explore how the minds of management experts work and demonstrate how to put theory into practice.
