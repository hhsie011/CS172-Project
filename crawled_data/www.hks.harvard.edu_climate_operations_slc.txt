In its broadest sense, that agenda seeks to ensure that HKS operations support international goals of sustainable development: promoting equitable improvements in the wellbeing of people today, while exercising stewardship of the Earth’s life-support systems on which the wellbeing of future generations depends. Each year, the SLC identifies two priorities to develop programming and pilot projects around to pursue our campus sustainability goals. The SLC works in coordination with Harvard University and the Office for Sustainability. Appointments to the SLC are made by Dean Elmendorf. The role of the SLC: Explore living laboratory connections that could integrate the real-world challenges of sustainability into the Kennedy School experience and use the campus and the local community to pilot innovative research and projects. Share knowledge, experience, and feedback on strategies and projects and how they may interact and influence many aspects of campus operations and life. Regularly review the HKS Sustainability Plan (HKS intranet login required) and recommend strategic updates. Monitor and guide the implementation of the HKS Sustainability Plan and supporting alignment between the Sustainability Plan and University Sustainability Goals. Recommend specific projects and budget requests to the Dean. Facilitate coordination of sustainability groups, activities, and events at HKS, including the Green Team and the Climate, Energy, and Environment Professional Interest Council (CEEPIC), thereby fostering strong awareness and engagement.
