Hanlon '77 set to lead a delegation to Connecticut next week to return the papers of Samson Occom to his Mohegan homeland, more attention is being paid to a leading figure in the founding of Dartmouth. Born in 1723, Occom was a scholar who spoke several languages and an ordained Presbyterian minister who traveled to Great Britain in 1766 to help raise money for a school for Native American youth envisioned by the Rev. Eleazar Wheelock. Though Occom was fantastically successful—he raised more than £12,000, including support through the Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian Knowledge—Wheelock veered from the original mission, and Occom never set foot at the school that became Dartmouth. Still, as Colin Calloway, the John Kimball Jr. 1943 Professor of History and a professor of Native American and Indigenous Studies, describes, Occom was an essential figure in the establishment of the school and could even be considered Dartmouth's "first development officer." "It wouldn't have happened without Samson Occom," he says. View the conversation here.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Native American and Indigenous Studies Undergraduate Overview Major and Minor Courses Honors Program Waitlists and Applications NAS 85 Independent Study Rules & Procedures NAS Students Writing Prize Award Recipients Alumni - Tell Us Your Story 2020 2021 Funding for Internships and Independent Research Off-Campus Program Research Overview Gordon Russell Visiting Professorship Gordon Russell Visiting Professorship Alumni Charles Eastman Fellowship Eastman Fellowship Alumni Tribal Scholar Fellowship Program Tribal Scholar Fellowship Alumni Resources News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
