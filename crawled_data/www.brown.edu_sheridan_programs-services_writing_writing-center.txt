Appointments will be offered again beginning June 27. Follow the Writing Center on Instagram at @Brown_Writing_Center! Brown's Writing Center provides individual and group writing support free of charge to any member of the Brown community. Writing Center associates assist students with all stages of the writing process, from finding a topic through drafting, revising, and final editing. The Center is staffed by graduate students from a variety of academic disciplines. Staff members are experienced writers and teachers who participate in ongoing training in composition theory and practice. Associates can help writers deal with writer's block, audience awareness, argumentation, organization, grammar, research skills, the conventions of academic writing, English as a Second Language, and issues of clarity and style. To earn the baccalaureate degree, all Brown students must demonstrate an ability to write well. Looking to make a Writing Center appointment? Click here.
