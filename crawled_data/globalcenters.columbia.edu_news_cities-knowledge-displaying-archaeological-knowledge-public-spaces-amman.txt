March 12, 2016 This travel seminar explored the urban development of the city of Amman through its two major archaeological sites – the ancient buildings of the Roman city of Philadelphia, with its amphitheater, Odeon theater and the Nymphaeum, and the Qala'a (Citadel) – the Umayyad Palace. Accompanied by Avinoam Shalem, Riggio Professor of the History of the Arts of Islam, and Holger Klein, Professor of Art History and Archeology, ten students traveled to Amman on March 12-18 to study these sites as related to the modern city of Amman. Modern methods of urban planning all related to the idea of reconstructing past narratives for Amman were critically discussed, while focusing mainly on archaeology, urban architectural developments, specific cultural centers and even museum display. Students' presentations were held both in situ, in front of the monuments of Amman, as well as in class. Like the cities of Rome and Jerusalem, the city of Amman is unique in its urban concept of exhibiting its archaeological past in the very center of the town. It is true that many cities all over the world are proud to call attention to their ancient and even near past histories by exposing ruins and remains of 'previous' architectural achievements. These monuments are displayed as if in a museum – an open one, which has no clear borders. And yet, the decision to designate a large space at the very center of a metropolis for presenting archaeology and to expose the underground history of urban spaces to the everyday inhabitants and visitors of a city is a revolutionary plan. The display of the Forum Romanum in Rome and the Cardo in Jerusalem as sites of learning of historical knowledge is modern and is strongly embedded in the histories of nationalism and of constructing identities. On March 16, a dinner for Professors Holger Klein and Avinoam Shalem, and their students, was hosted by Ramzi (A: EN ‘81) and Reem Muna.
