Admission requirements Inside the Program Students take part in citywide initiative to beautify downtown's Douglas Design District Sometimes being an art student isn't just about what you get to do on campus. There are a multitude of opportunities to spread your creativity throughout the Wichita area. Students in the "Introduction to Community & Social Practices" class took part in the citywide 2020 Vision initiative to create a street mural in the Douglas Design District. Utilizing industrial paint sprayers and large 10x12 foot stencils, the students painted sections of the street in a modern, yet classical design to symbolize a unified community district and celebrate the diversity of the many small businesses and people that call the area home. Curriculum The applied drawing concentration offers intensive studio work to develop a wide range of technical and conceptual skills, including traditional, mixed and digital media.
