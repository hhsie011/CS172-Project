Before coming to UAB in 2019, he was a research track professor in the Department of Neuroscience at Brown University. Research Dr. Cruikshank studies synaptic and sensory processing in neural circuits of the neocortex and thalamus. Clarifying how these structures bidirectionally control one another will be an important part of understanding mammalian information processing. His work involves neurophysiology in intact animals and in vitro, pharmacology, anatomy, behavior and optogenetics. He often combines whole-cell recordings from genetically-identified neurons with optical control. An overarching goal is to identify basic principles of cortical-thalamic processing, including interactions with brain state.
