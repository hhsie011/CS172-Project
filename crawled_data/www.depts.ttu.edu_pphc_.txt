From recruitment to commencement and beyond, PPHC is your healthcare career partner every step of the way. We are your primary academic advising home if you've chosen one of our ten pre-professional health designations (pre-clinical laboratory sciences, pre-dental, pre-medicine, pre-nursing, pre-occupational therapy, pre-optometry, pre-pharmacy, pre-physical therapy, pre-physician assistant, or pre-speech, language and hearing sciences). You can remain in that designation for your first 45 earned hours. Then we help you move into the degree-granting major that will take you where you want to go. Once you have declared a degree-granting major though, as long as you have a health professionals goal, we are on your advising team. Students in any major can meet with a PPHC advisor to continue preparing for entry into their professional programs of choice. PPHC is excited to launch "Connections," the official way for pre-health students to link up with the support resources of the Pulse, DegreeWorks, and Strive. Are you connected?

We'll work with you one-on-one to connect with university resources to ensure you're on the path right for you. And we'll make it easy for you to get involved with the student organization and volunteer experiences you need to be ready to apply to professional programs.
