Akiah Watts PreviousNext The funded research project is titled, "Interaction between AAVE and colorism in attitudinal judgments of African Americans." Abstract: The purpose of this research is to see how skin tone and speech type in African Americans influence how they are perceived in social and professional contexts. My previous research suggests African American females are more likely to experience colorism in professional traits while African American males are more likely to experience colorism in social traits. In this expansion, participants will be asked to complete one of four verbal-guise surveys containing still images with attached audio. The clips being tested include the eight combinations of gender (male/female), speech type (African American Vernacular English/Standard American English), and skin tone (light/dark) for the African American pictured. Respondents will be asked to provide their attitudinal judgments of these clips across social and professional traits. Demographic information of the respondents such as their gender, race, and self-reported skin tone will be collected for later statistical analysis. This research has far-reaching societal implications that African Americans can experience unjust prejudice in their social and professional lives based on the tone of their skin and the style of English they use. In order to create a more inclusive society, it is important to draw attention to the existing biases that people hold to take strides towards reducing their influence.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Linguistics Undergraduate Overview About Linguistics Learning Outcomes Courses Major/Minor Modified Minor Computational Linguistics Major Undergraduate Research Opportunities Student Presentations and Publications Honors Past Honors Theses Awards and Prizes Alumni and their Career Paths Foreign Study Research Overview Faculty Research Recent Grants Undergraduate Research Opportunities Student Presentations and Publications Linguistics Lab Research Roundtable Linguistic Discovery (Dartmouth journal) DARLA: Dartmouth Linguistic Automation News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
