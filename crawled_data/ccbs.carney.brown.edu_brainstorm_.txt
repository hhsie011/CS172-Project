We recruit world-class research scientists from academia and industry to contribute to meaningful projects at the interface of neuroscience, machine learning and brain disorders. The program is unique in that it merges the best of both worlds: A strong academic basis for new discovery with the support and infrastructure typical for industrial settings—including seed funds, professional project management, team support, career development plans and facilitation—and support to build spin-off companies. BRAINSTORM is a program within the Center for Computational Brain Science at Brown University’s Robert J. and Nancy D. Carney Institute for Brain Science. Ideas We focus on ideas in brain science and artificial intelligence that have potential for clinical application and commercialization. Innovators We recruit impact-oriented brain scientists to build applications that improve well-being. Incentives We focus on creating the right incentives—those that promote the translation of research in a pre-startup phase, such as core funding and business training opportunities.
