The primary purpose of CCRS is to connect support and resources with members of the university community who are impacted by bias incidents. Accordingly, reports from unconfirmed reporting parties are not included. CCRS is not an investigatory body and does not impose discipline. The log reflects the university's commitment to providing timely information that impacts campus. Iowa State University condemns all forms of racism, white supremacy, anti-Semitism and bigotry.
