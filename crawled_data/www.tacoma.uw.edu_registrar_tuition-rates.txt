Because University costs are supported by state taxes, the rates charged to students who are not residents of Washington state are higher than the rates for residents. Tuition rates are subject to change without notice. To be classified as a full-time student by the University of Washington Tacoma, an undergraduate student must register for and complete at least 12 credits per quarter. A graduate student must register for and complete at least 10 credits per quarter. Financial aid and tuition rates do not necessarily correspond to these credit requirements. For tuition rates from previous years, see the UW Tuition History page. Rates shown include student fees.
