In this way, they are able to reach a larger audience and, most importantly, create and strengthen Columbia University’s ties with the local academic/scientific/business community. The programs have had a multidisciplinary focus and range from mental health to the arts and from human rights to business affairs. The Center has also placed particular emphasis on the earth sciences, corporate governance, media and communications, public policy and science. Responding to the Covid-19 crisis, the Center turned to the webinar format to continue offering public programs featuring leading Columbia faculty members. Since going online in March 2020, it held several online events including: Chile's Constitutional Convention: Election Takeaways and Political Implications The Word for Word Poetry Reading Covering the Pandemic from Testing to Vaccine: The Science and Politics of Covid-19 News May 03, 2022 Climate School’s Jeff Schlegelmilch Challenges Public to Rethink Disaster Readiness An in-person discussion about how the public can be better prepared to respond to possible catastrophe.
