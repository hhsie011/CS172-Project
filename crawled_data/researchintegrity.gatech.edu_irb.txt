An Institutional Review Board (IRB) is a federally mandated panel that is charged with safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects in research. At Georgia Tech, the Central IRB reviews human subject research activities The Central board is composed of faculty and administrators from Georgia Institute of Technology and representatives from the greater Atlanta community. Administrative support for the Board is provided by the Georgia Tech Office of Research Integrity Assurance (ORIA). IRB approval is required in advance for all research projects that include human subjects, regardless of funding source and regardless of whether the project is a subgrant or subcontract to or from another institution. Submit research protocols via IRBWISE. Please see our IRB Review Process Flowchart for more guidance on how the review process works and what to expect in regards to review times. Additionally, please be sure to use our Submission Decision Tree to determine what type of review is needed for your study. The IRB is supported by ORIA, which reports to the Vice President for Research Development and Operations. This office maintains the university's Federalwide Assurance (FWA 00001731) and Registrations with the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) in the federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). This Federalwide Assurance and all IRB Policies and Procedures apply to all Georgia Tech faculty, staff, and students.
