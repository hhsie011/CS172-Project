Magazine Outreach Ways to Give Clemson Home College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences Students Current: Engagement Engagement Leading the Way Technical skills in the classroom are only part of what is needed to succeed after college. As the world evolves, so must skill-sets. Graduates will need to build bridges that bring together the best minds, regardless of culture, nation, or discipline. With these qualities, students will be prepared to lead in the 21st century. Leadership Programs Clemson Intersect Clemson Intersect is a collaborative project between the College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences (CECAS) and the Wilbur O. and Ann Powers College of Business to reinforce the relationship between business and the technical degree programs. The program's key focus areas include Business Analytics, Leadership, Innovation & Entrepreneurship, and Value Chain & Advanced Manufacturing. A speaker series will consist of professionals who will highlight trends and best practices from their organizations. Talks will also include how business, engineering, and computing work together to generate a global impact. The initiative will, eventually, expand to offer networking opportunities between students and speakers. Speaker Series $229M in total research expenditure support in 2020 Clemson Division of Research Clemson Libraries provides access to more than 3 million print and electronic books.

Internship Programs Creative Inquiry allows students to engage in team-based projects with an emphasis on undergraduate research. Graduate students often lead or mentor. Creative Inquiry The Center for Career and Professional Development offers career fairs, mock interviews, and networking opportunities throughout the year. Fairs and Workshops Study Abroad Clemson engineering students have a variety of opportunities to travel abroad and be exposed to unique cultures and customs. In addition, ongoing projects allow students to apply practical knowledge to hands-on experiences while making contributions to the living conditions of those who don't have access to things we take for granted. We encourage all CECAS students to accept the challenge and make a difference by getting involved and growing through these rewarding international project opportunities. CECAS Abroad Study Abroad FAQ Research The University has adopted an academic plan that identifies eight areas in which it will conduct innovative research and encourage economic development. As a result, Clemson is a thriving place for research, building nationally recognized programs in advanced materials, automotive and transportation technology, biotechnology, biomedical sciences, family and community living, general education, information and communications technology, leadership, and entrepreneurship, and sustainable environment.
