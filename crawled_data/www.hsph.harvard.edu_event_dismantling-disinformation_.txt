We’ve all seen the perils of disinformation. So, how do we combat it? This panel will explore concrete proposals for dismantling disinformation in communities, on social media, and through public policy and regulation. We’ll bring together experts from multiple fields — including communication, education, behavioral psychology, and First Amendment law — to tackle an issue that could well shape the future of public health. This is a conversation about solutions and the role each of us can play in limiting the impact of false content. Email your questions to studio@hsph.harvard.edu.
