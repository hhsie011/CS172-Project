This is the second year the Beijing Center supports SIPA Delegation after the Innovator’s Night panel in 2017. January 05, 2018 Dr. Peng Kang, Professor in Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry of Chinese Academy of Science in China, and Dr. Kanle Shi from Tsinghua University, who is also the co-founder of Hulu.com, were invited to share their entrepreneurial journeys and to discuss China's business environment and its prospect in the fields of technology, environmental protection, and education with Columbia undergraduate and graduate students and alumni. In 2018, aiming to create an all-dimensional experience for SIPA students, the Delegation took 20 SIPA students to visit governmental institutions, state-owned enterprises, top Chinese firms, and tourism spots in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen. Professor Merit Janow, Dean of SIPA, sent her high regards towards the visit. She anticipated students to have close contact with leaders and talented youths to deepen their understanding of all aspects of China. SIPA China Delegation was inaugurated in 2016. Fully initiated, fund-raised and operated by SIPA students under the support of SIPA and Columbia University, the Delegation has gained full support from Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC) and sponsorship from China-U.S. Exchange Foundation (CUSEF).
