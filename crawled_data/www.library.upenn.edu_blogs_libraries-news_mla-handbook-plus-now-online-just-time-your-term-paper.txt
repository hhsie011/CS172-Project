Posted on April 6, 2022 by David Sean Azzolina Explore this resource: Connect to MLA Handbook Plus The MLA Handbook, now in its 9th edition (2021), and available campus wide has a venerable history, going back, in various iterations, to 1951 providing guidance for students and faculty in the humanities and literary study. Though originating in the United States in the Modern Language Association, it is used worldwide. Despite its origin in the mid-twentieth century, The MLA Handbook is a very contemporary style citation manual and grammar guide. It includes methods for citing sources in various formats, not just traditional book and journal sources, but websites and videos, among other kinds other than print. Meeting contemporary needs, it provides for inclusive language principles that allow writers to meet the standards of today’s editors. The MLA Handbook Plus website provides the fulltext for MLA Handbook 9th edition (2021) in addition to MLA Guide to Digital Literacy (2019), MLA Guide to Undergraduate Research in Literature (2019), and citation training materials. Penn students will appreciate having this essential resource available to them at a moment’s notice online, alongside other citation management guides and tools available through the Penn Libraries.
