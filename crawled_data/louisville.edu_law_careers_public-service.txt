Greenebaum Public Service Program These Brandeis Law students spent the summer of 2016 as fellows with the Legal Aid Society. The University of Louisville Louis D. Brandeis School of Law is committed to training thoughtful, civic-minded lawyers who play active roles in their communities. This commitment was exemplified when Brandeis Law became one of the first five law schools in the country to adopt a public service requirement into the standard curriculum. The Samuel L. Greenebaum Public Service Program began in the spring of 1992 as a volunteer program and became a required component of the curriculum in 1994. The program is funded through an endowment created by Richard and Jane Eskind and John S. Greenebaum to honor the spirit of public service exemplified by their father, the late Samuel L. Greenebaum, a Louisville legal and civic leader. Major Offerings of the Greenebaum Program: • Pro Bono Graduation Requirement • First-Year Student Weeklong Projects • Paid Summer Fellowships • Public Service Internships • Lawlapalooza Careers Staff Policies Employment Statistics For Current Students For Employers For Alumni Greenebaum Public Service Program For Prospective Students For Current Students Lawlapalooza Central High School Law and Government Magnet Program Symplicity Professional Development News Debt relief specialist shares tips with Brandeis Law students Louisville entrepreneur, real estate developer Gill Holland talks the value of a law degree Workers' rights conference is 'amazing experience' for Brandeis Law student Brandeis Law students mingle with local lawyers thanks to mentoring program at Frost 3L gains practical experience at pro se divorce clinic Professional Development News - More… Louis D.
