OSC deals with alleged instances of academic dishonesty and other student misconduct, in order to determine how best to resolve these allegations consistent with the goals and mission of the University as an educational and intellectual community. As of July 1, 2019, all alleged violations of the University's Sexual Misconduct Policy are handled by the Office of the AVP of Equity and Title IX Officer. Our Mission It is the purpose of the student disciplinary system to further the educational mission of the University by resolving alleged violations of the Code of Student Conduct, the Code of Academic Integrity and other applicable policies regarding student behavior. There are numerous ways complaints about alleged student misconduct can be resolved. These include the formal disciplinary process as outlined in the Charter of the Student Disciplinary System, referral to the University Mediation Program, and referral to other University resource offices. The Office of Student Conduct at Penn has twin goals: to help create a safe environment where academic life can flourish; and to promote the development of students. Our student disciplinary process is meant to set the standard for behavior on our campus and to determine a student's standing in the community. It is not meant to replace or substitute for the criminal justice system or other legal avenues. However, the student disciplinary process provides an important additional forum to respond to the interests of the Penn community. Our processes are designed to educate and, where appropriate, sanction those students who violate our rules. We seek both to promote a student's sense of responsibility by enforcing accountability, and to protect our community by, where necessary, removing or restricting those who may pose a threat to others. Finally, our Mediation Program is available to everyone in the Penn community to facilitate the constructive resolution of disputes (excluding Academic Integrity complaints or concerns covered by the Sexual Violence, Relationship Violence and Stalking Policy). Our intention is to emphasize the peaceful and productive handling of conflict when possible and where appropriate. The Office of Student Conduct encourages your feedback, input and consultation. We strive to be a safe, helpful and professional resource for the entire Penn community. ______________________________________________________________ To view the most recent University Annual Disciplinary Report, please click here.
