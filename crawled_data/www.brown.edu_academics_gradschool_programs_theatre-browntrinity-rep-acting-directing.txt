Completion Requirements MFA Acting Completion Requirements The core curriculum consists of daily acting, voice, and movement classes, supplemented by frequent workshops in specialty areas. Technique work continues throughout the program, but there is a progressive shift in emphasis from the acquisition and refinement of skills to their practical application. In the final semester, through individual and group sessions, the student focuses strongly on showcase presentations and thesis work. In addition to classroom training, assignments in the Consortium and/or Trinity Rep Company productions will be an important component of training. Students will be expected to participate in a variety of studio and mainstage productions. Understudy duties on mainstage Trinity productions may also be assigned; the combination of understudy and performance work will give the graduating student enough candidate weeks to be awarded their Equity card upon graduation. MFA Directing Completion Requirements Directors are given the opportunity to develop their own vision, in collaboration with actors, by creating new work and re-imagining existing texts. Each year Brown/Trinity Rep admits two emerging directors who bring their curiosity, imagination, and humanity to engage in a rigorous three-year course of study and practice. The work sharpens their individual voices as artists, developing a personal articulation of intention, purpose, and vision. As contemporary creative leaders, directors must be well versed in the practical aspects of rehearsal and production, and inspire and synthesize the work of their colleagues. They must possess a broad-based critical foundation, a knowledge of historical and political context, and the capacity to envision beyond the present. The resources of Trinity Rep, Brown University, and Providence, Rhode Island provide a dynamic, fertile laboratory setting in which to grow these skills.
