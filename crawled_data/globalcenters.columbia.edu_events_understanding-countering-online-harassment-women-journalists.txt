This panel will shed light on the online harassment of women journalists and mechanisms to protect the physical and emotional safety of the targeted journalists. Online harassment and violence imperil journalists across the world. Online attacks, abuse, violence, and bullying especially directed at women journalists have significantly increased in the past few years. A cross-country report issued by UNESCO and the International Center for Journalists in 2020 reveals that three out of four women respondents (73 percent) had experienced online violence, and one in five women reported that they experienced physical attacks stemming from the initial online harassment. Many press freedom organizations like International Press Institute (IPI) recognize the severity of this threat on the safety of journalists and implement programs to help newsrooms protect their staff. Please note that there will be simultaneous translation into Turkish and English during this event.
