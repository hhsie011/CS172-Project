To help you plan, we want to let you know that Columbia will require all students, beginning with the Fall 2022 term, to be up-to-date with their COVID-19 vaccinations. This means at minimum to have received the primary vaccination series and the first booster dose. You will be unable to enroll or remain enrolled for the Fall term if your vaccine information is not up to date. Importantly, this requirement applies to both continuing and new incoming students. COVID-19 vaccination is widely available in the US and many countries around the world. Students will be able to receive their booster from Columbia Health Medical Services (Morningside/Manhattanville) or at Student Health on Haven (CUIMC). We encourage you to submit your documents now: Morningside and Manhattanville Students: Upload documentation of your vaccine series using the online instructions. It is a two-step process so be sure you complete both steps. CUIMC Students: Visit Student Health on Haven’s website for information on uploading your vaccine and booster documentation. You can read more information regarding acceptable vaccines online and for those unable to get such vaccination in their current country of residence, information on how to receive vaccines on arrival to the U.S. (including potential on campus vaccine options) will be shared over the summer. Information is also available for those requesting consideration of a potential medical or religious exemptions (Morningside/Manhattanville or CUIMC). Thank you for taking early action to address this requirement and we look forward to welcoming you to Columbia for the fall term. Thank you, Donna Lynne Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, CUIMC University COVID Director Gerry Rosberg Senior Executive Vice President Tags Facilities and Campus Life Vaccine Public Health Announcement News May 05, 2022 Update on Current Public Health Protocols April 25, 2022 COVID-19 Treatment Option for Individuals Meeting CDC Guidelines April 22, 2022 Statement From the President’s Advisory Task Force on COVID-19 April 15, 2022 Update on Vaccination Requirement for Students April 15, 2022 Three Updates: Booster Shots, Gateway Testing, and Masking Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
