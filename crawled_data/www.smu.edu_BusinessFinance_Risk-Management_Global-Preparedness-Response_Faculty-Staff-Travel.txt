This includes all international travel supported by SMU including, conferences, research, teaching, training, and recruitment, etc. Please do not register personal travel or other non-SMU travel. Register Your Travel Here What to expect Step 1: All employees must first receive departmental approval of their travel by completing a Concur Travel Request. Step 2: After your Concur Travel Request has been approved by your department, then you will need to complete the Risk Management Travel Authorization and Registration by going to the Terra Dotta Enterprise Travel Registry. You do not have to complete the entire profile in one sitting; be sure to save your progress and simply log back in to pick up where you left off. You might receive email reminders about your profile status if sections are left incomplete. Step 3: Once your profile is complete in Terra Dotta, the Travel Oversight Committee will review all aspects of the trip information you submitted and will either approve or deny your travel. If it is approved, you will receive an email notification and you will be able to continue with travel bookings in Concur. If your travel is denied, you will have the opportunity to appeal based on policy 11.4. The chair of the TOC will follow up with you on the steps involved in the appeal process. Step 4: Completion and approval of your trip in the Terra Dotta Enterprise Travel Registry automatically enrolls you in the new SMU location-specific notification system for international travel known as Alert Traveler. Please also download the App to receive important emergency notifications from SMU and to be able to check-in during an emergency abroad.
