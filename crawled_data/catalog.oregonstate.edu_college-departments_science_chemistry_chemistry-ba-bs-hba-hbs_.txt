Students in either track or any option with good academic records and letters of recommendation will be well prepared and competitive for continued graduate education in chemistry or related areas. Track One is well suited for students intending to pursue a graduate degree in chemistry or a closely related area. It provides the most rigorous and complete chemistry background and the most extensive laboratory experience. The curriculum is approved by the American Chemical Society (ACS) and has two options: advanced biochemistry and advanced chemistry. Both options include 6–12 credits of career-supportive electives (CSE) in advanced chemistry or related disciplines. These CSE courses are approved by the advisor and are intended to strengthen the student's background in areas related to career goals. Students choosing the advanced chemistry option must take at least 3 credits in advanced laboratory courses or research. Track-One graduates are eligible for ACS certification by the department chair and can become full members of the ACS without the requirement of work experience. Track Two is suited for chemistry majors who want to gain extensive experience in a secondary area, target a particular career direction or continue with graduate education in chemistry or related areas. Track Two options include biochemistry, business, chemistry education, chemical engineering, environmental chemistry, forensic science, materials science, and pre-medicine. The multidisciplinary approach of Track Two enhances preparation and opportunities for employment in electronics, polymers, or biotechnology (the biochemistry, chemical engineering, or materials science options), for careers in environmental science (environmental chemistry option), work in crime labs (forensic science option), or teaching in high schools (chemistry education option). The Track Two curriculum is not approved by the American Chemical Society. It consists of a core of chemistry courses (79–81 credits) and a combination of 8 to 11 courses (30–37 credits) that defines each option. BA Degree in Chemistry The BA degree in Chemistry is appropriate for chemistry students interested in obtaining a broader academic background through a second-language requirement and additional liberal arts courses (9 credits). It also includes 6–12 credits of approved career-supportive electives to allow students to choose courses in advanced chemistry or related disciplines to support their career goals. At least 3 credits are to be in advanced laboratory courses or research. This degree may lead to international opportunities, especially if coupled with the International Degree Program at OSU. Major Code: 520 Recall, integrate, and apply essential core information about the key components of Chemistry. Demonstrate competency in basic laboratory techniques, laboratory safety, chemical synthesis, and measurement of chemical properties and phenomena. Communicate ideas effectively orally and in writing. Demonstrate the ability to analyze data, access information and integrate information from various sources in order to solve problems. All Undergraduate Chemistry Degrees Completion of an option is required to earn a degree in Chemistry. The baccalaureate core requirements are met by: Course List Code Title Credits Fitness HHS 231 *LIFETIME FITNESS FOR HEALTH 2 HHS 241 *LIFETIME FITNESS (or any PAC course) 1 Speech 3 Writing courses 7 Perspectives courses 12 One Biology course 4 One Difference, Power, and Discrimination course (DPD) 3 Synthesis courses 6 Total Credits 38 The quarters in which these are taken are flexible, except that synthesis courses must be taken at the junior and senior level. Chemistry majors or minors may not use S/U grading in courses that meet Department of Chemistry or College of Science requirements. The timing of courses for all degrees and options can be critical, especially because of prerequisites. More detailed information and suggestions about when to take courses are found on the Chemistry Department website. Students should meet with their advisor every term. For many options in Track Two, students will also be directed to an additional advisor in another department for courses in that option. For any option involving biochemistry courses, it is strongly recommended that students select BB 314 and BI 221 (as the biology course to fulfill the baccalaureate core requirement). For options in which CH 462 is the recommended WIC course, it is strongly recommended that CH 422 be taken as a corequisite. Chemistry offers the following courses through the Honors College (HC). Chemistry students in the HC may substitute these courses for courses in the regular sequences: Course List Code Title Credits CH 231H & CH 232H & CH 233H GENERAL CHEMISTRY and GENERAL CHEMISTRY and GENERAL CHEMISTRY 12 CH 261H & CH 262H & CH 263H *LABORATORY FOR CHEMISTRY 231 and *LABORATORY FOR CHEMISTRY 232 and *LABORATORY FOR CHEMISTRY 233 3 CH 361H & CH 362H & CH 461H EXPERIMENTAL CHEMISTRY I and EXPERIMENTAL CHEMISTRY I and EXPERIMENTAL CHEMISTRY II 9 CH 462H & CH 463H & CH 464H ^EXPERIMENTAL CHEMISTRY II and ^ EXPERIMENTAL CHEMISTRY II and ^EXPERIMENTAL CHEMISTRY II 9 Track-One BS Degree in Chemistry (See the Advanced Biochemistry option and Advanced Chemistry option) Course List Code Title Credits Chemistry Core CH 231 & CH 271 GENERAL CHEMISTRY and *LABORATORY FOR CH 231 FOR CHEMISTRY MAJORS 5 CH 232 & CH 272 GENERAL CHEMISTRY and *LABORATORY FOR CH 232 FOR CHEMISTRY MAJORS 5 CH 233 & CH 273 GENERAL CHEMISTRY and *LABORATORY FOR CH 233 FOR CHEMISTRY MAJORS 5 CH 334 & CH 335 & CH 336 ORGANIC CHEMISTRY and ORGANIC CHEMISTRY and ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 9 CH 361 & CH 362 EXPERIMENTAL CHEMISTRY I and EXPERIMENTAL CHEMISTRY I 6 CH 421 & CH 422 ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY and ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY 6 CH 440 & CH 441 & CH 442 PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY and PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY and PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY 9 MTH 251 *DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS 4 MTH 252 INTEGRAL CALCULUS 4 MTH 253 INFINITE SERIES AND SEQUENCES 4 or MTH 306 MATRIX AND POWER SERIES METHODS MTH 254 VECTOR CALCULUS I 4 PH 211 & PH 212 & PH 213 *GENERAL PHYSICS WITH CALCULUS and *GENERAL PHYSICS WITH CALCULUS and *GENERAL PHYSICS WITH CALCULUS 12 PH 221 & PH 222 & PH 223 RECITATION FOR PHYSICS 211 and RECITATION FOR PHYSICS 212 and RECITATION FOR PHYSICS 213 3 Total credits required for graduation is 180 Track-Two BS Degree in Chemistry (See options for Biochemistry, Business, Chemistry Education, Chemical Engineering, Environmental Chemistry, Forensic Science, Materials Science, Pre-Medicine) Course List Code Title Credits Chemistry Core 1 CH 231 & CH 271 GENERAL CHEMISTRY and *LABORATORY FOR CH 231 FOR CHEMISTRY MAJORS 5 CH 232 & CH 272 GENERAL CHEMISTRY and *LABORATORY FOR CH 232 FOR CHEMISTRY MAJORS 5 CH 233 & CH 273 GENERAL CHEMISTRY and *LABORATORY FOR CH 233 FOR CHEMISTRY MAJORS 5 CH 324 QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS 2 4 CH 334 & CH 335 & CH 336 ORGANIC CHEMISTRY and ORGANIC CHEMISTRY and ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 9 CH 361 & CH 362 EXPERIMENTAL CHEMISTRY I and EXPERIMENTAL CHEMISTRY I 6 CH 411 & CH 412 INORGANIC CHEMISTRY and INORGANIC CHEMISTRY 2 6 CH 440 & CH 441 & CH 442 PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY and PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY and PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY 9 CH 462 ^EXPERIMENTAL CHEMISTRY II 3 or CH 463 ^EXPERIMENTAL CHEMISTRY II or CH 464 ^EXPERIMENTAL CHEMISTRY II MTH 251 & MTH 252 & MTH 254 *DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS and INTEGRAL CALCULUS and VECTOR CALCULUS I 12 Select one of the following series: 15 Series 1 PH 211 & PH 221 *GENERAL PHYSICS WITH CALCULUS and RECITATION FOR PHYSICS 211 PH 212 & PH 222 *GENERAL PHYSICS WITH CALCULUS and RECITATION FOR PHYSICS 212 PH 213 & PH 223 *GENERAL PHYSICS WITH CALCULUS and RECITATION FOR PHYSICS 213 Series 2 PH 201 & PH 202 & PH 203 *GENERAL PHYSICS and *GENERAL PHYSICS and *GENERAL PHYSICS Total credits required for graduation is 180 * Baccalaureate Core Course (BCC) ^ Writing Intensive Course (WIC) 1 For a stronger background in analytical chemistry, instead of CH 324 plus CH 411 and CH 412 substitute CH 421, CH 422, CH 461, CH 411 or CH 412, which adds 2 credits 2 The 9 credits must be approved by the advisor and the department by the end of the winter quarter of the junior year and include 3 credits of lab Major Code: 520 Degree plans are subject to change and the following is only an example of how students may complete their degree in four years.
