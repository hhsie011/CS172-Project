Our ever-expanding array of education courses allows undergraduates to explore fundamental issues of race, class, power, privilege, equity and identity through the lens of education. From introductory courses to advanced seminars, our classes examine how to teach for social justice, how students learn and develop, and how education policies promote or limit opportunity and equity. Our faculty includes experts in teaching and learning, human development, education policy, and the history of education. We take a multi-disciplinary approach to the field, offering courses from perspectives in anthropology, economics, history, human development, political science, social work, and sociology, among others.
