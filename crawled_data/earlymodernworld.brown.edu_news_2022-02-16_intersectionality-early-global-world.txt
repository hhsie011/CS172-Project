Nevertheless, a great deal of work remains to be done to understand the many varieties of ways such aspects of identities intersected and were mobilized or challenged in the marking of difference. Intersectionality in the Early Global World (20-21 May 2022) via Zoom Keynote Speakers: Roland Betancourt (UC Irvine) and Nicholas R. Jones (UC Davis) This conference is organized by the officers of UCLA MEMSA: Chase Caldwell Smith (History), Richard Ibarra (History), and Stefanie Matabang (Comparative Literature). Research on the premodern intersection of race, gender, and sexuality has steadily increased as a result of the efforts of a diverse group of scholars working across traditional periodization and geographic limits. Nevertheless, a great deal of work remains to be done to understand the many varieties of ways such aspects of identities intersected and were mobilized or challenged in the marking of difference. To that end, the Medieval and Early Modern Student Association (MEMSA), in cooperation with the CMRS Center for Early Global Studies (CMRS-CEGS) at UCLA, seek twenty-minute paper proposals for a two-day conference that will highlight the new and exciting work being undertaken with regard to these questions. Proposals from graduate students in all disciplinary fields and levels of experience are welcome. We especially welcome and encourage comparative and interdisciplinary proposals from disciplines such as Asian Studies, Africana Studies, Critical Race Studies, Indigenous Studies, Near Eastern Studies, Gender and Sexuality Studies, Literature, History, the History of Art and Architecture, Archaeology, Philosophy, Classics, and others. Please submit an abstract of the proposed presentation (250-300 words) to the officers of MEMSA (memsa.ucla@gmail.com) by March 1, 2022.
