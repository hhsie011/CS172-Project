Only University requirements are listed in this section. Requirements of colleges, schools, and departments appear in the section pertaining to the college, school, or department concerned. Scholastic Standards Required Credits Required University General Education and Proficiency Requirements Limitation on ROTC Credits Limitation on Physical Education Activity Credits Final-Year Residence Requirement Effective Date for Graduation Requirements Waiver of Graduation Requirements Graduation Requirements for ROTC Students Scholastic Standards Required To be eligible for the baccalaureate degree, a student must earn a cumulative GPA of 2.00 for all work done in residence at the University. The graduation GPA is computed when the student has completed all work for the degree and includes only credits earned while in residence at the University. Credits Required To be eligible for graduation from the University with the baccalaureate degree, a student must satisfy all other specific requirements and must offer a minimum of 180 academic credits. University General Education and Proficiency Requirements The University has adopted minimum general education and proficiency requirements. Individual schools and colleges may establish general education and proficiency requirements in excess of University requirements. Consult the undergraduate program section of each school or college for specific graduation requirements. Limitation on ROTC Credits Beginning Autumn quarter 2007, credits earned in military training courses can be counted in the basic 180 credits required for graduation. Prior to Autumn quarter 2007, credits earned in first- and second-year military training courses cannot be counted in the basic 180 credits required for graduation. Limitation on Physical Education Activity Credits No more than 3 physical education activity credits can apply toward a degree. Final-Year Residence Requirement To be recommended for a first or subsequent baccalaureate degree, a student must complete 45 of the final 60 credits as a matriculated student in residence at the University. The granting of exceptions to this rule is the responsibility of the dean of the college or school awarding the degree. If an exception is granted, the student still must present a minimum of 45 credits taken in residence as a matriculated student to be awarded a UW degree. Effective Date for Graduation Requirements If fewer than ten years have elapsed since a student's admission into a major program, the student may choose to graduate under the major program requirements in effect at the time of admission, or under any subsequent requirements. The choice shall be subject to approval of the student's departmental chair and dean, according to the procedures established in Section 23-48 of the Faculty Code. If the student wishes to obtain a degree after a lapse of more than ten years from the date of admission to the major program, they must meet the requirements in effect at the time of graduation unless permission to use earlier requirements is granted, either as a general policy or expressly for the individual student, by the department, school, or college whose requirements are in question. These provisions do not apply to the requirements for teaching certificates, which are prescribed by the College of Education at the time the certificate is to be granted. Waiver of Graduation Requirements A request for waiver of college or University graduation requirements is petitioned to the college graduation committee, which refers the petition to the Committee on Admissions and Academic Standards if an all-University requirement is involved. These petition forms are available at the Graduation and Academic Records Office or the advisory office. A student should see their academic adviser to initiate a petition. Because the Committee on Admissions and Academic Standards meets only quarterly, petitions involving University requirements should be filed early in the quarter. An exemption from an all-University graduation requirement that is granted by the Committee on Admissions and Academic Standards becomes void at the end of two calendar years from the date such exemption is granted if all degree requirements have not been completed within that period. Graduation Requirements for ROTC Students As a prerequisite for graduation from the University, students accepted for the third- and fourth-year advanced ROTC program must complete the advanced program unless excused or dismissed from this requirement by regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Army, the Navy, or the Air Force, whoever has the authority in the individual case.
