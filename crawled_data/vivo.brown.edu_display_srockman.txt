Full Text Research Research Overview Seth Rockman is a specialist in Revolutionary and Early Republic United States history, with a focus on the relationship of slavery and capitalism in American economic and social development. The histories of race, labor, and social welfare are central to his research. Rockman supervised undergraduate research for the University Steering Committee on Slavery and Justice, and is now conducting his own research on the relationship of Northern manufacturing to the plantation economies of the South. Research Statement Trained broadly as an early Americanist, I am interested in three historical trajectories that converged in the late-eighteenth century: the emergence of capitalism in the Atlantic World, the rise of New World Slavery, and the articulation of liberal conceptions of human agency and personal freedom. Integrating economic, labor, and cultural history, my work explores the social experience of economic change in the decades surrounding the American Revolution. In 2003, I published Welfare Reform in the Early Republic: A Brief History with Documents with Bedford Books. Scraping By: Wage Labor, Slavery, and Survival in Early Baltimore came out in 2009 from Johns Hopkins University Press. About Scraping By : Imagine Barbara Ehrenreich's Nickel and Dimed , circa 1818 that is, a very material look at how low-end workers found and kept jobs, navigated underground economies, employed clever strategies to keep households afloat, and what happened when they failed. Scraping By situates enslaved mariners, white seamstresses, Irish dockhands, free black domestic servants, and native-born street-sweepers in the same labor market, on the same jobsites, and ultimately within the same political economy of early republic capitalism. As a "labor history of unskilled labor" and one of the first studies to consider such diverse workers side-by-side, Scraping By explores how race, sex, nativity, and legal status determined the opportunities and vulnerabilities of working families. This study focuses on Baltimore between 1790 and 1840, when this boomtown was the nation's third-largest city, had the nation's largest population of color, and (perched at the boundary of North and South) saw its number of free and enslaved workers grow simultaneously. Sources include construction site payrolls, employment advertisements, almshouse records, court petitions, and speeches from the nation's first "living wage" campaign. Scraping By is fundamentally a study of capitalism and class in the post-Revolutionary US. In advance of the book, I have published several stand-alone essays on 1) integrating slavery into histories of capitalism, and 2) the viability of class analysis for the early republic United States. This work suggests that at a time when issues of globalization, free trade, corporate accounting, and fair labor practices dominate the headlines, economic history is too important to be left to traditional economic historians. Eschewing social-scientific models of human behavior and market mechanisms, I propose a history of American capitalism that recognizes the cultural and social forces that constitute "the market" and shape a multiplicity of human responses to economic stimuli. My new book focuses on objects manufactured in the North for use on plantations in the American South. At the intersection of business history and material culture studies, I consider the multiple meanings of hoes, blankets, and machetes as they moved great distances and fell into different hands. These artifacts illuminate issues of slave resistance, abolitionism, business ethics, technological innovation, and Southern nationalism, while also situating entrepreneurs, factory laborers, planters, and slaves in the same narrative of economic development. By following "plantation goods" from production to consumption, it is possible to see the simultaneity of opportunity and oppression in American history. In April 2011, Sven Beckert (Harvard) and I convened a three-day conference entitled "Slavery's Capitalism: A New History of American Economic Development." After a keynote address by President Ruth Simmons, seventeen scholars presented new research and engaged in vigorous discussion with commentators and the audience. The conference generated a volume of essays which appeared in the Early American Studies series at University of Pennsylvania Press in 2016.
