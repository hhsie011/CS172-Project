Launched in 2018, the Dean’s Circle is a recognition society created for the sole purpose of honoring School of Dentistry alumni and friends. Annually, those who give $1,000 or more are recognized in the Dean’s Circle for their giving, which helps further the mission and vision of the School and enhances the educational opportunities made available to our students. The University of Louisville School of Dentistry Strategic Plan describes the mission and vision of the School in this way: We will be national leaders dedicated to the improvement of the oral and overall health of those whom we serve, transforming lives by educating oral health care professionals to provide patient-centered treatment through innovative pedagogical approaches, community engagement, and research. From this statement we have derived the core tenets exemplified by the Dean’s Circle: Leadership, Innovation, and Transforming Lives. Benefits As a valued part of the ULSD family, each year Dean’s Circle honorees will receive an invitation to a recognition event, exclusive communication from the Dean, and a very special collectible coin. Each year a new coin will be minted featuring the Dean’s Circle logo and core tenets, the recognition year, and a unique design created and submitted by a dental student. Your gifts help the University of Louisville School of Dentistry fulfill our bold vision of instilling Leadership, encouraging Innovation, and Transforming Lives. For more information, please call (502) 852-5496 or e-mail megan.carbello@louisville.edu.
