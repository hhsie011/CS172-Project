NSF May 24, 2022 Groundwater Discovered in Sediments Buried Deep Under Antarctic Ice More Media Stories Earth Science News May 03, 2022 Fieldwork in Bangladesh During the End of Ramadan and Eid Festival We have come to in Bangladesh in the pre-monsoon heat to better image the active faults beneath the surface using electromagnetic instruments. We are using the fallow fields from the just-harvested rice crop for our sites. May 05, 2022 In Sediments Below Antarctic Ice, Scientists Discover a Giant Groundwater System For the first time, scientists have mapped in detail water locked in a deep basin far under the Antarctic ice. The discovery could have implications for how the continent reacts to, or even contributes to, climate change. May 09, 2022 Dealing With Rain and Rats As we continued our geophysical measurements, we had to deal with heavy rains, flooding fields, and rats and foxes biting our cables. Many cables were broken soon after sunset, ruining the measurements. May 11, 2022 Upcoming Scientific Fieldwork, 2022 and Beyond Thumbnail descriptions of field projects on land, at sea and in the air, on every continent and every ocean. May 12, 2022 Tea Gardens to the Rescue We switched to deploying our equipment for imaging faults and the structure beneath the surface to tea gardens to get away from power lines and buried the cables to protect them from gnawing foxes. May 17, 2022 Lazy Bears and Confused Birds: What a Warming Planet Means for Wildlife In the Arctic, climate change is upsetting the migratory rhythms of many species, disrupting pollinators, and spelling trouble for ecosystems around the world. May 20, 2022 Start of the Mini-Field School We were joined in our electromagnetic investigation of the subsurface and earthquake hazard by a group of US and Bangladeshi students and professors for a mini-Field School. May 25, 2022 Community-Led Science Uncovers High Air Pollution From Fracking in Ohio County In a collaboration that included Columbia researchers, Belmont County residents set up a low-cost sensor network that is helping them fight for clean air. May 27, 2022 Sylhet City, Geology, and Packing Up We finished our electromagnetic survey and mini-field school in northern Sylhet, Bangladesh, with lectures and field trips to see the geology by car and boat.
