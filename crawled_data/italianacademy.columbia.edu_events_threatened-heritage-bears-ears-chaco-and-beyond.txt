This symposium explores the implications – social, archaeological, environmental, spiritual, historical, artistic and legal – of the current threats to Bears Ears National Monument and Chaco Canyon. The desecration of traditional Pueblo, Zuni, Hopi, Navajo, Ute, Ute Mountain Ute and other tribal lands is imminent. Eighty-five percent of Bears Ears will be cut; the Chaco region will be further opened to oil, gas, and coal extraction. Safeguards will be stripped from 1.1 million acres at Bears Ears, and drilling again permitted around Chaco’s incomparable sites.
