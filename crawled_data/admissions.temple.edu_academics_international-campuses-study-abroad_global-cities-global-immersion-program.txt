Temple’s Global Cities Global Immersion Program is for students with a cosmopolitan view of the world who want a truly international collegiate experience. Offered on Main Campus, Temple Japan and Temple Rome, students in the program have the opportunity to take full advantage of Temple’s global network of urban campuses in three of the world’s most influential cities. Eligible Programs The Global Cities Global Immersion Program is open to students in the following undergraduate degree programs at Temple. Communication Studies in Klein College of Media and Communication Global Studies in the College of Liberal Arts International Business in the Fox School of Business Students in these programs can pursue one of three tracks to complete the program. Pathways Track: Bachelor’s and master’s degree in four years With this track, students earn both a bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree in four years from one of Temple’s Philadelphia or Japan schools or colleges. This track requires spending at least one term, but ideally two terms (fall, spring or summer), on each of Temple’s campuses in Philadelphia; Tokyo, Japan; and Rome, Italy. To finish both degrees in four years, you will complete three summer terms; participate in an international internship in either Japan or Rome; and save time and money by using nine to 12 credits of electives to take graduate courses during the junior and senior years—reducing time to complete a graduate degree. Credits can jointly apply toward completion of both bachelor’s and master’s degrees. Track: Bachelor’s degree in three years Temple offers alternate tracks for students who want to experience all three global campuses. With the three-year track, students can earn a bachelor’s degree on an accelerated timeline without committing to a graduate degree. This track involves spending at least one—but ideally two—terms, at each of Temple’s campuses in Philadelphia, Japan and Rome. To finish this bachelor’s degree in three years, you will complete three summer terms, and participate in an international internship in either Japan or Rome.  Track: Bachelor’s degree in four years With this alternate track, students can still experience all three global campuses and cities and earn a bachelor’s degree in four years without committing to a graduate degree. This track involves spending one to two terms at Temple’s campuses in Philadelphia, Japan and Rome.  How to Apply Students do not apply for admission into this program. Admitted students can choose to complete one of the pathways above by working with advisors housed in each school and college, depending on their intended academic major.
