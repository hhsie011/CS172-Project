If a degree is NOT from a university in the US, Canada, the United Kingdom, or Australia, an acceptable evaluation should: consider formal education only, not practical training experience; state if the collegiate training was post secondary education, i.e., did the applicant complete the United States equivalent of high school studies before entering college; provide a detailed explanation of the materials evaluated, rather than a simple conclusive statement; briefly state the qualifications and experience of the evaluator providing the opinion.
