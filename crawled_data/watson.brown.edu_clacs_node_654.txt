The Swearer Center is now offering a certificate program. Moving forward, students in any concentration can submit a declaration for the Engaged Scholarship Certificate (ESC) in ASK. The declaration is now open to eligible fifth and sixth semester students. In Fall 2021 only, seventh semester students can petition the Committee on Academic Standing (CAS) for an override to declare ESC; the final deadline to do so is September 13, 2021. Interested seniors must first meet with Julie Plaut, Assistant Dean of the College & Director of Engaged Scholarship, to develop their ESC Program Plan. Students can claim an advising appointment here, then submit their plan through this form. The ESC builds on the strengths and core elements of the ESP but allows undergraduate students to define the public, civic, and/or social justice issue on which they will focus. Each student will take SOC 0310: Theory and Practice of Engaged Scholarship and propose a set of three experiences—a three-course interdisciplinary elective sequence, a community-based practicum, and a capstone—related to the issue they define as their focus. Detailed information about the ESC can be found at http://brown.edu/go/escertificate, on Swearer’s website, and in the ESC Student Handbook. For more information, visit Swearer Center’s ESC website.
