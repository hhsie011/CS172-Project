Columbia Business School faculty members are world-renowned for their groundbreaking ideas, cutting-edge research, and enduring impact on the world. Their books, research, and teachings are used in real-world applications ranging from bias policies and diversity in organizations to psychology of media consumption and text mining. Columbia’s approach to academics breaks down the barriers between traditionally isolated disciplines to show how they intersect.

Together, they routinely partner with business leaders across the globe to test, refine, and implement new ideas for the ever-changing business landscape.
