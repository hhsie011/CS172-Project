Our mission is to instill in nursing students a sense of global citizenship and ethical responsibility. We seek to address health care inequities, such as those that lead to shortages of basic and necessary medical equipment, childhood deaths from easily-treatable illnesses, inadequate health care for the millions of refugees ï¬‚eeing wars and persecution, and devastation from epidemics of preventable diseases. Through the Office of Global Initiatives and Office of Global Research, we promote collaboration and innovation, with the goal of attaining health equity for all populations. Our curriculum provides extraordinary global opportunities for students and nurses at all levels of study, research, and practice.
