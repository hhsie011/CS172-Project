The UC Riverside AP Readiness Program is a partnership with Riverside County Office of Education designed with two interconnected goals in mind. The program aims to improve the teaching abilities of AP instructors while simultaneously giving students the skills they will need to be successful in college level classes. AP Readiness allows students to work with master Math, Science, Social Science and English instructors, who prepare them for the rigorous curriculum that they will face in AP courses. Concurrently, their AP teachers observe and learn from the master instructors, gathering a framework for how to successfully conduct an AP course. This unique program allows for students and teachers to learn together. Both teachers and students also become an essential part of a network of AP support and excellence. Program Highlights: Professional development supporting teachers for AP Math, Science, Social Science and English courses Workshops providing students with the skills necessary to be successful in college level classes and hands-on AP activities Formation of a network of learners allowing communication between teachers and students from various neighborhoods Student Registration Site Educator Registration Site AP Readiness 2021- 2022 Flyer AP READINESS 2021-2022 SPANISH FLYER Onboarding Powerpoint Presentation APR Session Schedule Dates for 2021-2022 Program 2021 2022 August 28 September 25 October 23 December 4 January 15 February 5 March 5 April 16 Search University of California, Riverside 900 University Ave. Riverside, CA 92521 Tel: (951) 827-1012 AP Readiness Program 900 University Ave. Sproul Hall Riverside, CA 92521 tel: (951) 827-5225 email: james.keipp@ucr.edu Privacy and Accessibility Terms and Conditions © 2022 Regents of the University of California × Let us help you with your search Enter your Search Criteria.
