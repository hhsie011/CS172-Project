Students can reserve space in the Lab to work alongside fellow students who are also working remotely. The lab also serves as an educational center. We offer training for students on how to be effective remote workers and for employers on how to be effective remote managers. The Center also offers technical bootcamps and simulated lab environments to help workers learn to use remote work tools such as Microsoft Teams, Slack and Trello. Workstations Student workstations include: 27” curved Dell monitors Docking station for your laptop, or Dell XPS and MacBook Pro laptops available to use in-lab Desk and table space Dedicated data line and/or WiFi Location The Lab is located just off campus on the third floor (Room 352) of University Square (U-Square).
