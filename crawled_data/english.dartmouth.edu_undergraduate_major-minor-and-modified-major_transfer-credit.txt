In addition, the Department of English and Creative Writing requires that a transfer course carry a minimum of 30 contact hours and a requirement of 25 pages of writing in order to be considered both for general College credit and for English major credit. Decisions on transfer credit are made by the English and Creative Writing Department's Committee on Departmental Curriculum (CDC), which is chaired by the Vice‐Chair of the Department. Transfer credits normally cannot be used in the major. Students wishing to be granted an exception must petition the CDC. If approval is granted, transfer courses are subject to the rules that apply to substitute courses. Two substitute courses (appropriate major courses from other departments at Dartmouth) are permitted within the major. One of those courses may be part of the concentration area. Students wishing to substitute more than one course in their concentration area must petition the CDC. Normally, substitute courses cannot satisfy the Course Group requirements. Note: No substitutions and no more than one transfer credit will be permitted in the English minor without permission from the CDC.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of English and Creative Writing Undergraduate Overview Major, Minor, and Modified Major Major Minor Modified Major Transfer Credit Creative Writing Concentration Honors Courses Course Group I Course Group II Course Group III Course Group IV Courses (No Group) Creative Writing Courses Courses (No Major Credit) Foreign Study Courses Independent Study and Honors The Historical Philosophy of W.E.B.
