Budget For federal, state, or non-profit sponsors, is the F&A rate mandated by the guidelines being used? For for-profit sponsors, is the University using the full, negotiated F&A rate? If No, an F&A waiver form must be completed. Are sponsor budget mandates followed (e.g., salary caps, prohibitions on purchase of equipment, total request, etc.)? Is Cost Share required? Is any Voluntary Cost Share included? If yes to any of the previous two questions, has the cost share been reviewed and approved by University Officials?
