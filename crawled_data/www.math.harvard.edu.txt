Most current approaches divide a large-scale scene into small regions and combine the local predictions together. However, this scheme inevitably involves additional stages for pre- and post-processing and may also degrade the final output due to predictions in a local perspective. This talk introduces Fast Point Transformer that consists of a new lightweight self-attention layer. Our approach encodes continuous 3D coordinates, and the voxel hashing-based architecture boosts computational efficiency. The proposed method is demonstrated with 3D semantic segmentation and 3D detection. The accuracy of our approach is competitive to the best voxel-based method, and our network achieves 129 times faster inference time than the state-of-the-art, Point Transformer, with a reasonable accuracy trade-off in 3D semantic segmentation on S3DIS dataset.

CMSA EVENT: CMSA Interdisciplinary Science Seminar: Surface hopping algorithms for non-adiabatic quantum systems CMSA EVENT CMSA Interdisciplinary Science Seminar: Surface hopping algorithms for non-adiabatic quantum systems 9:00 AM-10:00 AM June 16, 2022 CMSA, 20 Garden St, G10 1 Oxford Street, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA Surface hopping algorithm is widely used in chemistry for mixed quantum-classical dynamics. In this talk, we will discuss some of our recent works in mathematical understanding and algorithm development for surface hopping methods. These methods are based on stochastic approximations of semiclassical path-integral representation to the solution of multi-level Schrodinger equations; such methodology also extends to other high dimensional transport systems.

Currently, entanglement plays a key role in quantum information applications such as quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum sensing. In this talk the concept of entanglement will be introduced along with various methods that have been proposed to detect and quantify it. The fundamental role of entanglement in both quantum theory and quantum technology will also be discussed.
