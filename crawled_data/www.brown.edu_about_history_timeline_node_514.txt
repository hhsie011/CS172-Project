The Third World Center was opened to meet the needs of Asian, Black, Latino, and Native American students in response to student protests in 1968 and 1975. Today, the center continues to provide “an arena in which students can explore cultural heritages and learn about race and ethnicity as components of American identity.” Brown University Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA Phone: 401-863-1000 Maps & Directions / Contact Us © Brown University X
