Our primary purpose is to prevent suicide by decreasing risk factors, enhancing protective factors, facilitating gatekeeper workshops via our Tigers Together Advocate Training (TTAT) program, reducing stigma and creating an overall community of caring for the Clemson University family. While Tigers Together is housed in Healthy Campus, it could not happen without collaborative partnerships across campus with groups such as the Psychology Department, the Institute On Family and Neighborhood Life, Counseling and Psychological Services, Clemson Student Veterans Association, the Office of Advocacy and Success, You’re Not Alone, University Housing and Dining, and numerous others. Together, we continuously strive to enhance the safety and well-being of Clemson students.
