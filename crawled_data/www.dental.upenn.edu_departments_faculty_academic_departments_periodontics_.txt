The advanced education program in periodontics is designed to provide postdoctoral students with advanced training in the discipline of periodontics and implantology. Additionally, a four-year program in periodontal prosthesis and a four-year combined periodontics-orthodontics program are offered to selected candidates. Residents who wish to combine an academic career with clinical practice may also elect to pursue a Master of Science in Oral Biology (MSOB) and a Doctor of Science in Dentistry (DScD) concurrently with these advanced education certificate programs. The Department also offers an international visiting scholars program, designed for international clinicians who practice or are planning to practice dentistry focused on periodontics and surgical and restorative implantology. Research within the Department ranges from the areas of inflammation and diabetes as they relate to periodontal disease and the loss and repair of connective tissue and bone, to clinical studies on therapies for the treatment of periodontitis.
