RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARCHIVE Rarely seen artifacts are on display in a new exhibit at the Southwest Collection/Special Collections Library. The Southwest Collection; the TTU University Archives; The Sowell Family Collection in Literature, Community, and the Natural World; the Crossroads of Music Archive; and our oral history, audio/visual, and Rare Books Collections have provided items for our exhibit, “Raiders of the Lost Archive.” Our neighbors, The Remnant Trust, Inc. and the Vietnam Center and Archive, have also chipped in with their own artifacts. The items on display have rarely, if ever, been exhibited. They remind us that archival and special collections are more than pieces of paper filed away in boxes. They are also the unique, tangible evidence of a person’s existence; how they lived, how they thought, and how we all remember them. ANNOUNCEMENTS Ongoing The Marc Reisner collection is now open for research.
