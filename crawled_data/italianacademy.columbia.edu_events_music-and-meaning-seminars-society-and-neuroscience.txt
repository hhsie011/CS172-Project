Patel Professor of Psychology, Tufts University Elizabeth Tolbert Professor of Musicology, Peabody Institute, Johns Hopkins University Moderators: Andrew Goldman Presidential Scholar in Society and Neuroscience, Columbia University Jacqueline Gottlieb Professor of Neuroscience, Columbia University The extraordinary power of music to communicate complex emotions and thoughts has fascinated scholars for centuries. Music taps into cognitive mechanisms that govern our daily interactions with the world, such as expectations and violations of these expectations, and appears to have much in common with language. In addition, music plays social and ethical functions that can be understood from philosophical, historical, and cultural perspectives. Sponsors: Presidential Scholars in Society and Neuroscience program as part of the Seminars in Society and Neuroscience series; the Italian Academy for Advanced Studies.
