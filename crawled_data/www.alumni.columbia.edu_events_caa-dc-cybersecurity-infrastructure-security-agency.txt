Therefore it is paramount to have a frontline research and operations team to coordinate and enhance our defense. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is that organization, and it is our privilege to have its Executive Assistant Director for Infrastructure Security Dr. David Mussington discuss how CISA is tackling the major cyber/infrastructure security issues the USA is currently facing, and how it plans to bridge the divide between private technology firms and the Federal government to develops tools. He will share his perspective on the future of our digital lives and work in a global and more hostile world, and how it can be made inclusive and safe. And for those interested in rolling up their sleeves and joining the technological forefront of our cyber defense, he will discuss careers at CISA.
