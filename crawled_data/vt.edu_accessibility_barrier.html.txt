Our goal is to facilitate solutions to verified barriers as quickly as possible. The exact time to resolve the issue will vary based on the complexity of any fixes required. Also, because the ability to report a digital barrier is a new service, the resolution time may vary based on demand, which is difficult to estimate at this point. We appreciate your patience while we strive to increase access.
