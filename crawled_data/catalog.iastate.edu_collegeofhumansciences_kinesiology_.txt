Through discovery, learning and engagement we improve the lives of citizens of Iowa, the United States and the world. Goals The department has identified the following goals to support this mission: We seek to improve the lives of citizens of Iowa, the United States, and the world by the creation and dissemination of knowledge about physical activity and its relationship to health and well-being. We prepare scholars and professionals in the study of physical activity at the undergraduate and graduate levels. We educate the public and the University community in the scientific aspects of physical activity especially exercise, sport, and the role of movement throughout the lifespan. UNDERGRADUATE STUDY The Department of Kinesiology offers a Bachelor of Science degree in Kinesiology & Health. The undergraduate curriculum major/option is comprised of three components: general education, required departmental courses and the major/option courses. The intent of the general education component is to promote intellectual and personal growth and to prepare students for success in the basic, advanced and major/option components. Required courses provide an introduction to the field and fundamental principles of physical activity, fitness, health and disease. B.S. degree in Kinesiology & Health The Kinesiology & Health major includes five specialization options. Options comprise a focused area of study within Kinesiology and Health. Coursework within each specialization option builds upon personal and scholarly learning by enabling students to master content and skills specific to career applications. Options available are: Community and Public Health Exercise Science Physical Activity and Health Promotion Physical Education Teacher Education Pre-Health Professions Academic options within the Kinesiology & Health major Students in the Community and Public Health option are prepared for professional employment at local, state or national health agencies, medical centers, and other public or private organizations that seek to promote health in the population. Students in the Exercise Science option are prepared for professional roles as health and fitness leaders or program managers. Employment opportunities include work in corporate fitness programs, health/fitness facilities, clinics, or hospitals. Graduates are able to plan, implement and supervise exercise programs which will improve fitness and health. Graduates also have a basic understanding of management issues related to business applications in the health and fitness field. Students in the Physical Activity and Health Promotion option are prepared for careers focused on health and physical activity. This option provides more emphasis on behavioral and psychological aspects of physical activity. Students are prepared for careers in community based settings, including work sites, schools, hospitals, and other community agencies. Students in the Physical Education/Teacher Education option are prepared to teach physical education in grades K-12 and to meet the State of Iowa learning outcomes for teachers. Graduates can plan developmentally appropriate physical education, and individualize instruction and assessment for diverse audiences. Students in the Pre-Health Professions option utilize an interdisciplinary approach to the study of human movement. In so doing, they become prepared for graduate study in Kinesiology or advanced study leading to careers in medicine, physical therapy, physician assistant or other healthcare professions. Student Learning Outcomes for the Undergraduate Degree Despite the diversity of options, the learning outcomes comprise a common framework for each student as they progress through Iowa State University. The learning outcomes emphasized in academic coursework in the Department of Kinesiology are: COMMUNICATION Uses clear and effective written, oral, visual, and electronic (WOVE) communication techniques to foster inquiry, collaboration, and engagement in physical activity and health related settings.

Health Coach Certificate Students pursuing a bachelor's degree in kinesiology can seek additional credentials through the Health Coach Certificate. More information on the certificate can be found at: Health Coach Certificate. The Kinesiology Department offers two concurrent undergraduate and graduate programs. B.S./M.A.T.R. degree in Athletic Training Certified Athletic Trainers are allied medical health professionals who specialize in the prevention, assessment, treatment and rehabilitation of injuries to athletes and physically active individuals who are engaged in physical and athletic activities. To gain certification, candidates must graduate from a CAATE accredited athletic training education program and successfully pass the Board of Certification (BOC) examination. In addition to BOC certification, many states also have licensure requirements to practice athletic training. The Athletic Training program at Iowa State University, accredited since 2001 has transitioned to the new M.A.T.R. degree program, which includes various athletic training clinical rotations including high school, physical therapy clinics, surgical observation experiences, and emergency room observation. More information on the B.S./M.A.T.R. degree in Athletic Training. B.S./M.S. DEGREE IN DIET AND EXERCISE A combined Bachelor of Science and Master of Science (B.S./M.S.) degree in Diet and Exercise is available. The program is jointly administered by the Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition (FS HN), and the Department of Kinesiology. Students interested in this program must enroll as freshmen in the Pre-Diet and Exercise program. In the fall of the junior year, students will apply for admission to the B.S./M.S. program. Students not accepted into the program will continue toward completion of a B.S. degree in Dietetics or Kinesiology & Health. Coursework has been designed to facilitate a 4-year graduation date for those students not accepted into the program and electing to complete a single undergraduate degree. Students accepted into the program will progress toward completion of B.S./M.S. degrees in Diet and Exercise. More information can be found at: https://fshn.hs.iastate.edu/find-your-major/diet-and-exercise/ Graduate Study The Department of Kinesiology graduate program seeks to integrate discovery and learning by preparing graduate students to understand and create basic and applied knowledge in the study of physical activity, exercise and sport. The normal prerequisite to major graduate work is the satisfactory completion of a curriculum essentially equivalent to that required of undergraduate students in kinesiology at this university. However, it is possible for students to qualify for graduate study if undergraduate preparation has been in a related area. Students in the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees are required to complete original research and write a thesis or dissertation. There is a non-thesis degree option for M.S. students requiring more coursework and an internship experience or other creative component. Specific information about the requirements for these degree options is available from the department office or from the department web site (http://www.kin.hs.iastate.edu/graduate). Every effort has been made to make the catalog accurate as of the date of publication.
