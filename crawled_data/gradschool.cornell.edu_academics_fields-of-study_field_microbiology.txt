Most of the laboratories used by the field have been recently built or renovated, and a broad range of instrumentation is available for work in all aspects of microbiology and molecular biology. One semester of teaching is required for Ph.D. degree candidates.

Chang Campus: Ithaca Concentrations: Microbiology: microbiology Research Interests: The overall theme of our research is to understand how the host immune system is regulated by the gut microbiota through their secretion of small molecule metabolites. Our research focuses primarily on two areas: (1) the identification of metabolites produced by the gut microbiota that regulate the host immune system and, building on these discoveries, (2) the development of chemical tools to modulate the immune response. We employ biological and chemical approaches including the tools of molecular and cellular immunology, microbiology, chemical biology, chemistry, biochemistry, and cell biology to elucidate key communication pathways between the gut microbiota and the host immune system. Our ultimate goal is to understand how immune homeostasis is maintained in the intestines, as such discoveries would have broad implications for the development of therapeutics and prophylactics for many inflammatory diseases.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
