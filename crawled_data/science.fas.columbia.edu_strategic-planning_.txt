This strategic plan is the result of collaboration among the nine departments and invited input from the entire science faculty in Arts and Sciences – it was created by and for the faculty of Columbia’s natural sciences. Each department documented its own individual strengths, needs, and specific priorities, and the overall plan is built on the strategies outlined by each department. It has been designed to meet our collective needs with a comprehensive set of priorities, actions, and measures of success over the next decade that will build upon our existing strengths and lead Columbia to scientific preeminence.
