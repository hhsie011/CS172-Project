If your school uses an alternate scale, please contact your school for instructions. How to Calculate Your GPA (standard A-F scale only) 1. Convert each grade into its numeric equivalent using the chart below. A+ = 4.33 A = 4.00 A- = 3.67 B+ = 3.33 B = 3.00 B- = 2.67 C+ = 2.33 C = 2.00 C- = 1.67 D+ = 1.33 D = 1.00 D- = 0.67 F = 0.00 2. Multiply each class grade by the number of credits earned. For example: 3.0 (grade) x 4.0 (credits) = 12. 3. Divide this number by total credits attempted. This is your GPA. Please note: "Pass" grades have no GPA value.
