Faculty also serve the dual role of being co-workers and employees as well. In this section we hope to provide faculty members with the resources to support their co-workers, students, and each other.

How do I recognize if one of my employees is in need of help and/or resources? Click to expand Crises like COVID-19 impact the well-being of all employees. Some individuals with mental health diagnoses may experience an increase in symptoms, and other individuals experience a new mental health diagnosis, such as anxiety or depression as a result of COVID-19. A supervisor may be the first individual to recognize that an employee needs help. The list below provides some examples of behaviors that may indicate an employee is having a difficult time. This list is not intended to be exhaustive nor should it be used to diagnose a behavioral health issue. Only mental health professionals are qualified to provide a diagnosis.
