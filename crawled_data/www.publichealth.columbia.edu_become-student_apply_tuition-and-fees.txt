Notations *Health Insurance: Although charges are applied per semester to match financial aid awards, the Aetna insurance and SHS contract are for the entire contract policy (12 months from August 15, 2022 to August 14, 2023). A change in status (from full time to part time or taking a leave) will not release students from spring charges. If you are less than half-time in the Spring, you will still be charged medical insurance during the semester. Students covered by comparable medical insurance of their own may elect to waive this fee. Waiver forms can be found on the Student Health Service website. 2021-2022 Tuition & Fees Per Academic Offering MPH Full Time Tuition & Fees MPH Full Time Program length: Two years First Year tuition: $42,208** Fees: $6,297 **Anticipated 3% increase for flat rate and per point tuition for 2022-2023 Academic Year MPH Accelerated/Dual/4+1 Program length: Two semesters First Year tuition: $66,464** Fees: $6,297 **Anticipated 3% increase for flat rate and per point tuition for 2022-2023 Academic Year MHA Part Time Program length: Five semesters or more First Year tuition: $33,876** (18 credits based on per credit cost of $1,882) Fees: $1,491 **Anticipated 3% increase for flat rate and per point tuition for 2022-2023 Academic Year MS Full Time 30 credits ($1,882 per point) Program length: Two semesters First Year tuition: $56,460** Fees: $8,297 **Anticipated 3% increase for flat rate and per point tuition for 2022-2023 Academic Year MS Biostatistics Full Time 37 credits ($1,882 per point) Program length: Four semesters First Year tuition: $45,168** Fees: $6,297 **Anticipated 3% increase for flat rate and per point tuition for 2022-2023 Academic Year MS Epidemiology Online $1,882 per point Program length: Five semesters First Year tuition: $33,876** Fees: $1,441 **Anticipated 3% increase for flat rate and per point tuition for 2022-2023 Academic Year Understanding Fees For a breakdown and explanation of fees, please visit our Tuition and Fees page.
