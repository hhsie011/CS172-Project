ICL’s fundamental strength is Information Science, a discipline that investigates the properties and behavior of information, the forces governing the flow of information, and the means of processing information for optimum accessibility and usability. ICL has broad and deep capabilities across the data science hierarchy of needs and our key areas of research focus on systems that adapt to their operational environment, as well as scalable enterprise system modernization and transformation. Core research areas include software defined radio frequency systems, communications electronic warfare, 5G, spectrum analytics, RF propagation modeling, embedded software, high performance computing, interoperable data infrastructure, trust, analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning, information science, decision support systems, and enterprise applications. ICL conducts research that solves complex problems for range of sponsors, including defense, health, intelligence, justice and the state of Georgia. ICL’s strategy to enable research has two components: expand fundamental capabilities, innovative applications, and integration into our current major research activities; and strategically grow major application areas. Fundamental capabilities, innovative applications, and integration: Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning Distributed training and inferencing algorithms Advanced Computing High performance heterogeneous edge computing Strategic application areas: Edge Intelligence Convergence of communications, computing, control, localization and sensing Intelligent networks and spectrum operations for communications Device-edge-cloud AI architectures Real-time AI on massive distributed small data Health Information extraction from diverse data types Integrated biomedical sensors Real-time diagnostic and treatment progression aids Digital Transformation Analytics and AI use case framework Workforce upskilling Trust, interoperability, and data modernization Sensors, mobile and cloud to edge architectures Joint All Domain Battle Management Edge intelligence and digital transformation of battlespace This Laboratory's Focus Areas Advanced Computing and Artificial Intelligence Advanced Computing and Artificial Intelligence Communications Systems and Spectrum Communications Systems and Spectrum Health Emerging and Advanced Technologies Health Emerging and Advanced Technologies Software Engineering and Analytics Software Engineering and Analytics Trusted Interoperable Systems and Architecture Trusted Interoperable Systems and Architecture Related Initiatives 5G Lab 5G Lab Army Family Web Portal (AFWP) Army Family Web Portal (AFWP) All Payer Claim Database All Payer Claim Database Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Center for Health Analytics & Informatics (CHAI) Center for Health Analytics & Informatics (CHAI) FalconView FalconView ICEHAMMER ICEHAMMER National Information Exchange Model (NIEM) National Information Exchange Model (NIEM) Trustmark Trustmark STEM@GTRI STEM@GTRI Laboratory Director Laboratory Director, ICL Jeffrey Sitterle Have a question?
