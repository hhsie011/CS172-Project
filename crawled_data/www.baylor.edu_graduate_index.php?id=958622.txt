Fellowships Post-Doctoral Teaching Fellowship The Graduate School with the support of the Provost’s Office and in collaboration with the College of Arts and Sciences and the Honors College, is pleased to announce the early launch of the Postdoctoral Teaching Fellowship Program. Seven postdoctoral teaching fellowship positions will be available for 2022-2023: three continuing within the English department (launched in Fall 2020), and four additional fellows for 2021-2022--three in College of Arts and Sciences and one in the Honors College These one-year positions will include a salary of $40,000, continued access to Graduate School travel funds, additional mentoring through the Graduate School, inclusion in the Graduate School Mock Interviews and professional development training, and the same health benefits as Baylor faculty. Summer Dissertation Fellowship Doctoral students who will be actively writing during summer months should apply for this competitive fellowship. Fellows receive funding support for summer months with no work requirement other than writing progress. Mc Nair Doctoral Fellowship Program The McNair Doctoral Fellowship is a 5 year non-work related fellowship available to PhD students. Current McNair Scholars and Alumni who enroll in one of Baylor's traditional PhD programs are eligible to apply. Doctoral Administrative Fellows Doctoral Administrative Fellows are a select group of doctoral students who play an integral role in the Graduate School. The fellowships allow students to gain administrative experience and a distinct perspective on the university’s operations while serving the Graduate School and their peers. Baptist College and University Scholars This program seeks to strengthen ties among IABCU member schools by identifying Baptist College and University Scholars from Ph.D. or MFA programs. To be eligible for the BCU Scholars Program, students must have graduated from a school that is a member of the IABCU. Upon invitation and acceptance to the BCU Scholars program, graduate students have the opportunity to participate in symposiums, retreats, the IABCU annual meeting, events conducted each semester, and the Schmeltekopf Fellowship for Educational Leadership. Baptist Scholars International Roundtable (BSIR) BSIR promotes scholarship from Baptist perspectives across the ages and around the globe by facilitating a scholarly forum for exchange of ideas. This community is international, intergenerational, interdisciplinary, and invites a diversity of Baptist affiliations. At the heart of the Roundtable is formation for academic stewardship in which a newer generation is welcomed into an international Baptist Academy and formed to preserve and sustain both academic and faith communities. Awards Outstanding Dissertation Award The highest research award available among the Baylor graduate community. Graduate Program Directors both nominate dissertations and score the nominations. Three are awarded each year. Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor Award Competitive graduate student award that recognizes excellence in teaching for our TORs (teachers-of-record). Six are awarded each year. Outstanding Graduate Research Award The Outstanding Research award is awarded six times annually with the goal of promoting the research productivity of graduate students within STEM, Social Sciences, and Humanities. Travel Awards The Graduate School is eager to support students and their original research through two kinds of travel support: Travel to Professional Meetings and Travel to Support Doctoral Research.
