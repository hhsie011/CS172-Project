We are moving forward with a boldly ambitious plan for our future that holds the promise of significant impact in the region, nation, globe—and with an outreach to space. We will accomplish through a confluence of industry partnership, specialized research, and a thriving South Florida entrepreneurial ecosystem. We will educate the next generation of engineers to solve existing and as-yet-unimagined problems. These thrusts will be developed collaboratively with faculty from other schools and colleges, as well as with corporate partners. The following chart illustrates how individual Departments and their clusters support the College-wide Thrusts: Through the Strategic Initiatives, some of the “big” questions that we will answer include: Engineer better health, through research into and development of cutting-edge materials, devices, systems, and data analytics to support advances in medicine and public health. Reverse and mitigate, and adapt to the effects of climate change aided by technological innovations, through research and discovery that leads to workable solutions for air and water quality, sea level rise, and more resilient and sustainable environments. Unlock the potential of outer space to improve our condition on Earth, through research focused on aerodynamics, astrodynamics, propulsion, advanced materials and environmental technologies, satellite imaging, and related areas. Develop sustainable habitats in extraterrestrial environments to sustain life Cyberphysical “smart” systems that will use our knowledge and innovations to integrate sensing, computation, control and networking into the natural and engineered environment to obtain and operate smart systems The College of Engineering is working on the following strategic thrusts consisting of advanced research areas and cross cutting initiatives: Advanced Materials Data Sciences and Engineering Energy and Environment Health Care Engineering Space Sciences and Engineering Sustainability and Resilience Innovation and Entrepreneurship Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning International Alliance Corporate Affiliates Program University of Miami Coral Gables, FL 33124 305-284-2211 College of Engineering 1251 Memorial Drive, McArthur Engineering Building Coral Gables, FL 33146 (305) 284-2404 (305) 284-2404 Resources About UM myUM CaneLink Academic Calendar Blackboard UM Network Alumni Association Medical Center Hurricane Sports Employment Opportunities Support COE Give to COE Ways to Give Visit Campus Map Parking & Transportation Connect social-facebook social-twitter social-youtube social-instagram Copyright: 2022 University of Miami.
