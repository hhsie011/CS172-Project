The Bioarchaeology of Agricultural Transitions: Case Studies from Southeastern Europe The presentation will review recent advances in bioarchaeological research in connection to forager-farmer transition processes in southeastern Europe. The majority of data come from the Danube Gorges area between present-day Romania and Serbia, where more than 500 human individuals were uncovered at several known archaeological sites. These osteological collections provide an important source of material for increasingly sophisticated bioarchaeological approaches, such as multi-isotopes studies in conjunction with radiocarbon dating, identification of starches in dental calculus, aDNA research, or cementochronology. Bioarchaeological evidence linked to agricultural transitions from other areas of the Balkans will also be considered.
