The task force, along with President’s office, engaged with students, faculty, staff, alumni and members of the community. The task force was impressed by the passion and commitment with which each organization and their members approached this task. The importance of this issue to the Clemson community is evident. The feedback received was thoughtful, creative and reflected the need to tell our full and complete history. We want to thank everyone who participated in the process and provided their input. Your feedback was invaluable and is central to the task force’s recommendations. While the work of the task force is complete, we want to make it clear that this represents the beginning, not the end, of the mission to tell the complete history of Clemson University.
