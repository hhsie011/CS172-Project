The conference—organized by Reset Dialogues on Civilizations with the Centro Studi Americani in Rome and Columbia's Italian Academy—will take place on two days in Rome, at the Centro Studi Americani; international speakers will be invited to join by Zoom video. Simultaneous interpretation (English/Italian, Italian/English) will be provided throughout. In today's democracies, conflict continues unabated over the correct policy responses to everything from the Covid-19 pandemic to economic inequality and ethnic diversity. In the United States in particular, this conflict has sown profound divisions between figures in the staunch two-party system, which are not only political but have taken on a distinctly cultural hue. The extreme result of this cultural polarization may yet be the delegitimization of the world’s most famous democracy. See speaker bios here.
