The four years of teaching must be completed within eight years after you complete or otherwise cease to be enrolled in the program for which you received a TEACH Grant. If you receive a grant but do not complete the required four years of teaching service within the given time-frame, or otherwise do not meet the requirements for the TEACH Grant Program, all the grant funds will be converted to a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan. You will have to repay this loan in full which includes interest. Once the TEACH Grant is converted to a loan it cannot be converted back to a grant.
