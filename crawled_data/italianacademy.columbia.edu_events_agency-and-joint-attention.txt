The gathering, held in the Academy's Library, focused on the antecedents and the development of the cognitive skills of agency and joint attention. The conference participants were a diverse group of scholars who investigate these issues from a variety of perspectives. Some have argued for the uniqueness of agency and joint attention in humans while others believe that some of the precursors of these skills exist in non-human primates.
