The Kinseys will be back at FSU Panama City for the closing! Stay tuned for more information about events during closing week, Monday, July 25, through Thursday, July 28 (final day). Bernard Kinsey and his wife, Shirley, cultivated the Kinsey Collection for more than 40 years, and their son, Khalil, now serves as chief operating officer and curator of the collection. The Kinseys see themselves as “caretakers” of the art and artifacts that convey a significant part of the American story through African American paintings, sculptures, manuscripts, rare books, and documents — from a bronze bust of Frederick Douglass to letters by Malcolm X and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Primary source historical objects and artifacts date from 1595 to the present day, and artwork dates to 1865, painting a clearer picture of African American’s triumphs despite overwhelming obstacles.
