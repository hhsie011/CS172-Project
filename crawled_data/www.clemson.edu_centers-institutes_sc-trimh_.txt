Our primary mission is to develop a new generation of NIH-funded investigators by providing the intellectual expertise needed for one-on-one and group mentoring opportunities to early-stage and/or new investigators, financial support for investigators to obtain preliminary data and research infrastructure, through dedicated scientific cores, necessary for investigators to be successful in competing for NIH research awards. The Center is led by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in physics, material science, computing, bioengineering, public health, data sciences, bioinformatics, biology, and medicine, thereby coalescing resources and disciplines from Clemson University School of Health Research (CUSHR) and allied with the Prisma Health System and the Medical University of South Carolina. The center leverages Clemson University’s seminal history in medical device and therapeutics research, computational modeling expertise, and “smart” biosensor advanced fabrication and manufacturing technologies, to provide a unique platform for performing translational research. A primary focus of the center is the concept of “Virtual Human Trials” in which the timeline from the discovery of ideas in the laboratory to when they are deployed as therapeutic strategies is considerably reduced by employing multi-scale, multi-physics computational modeling strategies to more accurately and rapidly focus on winning therapeutic candidates. SC TRIMH welcomes the addition of new participants who wish to join the center to assist us in creating a critical mass and community of investigators, at Clemson and across the state, that will accelerate the rate of discoveries in musculoskeletal and related health.
