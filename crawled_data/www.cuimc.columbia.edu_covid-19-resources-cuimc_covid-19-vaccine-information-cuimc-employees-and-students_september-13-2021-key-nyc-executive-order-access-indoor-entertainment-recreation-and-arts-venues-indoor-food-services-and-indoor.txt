Under this mandate, Columbia is required to check proof of vaccination (and identification) in order for you to enter these settings. The same will be true throughout New York City. Please note that the University is now required to ensure that you have shown proof of your vaccination record to enter indoor spaces like the following illustrative examples (but this is not an all-inclusive list): Entertainment and Recreation (compliance of those individuals teaching or attending lecture classes in these venues will be checked only via the CU Green Pass system) Miller Theatre The Lenfest Center for the Arts Schapiro Black Box Theatre Lenfest Center for the Arts Wallach Art Gallery LeRoy Neiman Gallery Food Services (upon resumption of indoor dining — please note that you can still participate in the current grab-and-go arrangements without proof of vaccination) John Jay Dining Hall JJ’s Place Faculty House CUIMC Faculty Club Café 212 Joe Coffee locations on campus Nous Espresso Bar Brownie’s Café Uris Deli Gyms and Fitness Dodge Physical Fitness Center Baker Athletics Complex 50 Haven Athletics Complex The good news is with a fully vaccinated campus, it should be a relatively straightforward process to comply with these new rules. You may notice new signs in these settings, and you will receive more information about the required steps in each location. Acceptable proof of vaccination for purposes of Key to NYC includes any of the following listed below (a photo or photocopy of the listed documentation is acceptable): CDC Vaccination Card NYC or other official immunization record from within or outside the US where your vaccine was administered NYS Excelsior Pass or Excelsior Pass Plus NYC COVID Safe Pass Please remember that in addition to proof of vaccination, individuals will be required to show their green pass, have their Columbia ID card, and wear a mask throughout their visit. For additional information regarding the mandate, please visit Key to NYC Guidance.
