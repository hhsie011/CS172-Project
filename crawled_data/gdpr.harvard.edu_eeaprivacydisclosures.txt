These small data files or graphic files serve various functions: Strictly Necessary: Necessary to deliver our services; Performance and Functionality: Enhance the performance and functionality of our services but are non-essential to their use; Analytics and Customization: Allow us to understand the effectiveness of our services and marketing campaigns, as well as to customize our services based on this information; or Advertising: Make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. You can control the use of certain cookies and similar technologies by: Opting out of targeted online advertising through advertising networks (please visithttp://www.aboutads.info/choices/, http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!/ or http://www.youronlinechoices.com for more information); Setting or amending your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies (please visit your browser’s help menu for more information).

Your Rights Upon your reasonable, good faith request we will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your Personal Data as part of our GDPR Processing Activities, to the extent required by and in accordance with applicable law. In certain cases, you may also have a right, with respect to your Personal Data collected and used in the GDPR Processing Activities, to: correct or update any of your Personal Data that is inaccurate; restrict or limit the ways in which we use your Personal Data; object to the processing of your Personal Data; request the deletion of your Personal Data; and obtain a copy of your Personal Data in an easily accessible format. To submit a request, please send an email message to EEADataSubjectRequest@harvard.edu. Because we want to avoid taking action regarding your Personal Data at the direction of someone other than you, we will ask you for information verifying your identity. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe. Subject to certain legal limits, you also have the right to withdraw your consent to our processing of your Personal Data as part of our GDPR Processing Activities, where our processing is solely based on your consent. In some cases, you can do this by discontinuing use of the services involved in the GDPR Processing Activities. This would include by closing all of your online accounts with us and contacting us at EEADataSubjectRequest@harvard.edu to request that your Personal Data be deleted. If you withdraw your consent to the use or sharing of your Personal Data for the purposes set out in these Disclosures or the other Harvard privacy statements that link to or expressly adopt these Disclosures, you may not have access to some or all of the related services, and we might not be able to provide you some or all of the services. Please note that, in certain cases, we may continue to process your Personal Data after you have withdrawn consent and requested that we delete your Personal Data, if we have a legal basis to do so. For example, we may retain certain data if we need to do so to comply with an independent legal obligation, if we still need the data for the lawful purposes for which we obtained the data, or if it is necessary to do so to pursue our legitimate interest in keeping our services and operations safe and secure or to safeguard our rights or the rights or safety of others. If you have any complaints regarding our privacy practices, you have the right to make a complaint with your national data protection authority (i.e., supervisory authority). F. User Generated Content Some of our online activities, such as listservs, chat rooms and bulletin boards, enable users to submit their own content. Please remember that any Personal Data you submit or post as user-generated content in these circumstances could in some cases be seen by others or become public. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal, financial or other information in such submissions or posts. We cannot prevent others from using that information in a manner that may violate these Disclosures, the law or your personal privacy and safety. We are not responsible for the results of such postings. G.
