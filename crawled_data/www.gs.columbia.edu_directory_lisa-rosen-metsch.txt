Previously, she was the Chair and Stephen Smith Professor of Sociomedical Sciences at the Mailman School of Public Health, and is an internationally-recognized scholar in the prevention of HIV among populations with substance use disorders. For the past two decades, Dr. Rosen-Metsch's research program has been continuously funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. She was one of the early researchers in the era of antiretroviral therapy to articulate the importance of creating prevention/primary care programs for people living with HIV, not simply those at risk of infection. She also was part of the multi-site team funded by the CDC that developed and tested the first evidence-based linkage to care intervention for individuals who were newly diagnosed with HIV. Dr. Rosen-Metsch's current work focuses on developing innovative strategies to increase the uptake of testing, linkage, retention, and re-engagement in care among vulnerable populations. Her landmark research has resulted in more than 200 peer-reviewed publications and has helped shape national policy and intervention programs. Prior to joining the Mailman School, Dr. Rosen-Metsch was Professor of Epidemiology at the University of Miami’s Miller School of Medicine, where she served as director of the Division of Health Services Research and Policy, with secondary appointments in the Departments of Medicine and Sociology. Dr. Rosen-Metsch is also a GS alumna, having graduated from the Joint Degree Program with List College of the Jewish Theological Seminary.
