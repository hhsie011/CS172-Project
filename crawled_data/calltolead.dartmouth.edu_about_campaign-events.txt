About Strategic Priorities Campaign Leadership Campaign Events Your Invitation to Change the World An Important Update About the Canada Global Summit After much thought and careful consultation with Dartmouth’s leadership and our Canada Alumni Regional Committee, we have decided to postpone Dartmouth at 250: The Canada Global Summit, scheduled to take place April 3-5 in Toronto. We do not undertake the change lightly, but the health and well-being of our community (in Canada, Hanover, and around the “girdled earth”) is our greatest concern. We looked forward to a once-in-a-century opportunity to bring the Big Green to Canada, but rest assured that our team is already working to reschedule the Canada Summit for this coming fall or next spring. We will update the website as new information becomes available. If you have questions, please contact us at globalsummit@dartmouth.edu.
