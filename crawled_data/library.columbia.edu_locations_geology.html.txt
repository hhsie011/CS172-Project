Library services (including the reserves collection) supporting students, faculty, and researchers will be relocated to the Science & Engineering Library in the Northwest Corner Building. Print materials from the Geology collection will be available by request from the library catalog. The Geology Library's collection is particularly strong in the areas of traditional terrestrial geology. Extensive collections of state and foreign geological surveys and societies go back to the 18th century. For questions about the Geology Library closing, our Geology Collections, or our related services, please email us at geology@library.columbia.edu. Services for Lamont Users Library services supporting LDEO students, faculty and researchers will continue from the Morningside campus with a courier service delivering library materials to a pickup shelf located in room 106 Geoscience (DEES Office) on the Lamont campus. The courier service will deliver on Tuesdays and Fridays. Library materials may also be returned via a drop-off box in the same location. For further details click here.
