The event will be held in English and is translated simultaneously into Arabic. With the rise of fake news and misinformation, it can feel as if people are more divided than ever before. But in reality, most people fall in one of two camps: the “exhausted majority,” who wants to avoid rumor-mongering and fake news, and the “angry few,” who play an outsized role in spreading it far and wide. This talk will describe how fake news and misinformation came to dominate the digital experience and briefly describe tools and tactics we can use to detect, deflect, and distance ourselves from the damage inflicted by the fake news phenomenon. Speaker: Alexis Wichowski: ALEXIS WICHOWSKI is the deputy chief technology officer for the City of New York, and an adjunct professor of technology, media, and communications at Columbia University. A widely recognized technology expert, Wichowski spent the past two decades working at the intersection of technology, media, and government, most recently at the State Department and the United Nations.
