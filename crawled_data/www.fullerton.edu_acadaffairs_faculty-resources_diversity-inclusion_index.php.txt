This work has been occurring now for two years, and you can find archived updates here. We group this under climate, professoriate, and faculty success. However, all of these elements feed each other and so are not separable. Note that the work detailed here happens across our many college and AVP portfolios and are the result of collaborations and leadership from staff, faculty, students, and administrators. Please share feedback with me so we can continue this journey towards the institution we seek to become. Best Wishes, Carolyn Thomas, Ph.D. Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs Equity Pedagogy Module Interested in learning more about equitable teaching practices?
