Refer to your TV owner's manual for specific instructions for your set. Connect the TV to the cable wall jack using a coaxial cable. If the TV has more than one input jack, select the one labeled "CABLE" or "CATV". Your television must have a Qam tuner to receive HD and Digital signal. Refer to your televisionâ€™s specifications to confirm. Plug the TV power cord into an electrical outlet and power on the TV. Connect one end of the coaxial cable cord into the cable TV outlet in the wall, and connect the other end into the back of the television. If your TV has cable signal auto-detection, it will automatically pick up the cable channel lineup. If your TV does not have this function, you will need to set your TV to receive cable channels as described below. Configure your set to receive CABLE or CATV signals. This is usually accessed through a MENU or SETUP option on the TV's remote control. Switch from Air or Antenna to Cable/Catv. Refer to your TV owner's manual for specific directions for your set. Program the TV to receive channels. This is usually accessed through the same MENU or SETUP option used above. Locate an option labeled AUTO-PROGRAM (ch memory, ch scan) and select it. The TV will search through all channels and program the working channels. Refer to your TV owner's manual for specific directions for your set. Your TV should now receive all on-campus channels!
