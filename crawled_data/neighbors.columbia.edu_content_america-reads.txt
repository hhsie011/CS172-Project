The program partners with local elementary schools with the goal of ensuring that all children are reading at grade level. Community Impact is one of 1,200 chapters at colleges and universities nationwide, improving literacy at three public schools, P.S. 125, P.S. 192 and P.S. 76, in the Morningside Heights and West Harlem communities. Daytime in-class assistance and after school one-on-one tutoring are provided for students in grades K-5. Tutors also seek to nurture the value and joy of learning through mentorship and organize weekly educational field trips around the city. Volunteers can choose to work one session per week (2 hours with travel) or several sessions per week for one year. Columbia University Irving Medical Center's Office of Government & Community Affair and Office of Student Financial Services-Federal Work Study are also collaborative partners serving the Washington Heights community.
