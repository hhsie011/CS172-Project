Alternately, it is a stand-alone option for students seeking positions in museums, galleries, non-profits, and other institutions. The M.A. in Art History offers an optional concentration in Arts Management, which provides a specialized degree pathway for students seeking to advance artists, art, and audiences by becoming cultural organizers and leaders. Students learn to engage the forces that shape the visual arts landscape by aligning their operations and programs with their mission and values. In addition to Art History requirements, core courses in the Arts Management track build professional practice skills, awareness of the history of the field, and perspectives on its future across a range of institutional models. A number of resources are available at Temple to Art History M.A. students: The Loretta C. Duckworth Scholars Studio (formerly the Digital Scholarship Center) in Charles Library offers opportunities for research in the digital humanities with high-end computing and visualization resources, a virtual reality studio, collaboration spaces, and 3-D printing and media-capture capabilities. Temple Contemporary, Tyler’s innovative exhibitions and public programs space, offers opportunities to learn curatorial practice. Expansive, world-class art and architecture buildings provide direct access to all aspects of the creative process via fellow students and faculty artists and designers. State-of-the-art digital resources include 8,000 digital images and access to millions more via Tyler’s Artstor Digital Library membership. Tyler’s art history community is enriched by a steady stream of compelling lectures by leading scholars and practitioners. Tyler graduate students in Art History may participate in Temple University’s Teaching in Higher Education certificate program to gain advanced training for a career in higher education or in the Cultural Analytics graduate certificate program offered by Duckworth Scholars Studio. Time Limit for Degree Completion: 3 years, although the degree is designed to be completed full-time in two years Campus Location: Main Full-Time/Part-Time Status: The degree program can be completed on a full- or part-time basis. Study Abroad: Many Tyler Art History graduate students take advantage of research opportunities at Temple University Rome and Temple’s Japan Campus in Tokyo, both among the oldest and largest facilities of their type. Other opportunities exist elsewhere around the globe as guided by faculty members' extensive connections. Accreditation: This degree program is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD). Non-Matriculated Student Policy: Non-matriculated students must contact the Graduate Director for information. Financing Opportunities: In keeping with Temple University’s commitment to access and affordability, Tyler’s graduate programs offer a competitive level of tuition with some opportunities for financial support. Rates are set annually and are affected by many factors, including in-state or out-of-state residency. For more information, contact the Graduate Director or the Associate Graduate Director for Arts Management, as applicable, and explore Temple’s graduate student financial information page. Eligible graduate students are encouraged to apply for work study.

Culminating Events: Qualifying Paper: For the research-focused master's degree, students enroll in ARTH 9995. The qualifying paper engages the student in acquiring an understanding of how to conduct research using primary and secondary sources; a knowledge of art history that is rooted in historical, cultural, stylistic, and ethical analysis; and the skills to write critical evaluations of artwork in their historical, cultural, and stylistic contexts. Selection of the research project requires the approval of the student’s primary advisor, who is chosen by the end of a student's first year of study. The primary advisor guides the student in writing the qualifying paper, which is to be 25-30 pages in length. The qualifying paper entails rethinking, elaboration, and expansion of a research project already composed for a class, with the addition of concentrated research time and/or a different methodological framework to extend the scope of the paper, producing a product that contains original work. The qualifying paper requires the approval of two readers. Internship: The Arts Management concentration requires 6 credits of internship supervised by the Arts Management Concentration Advisor. Three of these credits are taken in the second academic term of study, and three credits are taken in the last academic term concurrent with the required capstone class.
