The pioneering Freshman Research Initiative (FRI) gives first-year students the opportunity to initiate and engage in real-world research experience with faculty and graduate students. Our companion Accelerated Research Initiative (ARI) offers a parallel experience for students not in their first year in college. Our program has become a national model for science education, as students are more likely to stay in college, complete science and math degrees, and graduate better prepared to pursue advanced degrees or jobs in the industry. Launch Pads for Discovery In FRI, undergraduate students explore unanswered questions in science, math, and technology. Over 1000 College of Natural Sciences (CNS) students each year uncover new knowledge and develop innovative technologies in the 35 faculty-led research laboratories here: Students » Faculty » Community » FRI News Undergraduate Research Played Role in Paper Tied to Early Career Award Undergraduate Research Played Role in Paper Tied to Early Career Award Read More Student Employee of the Year Helps Community Through Her Research Student Employee of the Year Helps Community Through Her Research Read More Additional News » Departments & Schools Astronomy Chemistry Computer Science Integrative Biology Marine Science Mathematics Molecular Biosciences Neuroscience Statistics and Data Sciences Physics Human Ecology Human Development and Family Sciences Nutritional Sciences Students Advising Centers Career Services Health Professions Office Honors Office Office for Undergraduate Research Biology Instructional Office Dean's Office College Leadership Strategic Plan Business Services Communications & Events Office of Development Faculty Affairs Information Technology Research & Facilities Undergraduate Education Graduate Education College of Natural Sciences The University of Texas at Austin 120 Inner Campus Dr Stop G2500 Austin, TX 78712 Campus Map » Student Inquiries: 512 471 4536 General Inquiries: 512 471 3285 Login » Sitemap » Help » © Copyright 2019 College of Natural Sciences The University of Texas at Austin Web Privacy Policy Web Accessibility Policy JavaScript is currently disabled.Please enable it for a better experience of Jumi.
