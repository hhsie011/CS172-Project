Its cultural heritage is vast, ranging from luxury objects to papyri and inscriptions, from mosaics to glass, from ivories to marble and from pottery to coins. Starting from concrete typologies of hand-manufactured goods existing in the Ravennate cultural milieu, the conference aims to enlarge its focus on the multifaceted traditions of late antique and early Byzantine handicraft from the fourth to the eighth century CE. Our goal is to consider patronage, social taste, acculturation, workers and the economic industry of production which supported the demand, circulation and distribution of artifacts, rather than evaluating the artistic qualities of the objects themselves.
