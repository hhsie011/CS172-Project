A brief program will begin at 6:30 PM with Interim President Lori Stewart Gonzalez and McConnell Center Director, Gary Gregg. The program will discuss the exciting expansion planned for the McConnell Chao Archives. \nThe Archives will include all the historical documents, papers, and material collected over Senator McConnell’s nearly 40- year career of national and international service in the U.S. Senate, including the last 16 years as Majority and Minority Leader of the Senate. The McConnell Chao Archives will serve as a permanent teaching and research reservoir for scholars, historians, and the public for future generations. After more than four decades of service to Kentucky, this historic collection of McConnell’s career is best served by being located in his hometown and at his alma mater where it can be preserved and used as part of the McConnell Center’s mission of civic education.\nWe hope you will be able to attend the U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell and Secretary Elaine L. Chao Archives Reception on June 23 to learn more about the upcoming expansion. NOTE: Space is limited.\n\nSenator McConnell and Secretary Chao will not be attendance. The McConnell Center is not affiliated with any political party and works hard to maintain its outstanding reputation for nonpartisan educational opportunities. \n LOCATION:University of Louisville UID:1157-8814-44523 END:VEVENT END:VCALENDAR
