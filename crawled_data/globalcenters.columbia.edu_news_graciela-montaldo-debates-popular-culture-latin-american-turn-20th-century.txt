Among other duties, Professor Montaldo came to explore the archives of Instituto Moreira Salles, Brazil's larges private-owned archive, as well as Biblioteca Nacional (Brazilian National Library) archives. Professor Montaldo is interested in the dissemination of modernism, the expansion of Brazil’s culture industry, and the history of editorial decisions, collaborative literary work, and the politics of translation, book markets, canon building, and the internationalization of literature. Dr. Montaldo gave the open lecture " Illustrious travelers: Performance and Literature in Argentine at the end of the 19th Century" at the School of Communication of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). The lecture analyzed a series of visits made by writers and artists from Europe to Argentine in the turn of the 20th century.
