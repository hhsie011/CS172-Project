Students in any discipline whose research develops knowledge about South Asia may apply. Pending university guidelines funds may be used for travel to visit archives or conduct fieldwork where possible, attend conferences virtually or in person, language training, unanticipated research expenses due to COVID-19, or other non-travel efforts to further one's research during these challenging times. It is highly recommended that students review current university travel policies as it may be necessary to submit your travel plans for university review in October or early November, even before the committee has reached a decision about awards. Please reach out to stephanie_abbott@brown.edu with questions. Award: Up to a $3,000 maximum, students may apply for smaller amounts.
