In our society, knowing Spanish is not just an asset; it is increasingly a necessity. The Spanish language program offers a sequence of courses ranging from basic to advanced. Students at all levels develop proficiency in speaking, listening, reading, and writing while also studying the cultures and societies of the contemporary Spanish-speaking world. The Hispanic Literatures and Cultures concentration enables students to develop advanced Spanish skills while acquiring a solid background in the complex history, literatures, cultures, and intellectual traditions of Spain, Latin America, and the Latinx-U.S. The department offers a variety of courses on topics related to literary history and theory; multicultural contact; linguistics and the history of the language; visual culture, film, and performance studies. Interdisciplinarity is a hallmark of the department, and students in this concentration are encouraged to broaden their perspectives by taking relevant courses in other departments. Most choose to strengthen their academic preparation by participating in a study abroad program in Spain or Latin America and by engaging with Latin American and Latinx communities in the United States.
