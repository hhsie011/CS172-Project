It was designed to introduce the field of population genetics. Speakers covered a few ways to summarize genetic variation data, as well as discuss the evolutionary forces that create and shape patterns of genetic variation. This lecture guided students to ask questions such as: What are some simple ways to model patterns of genetic variation? How do more complex evolutionary forces affect patterns of genetic variation? Speakers: - Pr. Ryan Hernandez, Associate Professor, Bioengineering School of Pharmacy at University of California, San Francisco. - Pr. Joseph Terwilliger, Professor, Department of Genetics and Development, Columbia University The course's prominent professors: Pr. Joseph Terwilliger, Pr. Joseph H. Lee, Pr. Ryan Hernandez, Pr. Markus Perola, Pr. Sonia Abdelhak, Pr. Kenneth Weiss and Harald Goring. More information on the free online course can be found here.
