The minor in neuroscience is intended to provide formal recognition for students who have concentrated some of their academic work in the interdisciplinary area of neuroscience. The minor can accommodate majors from all other departments, including Biology. Curriculum The Neuroscience Minor comprises 1 Prerequisite course 2 Core Courses 3 Elective Courses See Headings below for details This checklist will guide you in preparing a succesful request for approval of your minor plan. Prerequisite Course PSYC 6 Introduction to Neuroscience Notes: The prerequisite course CANNOT be taken as an NRO. For the class of 2022 and beyond, PSYC 1 is no longer accepted as a prerequsite for the Neuroscience minor. Must complete two Core Courses PSYC 35 (Previously offered as PSYC 46) Cellular & Molecular Neuroscience OR BIOL 12 Cell Structure & Function PSYC 36 (Previously offered as PSYC 65) Systems Neuroscience with Laboratory PSYC 37 (Previously offered as PSYC 45) Behavioral Neuroscience Note: Core courses CANNOT be taken as an NRO. Must complete three Elective Courses You may choose from the list below as well as the Approved Neuroscience Elective Course list (see link below). Note: One course must be at the 50s level or higher. PSYC 21 Perception PSYC 28 Cognitive Psychology PSYC 35 Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience (if not taken as a core course) PSYC 37 Behavioral Neuroscience (if not taken as a core course) PSYC 38 (Previously offered as PSYC 27) Cognitive Neuroscience PSYC 40 Introduction to Computational Neuroscience PSYC 50s level, 80s level, and other approved electives: At the beginning of each academic year, the Neuroscience Steering Committee will announce which other courses qualify for elective credit. Below is a link to the currently approved Electives that count towards the Neuroscience minor. We recommend that you not save a copy of this pdf to your computer at the beginning of the year, but instead use this link each time you wish to access this list. This is because we may add classes as the year progresses and those updates will appear here. Approved Neuroscience Elective Courses for 2022-2023 (Updated May 10, 2022) Previously approved courses: Approved Neuroscience Elective Courses for 2021-2022 Approved Neuroscience Elective Courses for 2020-2021 Approved Neuroscience Elective Courses for 2019-2020 Approved Neuroscience Elective Courses for 2018-2019 Approved Neuroscience Elective Courses for 2017-2018 Notes: Elective courses CANNOT be taken as an NRO. While it is highly likely that subsequent offerings of a course would also count as an elective, it is not guaranteed. This is because the instructor may change and/or the amount of neuro-relevant content may change over time. Please consult each year's list of approved electives to be sure the course you plan to take counts as an elective! With permission of the Neuroscience Steering Committee, other courses that are appropriate given the student's area of specialization may be taken for elective credit. Not all 50s, 51s, 52s, and 80s-level courses count for neuroscience credit.You MUST consult the list of Approved Neuroscience Elective Courses for each year (via the link above). Students who take Physiology 150 or PEMM 211 should register for Psychology 90 and have permission of the instructor. Courses that are taken as part of another major/minor cannot be used as elective courses for Neuroscience. For permission courses at 60's and 80's level, students should fill out an online permission form.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences Undergraduate Overview Psychology Major Minor Major & Minor FAQs Honors Honors FAQs Neuroscience Major Minor Major & Minor FAQs Honors Honors FAQs Curriculum Transfer and AP Credit Courses and Syllabi Introductory Intermediate Topics Labs Independent Research Course Syllabi (ID login required) Permission Courses Request Form Fall 2022 Winter 2023 Spring 2023 Resources Graduate Graduate Program in Psychological and Brain Sciences Research Areas Coursework and Curriculum Mentoring Toolkit Resources Current Graduate Students Graduate Admissions Admissions FAQs Our Graduates Recent Dissertations Research Overview Recent Research Findings Facilities Undergraduate Research Post-Doctoral Fellows Post-Doctoral Opportunities Participate in Experiments 2021 Honors Student Thesis Presentations (ID Login Required) 2022 Honors Student Thesis Presentations (ID Login Required) Community Diversity Suggestions For Current PBS Community (ID Login Required) News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
