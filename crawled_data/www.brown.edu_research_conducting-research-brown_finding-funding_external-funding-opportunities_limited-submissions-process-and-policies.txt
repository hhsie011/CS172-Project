Limited Submissions Process and Policies Limited Submissions Process and Policies Many funding agencies and foundations have established limited submission policies and will only review a limited number of applications from each institution. Applications or nominations submitted without proper institutional endorsement, or submission of a number over the limit, may result in automatic rejection of all Brown proposals. The process for limited submissions, led by Vice President for Research, in coordination with the Dean of Medicine and Biological Sciences, Dean of Public Health, and the Dean of the Faculty, starts with an announcement from the Office of the Vice President for Research (OVPR) with a deadline for an internal review of applications/nominations. The offices of the Dean of Medicine and Biological Sciences, Dean of Public Health, and/or the Dean of Faculty will take part in the review process in coordination with a faculty review committee, and the Provost will be consulted regarding the final decision. Every effort will be made to identify and announce programs with limitations on proposal submissions. In addition to mailings and announcements, OVPR maintains this searchable database of limited submission opportunities. This is not a comprehensive list, and it is the investigator's responsibility to contact OVPR should the program in which they are interested be restricted, but is not on this list. The Vice President for Research will then determine if an internal competition is necessary and will assist the investigator in obtaining institutional endorsement. A list of limited submission opportunities is available here. For more information, please contact Margaret Manning, Research Development and Support Program Manager, at (401) 863-5145.
