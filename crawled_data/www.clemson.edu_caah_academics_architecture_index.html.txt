Our Programs Apply Visit Lecture Series Student Work School of Architecture News Southern Roots + Global Reach “ “Clemson has shaped me for the better. It has equipped me with lifelong resources. We’ve been given opportunities to grow and thrive. I have had the chance to learn from professors who understand the world shifts gradually as much as it evolves, and their teaching methods adapt to those changes. Clemson has pushed me to keep going beyond limits. Moreover, it has instilled in me a sense of belonging, it has nurtured my curiosity, and it has helped me learn how to embrace and adapt to new challenges by being myself. I am sure there will be many more challenges ahead, but one thing I learned while at Clemson is to understand that the best way to grow and also succeed is to get out of our comfort zone and do the impossible. ” Mohamed Fakhry Master of Architecture '21 School of Architecture Events Fluid Campus™ The School of Architecture's Fluid Campus™ gives our students a study abroad experience that is fully immersive and academically robust.
