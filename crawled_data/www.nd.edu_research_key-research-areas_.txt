Notre Dame Research has identified these as areas of historic strength and growing priority investment. Analytical Sciences & Engineering The Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry, Department of Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering, and related programs, such as Advanced Diagnostics & Therapeutics and Precision Medicine, are collaborating on innovative molecular research and the discovery and design of new technologies to combat disease, promote health, and safeguard the environment. Applied & Computational Math & Statistics Notre Dame researchers are advancing solutions to critical problems in science and engineering, such as cancer progression, gene sequencing, environmental modeling, and big-data analysis in global health, through the development and novel application of mathematics, computation, and statistics. Cancer Researchers at the Harper Cancer Research Institute are dedicated to conducting innovative and integrative research that confronts the complex challenges of cancer. By forming interdisciplinary collaborations across colleges and schools, investigators are using their collective expertise to design new ways to attack cancer. Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering With a plan for significant growth in key areas and an ethos that reflects the University’s mission, Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering at Notre Dame is poised to play a leading role in addressing some of the world’s grandest challenges in energy, the environment, human health, sustainability, and water. Circuits As digital infrastructure evolves, with the emerging ubiquity of sensor networks, embedded intelligence, and the “Internet of Things,” Notre Dame’s Departments of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science & Engineering are working to expand and connect these areas of traditional research strength by developing new capabilities in advanced circuits research. Computational Data Science and Engineering Within Notre Dame’s Department of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering, researchers are focusing on developing tools that can advance deep understanding of research problems through high-performance multiphysics and multiscale predictive computations. Economics Notre Dame Department of Economics researchers are working to create real-world and policy-relevant solutions to help solve the economic, social, and political problems facing humanity. Energy At ND Energy, the Center for Sustainable Energy at Notre Dame, researchers are building a better world by creating new technologies to provide readily available, inexpensive, and non-polluting energy to help solve the global energy crisis. Environmental Change With one-of-a-kind research facilities and leading tools, Notre Dame’s environmental change researchers are focusing on globally significant research that can be translated into policy solutions to make the world a better place for humans and for the environment—truly “Science Serving Society.” Global Health At Notre Dame’s Eck Institute for Global Health, researchers are building upon the University’s historical strengths in work combating infectious disease, such as malaria, dengue fever, and tuberculosis. Global History Notre Dame’s Department of History is committed to a more globalized and transnational study of the past. Institute for Advanced Study The Notre Dame Institute for Advanced Study (NDIAS) brings together leading thinkers from around the world to live and work in an intellectual community. Nanotechnology Researchers at Notre Dame’s Center for Nano Science and Technology (NDnano) are collaborating across traditional scientific boundaries to develop more energy-efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly technologies to address global challenges. Nuclear Physics Notre Dame has a long legacy in nuclear physics, and today is building a preeminent nuclear astrophysics laboratory on campus while also contributing to off-campus research projects and resources. Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Notre Dame scientists and engineers from the Center for Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine are collaborating to advance the research and application of adult stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells using a wide variety of organisms. Topology and Quantum Field Theory Notre Dame’s topologists are focusing on generating discoveries concerning the topological aspects of quantum field theories in order to fuel progress in topology and theoretical physics. Turbomachinery and Propulsion From the Notre Dame Turbomachinery Laboratory in downtown South Bend, where researchers study and test components of gas turbine engines, to the Institute for Flow Physics and Control on campus, where faculty and students are exploring the potential for hypersonic aerodynamics, Notre Dame is building on its historic strengths in the areas of fluid dynamics, aerodynamics, and other areas of aerospace research to create an expert corridor for aerospace engineering and research in South Bend.
