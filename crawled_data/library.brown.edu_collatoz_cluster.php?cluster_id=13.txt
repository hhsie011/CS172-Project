The idea of acquiring film copies of selected titles in the collections of the Biblioteca Nacional de Santiago de Chile, the Biblioteca Nacional de Peru, and other South American libraries was developed during 1939 by Lawrence C. Wroth and Henry B. Van Hoesen. In 1940 a grant was obtained from the Rockefeller Foundation to carry out the program. Originally scheduled for three years, it was extended to five. That part of the plan calling for the filming of books in the Chilean library was accomplished. The filming of books in the Biblioteca Nacional de Peru had to be given up because of the unfortunate destruction of that library by fire. Preliminary arrangements had been made for carrying on the work in Mexico, but due to the scarcity of film and the difficulties of transportation brought about by World War II, this part of the project was finally given up in 1943. Cataloging of individual titles by the Library of Congress, in exchange for a positive copy of the films, was completed in 1945. ...more information Migueis (Jose Rodrigues) The Jose Rodrigues Migueis Archives contain the personal papers and selected volumes from the private library of the late Portuguese writer, donated by his widow.
