Confirmed Anticipated Financial Aid needs to be greater than or equal to your charges due on your Student Homepage. If the confirmed aid is insufficient, please pay the difference before the payment deadline. Please contact the Office of Financial Aid for more information about your Financial Aid status. What if I miss the deadline? Without a sufficient payment or sufficient anticipated aid, your courses may be subject to disenrollment. After disenrollment, you will need to re-enroll in any available courses. Check your student email account for reminders and alerts. Important Dates Overview The registration date will determine the student's payment deadline. Students that register during PREPAY are required to prepay tuition prior to enrolling in classes. Late Add and Late Registration fees may apply.
