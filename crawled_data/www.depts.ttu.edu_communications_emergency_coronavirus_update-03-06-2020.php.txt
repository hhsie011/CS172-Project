At this time, no one knows how severe this outbreak will be. Given this uncertainty, and the fact that the seasonal influenza (flu) virus is also widespread, we are taking proactive steps to address a number of business concerns. First and foremost, we want to maintain a safe workplace by encouraging practices to protect the health of faculty, staff, students, campus visitors, and others. We ask all employees to help the Texas Tech University community stay well by taking the following steps to reduce the transmission of communicable diseases in the workplace. Stay home when you are sick. Wash your hands frequently with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based sanitizer. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Cover your mouth with tissues whenever you sneeze, and discard used tissues in the trash. If a tissue is not available, sneeze or cough into your elbow or upper sleeve, not into your hand. Avoid close contact with people who are sick with respiratory symptoms. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces. Consider using telephone and video conferencing instead of face-to-face meetings, if available, during this outbreak. If face-to-face meetings are unavoidable, meet in a large room to avoid close contact. Refrain from shaking hands. The Texas Tech University's custodial teams use Oxivir 1 and an EMist system in areas with high traffic to disinfect surfaces and workspaces that traditional cleaning methods may miss. Additionally, hand sanitizer dispensers have been placed in the Student Union, Residence Halls, Dining Halls and Library. It is critical that employees do not report to work while they are experiencing respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headache, chills or fatigue. Currently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that employees remain at home until at least 24 hours after they are free of fever (100 degrees F or 37.8 degrees C) or signs of a fever without the use of fever-reducing medications. Many times, with the best of intentions, employees report to work even though they feel ill. Employees who report to work ill will be sent home in accordance with these health guidelines. We encourage you to visit the TTU Coronavirus website for updated information.

For questions regarding Oxivir 1 or EMist, please contact Aaron Smith, Managing Director of Services by emailing aaron.smith@ttu.edu or by calling 806-834-1121.
