Through a 5-week interactive curriculum, this group aims to begin to equip students with the time, space, and skills for the self-reflection and processing of privilege that is necessary to meaningfully dismantle systems of racial oppression from a position that has privilege. Through increasing self-awareness and centering justice, as well as the recognition of history and its impact on the present, students will build skills around empathy, responsibility in action, and interrogation of knowledges we use and value while centering compassion, healing, and vulnerable, open dialogue. This space will not be a support group for white students. Nor will it be comfortable or easy. What it will be is a meaningful, challenging step for those who feel called in and ready to start taking their appropriate place in creating a more just Columbia community. *Due to the open and online nature of this virtual working group where building community and relationships that invite accountability are central to the success and sustainability of this effort for everyone, we ask that you be able to attend all 5 sessions. *Although this space is not private or confidential, participants are asked to be respectful and mindful of each other and practice discretion. *Please email Alice!
