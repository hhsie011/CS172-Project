In 1992, Yale published a report on improving public safety in order to address the needs of a 21st century campus. The University administration made it a point to keep the campus open and integrated into the New Haven urban landscape. As a result of these new goals the department developed into a separate entity in 1996. In the last 40 years, Yale Security has grown from three officers patrolling the Medical School to a department with 150 officers and managers that oversee the operation of over 500 blue phones and 3,000 card readers. The Yale Security Department serves as the eyes and ears of the YPD by patrolling buildings and parking facilities. Yale Security also manages the University security systems (CCTV cameras, ID card readers, intercoms and alarm systems), provides walking escorts and nighttime safe rides, runs theft deterrent programs, and provides lockout services. Yale Security Department has offices located at 57 Lock Street and 79 Howe Street, and on West Campus. The department is staffed 24 hours a day by trained security officers and management personnel.
