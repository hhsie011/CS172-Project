The 62-acre research center also houses MCZ specimen-preparation facilities and the largest specimens from some of the MCZ collections. The Ernst Mayr Library and its archives join in supporting the work of the Museum by providing and preserving information resources and services to support the research and teaching activities in the Harvard community. The Harvard Museum of Natural History was established in 1998 as the public face of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, along with two other natural science museums at Harvard. The HMNH presents the incomparable collections of these parent museums and the research of scientists across the University. The Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology is the academic department associated with the MCZ. Curators of the MCZ collections are also faculty professors in this Harvard academic department. mcz_1875_01.jpg About Affiliates & Facilities Collections Operations Annual Reports Lunchtime Seminars News Contact Privacy | User Agreement Harvard Museums of Science & Culture Organismic and Evolutionary Biology https://www.instagram.com/mczharvard/ https://twitter.com/MCZHarvard https://www.facebook.com/MCZHarvard/ d327872e00f44e2d502b313399641a26 Admin Login OpenScholar Copyright Â© 2022 The President and Fellows of Harvard College | Accessibility | Digital Accessibility | Report Copyright Infringement
