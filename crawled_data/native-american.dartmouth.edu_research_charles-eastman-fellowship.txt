The successful applicant will be appointed in the Department of Native American and Indigenous Studies. Fellowship Details Dartmouth College invites applications for the Charles Eastman Predoctoral Fellowship. This fellowship promotes student and faculty diversity at Dartmouth, and throughout higher education, by supporting the career trajectories of underrepresented minority scholars and others with a demonstrated ability to advance educational diversity. Applicants will be selected on the basis of their academic achievement, promise in both research and teaching, and their demonstrated commitment to addressing racial underrepresentation in higher education. This is a two-year residential fellowship, with one course taught in the second year. Throughout, fellows are expected to pursue research activities while participating fully in the intellectual life of the department and the college. The first year, fellows receive an annual stipend of approximately $36,000 plus benefits and an allocation for research expenses; as a postdoctoral fellow in the second year, the stipend is approximately $55,200 plus benefits and an allocation for research expenses (exact funding levels for 2022-24 will be set at the time of offer). In the second year, fellows teach one course in Winter or Spring. Eastman Fellows are part of the Provost's Fellowship Program, a multidisciplinary cohort of approximately ten predoctoral and postdoctoral scholars who share a commitment to increasing diversity in their disciplines. Fellows participate together in mentoring and professional development programming, including guidance in preparing for faculty careers. Selection Process Applicants will be selected on the basis of: academic achievement and promise; membership in a racial or ethnic group that is currently underrepresented among faculty in the applicant's academic field; demonstrated commitment to increasing opportunities for underrepresented minorities and increasing cross-racial understanding; and potential for serving as an advocate and mentor for minority undergraduate and graduate students. Consideration will be made for scholars who seek to share their research as presenters and lecturers in the Dartmouth community. Each fellow will be expected to participate in selected activities with undergraduate students (for example, presenting guest lectures in classes, serving in programs for minority students interested in academic careers, and interacting with undergraduate majors in host departments). Recipients of the Eastman Dissertation Fellowships will be appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies, upon the recommendation of a faculty selection committee in consultation with appropriate departments.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Native American and Indigenous Studies Undergraduate Overview Major and Minor Courses Honors Program Waitlists and Applications NAS 85 Independent Study Rules & Procedures NAS Students Writing Prize Award Recipients Alumni - Tell Us Your Story 2020 2021 Funding for Internships and Independent Research Off-Campus Program Research Overview Gordon Russell Visiting Professorship Gordon Russell Visiting Professorship Alumni Charles Eastman Fellowship Eastman Fellowship Alumni Tribal Scholar Fellowship Program Tribal Scholar Fellowship Alumni Resources News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
