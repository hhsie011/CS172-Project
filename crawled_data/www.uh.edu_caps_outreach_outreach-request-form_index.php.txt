A minimum of 2 weeks’ notice is required. Requests received on short notice or outreaches occurring after business hours are not guaranteed to be fulfilled. Requests for speaking engagements can only be made by a UH affiliate; event location must be on the University of Houston main campus. Custom Requests: CAPS offers a number of standard presentations (e.g., QPR suicide prevention, Helping Students of Concern, Overview of CAPS services) but we often get requests for more customized presentations. We would be pleased to fulfill a custom request if requested early in the semester. However, CAPS cannot guarantee custom requests during peak times of the semester or with less than two weeks’ notice. Interviews for class assignments: CAPS is committed to supporting the educational mission of the university and providing mentorship to students interested in the helping professions. Given that we must prioritize students seeking clinical services, and often receive multiple requests from students requesting interviews, all requests for interviews must be submitted at least 3 weeks in advance of the assignment due date. We cannot guarantee requests with less notice will be fulfilled.
