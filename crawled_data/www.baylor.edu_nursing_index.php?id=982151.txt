Strengthening health system capacity refers to increasing the number of health professionals and improving their physical and intellectual resources to improve health outcomes. This international multidisciplinary project involves an active partnership between faculty and students from Baylor University and Bangalore Baptist Hospital (BBH) in India from fields of nursing, medicine, health sciences, computer sciences, business, art, university scholars, and statistics. This mutually beneficial partnership includes international exchanges between Baylor and BBH faculty and students. These mutually beneficial immersions provide Baylor faculty and students with opportunities to learn about global healthcare, research and to develop cultural humility, ultimately improving their capacity to care for diverse populations in the US and globally. This project includes large-scale transformative education, research, and opportunities to improve patient care in both countries. Large-scale impact is demonstrated through the physical construction of three new centers for excellence in Bengaluru, India where best practices in technology design are implemented such as the use of mobile health (mHealth) apps to improve patient care. For information on how to get involved in this project, please email Dr. Shelby Garner at Shelby_Garner@Baylor.edu The Simulation Healthcare and Research Center for Nursing Excellence Baylor University and Bangalore Baptist Hospital built and opened the first Simulation Healthcare and Research Center for Nursing Excellence in 2017 funded by the US Agency for International Development (USAID). Healthcare simulation involves the use of human patient robotics and a replicated clinical space to give health providers a safe way to practice and perfect clinical decision making and other skills rather than practicing on real patients. Since Baylor and BBH opened the center in 2017, more than 30 nursing and medical schools in India have visited the center to glean ideas for replicating the technologies and programs throughout the country of India and thousands of faculty and students in nursing and medicine have been trained. One unanticipated benefit of the simulation center was its impact during the peak of the COVID pandemic. The simulation center was used to train health professionals on emergent protocols for COVID prevention and treatment and was transformed into a clinic where over 20,000 people were vaccinated. Baylor faculty and student teams have participated in 20 immersive trips to India to implement and research new technologies.
