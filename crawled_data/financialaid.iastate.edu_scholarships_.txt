Some programs will continue to accept applications. OneApp will reopen in early Fall 2022 for students to apply for the 2023-2024 academic year. With Iowa State University’s OneApp scholarship portal, students can submit scholarship applications in one system. The Office of Student Financial Aid, academic colleges and departments, and other campus units (ex: Student Affairs Central Office, Program for Women in Science and Engineering, Student Accessibility Services, etc.) will use the information available in OneApp to select scholarship recipients. OneApp is closed until early fall 2022. Deadlines will vary depending upon the scholarship or opportunity, so we encourage students to log in to OneApp early and often to ensure deadlines are met. Once submitted, students can still access and revise their applications until the scholarship close date. Scholarship selection committees will use the information available in the system (e.g., data from student records and/or information provided on the General Application, Conditional Application, and any Recommended Opportunities) as of when the committee begins their review of applications. There will be some university scholarships not using OneApp to award 2022-2023 scholarships. Go to the additional ISU scholarships page to view other scholarships available at Iowa State.
