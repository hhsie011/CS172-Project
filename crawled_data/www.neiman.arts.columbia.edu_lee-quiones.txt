The records together with a tagged can of spray paint from the artist's collection are housed in a vintage suitcase, much like the one Quiñones used to carry his paint cans to the train yards and tunnels. This unique portfolio represents not only the soundtrack of the artist’s career but also a mini-retrospective of his visually dynamic tags. Quiñones was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico in 1960 and raised in New York City’s Lower East Side. One of the originators of street art, Quiñones started painting on city streets and subway cars in the 1970s. Over the next decade, he would paint over 100 whole subway cars throughout the MTA system, to then shift to a studio-based practice. He was instrumental in moving street art above the ground when he created the first handball-court mural in 1978. He has presented numerous solo shows and exhibited internationally, including at the Galleria La Medusa, Rome, White Columns, NY, Documenta #7 Kassel, Germany, New Museum of Contemporary Art, NY and MoMA PS1, NY.
