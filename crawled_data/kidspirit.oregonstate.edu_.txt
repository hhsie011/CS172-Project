Individual program information including pricing and schedules can be found for Spring Archery, Spring Gymnastics, Cooking Academy, and ACES no-school days. At KidSpirit we are always working to find creative ways to adapt our programming and stay connected and safe. Due to mixed-age classes we continue to practice caution, including maintaining some spaces where masks are still required. Read more about our spring COVID measures at our Health & Safety page. Lastly, we encourage each of you to continue following good personal hygiene practices and current guidance from public authorities as you make decisions about travel, social gatherings, and other matters in your personal life. If you or your student are sick, please stay home from class, and call to let us know. We all play a role in contributing to a safer Oregon. The actions we take, individually and together, are critical at this time. If you have any questions or need help with registration, feel free to call or email us.
