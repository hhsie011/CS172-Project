The guiding values for IE’s approach to assessment is expressed in the motto “Missional, Meaningful, Manageable”. Missional- Reflects the value of our shared purpose as units in a larger institution and our alignment around common strategies for achieving our mission. Meaningful- Represents the importance of collecting data can inform decisions for improving the quality of services our university provides. Manageable- Recognizes that in order for assessment and improvement efforts to be sustainable, they must be embedded in our organizational practices and not burdensome. Universities typically differentiate four different approaches to assessment based upon the organizational function, including the following: Academic Programs: focused on learning outcomes assessment. Administrative Units: focused on alignment with institutional goals and budgets. General Education: focused on general education outcomes in programs and core classes. Student/Academic Services: focused on a combination of student learning and operations.
