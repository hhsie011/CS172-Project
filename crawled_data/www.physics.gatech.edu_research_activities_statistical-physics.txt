This hidden commonality allows one to discover similarities in problems ranging from quantum phenomena at one end of the scale to the structure of the Universe at the other. Georgia Tech nonlinear dynamics faculty work on a correspondingly wide range of problems, from quantum systems, the dynamics of fluids and granular media, optical and electronic systems, to problems lying at the interface between physics, chemistry, biology, and medicine.
