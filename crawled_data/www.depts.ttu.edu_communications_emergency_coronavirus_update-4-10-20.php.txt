While we now have a much greater reliance on technology, let us not forget about the positive impact that a one-on-one conversation or individual follow-up with a colleague, student, or classmate can have. Summer Session I As we continue to closely monitor the ongoing spread of COVID-19 and the impact it has on our University operations, we have decided to move all courses for Summer Session I to online instruction. We will continue to provide updates for Summer Session II as those dates get closer. I encourage all students to consider enrolling in the summer session to continue your education as well as your engagement with the Texas Tech University community. To ensure broader access to Summer Session I courses, we've made several temporary adjustments to our fee and service structure: We will not assess the Online Learning & Distance Education Fees ($35 per Semester Credit Hour), and we will reduce the Student Services Fee by 50%. For a student taking six credit hours over the summer, this will be a total cost savings of approximately $275. When coupled with the absence of campus-based fees for Summer Session I, students may realize a savings of over $600 for six hours of enrollment. Our Barnes & Noble bookstore will support online course materials, where available, and has extended book rental returns for the spring term to the first week of fall. Expanded Red Raider Guarantee To increase access to higher education, we are also announcing an expansion of the Texas Tech University Red Raider Guarantee program. Starting with the Fall 2020 term, the program will guarantee tuition and mandatory fees (based on 30 credit hours for the year) to new entering freshman and transfer students with an associate's degree, who are Texas residents, have a family adjusted gross income that does not exceed $65,000, have demonstrated financial need, and who will be enrolled full time (12 hours or more each semester – Fall/Spring only). The program currently covers those with a family adjusted gross income that does not exceed $40,000. More information is available on the Financial Aid website. If you have any questions about enrollment options, please contact your academic advisor or the Provost's Office.
