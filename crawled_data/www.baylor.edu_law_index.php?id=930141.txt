Baylor’s fully integrated transactional program prepares students for all types of positions within transactional areas of practice. HIGH STAKES. Transactional lawyers work to protect the interests of an individual, business, or organization in a commercial or financial setting. Whatever the type of client, business lawyers often bring parties together, playing a critical role in contract negotiations, joint ventures, intellectual property rights, and mergers and acquisitions. Transactional lawyers must understand the business, financial, and economic aspects of deals, and be equipped to help clients manage risk. HIGH STANDARDS. Led by professors who are nationally recognized for their teaching, scholarship, and work as practicing lawyers, students looking to pursue a career in transactional law will find a rigorous, rewarding, fully immersive experience. The curriculum is an experience that uniquely prepares them to enter practice armed with the business acumen, practical skills, and confidence to make a positive difference for their clients. HIGH EXPECTATIONS. Every student gains valuable experience in Transactional Practice through a heavily required three-year curriculum that provides a strong foundation for whatever area of practice he or she decides to pursue. In the third year, that experience is put to the test, when transactional cases are integrated into Baylor’s renowned Practice Court. Beyond the required courses, students can elect to dive deeper into specialized areas through a series of transactional “Professional Tracks.” The journey offers students the opportunity to work one-on-one with a professor in a custom-designed transactional “Capstone.” “At Baylor Law, I was able to take some really wonderful courses that built a firm foundation in transactional practice.” —Dathan Voelter, JD '99 Director, Germania Farm Mutual Insurance Association Academics Academic Calendar Academic Services Advocacy Top Gun National Mock Trial Competition 2021 Top Gun XII Top Gun XI - How We Did It 2020 Top Gun XI 2019 Top Gun X 2018 Top Gun Competition 2017 Top Gun Competition 2016 Top Gun Competition 2015 Top Gun Competition Transactional Practice Ready Transactional Courses Professional Tracks & Capstones Transactional Dual Degree Programs Transactional Faculty Transactional Law & Practice Court Legal Writing Business Law Boot Camp The Closer National Transactional Law Competition 2023 | The Closer 2022 | The Closer 2021 | The Closer 2020 | The Closer 2019 | The Closer 2018 | The Closer 2017 | The Closer In House Counsel Externship Program Competition Opportunities and Results for Current Students Transactional Law Mentorship Program Degree Programs Executive LL.M. in Litigation Management Baylor Law Learning Outcomes Experiential Learning Practice Court Program Legal Clinics Entrepreneurship Clinic Estate Planning Clinic Immigration Clinic IP Law Clinic Trial Advocacy Clinic Veterans Clinic Transactional Capstones Public Service Baylor Law's Pro Bono and Public Service Program Adoption Day People's Law School People's Law School | 2022 People's Law School 2022 Class Schedule People's Law School 2022 Survey People's Law School | 2021 Service Opportunities for Law Students Waco McLennan Pro Bono Challenge Waco McLennan Pro Bono Challenge Hours Recording Form Waco McLennan Pro Bono Challenge Sign-up Waco McLennan Outstanding Pro Bono Advocate Awards DAYL Pro Bono Challenge DAYL Pro Bono Challenge Hours Recording Form DAYL Pro Bono Challenge Sign-Up DAYL Pro Bono Annual Challenge Results DAYL Pro Bono Partners Service Award Resources Student Awards Competitions Intramural Opportunities Intermural Opportunities Externships Leadership Development Program Legal Mapmaker Legal Mapmaker Program Payment Study Abroad Legal Writing Integrated Approach Writing Courses Writing Faculty The Ultimate Writer Competition The Paper Chase Legal Writing Competition Study Abroad at St Andrews Baylor Law Review Show More General Information Colleges, Schools, Libraries & Research Admissions Administration Gateways For...
