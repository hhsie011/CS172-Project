The Agricultural Engineering program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org/. Goal: To educate students in the analysis and design of machinery, animal housing, and environmental systems for the production, processing, storage, handling, distribution, and use of food, feed, fiber and other biomaterials, and the management of related natural resources, by integrating basic physical and biological sciences with engineering design principles. Student Learning Outcomes: Graduates of the Agricultural Engineering curriculum should have, at the time of graduation: an ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics an ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences an ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions an ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies. Program Educational Objectives: Three to five years after graduation, our graduates will be using the knowledge, skills, and abilities from their agricultural engineering degree to improve the human condition through successful careers in a wide variety of fields. They will be effective leaders, collaborators, and innovators who address environmental, social, technical, and business challenges. They will be engaged in life-long learning and professional development through self-study, continuing education, or graduate/professional school. Graduates find employment in diverse ag- and bio-related industries and government agencies dealing with agricultural machines and buildings, animal and environmental control, grain processing and handling, soil and water resources, food, biorenewables, and biotechnology. Their work involves engineering design, development, testing, research, manufacturing, consulting, sales, and service. Students are highly encouraged to participate in either cooperative education or internship programs. The department also offers a bachelor of science curriculum in biological systems engineering. Additionally, the department offers bachelor of science curricula in agricultural systems technology and in industrial technology. Well-qualified juniors and seniors in agricultural engineering who are interested in graduate study may apply for concurrent enrollment in the Graduate College to simultaneously pursue a bachelor of science degree in agricultural engineering and a master of science degree in agricultural engineering. A concurrent bachelor of science and master of business administration program is also offered by the department. Refer to Graduate Study for more information.

The concurrent BS/MS program allows seniors to: Become eligible for a research assistantship during their senior year Complete an MS degree (with thesis) within 18 months of BS graduation For more information about our concurrent undergraduate and graduate programs in Agricultural & Biosystems Engineering, visit: https://www.abe.iastate.edu/graduate-students/abe-concurrent-degrees/. Graduate Study The department offers master of science, master of engineering, and doctor of philosophy degrees with a major in agricultural and biosystems engineering. Within the agricultural and biosystems engineering major the student may specialize in advanced machinery engineering, animal production systems engineering, biological and process engineering, occupational safety engineering, or water and environmental stewardship engineering. Details on current research programs available at http://www.abe.iastate.edu/. For the master of science program, at least 30 credits of acceptable graduate work must be completed with a minimum of 22 credits of course work; corresponding numbers for the master of engineering program are 32 and 27. For the doctor of philosophy degree, at least 72 credits of acceptable graduate work must be completed with a minimum of 42 credits of course work. All Ph.D. students must complete a teaching/extension experience prior to graduation. The department also offers both master of science and doctor of philosophy degrees in industrial and agricultural technology. The department also participates in interdepartmental majors in environmental science, sustainable agriculture, human computer interaction, and toxicology (see Index).
