The exhibition will be open to the public from 9:30 AM to 4:30 PM each weekday from May 2 to May 23. Each of the ten gifted photographers from Magnum Photos—the international picture agency founded by Robert Capa, Henri Cartier-Bresson, George Rodger and David “Chim” Seymour—was assigned a theme for his photographic portrait series. One photographer showcases the intense preparation for the Winter Olympics; another looks at youth and its hangouts; another investigates cultural heritage and looks at the tension between the old and the new; another offers a peek behind the curtain of Piedmont’s taste and craftwork expertise; another explores technology; and yet another gives a human view of industrial production. The featured photographers are Bruno Barbey, Stuart Franklin, Jean Gaumy, Harry Gruyaert, Josef Koudelka, Alex Majoli, Peter Marlow, Mark Power, Ferdinando Scianna, and Patrick Zachmann.
