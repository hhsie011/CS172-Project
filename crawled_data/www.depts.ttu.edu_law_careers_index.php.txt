AALS Bylaws Section 6-3b and AALS Regulation 6-3.2. Employer Affirmation As an employer seeking assistance and facilities for interviewing and other placement functions from Texas Tech Law, I affirm that Texas Tech Law has informed me of the University's nondiscrimination policies and the school's obligation under AALS Bylaws; and its expectation that each employer will observe the principle of equal opportunity. I provide this assurance of my willingness to observe the principles of equal opportunity and compliance with its nondiscrimination policies as a condition of obtaining any form of placement assistance or use of the school's facilities.
