All Ivy League school alumni are welcome to apply for this project. After the project board’s review, they are recruited as the "wallers" in the Ivy Wall™-Teng Zhan Project. For non-Ivy League graduates who have a strong will in participating, you must have a referee from an Ivy League school alumna/alumnus, and this referee must be a recruited Waller participating the Ivy Wall™-Teng Zhan Project.
