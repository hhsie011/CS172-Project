By living in one of the 11 on-campus Residential Commons, SMU students interact with students from across the country and around the world, developing a global perspective right here on campus! All of our Residential Commons -- RC's for short -- are co-ed and offer the same amenities: mostly double-occupancy rooms with similar furnishings and access to classroom and study space and dining options. But, that's where the similarities end. Each architecturally distinctive building houses a community that is ever-evolving with each new group of residents, developing unique traditions, gatherings, and meaningful activities. Each RC even has its own signature crest and colors to further add to the individual identity of the community. Together, the 11 Commons make up a vibrant, dynamic residential living and learning system that reflects the diversity on which SMU thrives as a whole. Explore the Commons here. Faculty Engagement SMU's commitment to creating lasting, mentoring relationships between students and faculty extends into the Residential Commons system with the Faculty in Residence. These FiR's are the cornerstone of the residential life experience, offering mentorship, guidance, intellectual discourse and fostering community outside of the classroom. Whether it's teaching a class inside the RC, organizing a group outing to explore one of Dallas' newest offerings such as Klyde Warren Park, or baking up a fresh batch of cookies for a weekly book club, FiR's are there to engage, interact and foster students through their first two years on campus. You may even get the opportunity to take walks with some of our brightest residents, like Teddy, official Pet in Residence of Armstrong Commons! Learn more about life in the RC here.
