While diverse in their training, skills, and ideas, the members of this group have commonalities in their motivating questions, methodological approaches, and explanatory constructs. They also share a distinguished track record of recognition for their scholarship and teaching. Common research elements The involved scholars typically focus on a core set of motivating questions, including How individuals (consumers, leaders, investors, etc.) and groups (e.g., management teams, policy bodies) make choices and with what effects; How parties (individuals, agents, leaders, etc.) jointly solve problems and resolve disputes through dialogue and bargaining and with what effects. These scholars typically have expertise in one or more methodological approaches, including Experimental methods, including the controlled presentation and manipulation of information and stimuli to establish causal effects; Neurological methods, including the use of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging methods to identify brain regions and systems involved in particular tasks and cognitions; Biological and physiological methods, including the use of measures such as heart rate and testosterone levels as indices of variables such as stress and dominance-orientation. The models featured in Columbia’s scholarship on these topics typically feature one or more of a particular set of explanatory constructs, including Cognitive construction, including the ways in which people make sense of and attach meaning to their experiences and choices as well as the construction of their own preferences; Cultural dynamics, including the ways in which national and other cultures enter into thoughts, feelings, and behavior; Individual differences, including person-to-person variance in motivations, personality, behavior, and cognitive styles. A track record of excellence Columbia’s decision making and negotiation scholars are among the most sought-after teachers in the School and the most highly-regarded contributors to their academic fields. Columbia Business School is a center of excellence on these topics. Illustrative accomplishments of current faculty members include the following Scholarly honors, including the Presidential Early Career Award for Social Scientists for Professor Sheena Iyengar; the Early Contribution Award from the Society of Consumer Psychology for Professor Ran Kivetz; the Academy of Management’s “Best Paper” awards for articles by Professors Daniel Ames, Joel Brockner, Michael Morris, and Elke Weber; and the American Psychological Society William James Fellow Award for Distinguished Achievements in Psychological Science for Professor Tory Higgins; Grants and research support, including millions of dollars in funding from the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and other foundations and agencies; Scholarly community leadership, including Professor Eric Johnson, former President of the Society for Judgment and Decision Making and Professor Elke Weber, former President of the Society for Neuroeconomics; Teaching awards, including the Columbia University Presidential Award for Outstanding Teaching, the Award for Excellence from the Berkeley-Columbia EMBA graduating class, and multiple recipients of the Dean’s Award for Innovation in the Curriculum; Executive Education leadership, including Professor Michel Pham, Faculty Director of the Strategic Marketing Management program, and Professor Joel Brockner, Faculty Director for the Leadership Essentials and High Impact Leadership programs; Provocative books that make contemporary research accessible to managers, policy makers, and the wider public, including Friend and Foe co-authored by Professor Adam Galinsky and The Art of Choosing by Professor Sheena Iyengar; Media visibility in leading mainstream outlets, including a recent cover story and profile in the New York Times Magazine profiling Elke Weber’s research; Exceptional doctoral training, with a track record of dissertation awards and placement of graduates as faculty members of the world’s best business schools.
