Meet with Us and Learn More! There are many opportunities for you to learn more about the Honors College when you schedule a visit with us. Explore these options and decide what works best with your schedule! Monday and Friday with Honors The Honors College hosts in-person information sessions for prospective families each week. These are offered every Monday and Friday from 10:15-11:00 a.m. on campus. To register, simply sign up for a Visit Experience on a Monday or Friday and select the Honors College in the “Meet with a department representative” section of the registration form. In addition to the Monday and Friday Honors College info sessions, BIC’s departmental standard appointments are set up through the same form. Simply select BIC, as the department you would like to meet with, and ignore text that says ‘there are no available times on selected day.’ The visit experience office will work with the BIC office to create your personalized itinerary.
