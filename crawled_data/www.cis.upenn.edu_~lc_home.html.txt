at Welcome to the Logic and Computation Group at the University of Pennsylvania! here is a rich and diverse history of the application of logic to the field of computer science. The work of logicians such as Turing and GÃ¶del has had a profound influence on information science as we know it today. This interface between mathematical / philosophical logic and new technologies is now a very active and productive field of research. It is playing a crucial role in the development of new programming languages and architectures and is central to the development of methods for specifying and verifying the correctness of hardware and software. The field is rapidly expanding and has touched virtually every area of the emerging information technology. The Logic and Computation Group is an interdisciplinary research group composed of faculty and graduate students from the Departments of Computer and Information Science, Linguistics, Mathematics, and Philosophy. The director is Peter Freyd. The group meets weekly in the Logic and Computation Seminar (click to see schedules of talks and how to subscribe to the mailing list). Some papers by members of the group can be found at the CIS ftp site or the CIS Technical Report Archive or as part of the IRCS Technical Report Series. Members of the group participate in the Logic, Information, and Computation Program which offers undergraduate courses of study. The Logic and Computation Group is closely connected with the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science, a Research Center at Penn devoted to the pursuit of an understanding of the human mind and to the development of new technologies.
