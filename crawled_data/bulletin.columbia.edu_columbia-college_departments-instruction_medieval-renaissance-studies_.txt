Please note that requirements for the Special Concentration were revised November 2017. In addition to fulfilling the requirements for a departmental major or concentration, students with this special concentration should plan on taking an additional four (4) courses in other departments of the program, to be chosen in consultation with an appropriate member of the committee. Students must also demonstrate an ability to work with original language sources (other than in Early Modern English) from the medieval and/or Early Modern periods, either through language coursework focusing on the historical language (e.g., LATN UN3033 MEDIEVAL LANGUAGE ＆ LITERATURE, MDES GU4214 Fourth Year Classical Arabic I) or through research (e.g., a senior thesis or seminar paper with substantial use of original language sources). Any courses outside the major used to demonstrate the language requirement may also count toward the course requirement for the special concentration. Students should gain approval of the director of the program in advance for plans to fulfill this language requirement. MRST GU4201 History of the Medieval Book: Manuscripts as Material Culture. 4 points. This course will study the medieval book as a multimedia physical and cultural artifact. We will begin with a study of the technology of book production from Late Antiquity through the High Middle Ages, including the shift from roll to codex, the preparation of parchment, the development of inks and pigments, and techniques for decoration. Next, the class will turn to the various uses of books within both religious and secular contexts, as well as to the use of books as a medium of self-representation and the transfer and transformation of bodies of religious and scientific knowledge. Finally, the course will consider the use of the growing number of digital manuscript collections accessible on the internet for teaching and research.
