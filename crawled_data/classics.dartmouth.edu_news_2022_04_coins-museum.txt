McDonald 1940 Fund; 2019.27 PreviousNext RANDALL KUHLMAN, Center for Object Study Attendant and Scheduling Assistant Hood Quarterly, spring 2022 This winter, the Hood Museum of Art collaborated on a special gallery installation with the Dartmouth Classics/History course Before Billboards and Twitter: Roman Coins as Text, taught by Professor Roberta Stewart and described in the course catalogue as follows: "Nowhere else in the ancient world can we watch a discourse so systematically and comprehensively as we can on coins. Moreover, coins often bring forward communities and persons otherwise unrecorded in other ancient sources, allowing us to nuance the political narratives of the literary sources in terms of local traditions or individual identity (gender, ethnicity, religion)." The class was held in the Bernstein Center for Object Study over winter term, giving students the opportunity to closely study coins from the museum's collection at every session. As a culminating experience, students researched and wrote about coins that were installed in the museum this spring. Kylie Romeros '22, a Conroy Intern and member of the class, spoke about what she learned: "I've always been fascinated with museums, but now I truly understand how unique they are in their responsibility to provide objects with context. A lot of work goes into making sure that everyone can view a coin and take away some meaning from it that extends beyond a purely material understanding." In sharing our ancient Mediterranean coinage publicly through this exhibition, we hope to teach our audiences how a numismatist might view coins and use them to study history. The exhibition also includes example of coins and currency from different times and regions throughout the world, asking visitors to consider how currency is defined and what money actually is. The exhibition aims to offer the viewer a fresh perspective on something as seemingly familiar as money. The students' research on objects of their choosing adds to the Hood Museum's scholarly archive and provides new narratives and deeper insights into the collection for our public audiences. This extended content is available through a website that allows visitors to explore thoughts and ideas beyond the space constraints of a gallery label. The website also expands our audiences by sharing the exhibition content virtually. As the museum navigates remote learning and virtual exhibitions, these collaborative offerings help us to bring together students, faculty, and audiences in new and exciting ways. You can see the coin exhibition (Money Talks) in the Kim Gallery on the first floor.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Classics Curriculum Overview Course Offerings by Term Fall 2021 Winter 2022 Spring 2022 Summer 2022 Fall 2022 Winter 2023 Spring 2023 2023-24 Classical Studies Courses Entry points for Classical Studies Literature, Philosophy, Religion Ancient History Classical Archaeology Language Study -- Latin Latin Classes Placement in Latin Language Study -- Ancient Greek Courses in Ancient Greek Placement in Ancient Greek Majors and Minors Classical Studies track Ancient History track Classical Archaeology track Classical Languages and Literature track Culminating Experience Foreign Study NEW Classics FSP in Spring 2022 Greece Foreign Study Program Rome Foreign Study Program Projects & Awards Classics-Related Projects and Awards Student Research Archaeological Fieldwork Reid/Wiencke Funding for Research Senior Honors Projects Awards & Prizes Faculty Media Projects Annual Lecture Programs Faculty Books Inclusivity News & Events People Our graduates Graduating with a Classics Degree Alumni Support Tell Us Your Story Alumni Stories My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
