Non-Affiliate Guest Registration Process Residential students can now register in advance to host one non-CUID holder guest for the Summer. In addition to the standard Guest Policy and procedures, residents must follow the steps below to facilitate a virtual verification of the guest’s vaccination status before their arrival on campus. Guest Registration Process: Open May 15 through August 24 Report to Undergraduate Student Life in Lerner 510 on Wednesday from 9 a.m. - 5 p.m. for remote verification of your guest’s vaccination status. Ensure that your guest is available virtually, via Zoom or FaceTime, with their ID and vaccination record at hand, so that Columbia Residential Life staff can visually confirm their vaccination status. NOTE: Guest IDs and vaccination records must be inspected visually and cannot be sent over email. Once your guest’s vaccination status is confirmed, you will receive an email containing their Green Pass. Present your guest’s Green Pass to Public Safety while checking them in via the standard guest registration process. PLEASE NOTE: Guests registered during the Spring semester do not have to be re-registered if you will be hosting them again over the Summer. The same Green Pass issued initially should be presented to Public Safety on check-in. An advanced registration form is no-longer required, just come to Lerner 510 on Wednesday's from 9-5 with your guest ready to virtually verify their vaccination status. Please direct any questions questions about this process to reslife@columbia.edu.
