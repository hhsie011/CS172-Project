Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching, and Learning http://cirtl.tamu.edu/ The Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching, and Learning (CIRTL) is a national network of universities and colleges that are focused on teaching and learning in higher education. CIRTL uses graduate education as the leverage point to develop a national STEM faculty committed to implementing and advancing effective teaching practices for diverse student audiences as part of successful professional careers. The goal of CIRTL is to improve the STEM learning of all students at every college and university, and thereby to increase the diversity in STEM fields and the STEM literacy of the nation. Established in fall 2006, the CIRTL Network was comprised of Howard University, Michigan State University, Texas A&M University, University of Colorado at Boulder, University of Wisconsin-Madison, and Vanderbilt University. After substantial expansions in 2011 and 2016, the Network now includes 42 research universities across the United States and Canada. The diversity of these institutions—private/public; large/moderate size; majority-/minority-serving; geographic location—is by design aligned with CIRTL's mission. As a local member of the CIRTL network, CIRTL@TAMU works collaboratively with the Graduate and Professional School, the Center for Teaching Excellence, and the academic colleges. Through collaboration, the CIRTL@TAMU offers a range of local and national teaching and learning opportunities for graduate students and post-doctoral fellows at Texas A&M University. These opportunities help students learn and apply the principles of teaching as research in a supportive context of one or more local learning communities that are infused with the pillars of CIRTL: Learning-through-Diversity, Learning Community, and Teaching as Research. Students who engage with the network can earn CIRTL certification at the Associate, Practitioner, and Scholar levels.

Doctoral Student Profile and Feedback System The Doctoral Student Profile and Feedback System is an easy-to-use platform intended to support the regular review of the academic performance of doctoral students at Texas A&M University. Designed in conjunction with Interfolio, the system provides a single source for students to view their academic progress, create custom curricula vitae and biosketches, and receive feedback from their faculty advisors. Faculty and staff administrators can use the system to collect data about their program and manage the workflow of review and feedback. The system allows students to keep track of progress toward their degree, including information about courses taken, teaching, professional development activities, and scholarly productivity. Much of this information will be automatically imported from other campus databases, reducing the amount of work that students need to do to the stay current. Students can use their profile information to create documents suitable for employment or fellowship applications. For faculty, this system provides a simple interface to track the progress of students whom they supervise. For administrators, the system allows simple access to a wealth of information about the activities of students in their program and helps streamline reporting processes. The system is customizable by departments and programs. It is designed to integrate and simplify existing feedback processes or to encourage units to begin regular evaluations. The Graduate and Professional School provides support and training for departments and programs as they implement the system. More on the system, including instructions for users, can be found on the Graduate and Professional School website’s Doctoral Profile and Feedback System page.

Graduate Mentoring Academy The goal of the Graduate Mentoring Academy is to improve graduate mentoring experiences between students and faculty. The target audiences for the academy are graduate and professional students, faculty, and staff. The Graduate Mentoring Academy is administered by the Graduate and Professional School at Texas A&M University. The Graduate Mentoring Academy (GMA) is a parallel to the Faculty Mentoring Academy (FMA) and uses the Center for the Improvement of Mentored Experiences in Research (CIMER) resources which includes seven evidence-based mentorship competencies. These Graduate and Professional School activities, along with efforts from the Center for Teaching Excellence, and the Division of Research, work to create a culture of mentoring across our institution. GMA workshops are offered in both face-to-face and virtual formats so that all seven competencies can be accessed regardless of location over the course of the year. Workshops are formatted in a learner-centered and engaging format that include case studies, discussion opportunities, and reflection activities. Break out groups are used in the sessions to ensure every group of students, faculty, and staff receives appropriate and differentiated activities and instruction. Students, faculty, and staff can expect to increase their mentoring competence and skills so that they can be better mentors and mentees to others. The goal is to improve the graduate mentoring experiences of our students and increase our mentoring capacity as an institution. Students, faculty, and staff who complete all seven competencies will earn the designation of Graduate Mentoring Academy Fellow, receiving a certificate and a door placard. Graduate Mentoring Academy Fellows will also have the opportunity to gain additional professional development experience to become a Graduate Mentoring Academy Workshop Facilitator. Graduate and professional students who engage in the Graduate mentoring Academy may also earn credit towards G.R.A.D. Aggies certificates.
