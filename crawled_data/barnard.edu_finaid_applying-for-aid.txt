The College considers all sources of income and asset information in determining a family’s ability to pay. Barnard meets full-need for all eligible students with a combination of grant, loan, and job opportunities. 2022-2023 Financial Aid Application Deadlines • November 1, 2021 Early Decision Deadline • February 15, 2022 Regular Decision Deadline • March 15, 2022 Fall Transfer Deadline Please note: Barnard does not offer institutional financial aid to Spring transfer applicants or international transfer applicants. Application Procedure Once a student has submitted the Common Application, the Barnard Admissions Office will email a link to Barnard’s application portal. A Financial Aid Checklist will appear in an applicant’s portal starting in mid-October if a student reports that they intend to apply for financial aid on their admissions application and have reported their Social Security number. The Financial Aid Checklist is a personalized list of all documents required to complete the financial aid application and is updated based on the applicant’s FAFSA and CSS Profile information. Additional requirements may be added as documents are reviewed. All applicants should review their Financial Aid Checklist on a regular basis to ensure all required documents have been received. Domestic First-Year* applicants must submit their documents via the College Board IDOC service. Once you have submitted your CSS Profile, you will receive instructions from the College Board about how to submit your documents to IDOC. All other applicants (International and Fall Transfer applicants) must submit their documents via their Barnard Application Portal via the upload documents feature. *Students who are reapplying as first-year applicants must submit via their Barnard Application Portal. Do not submit via IDOC. Back to top Required Documents for U.S. Citizens & Permanent Residents The main documents required to apply for financial aid are listed below. Additional documents may be requested based on the information reported on your CSS Profile and FAFSA.
