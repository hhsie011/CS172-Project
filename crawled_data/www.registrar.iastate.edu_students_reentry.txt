No. As long as you are returning as an undergraduate student, you simply need to complete a reentry form, even if you wish to change to a different major. The form is available from the link of the left column of this page. If I was academically dismissed will the reentry process allow me to attend ISU? No. Students who left Iowa State in good academic standing may use the reentry process. Students who were academically dismissed and absent from the university more than 12 months must also be reinstated. The reinstatement process applies to students who were dismissed from Iowa State for academic reasons. Will I be assessed the Records and Documents fee? Students reentering will be assessed the Records and Documents Fee unless it was previously assessed during a prior attendance at Iowa State. The Records and Documents fee will be assessed upon entry to the university for all new undergraduate, graduate, and professional students including new direct from high school, transfer, and reentry students).
