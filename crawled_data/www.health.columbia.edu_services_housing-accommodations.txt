Submit a request for housing accommodations; form varies by school: Housing Accommodations Form—Columbia College, Columbia Engineering Housing Accommodations Form—General Studies, Graduate and Professional Schools Housing Accommodations Form—Columbia University Medical Center Also submit: Personal statement that includes all pertinent information related to your accommodations requests and an explanation of how these accommodations will mitigate the impact of your disability and why they are necessary for you to live in University housing Documentation supporting the specific accommodations requests; meeting the requirements outlined in Disability Services documentation guidelines for the student’s disability type. Documentation must establish a direct link between the underlying condition and the requested housing accommodations. Requests for housing accommodations on the basis of an asthma or allergy condition must include a Disability Verification for Asthma and Allergies form completed by the student’s physician. How Accommodations Are Determined In collaboration with Columbia undergraduate and graduate housing departments, accommodation requests are determined by committee on a case-by-case basis, according to documented need and prevailing standards for reasonable accommodations. Housing accommodations are made after a determination of: Student’s disability status Whether student’s disability necessitates adjustments to the living environment Potential alternative accommodations, and what, if any, housing accommodations would be appropriate for the student. Available housing options Housing accommodation requests and documentation are reviewed monthly, generally the first Tuesday of the month. Incomplete applications are not reviewed. Students who submit completed requests after the committee has met for any given month must wait until the following month to have their request reviewed and considered. The committee communicates its decision via an email sent to the student’s Columbia email address by the end of that same week. Expand all Collapse all Frequently Asked Questions I am a graduate student but was not approved for a housing allocation, and I need housing for a disability or medical condition. What should I do? You may request a housing assignment as a housing accommodation. Complete the application process outlined on this page. I have a service/assistance animal. Do I need to request housing accommodations? Students who wish to bring their service/assistance animal to Columbia must be approved for this accommodation through the housing accommodations process before bringing their service/assistance animal onto campus. Read the University Service and Assistance Animal Policy for complete information about related policy, procedures, and expectations. I have a personal care attendant. Do I need to request housing accommodations? Students who wish to have live-in or per diem personal care assistants must be approved for this accommodation before bringing their assistant onto campus. What if I don’t have a disability but have concerns about my current housing situation? Students who do not qualify for disability housing accommodations may apply for an assignment or transfer to a location that may better address their preferences through standard housing procedures: Columbia College and Columbia Engineering undergraduates should contact Housing Services for information on this process. Graduate students and General Studies undergraduates should contact University Apartment Housing. Students matriculated in programs at Columbia University Medical Center should contact the Office of Housing Services. What if I have allergies/asthma? To request accommodations related to allergies or asthma, submit a Verification of Disability Form for Asthma and Allergy Conditions form completed by your doctor. If I am requesting academic, classroom, or campus in addition to housing accommodations, do I need to submit separate documentation? If your need for academic, classroom, or campus accommodations is directly related to your need for housing accommodations, you do not need to submit separate documentation. But your documentation should address the need for all requested accommodations. However, if your need for academic, classroom, or campus accommodations is unrelated to your disability-related need for housing accommodations, separate documentation is required to appropriately address the non-related requests.
