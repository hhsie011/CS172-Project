Log into My Account to determine any permits that may be immediately available. Requests for other lots may be made by adding yourself to a wait list. How do I add myself to a wait list? You can add yourself to a wait list for up to six choices by logging into My Account. When your name reaches the top of the wait list for a lot/garage with a vacancy, you will be notified via TAMU email and offered the opportunity to exchange or purchase the permit available by a given date. You can view your wait list progress through My Account. How can I get bus information? Our Transit Service page includes information regarding on-campus, off-campus, night and weekend routes. You may also visit transport.tamu.edu/busroutes for maps, leave times and real-time bus locations. Are there any areas other than my assigned lot where my permit is valid during the day? (Night permits are NOT VALID during the day) Yes. Your permit is valid in several other lots during the day. Visit our website for the Any Valid Permit Map. NOTE: Night permits are only valid at night, and are not valid in any lot prior to 5 p.m., except during semester breaks. Where can visitors park?
