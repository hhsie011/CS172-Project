There are many things to consider prior to moving forward with dropping a class. Please see the following list of items and make sure that you are aware of everything you may need to take care of as you drop a class. Academic & Financial Impact on degree plan – Will dropping this class delay your degree plan? Check with your Academic Advisor in the Undergraduate Advising Center or in your academic unit. Tuition & course fee charges – Are you eligible for a partial tuition refund? Check the Academic Calendar for refund deadlines, http://registrar.ku.edu/calendar, or contact the Office of the University Registrar for further assistance. Transcript impact – How will this course show up on your transcript after you drop? Depending on when you drop and your program, there can be a record on your official transcript. Take a look at schedule change approvals and deadlines for more information. Undergraduate Advising Center Summerfield Hall, Room 315 785-864-2834 advising@ku.edu Office of the University Registrar KU Visitor Center 785-864-4423 registrar@ku.edu Financial Aid Dropping below full-time status – Could negatively impact grant and/or scholarship aid and may require you to repay some or all of the aid you’ve received so far for the semester. Check with Financial Aid & Scholarships (FAS). Dropping below half-time status – Could negatively impact federal student loan aid and require you start repayment of any existing student loans. Check with FAS. Dropping ANY Coursework will negatively impact your Satisfactory Academic Progress, meaning you may lose eligibility for federal or institutional aid in future semesters. Check with FAS. Departmental & Outside Scholarships or Loans – Many scholarships and private student loans have minimum enrollment requirements. Check with the awarding department, organization, or lender before dropping coursework. Financial Aid & Scholarships KU Visitor Center 785-864-4700 financialaid@ku.edu Student Account Services Strong Hall, Room 23 785-864-3322 stu.account@ku.edu Housing Dropping below full-time enrollment – No longer eligible to live in campus residence or scholarship halls. Check with your Residence Assistant or the University Housing office for details. Canceling housing contract – Just like canceling a rental agreement early, there are financial penalties charged for canceling your housing contract early. Check with University Housing for details on contract cancelation. Canceling / Changing meal plan – Meal plan changes are only allowed very early in the semester or before the semester starts. Check with University Housing for details. University Housing Corbin Hall 785-864-4560 housing@ku.edu Meal Plan Information union.ku.edu/dining/dining-plans Other Considerations Dependent student health insurance – If you are on your parent’s health insurance policy as a dependent, there may be a negative impact for falling below full-time enrollment. Check with your insurance provider for details. Employer tuition assistance – if your, your spouse’s, or your parent’s employer provides tuition assistance, changing your enrollment status could impact your eligibility. Contact the employer’s benefits department for details. Veteran / GI Bill® benefits1 – If you receive educational assistance as either a veteran or current service member, changing your enrollment status could have negative impact on your benefits. For help, start with Veteran Services. International Students – If you are an international student in F-1 or J-1 status, you MUST get permission from International Student Services, Room 2 Strong Hall, BEFORE dropping below full-time in order to maintain legal status.
