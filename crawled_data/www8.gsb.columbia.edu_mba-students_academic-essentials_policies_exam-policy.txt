For the Fall 2021 semester, OSA is implementing that all core exams will be in person, while the elective instructors have the option to choose the modality of their exams (either in person or online). Please note professor availability, as well as ITG/CUIT support windows respectively when taking into consideration when to take your exam, as at certain times (such as 2am ET) these resources may not be available to address technical issues. If it is not possible to reschedule before the end of the exam period due to one of the reasons below (documentation needed if applicable), there are two “Exam Make-up Days” scheduled per term. Please see the MBA Exam area of BOSS for these dates. If the exams cannot be made up during either the exam period or these two days, a grade of zero will be entered for the final exam. Please note: Students who miss an exam or make-up exam for an unexcused reason and do not notify OSA beforehand will receive an F in the class. Exams may be rescheduled during the exam period for the following reasons: Religious observance – no documentation needed Military Service – letter from commanding officer Court appearance – summons from the court Illness – letter needed from student’s doctor stating when the illness began and for how long he/she should be staying home Family emergencies, such as death or serious illness of immediate family member – OSA will determine what kind of documentation is required Communication of an expected absence must be received by OSA by no later than two weeks before the exam period begins. Emergency absences will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Documentation is required as applicable.
