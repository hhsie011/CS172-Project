IMPORTANT: Logic is isolated to a single page and cannot be applied across multiple page forms. For example, if a form is two pages each page can implement it's own logic. However, choices make on page one cannot effect fields visible on page two. FOR SECURITY The CAPTCHA element MUST be added to every form on your site. When adding an element expand the Conditional Logic section NOTE: Only add logic to the elements that need to be visible or invisible based on other field values. Logic is not needed for elements that are always visible. Select the STATE for the element Select the condition from the ELEMENT/SELECTOR dropdown This is a listing of all elements added to the page so far. Select the element from the list that impacts the visibility of the element to which you are adding logic.
