The languages of the city are in constant dialogue with each other. Though there are many political tensions in their use, Marathi, Hindi, Urdu, and Gujarati work together with English to construct the polyphony and multiplicity of daily life in the city. Columbia Global Centers | Mumbai invites you to a talk by author Jerry Pinto where he will discuss his lives in these languages and his experiments in situating himself and implicating his linguistic position. The talk is being organized as part of the Center's Mumbai as a City of Knowledge initiative. About the Speaker Jerry Pinto is an award-winning writer and seasoned journalist whose body of work includes acclaimed novels such as Em and the Big Hoom and Murder in Mahim. He has co-edited Bombay Meri Jaan: Writings on Mumbai with Naresh Fernandes, and his book Helen: The life and Times of an H Bomb, has won the National Award for Best Book on Cinema. Pinto has translated several books from Marathi to English, including Cobalt Blue by Sachin Kundalkar, which was shortlisted for the Crossword Prize for Translation, and a critically acclaimed translation of Daya Pawar’s path-breaking autobiography, Baluta. Other translations include works by Vandana Mishra, Mallika Amar Sheikh and Ganesh Matkari. His translations of Baburao Bagul’s Marathi short stories, The Day I Hid My Caste and Other Stories, and Swadesh Deepak’s I Have Not Seen Mandu, a memoir of madness and recovery written in Hindi, are forthcoming this year.
