Introduction This Policy establishes the accountability of all Users (as defined in the Columbia University Information Security Charter (the “Charter”)) of Columbia University’s Information Resources. It addresses the confidentiality, integrity and availability of such Resources in support of the University’s missions, codifies appropriate usage and establishes the need for Users to respect the rights of others and to be in compliance with other University policies, policies of external networks and resources, and all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations. The University’s Information Resources are provided to support the teaching, learning, clinical and research missions of the University and their supporting administrative functions. Inappropriate use of these Information Resources threatens the atmosphere for the sharing of information, the free exchange of ideas and the security of an environment for creating and maintaining Information Resources. This Policy applies to the access and use of the University’s Information Resources, whether originating from University or non-University Information Resources, including personal computers, as well as the access and use of Information Resources provided by research sponsors to, or leased or hired by, University Users. Additional terms apply to the use of email at the University, as described in the Columbia University Email Usage Policy. Capitalized terms used herein without definition are defined in the Charter.

For reasons relating to compliance, security or legal proceedings (e.g., subpoenas) or in an emergency or in exceptional circumstances, the University’s Office of the General Counsel may authorize the reading, blocking or deleting of University Data. In particular, in the context of a litigation or an investigation, it may be necessary to access University Data with potentially relevant information.
