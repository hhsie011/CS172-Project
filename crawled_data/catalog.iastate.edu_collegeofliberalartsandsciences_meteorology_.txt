The Bachelor of Science Major in Meteorology: The study of meteorology involves the description of the earth’s atmosphere and the processes responsible for its behavior. Students majoring in Meteorology earn a bachelor of science. The major satisfies guidelines specified by the American Meteorological Society and meets education requirements for employment with the National Weather Service and the World Meteorological Organization. Successful preparation for professional or graduate work in Meteorology requires that the student develop and integrate a diverse range of skills and knowledge bases. These include weather observing, the physics and dynamics of the global atmosphere, application of new weather technologies, advanced mathematical tools, computer programming and modeling, and effective oral and written communication. The faculty view the senior thesis (MTEOR 499 Senior Research), in particular, as a capstone experience in which students demonstrate they have achieved this integration. Also, contemporary meteorology is an earth-system science with ties to a variety of human experiences. The electives and general education requirements of the college are further experiences that the meteorology student must integrate with their core meteorology knowledge in order to function effectively in a globally-oriented profession. Meteorology as a Secondary Major: The Meteorology program allows students in academic programs with affinity to meteorology to complete a secondary major in meteorology through an accelerated pathway. Students earning a BS degree in electrical or aerospace engineering who complete the designated Meteorology coursework of at least 25 credit hours can earn a secondary major in Meteorology. Students should work closely with their advisors in each department to ensure that all requirements are met. Please review the information on the department website or contact the current program head for more information and sample four-year plans to earn a secondary major in Meteorology. Student Learning Outcomes Upon graduation, students should be able to: Demonstrate the ability to think critically; Exhibit a broad understanding of atmospheric systems and processes; Demonstrate scientific literacy and its application to scientific inquiry and societal concerns; Demonstrate proficiency in data collection, management, and analysis including understanding sources of error and/or uncertainty; Read and critically evaluate relevant literature and information; Use appropriate tools from chemistry, physics, biology, mathematics, and data science to solve discipline-specific problems; Present information effectively in written and oral forms; Work in a team environment in alignment with the ISU principles of community; Work independently; Attain employment in meteorology, atmospheric science or related fields, or pursue graduate studies.

Minor The department offers a minor in Meteorology which may be earned by completing 15 credits including MTEOR 111 Synoptic Applications (only 1 credit may count toward the minor), MTEOR 206 Introduction to Weather and Climate and MTEOR 301 General Meteorology. The minor must include at least 6 credits in the courses numbered 300 or above taken at Iowa State University and must include at least 9 credits that are not used to meet any other department, college or university requirement. Further information concerning programs of study, including sample degree programs, is available from the department. Concurrent Programs Combined Degrees: A concurrent program is offered which combines a bachelor of science degree in meteorology and a master of science degree in meteorology. This program gives well-qualified Iowa State juniors and seniors the opportunity to begin working on the M.S. degree before completing the B.S. degree, reducing by at least one year the normal time period necessary to complete both degrees separately. Additionally, a concurrent program exists that gives students the opportunity to receive a B.S. in meteorology and an M.B.A. (master of business administration) within five years. Review the department website or contact the current program head for more information regarding these options. Graduate Meteorology The department offers programs leading to the master of science (M.S.) and doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) in Meteorology. Students desiring a major in Meteorology normally will have a strong undergraduate background in the physical and mathematical sciences. Individuals desiring to enter a graduate program are evaluated by considering their undergraduate preparation and performance along with their expressed goals in the statement of purpose. Prospective students are encouraged to reach out to individual faculty members who they wish to work with prior to applying. Programs of study are designed on an individual basis in accordance with the requirements of the Graduate College and established requirements for each departmental major. Additional coursework is normally taken in complementary areas such as aerospace engineering, agronomy (soil science), chemistry, civil and construction engineering, computer engineering, computer science, engineering mechanics, environmental science, materials engineering, mathematics, mechanical engineering, microbiology, physics, or statistics. Departmental requirements provide a strong, broad background in the major and allow considerable flexibility in the program of each individual. A thesis is required of all M.S. candidates, and a dissertation is required of all Ph.D. candidates. Course requirements for the M.S. degree include MTEOR 542 and 543, along with at least four courses from the graduate Meteorology electives (502, 504, 505, 507, 516, 518, 535, 540, 552, 568, 589, or 605) or from outside the department according to the students' professional goals and interests, in consultation with their advisor and POS committee. Students without prior synoptic meteorology course work must complete MTEOR 511 and may substitute these credits in place of other elective courses. Graduates in Meteorology have a good comprehension of basic principles, a capacity for critical and independent thought, and an ability to communicate effectively with scientific colleagues. They have an appropriate breadth in their understanding of meteorology with a suitable specialization. Graduates are able to undertake thorough research and explain the results in a scientifically reasonable fashion.
