Most of our scheduled face-to-face courses offered during the Summer II and August Intersession terms will be delivered online. Students should expect to see these changes reflected in their summer schedules in the coming week. Nonetheless, we are planning to deliver a small number of courses via face-to-face instruction on the TTU campus during Summer II and August Intersession. Most of these are courses such as performance-based studios, science labs, and field activity (including internship) experiences that cannot effectively be delivered online. Departments that have been approved to offer these face-to-face courses have begun planning to ensure compliance with local and state health and safety guidelines. Once departments have developed their plans, those will be shared with students, faculty, and staff who will be present on campus in academic buildings for scheduled face-to-face instruction during the Summer II and August Intersession terms. Additional guidance for students, faculty, and staff specific to attendance policies, passing periods, and use of personal protective equipment will be shared as soon as it is available. If you are a student enrolled in a Summer II or August Intersession course and you have a question about your enrollment, please contact your academic advisor.
