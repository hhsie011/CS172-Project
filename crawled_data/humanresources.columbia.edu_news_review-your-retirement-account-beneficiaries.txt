That’s because your beneficiary designation—not your will—dictates how your retirement assets get distributed. Take a few minutes to make sure the beneficiary information you elected is current so your money will go where you want it to. If you supplied beneficiary information to the University, be sure to update your TIAA and/or Vanguard accounts as well. If you have multiple retirement accounts with the vendors, you must designate a beneficiary for each plan account. Updating Your Beneficiaries To update your beneficiaries, contact or go to TIAA and/or Vanguard directly.
