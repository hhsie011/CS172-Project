PublicDemoS Project explores the ways in which Public Space allows the appearance of actors and manifestation of cultural differences. New forms of public agency and visibility extend politics to everyday life experiences, opening up avenues for artistic expressions and creative accommodations. A transversal and intercultural approach opens up new ways of thinking politics, modes of empowerment of citizens and creation of commons. In multicultural settings, the democratic agendas are renewed by politics of performative citizenship and public making.
