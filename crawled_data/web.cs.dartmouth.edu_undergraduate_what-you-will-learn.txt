Funding & Sponsorship Opportunities Share What You Will Learn As A Computer Science Major You will recognize that computational techniques apply to diverse problems, and you will be able to determine which techniques to apply in a given situation. You will know how to develop computational models, abstractions, and representations of information. You will be able to design and implement efficient and elegant solutions to computational problems. You will have the skills to diagnose, analyze, and correct failures in software systems. You can gain practice in efficiently communicating to a technical audience, as well as to a non-technical audience, both in writing and orally. You will know the fundamentals of computer architectures, programming languages, and operating systems, thereby enabling you to stay abreast of changes in approaches and technology. You will have facility with fundamental mathematical modeling and algorithmic techniques, and you will understand the limits of what is computable with given resources. As A Digital Arts Minor You will learn about the principles, aesthetics, and practice of the digital arts in our rapidly changing world of 3D animation, special effects, social media, digital music and games. Most of you will learn about 3D computer modeling and animation. Many of you will learn how to design and develop content for cool technology tools or learn how to build the tools yourself. You will work with students from different disciplines and backgrounds. If you are an artist, you will learn a bit about coding. If you are a coder, you will learn a bit about art and if you are somewhere in-between, you will feel at home as we navigate and translate between art, technology, science, music and society. You will complete a minor that is comprehensive and deep, through focused assignments that demand technical proficiency and high production values. You will gain an understanding of technical concepts in order to achieve optimal control over the tools being used to create digital art.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Computer Science Undergraduate Overview What You Will Learn Advice & Contact Declaring your CS Major/Minor Programs The Major Modified Majors The Minors Honors Program AIT-Budapest for Dartmouth Students Courses Upcoming Class Schedule Prizes Previous Winners Considering Graduate School?
