It’s an opportunity for anyone carrying grief at BC to get to see that they’re far from alone in this experience. Participants meet weekly in small groups in a private setting to listen and share whatever they’d like with each other about their experience of grief, guided by a facilitator. Carrying grief in college can feel so isolating; sharing it can help. Groups meet six times throughout the semester, and form according to people’s schedules. If you're interested, contact Rick Rossi to get connected.
