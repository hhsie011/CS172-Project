When you move off campus, you automatically acquire the responsibility to be a good neighbor. Keep in mind that you live in a diverse neighborhood of students, professionals, families with children, as well as possibly older and retired individuals. Get to know your neighbors! Whether you live in the University neighborhood or commute from a nearby location, Student Living can provide assistance in making the most of your off-campus residential experience, including providing a comprehensive off-campus housing search site. We provide services to support your independence and help you engage in the greater Syracuse community, as well as on campus. Student Living can support your experience through hosting and promotion of events and involvement opportunities, winter weather preparation, landlord and tenant relations, safety, budget planning, apartment searches, and more.
