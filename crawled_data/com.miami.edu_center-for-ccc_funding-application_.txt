The funding will become available immediately after award decisions are made and must be spent within the award cycle funding period. Criteria Evaluation of proposals will be based on the following criteria: Lead applicant is an SoC faculty member of the Center and at least two SOC departments or two University of Miami disciplines are meaningfully represented. Proposed project represents a significant collaboration across disciplines. In other words, project could not be accomplished without the participation of faculty from at least two disciplines. Potential of the research to lead to a viable external funding application.

Specific external funding mechanism for future project is identified. Strong evaluation component must be present. Research methodology used is appropriate for the research questions or hypotheses advanced. Writing of the proposal is clear. Timeline for project is feasible. Budget is clearly justified. Additional Criteria Proposals that include the following criteria will be evaluated more favorably: Project focuses on populations within Miami, the Caribbean, Central America, and/or South America. Meaningful involvement by one or more graduate or undergraduate students or classes. Strong likelihood that the project will yield data that can be used to strengthen a future external grant proposal. Evaluation All proposals will be evaluated by the internal advisory board of the Center for Communication, Culture, and Change, based on the criteria outlined above. Applicants who serve on the advisory board will recuse themselves from the evaluation of grant applications in the current round.
