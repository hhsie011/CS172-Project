Our overarching mission is to empower LGBTQIA+ folks at Brown University studying or working in STEM fields to succeed personally, academically, and professionally. We aim to achieve this mission by building a community of LGBTQIA+ students, faculty, staff, and alumni and by developing initiatives that foster innovation, leadership, and advocacy as it relates to gender and sexual identity both within individual departments and across the university. Along with the benefits of creating a space for LGBTQIA+ individuals in STEM to connect, our group works to provide professional development resources specifically tailored to navigating STEM careers as an out LGBTQIA+ individual. By leveraging connections with LGBTQIA+ alumni and other professionals, we host panels, discussions, and workshops where students can gain professional insight and guidance. In the long-term we aim to equip members of the group with the skills and confidence necessary to be visible in their respective fields of study both here at Brown, and beyond, and to continue to promote diversity and inclusion across a broad range of professions.
