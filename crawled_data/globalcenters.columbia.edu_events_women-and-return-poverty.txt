While women's rights are already suppressed across the world, the pandemic has exacerbated these situations in the region during lockdowns and in an absence of adequate response. The unabated rise of gender inequalities such as burdens of running a household, spousal abandonment, loss of work and income, lack of access to healthcare in relation to reproductive health, among others have led to a ripple effect on the societies at large. In addition, with closure of schools, the reports of adolescent pregnancies, child and forced marriages in sub-Saharan countries have also sky-rocketed. From this stems a need to host a discussion on the measures to address the impact of the pandemic and the lockdown, which has put women and girls in more vulnerable positions and let them slide into poverty further. The main objectives of the webinar are to voice the experiences of women and girls during a pandemic, as well as to discuss strategies for smart, affordable, and urgent choices that public policy practitioners can make to reverse the impact of the pandemic on women and girls.
