The motor unit utilized small sprint-type motorcycles, three wheeled motorcycles and the traditional Harley Davidson police motors to patrol campus. The motor unit was disbanded in the late 1970’s, when a motor officer was seriously injured in a traffic crash. After almost thirty years without a motor unit, a new motor unit was established in 2004, when FSUPD purchased two new BMW F650GS police motors. One of the main priorities of establishing this new motor unit was safety and training, so two officers were selected and the had to attend and pass the eighty hour ITPM Police Motorcycle Operator's Course. Since the motor unit has been reestablished, it has been a great success. In late 2005, FSUPD acquired three new 2006 Harley Davidson Road King police motors, which expanded the motor unit to five operators. In 2008 FSUPD acquired two more new Harley Davidson Road King police motors and the BMW’s were phased out. There are currently five motor officers assigned to the motor unit and two of the motor officers are IPTM Police Motorcycle Instructors. The motor unit also has a certified Harley Davidson service technician on staff. The motor unit conducts eight hours of motorcycle training per month. The motorcycle training changes monthly and may consist of: cone courses, emergency braking exercises, off-road riding, escort procedures, crash avoidance exercises, traffic stop procedures and weapons handling/tactics on the police motor. The motor unit participates in police motorcycle training seminars and competitions. The motor unit has won numerous awards for their performance and motorcycle handling skills. The motor unit is currently part of the FSUPD Patrol Division. A motor officer’s main duties are to patrol campus, answer calls for service, conduct traffic enforcement and interact with the campus community.
