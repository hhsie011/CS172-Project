In the course of her tenure, Merkel became a symbol of unity for Europe and weathered complicated relationships with many world leaders. At this critical juncture, what lessons can be drawn from Merkel’s leadership? Can her legacy provide inspiration to those who are concerned about the future of democracy and security in Europe? To explore these questions, renowned writer Kati Marton, whose recent biography of Angela Merkel, The Chancellor – The Remarkable Odyssey of Angela Merkel (Simon and Schuster, 2021), was published last fall to critical acclaim, will be joined by Michael Broening, Executive Director, Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung New York Office, and Sheri Berman, Professor of Political Science at Barnard College. This event is jointly presented by Columbia Global Centers | Paris, the Sciences Po American Foundation, the European Institute, the Alliance Program, and the Maison de l'Europe de Paris.
