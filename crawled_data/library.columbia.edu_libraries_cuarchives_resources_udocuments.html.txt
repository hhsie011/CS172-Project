New York, 1932. Minutes of the Board of Trustees The University Archives maintains copies of all of the Minutes of the Board of Trustees from 1754 to the present. These are a particularly useful tool for tracing the history of a department, a specific school's development, or university governance. The Minutes provide official information about numerous topics in the history of Columbia including university governance (e.g., changes to the University statutes), teaching appointments, awards of honorary degrees and certain prizes, endowments, donations of money and materials, real estate purchases, appointments to the Board of Trustees and its various committees, and construction projects. The minutes also often comment (both directly and indirectly) on major national events (e.g. Abraham Lincoln's assassination) and include resolutions of appreciation for significant individuals, usually associated with the Board. Minutes created since 2005-2006 are in electronic format only. Due to the nature of these records, Trustee Minutes are closed for 50 years after their creation. Gifts and bequests: land, buildings and equipment, 1754-1928 (1929). Compiled in the office of the Treasurer.

New York: Printed for the Trustees, 1903. Annual Reports The Annual Reports of the President to the Trustees offer a yearly "state of the University" from 1865 to 1948. The tradition of a printed "Annual report of the President of Columbia College made to the Board of Trustees" started with University President Frederick A.P. Barnard. The reports include current events, facts and figures of students enrolled and degrees conferred, and as well as trends in each school. In addition to the President's remarks, the later reports include the Treasurer's financial reports and also each Dean reports to the President on the previous academic year at their school or division (Columbia College, Law, Business, Journalism, Barnard, Teachers College, etc.) as well as reports from the Librarian, the Registrar, the Secretary and other senior administrators. You can find access to the paper copies and links to the online reports from 1865-1948 in the President's Annual Reports finding aid. Catalogues Catalogue of the Officers and Students of Columbia College, also known as the Handbook of Information and sometimes, the Catalogue and General Announcement, is essentially a "snapshot" of the University in a given year. These publications usually include the list of trustees, officers of instruction, and administrators. They also contain information about the curriculum in the various programs, detail admission policies and requirements, explain degree and certificate programs, note tuition fees, list prizes and scholarships, provide a copy of the academic calendar, and describe general regulations of the university. In the handbooks from the 19th century you can often find lists of students and sometimes alumni. From 1893-94 to 1918-19 one can find regularized registers of students listed for each school. In addition to the register of students, the Catalogue also includes a list of the degrees conferred at the last commencement. For each year starting in 1893-94, the staff and student directories can found at the back of each volume. Full names of students appear beginning in the 1919-20 volume. Between 1893-94 and 1918-19 the student directories only list the first initial and the full last name since full name information is found in the school specific student registers. Paper copies are available at the University Archives. 1848 1849 1850 1851 1852-1853 1853-1854 1854-1855 1855-1856 1856-1857 1857-1858 1858-1859 1859-1860 1860-1861 1861-1862 1862-1863 1863-1864 1864-1865 1865-1866 1866-1867 1867-1868 1868-1869 1869-1870 1870-1871 1871-1872 1872-1873 1873-1874 1874-1875 1875-1876 1876-1877 1877-1878 Handbook 1878 Register 1878-1879 Handbook 1879 Register 1879-1880 Handbook 1880 Register 1880-1881 Handbook 1881 Register 1881-1882 Handbook 1882 Register 1882-1883 Handbook 1883 Register 1883-1884 Handbook 1884 Register 1884-1885 Handbook 1885 Register 1885-1886 Handbook 1886-1887 Register 1886-1887 Handbook 1887-1888 Register 1887-1888 Handbook 1888-1889 Register 1888-1889 Handbook 1889-1890 Register 1889-1890 Handbook 1890-1891 1891-1892 1892-1893 1893-1894 1894-1895 1895-1896 1896-1897 1897-1898 1898-1899 1899-1900 1900-1901 1901-1902 1902-1903 1903-1904 1904-1905 1905-1906 1906-1907 1907-1908 1908-1909 1909-1910 1910-1911 1911-1912 1912-1913 1913-1914 1914-1915 1915-1916 1916-1917 1917-1918 1918-1919 1919-1920 1920-1921 1921-1922 1922-1923 1923-1924 1924-1925 1925-1926 1926-1927 1927-1928 1928-1929 1929-1930 1930-1931 1931-1932 1932-1933 1933-1934 1934-1935 1935-1936 1936-1937 1937-1938 1938-1939 1939-1940 1940-1941 1941-1942 and 1942-1943 1943-1944 and 1944-1945 * Between 1878 and 1890, Columbia published two separate volumes: one was a Handbook of Information as to the Course of Instruction (course catalogue) and the other was an Annual Register (trustee, faculty and student directory). The volumes were merged again for 1891-1892 Hanbook of information, which included the Register of Students for 1890-1891.
