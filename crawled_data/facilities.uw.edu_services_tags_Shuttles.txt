Our COVID-19 safety protocols include: Face coverings continue to be required for all passengers and drivers on Health Sciences Express, UW/Fred Hutch South Lake Union and Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA) shuttles. This is because these shuttles primarily serve as an extension of healthcare settings, serving patients and healthcare workers, where face coverings continue to be required per state law and UW policy. For all other UW shuttle services, masks are recommended for all, including drivers. Mask use on these other shuttles will align with the UW’s general face covering policy. Daily COVID-19 symptom screening of employees before entering the workplace. Employees are required to stay home if they have COVID-19 symptoms or have been instructed to quarantine or isolate. Full daily cleaning and disinfection of high touch surfaces (hand rails and hand holds, arm rests, etc.) before and after each shift. Hand sanitizing supplies provided for passengers and drivers. We encourage all our valued customers to follow these best practices: Get vaccinated. Stay home if you have COVID-19 symptoms or if you have been instructed to isolate or quarantine by a public health professional. Wear a face covering while inside and boarding/disembarking from the shuttle. Maintain distance from other passengers when possible. Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before and after riding.
