Carnell Professor of Journalism 316 Annenberg Hall ckitch@temple.edu 215-204-8346 This minor serves students in other majors who would benefit from a deeper understanding of journalism's role in society.

It offers students headed toward a range of careers — for instance, community advocacy work, teaching, media research, law, policymaking, public history, global development, and many other fields — a valuable perspective on how contemporary issues in journalism will impact their roles as citizens and professionals.
