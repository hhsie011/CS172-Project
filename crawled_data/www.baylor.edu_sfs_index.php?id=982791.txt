How do I sign up for DUO 2-Factor Authentication? Visit baylor.edu/its/weduo and follow the instructions. You'll need to do this in order to access all of your information in BearWeb. When you log in to DUO, you'll use your Bear ID (example: first_last3) and password. More Information: https://www.baylor.edu/helpdesk/index.php?id=982134 2. Where is my Parent BU Financial Aid PIN? The Parent BU Financial Aid PIN is only sent to parents of students who are dependents based on their FAFSA responses. It is emailed to the Parent email address provided on the FAFSA. If you are an independent student, you will not need a parent PIN. If you are a dependent, the parent listed on your latest FAFSA should have received a notification with their Parent BU Parent PIN at their email address and mailing address on the FAFSA. If your parent cannot locate their PIN, your parent should contact our office to request a PIN reset. If your parent on the FAFSA needs to change the email address on the FAFSA, please have your parent contact our office. More Information: https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/filling-out/dependency 3. How do I access and electronically sign for my requirements? To access your requirements, visit bearweb.baylor.edu and follow these steps: Student Financial Services > Financial Aid > NEW Financial Aid Dashboard > Select Award Year > Home. Be sure to select the correct aid year that has the unsatisfied requirements. Once you click on the name of the requirements, you will be redirected to the Conflicting Information and Verification (CIV) workbook where you can complete and electronically sign the form using your student PIN and your parent's PIN, if applicable. More Information: https://bearweb.baylor.edu/ 4. How will I know Baylor received my documents for processing? You can monitor the status of the documents through BearWeb. Once we receive your document, the status should reflect "received, not yet processed" within 24 business hours. More Information: https://bearweb.baylor.edu/ 5. When will the document be processed? Documents are processed in the order received and it may take a few weeks. We make every effort to complete processing as soon as possible. 6. The only requirement I have left is Entrance Counseling and I already completed this requirement. Why do I continue to receive Missing Information emails? The Entrance Counseling requirement is not updated immediately after completion; the requirement should be updated by May 1. If you have already completed entrance counseling and listed Baylor to receive confirmation, you may disregard these requirement messages. 7. Is my Baylor Financial Aid PIN the same as the FSA ID PIN? The Student BU Financial Aid PIN is issued by Baylor and IS NOT the same as your FSA ID. The FSA ID is the username and password you use on the federal student aid website studentaid.gov, and on the myStudentAid mobile app. More Information: https://studentaid.gov/ 8. What should I do if my FAFSA mailing address is incorrect? If the mailing address provided on the FAFSA is incorrect, you will need to resubmit the FAFSA with the updated information.
