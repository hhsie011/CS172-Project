Academic Calendar Registration Final Exam Schedule Through its varied activities, the office works closely with the offices of the Provost, Information Technology, Admission, Student Financial Services, the College Deans and the University Freshman Center. Services The Office is responsible for the accuracy and integrity of the University's official student records. Our chief responsibilities fall into six broad categories: registration; record-keeping; enrollment verifications and transcripts; course offerings; classrooms scheduling; and graduation. The Office of the Registrar provides the following services: Facilitates the University course registration processes; Maintains student academic records and mails student report cards each semester; Guarantees the accuracy, integrity, and confidentiality of student records in adherence to state and federal regulations; Produces transcripts and enrollment verifications for students and alumni; and Reports student enrollment information to the National Student Clearinghouse for loan providers, employers, background screening firms, and health insurance providers. Resources Confidentiality Matters Click to Open St. John's University takes our obligation to safeguard the confidentiality of student information very seriously. We go beyond the requirements of the federal law that governs access to this information. In general, we will not release any information about you without your prior written consent. There are only two exceptions: First, we may confirm the following directory information: Dates of attendance Degrees or honors received Your major Please note that we will never volunteer this information. Under no circumstances will we give anyone your social security number, your GPA, the courses you took, or the grades you received. If you want someone to see your GPA, courses, and/or grades, you must ask us to send that person or agency a transcript. If you do not want us to confirm even this minimum directory information without your prior written consent, you must request this in writing at one of the following addresses: Students and Alumni of the Queens, Manhattan, and Rome Campuses Office of the Registrar St. John’s University 8000 Utopia Parkway Queens, NY 11439 Attn: FERPA Desk Students and Alumni of the Staten Island Campus Office of the Registrar St. John’s University Kelleher Center 300 Howard Avenue Staten Island, NY 10301 Attn: FERPA Desk Please note that if you ask us to withhold directory information, we will not be able to confirm your enrollment or degrees for enrollment purposes, health plans, or other verifications of status. The only other time that we may release information about you without your prior written consent is under those circumstances specified by federal law. For additional information about FERPA, the federal law that governs the release of student education records, click here or write to the following address: Family Policy Compliance Office U.S. Department of Education 400 Maryland Avenue, S.W. Washington, DC 20202-4605 For more information about our policy and the governing federal law, consult the Policies/Procedures section of the current University Student Handbook. Enrollment and Degree Verification Click to Open St. John’s University is required to submit loan information to the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS), and that information is accessible by guaranty agencies, lenders, and institutions determined to be authorized users of the data system. Third Party Agencies The National Student Clearinghouse is an authorized agent for St. John’s University and is approved to provide degree and enrollment verifications. If you are a third party agency requesting this information, please visit the National Student Clearinghouse's Verification Services website at https://nscverifications.org/. If you have questions or need further assistance, please contact the National Student Clearinghouse via phone (703-742-4200) or fax (703-742-4239). Students and Alumni St. John’s University is pleased to provide enrollment and degree verifications free of charge to all student and alumni. There are three ways you can order an enrollment or degree verification: online, in-person, or through the mail. Online Requests Current students may order enrollment and degree verifications via the Web. To do so, sign into signon.stjohns.edu and click on the UIS icon. Under the Student tab click on "Student Records”. From the "Student Records" menu, select “Request an Enrollment Verification.” Recent alumni who continue to have access to UIS may also order enrollment and degree verifications online. In-Person Requests On the Queens campus, the Office of the Registrar is located in Newman Hall, room 102, which is through the breezeway adjacent to the Welcome Center. On the Staten Island campus, the Registrar is located on the first floor of the Kelleher Center. Mail-In Requests Students and alumni of the Queens, Manhattan, and Rome Campuses St. John’s University Office of the Registrar 300 Howard Avenue Staten Island, NY 10301 Attn: Verifications Desk Students and alumni of the Staten Island Campus St. John’s University Office of the Registrar 300 Howard Avenue Staten Island, NY 10301 Attn: Verifications Desk When requesting a verification by mail, please be sure to provide the following information: Full name and any other name used while at St. John’s University "X number" - If you don't know this number, give us the last four digits of your Social Security number. Dates of attendance Division of the University you attended Degrees you received Address and a phone number at which you can be reached Best times to call you The name and address of the person to whom you want us to send the verification Please be sure to sign your request. Please note we only verify your dates of attendance, degrees and honors received, and your major. If you need verification of the courses you took, the grades you received, or your GPA, you must request a transcript. Current students can view their entire academic record and student advisement report by signing into signon.stjohns.edu and clicking on the UIS icon. Social Security Number A Public Notice about Social Security Numbers New York State Education Law prohibits the use of the Social Security number for identification purposes. Additionally, the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) prohibits the release of the Social Security number without a student's prior written consent. Neither the State of New York nor the Federal government requires the release of Social Security numbers except in a few carefully defined situations, chiefly related to verification of entitlement to financial aid. Because of the above and because the Social Security number is not a part of a student's educational history, the Office of the Registrar at St. John's University does not confirm or in any other way make reference to or reveal a student's Social Security number. When we confirm or verify a student's enrollment or the award of a degree, we certify academic information that our records contain, information that originates with us and that we have authority over. If, for example, we confirm that St. John's University awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree to Jane Doe on May 15, 2002, we assert that our records indicate that a person with this name received the degree indicated on the noted date. We do not, nor should we, authenticate anyone's identity.

Graduation, Commencement, and Diplomas Click to Open Conferral of Degrees/Graduation The University confers degrees three times a year: January, May and September. Summer degrees are conferred on the last business day of September and fall degrees are conferred on the last business day of January. Spring conferral dates are announced each year to coincide with the University's Commencement ceremonies. Since the University confers degrees at various times throughout the year, students should consult with their dean's office for dates when diplomas will be available for pick-up. Unclaimed diplomas will be kepts for five years from the date of award, after which they will be destroyed. Gradautes who request an unclaimed diploma after it has been destroyed will have to pay the replacement fee in effect at the time of the request. It should be noted that a replacement diploma may not be identical in all respects to the original. Commencement The University holds Commencement Ceremonies in May for the Queens and Staten Island campus graduates. If you plan to attend your Commencement Ceremony, you will need to register online at stjohns.edu/commencement. Registration for Commencement begins in March.

For this reason beginning with the Fall 2018 semester, the University enabled students to use a Preferred Name where possible in the course of University business and education. Students may request this service by completing a Preferred Name Change Request form (PDF) in person in the Office of the Registrar. The student’s Preferred First Name and/or Middle Name may be used in many University contexts, such as Canvas, class roster and ID Cards. Please note the University is legally required to use student's Legal Name for official records, however, whenever reasonably possible a student’s Preferred Name will be used. Frequently Asked Questions What is a Preferred Name? A Preferred Name is a name a student wishes to be known by in the University community that is different from a student’s Legal Name. St. John’s University policy covers Preferred First Name and/or Middle Name. Students who wish to change their Legal Name can obtain information from the Office of the Registrar. What is a Legal Name? A Legal Name is the name that appears on your passport, driver’s license, birth certificate, or U.S. Social Security Card. Do I have to use a Preferred Name? No. Use of a Preferred Name is optional. Where will my Preferred Name be used? Class Rosters Blackboard & Canvas University ID cards Grading Rosters Email address Student Housing Judicial Case Management Where will my Legal Name be used?

Electronic Transcripts (PDF) Electronic Transcripts (PDF) are now available. Delivery is within hours of the request being processed. Electronic Transcripts are $6 per copy, payable by credit card only. St. John’s University has partnered with Parchment for electronic transcript delivery. Click here to order an eTranscript.

Requestors will receive an email confirmation when the transcript is available for the recipient to download and another email when the transcript has been downloaded by the recipient. PDF document delivery is becoming increasingly common across institutions, organizations, and agencies. However, before requesting PDF transcript delivery, please verify that the recipient will accept an electronic transcript. Additionally, it is important that you verify the correct email address for transmission of the transcript. Official PDF transcripts are transmitted electronically to the recipient and is intended solely for use by the recipient. The official transcript has been digitally signed and therefore contains special characteristics. The Blue Ribbon Symbol is assurance that the digital certificate is valid, the document is authentic, and the contents of the transcript have not been altered. If the transcript does not display a valid certification and signature message an invalid digital certificate display means either the digital signature is not authentic, or the document has been altered. The digital signature can also be revoked by the transcript office if there is cause, and digital signatures can expire. A document with an invalid digital signature display should be rejected. Lastly, one other possible message, Author Unknown, can have two possible meanings: The certificate is a self-signed certificate or has been issued by an unknown or untrusted certificate authority and therefore has not been trusted, or the revocation check could not complete. If this message is received make sure there is a proper connection to the internet. If there is a connection and the digital signature cannot be validated, reject the document. Any questions with electronic transcripts please call: 847-716-3005.

Transcript Questions: Undergraduate and Graduate students email [email protected]. Law School students email [email protected]. New York State's "Enough is Enough" Legislation Effective October 5, 2015, New York State Legislation Article 129-B requires that, based on selected student conduct findings, all colleges and universities add notations to student transcripts. Through St. John’s University’s student conduct process, students found responsible for crimes of violence, including but not limited to, sexual violence will have the following transcript notations added: Suspension Notation: Suspended after the finding of responsibility for a code of conduct violation. Expulsion Notation: Expelled after the finding of responsibility for a code of conduct violation. Notation if student withdraws from St John’s University while the investigation of the complaint is pending: Withdrew with conduct charges pending. Those seeking the removal of a transcript notation for a suspension must submit a written appeal to the Office of the Registrar. All such appeals will be reviewed by the Transcript Appeals Committee comprised of the Dean of Students or designee, the University Registrar or designee, and other University administrators as deemed appropriate. Suspension notations will not be removed prior to one year after the conclusion of the suspension. Expulsion notations are permanent. If a finding of responsibility is vacated, for any reason, any related transcript notations will be removed. Transcript Notations: Significantly, Article 129-B mandates that higher education institutions include notations on the transcripts of students found responsible through the institution’s conduct process for crimes of violence, including, but not limited to, sexual violence, as set forth in 20 U.S.C. 1092(f)(1)(F)(i)(I)-(VIII) of the Clery Act. Such transcript notations must state “suspended after the finding of responsibility for a code of conduct violation” or “expelled after a finding of responsibility for a code of conduct violation,” as applicable. Should the student withdraw from the higher education institution while the investigation of the complaint is pending, his or her transcript must note “withdrew with conduct charges pending.” Higher education institutions must have in place written policies regarding such transcript notations, which, at a minimum, provide an appeals process for students seeking removal of such notations in accordance with Article 129-B. Student Advisement Reports Click to Open Student Advisement Reports - DegreeWorks Student Advisement Reports powered by DegreeWorks is a web-based program that enables you to easily track your academic progress. The report generated by DegreeWorks is an unofficial guide and source of information on degree requirements and GPAs which is a valuable tool for students and their advisors to enhance the advisement process. Students will be able to see how specific program requirements have been met and what courses still need to be taken to fulfill their requirements. Additionally, information on advisement reports is "real-time" - accurate at the point in time the report is run. Accessing Student Advisement Reports in DegreeWorks Students may access their Student Advisement Report through signon.stjohns.edu. Once logged in to signon.stjohns.edu students can click the "DegreeWorks" widget to access the Student Advisement Report. Students will be able to view previous reports, generate a new report, or complete a "What-If Analysis". Note: Students who started before Summer/Fall 2016 and students enrolled in the Graduate School of Education may access their report by selecting "Advisement Report (CAPP)" under the Student Advisement menu located in UIS after logging into signon.stjohns.edu. Students should follow the prompts to enter the appropriate term and proceed to view previous reports, generate a new report, or complete a "What-If Analysis". To access captions, please toggle the "CC" button on the right-hand side of the video player. Accuracy of Student Advisement Reports Although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of Student Advisement Reports, these reports remain unofficial guides to degree progress. Students and advisors remain responsible for ensuring that all degree requirements are satisfied. No degree will be automatically awarded based on a Student Advisement Report. Determinations to award or withhold degrees will continue to be made in each of the University's colleges according to its established policies and procedures. Students should inform their advisors or deans of concerns about the information on their advisement reports. Reading Student Advisement Reports in DegreeWorks Student Advisement Reports are divided into different areas. These may vary by program. Typical areas are the major area, the core area, and elective credits applicable to this degree. About the GPA For each area, the advisement report gives a GPA, which is calculated solely from the grades in that area. This GPA is accurate for the grades shown but is not an official GPA - it is for informational purposes only. The "Insufficient" section at the bottom of the advisement report shows all courses that have not been used to satisfy a degree requirement. This includes failed courses and those courses from which a student has withdrawn. These grades may count in a student's official GPA, major GPA, or honors GPA. Note: The overall and program GPA's shown at the top of the advisement report include all grades in all courses taken. Checking Your Degree Requirements If a student has two (2) degrees, a report will need to be executed for each program. Degree requirements for any given program may remain the same or may change from year to year. Changes may be minor or significant. As changes are coded, the advisement report will automatically take any changes into account. To see a complete list of currently available programs, select the "What-If Analysis" option. What-If Analysis If a student is contemplating switching from their current major to another one a “What-if Analysis” should be run and will displays academic requirements for that major. The “What-if Analysis” feature shows how many program requirements have already been satisfied if a change of major is of interest. A “What-if Analysis” may be run against any available program. To access captions, please toggle the "CC" button on the right-hand side of the video player.
