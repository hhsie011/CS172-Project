The Albright Entrepreneurs Village (AEV), located on Centennial Campus, is NC State‚Äôs living and learning community for student entrepreneurs. AEV provides sophomores and above the opportunity to experience entrepreneurship on and off-campus. Residents have the opportunity to explore their interests in a supportive community. Specialized programming includes mentorship and networking events, trips and tours, and regular meetings with alumni and startup founders. Villagers also benefit from joining like-minded peers, and peer mentors, and having access to competitions and social events all designed to expand your entrepreneurial skills and mindset in a fun environment. Village Benefits EI 100 VILLAGE COURSE The Village offers a 1-credit class during the fall semester of your first year at AEV that brings in speakers and focuses on identifying entrepreneurial opportunities and skill-building to maximize your time in the AEV. VILLAGE TRADITIONS The village also hosts year-round community socials, has a private Slack channel to communicate, and has been known to throw an awesome end-of-year BBQ, among other traditions! HANDS-ON EXPERIENCE The Village promotes entrepreneurial thinking and leadership development through ‚Äúhands-on‚Äù activities and community speakers to gain valuable knowledge. The Village also offers design simulations and competitions with prizes to support students building ventures and encourages skill development across all disciplines and career pathways.

Past annual trips have included Washington D.C. and Chicago.
