We invite you to explore the services, opportunities and resources available to you throughout the various stages of your Husky Experience. Undocumented students are immigrants who entered the United States without inspection or overstayed their visas and are present in the United States with or without their parents. They face unique legal uncertainties and limitations within the U.S. educational system. The majority of undocumented students are characterized as youth that were brought to the United States by their parents at an early age and have lived in this country for a significant portion of their lives, learning the language and adapting to the same American customs taught to other students in schools. Many undocumented students are resilient individuals who have gone through the K-12 system, excel academically in high schools and wish to pursue a college education.
