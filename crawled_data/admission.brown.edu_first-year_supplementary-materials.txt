Music or Visual Art Submissions If you are accomplished in music or visual art, you may include additional supplements with your application in the Common Application through SlideRoom. You do not need to wait for access to your Brown Applicant Portal to upload music or visual art materials to SlideRoom. When submitting through SlideRoom, you must create your SlideRoom account and begin your application on or before November 1 for Early Decision and January 5 for Regular Decision. The Early Decision material submission deadline is November 4 and the Regular Decision material submission deadline is January 10. QuestBridge applicants submitting a music and/or visual arts portfolio(s) should use the QuestBridge program(s) in SlideRoom. Music Submission Details Visual Art Submission Details Academic Paper/Research Abstract If you have completed an advanced academic paper or significant research project that you want to include as part of your application, you may upload that document or an abstract to your Brown Applicant Portal under the category of Academic Paper/Research. Please include a brief note to provide us with context for your submission, for example: approximate date(s) you were involved, whether you worked on this independently or as part of a team, what external recognition you may have received and anything else you want us to know. Dance, Theatre Arts and Performance Studies While many Brown students are accomplished in the performing arts and pursue dance and theater in and out of the classroom, auditions and portfolios are neither required nor reviewed for students interested in Dance and Theatre Arts and Performance Studies. All Other Supplementary Materials We prefer that you upload all other supplementary materials to your file after you receive access to your Brown Applicant Portal. We recommend that you do not send a collection of award certificates or similar materials. If you have a YouTube video you'd like to share, or maintain an online presence that showcases your background, talents or creativity, please include that link in the Brown University Questions (Activities) section of the Common Application. One optional letter of recommendation may be requested and submitted through the Common Application. Any additional supplementary recommendations should be sent directly by your recommender, either as a PDF emailed to documents@brown.edu or by fax to 401-863-9300. Be sure to ask your recommender to include your full name, date of birth and high school in their letter so that we can match the letter to your application.
