We've provided the resources below as a starting point for exploring opportunities to receive financial aid from external sources. We strongly advise international students to research the many available funding options, and to determine your ability to secure funding before applying to Boston College.

International Education Financial Aid This site lists over 1,000 scholarships, grants, and awards for international students. Loan Information It is possible for international students to acquire loans from U.S. lending organizations. In some situations, you must apply with a credit-worthy U.S. citizen or permanent resident as a co-borrower. Private loans are available through several lending agencies. Most loans carry a variable interest rate, but there are some that offer fixed-rate loans. Interest rates can also vary widely from lender to lender for the same borrower. We recommend that students interested in a private loan compare rates carefully and know what their monthly repayment schedule will be. For more information on private loans, including application and disbursement, visit the Private Educational Loans tab on the Undergraduate Financial Aid web page. Note: Boston College does not recommend any particular lender or group of lenders to its students and families.
