Exercise physiology is the scientific study of acute physiological responses and chronic adaptations to a wide range of exercise conditions. Exercise physiologists use exercise as a non-invasive means to investigate changes in physiologic systems, organs, tissues, cells, organelles and molecules. Exercise physiologists with a clinical interest study the effect of exercise on pathology and the mechanisms by which exercise can reduce or reverse disease progression. Exercise physiologists discover health and fitness benefits from different doses and types of physical activity and exercise. Advances in sports performance, recovery from intense and prolonged training and adaptations to extreme environmental conditions can be largely attributed to the field of exercise physiology. Exercise physiology provides a strong academic foundation for individuals interested in careers in science, medicine, pharmacy, physical therapy, cardiac rehabilitation, diabetes and weight management, lifestyle behavior changes, sports physiology, coaching and other health- and fitness-related professions. Students who wish to pursue the Masters of Science degree in Exercise Physiology must have graduated from an accredited four-year institution with a major in Exercise Science, Kinesiology, Exercise Physiology or related fields. Students who do not have the appropriate academic background are required to have both Human Anatomy & Physiology and Chemistry as prerequisites. Additionally, it is recommended that students have taken exercise science related courses, such as exercise physiology and/or biomechanics. Exercise Physiology Mission Statement As committed Christians, our mission is to educate young men and women to become leaders and pioneers in exercise physiology by integrating our faith with academic training, research and evidence-based practice.
