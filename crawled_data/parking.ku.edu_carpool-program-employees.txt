Members may not have any other KU parking permits. The permit may be purchased in any zone up to the highest eligibility of carpool members. The eligible member must be the primary driver. Cost is the regular permit price divided by the number of carpool members. Payroll deduction is not available for carpool permits. Only one car may be parked in the carpool color zone parking at any time. Carpool members may park additional registered vehicle(s) in the Park & Ride lot (301) on days when carpooling does not work. Any parking tickets issued to carpool participants are the responsibility of the owner/operator of the illegally parked vehicle. Any abuse of a Carpool permit by participants, family members, KU students, or anyone not authorized to use the carpool permit will result in the carpool permit being revoked. Each potential member of a carpool must fill out our online carpool application form, and will be contacted by a staff member from Transportation Services within three business days.
