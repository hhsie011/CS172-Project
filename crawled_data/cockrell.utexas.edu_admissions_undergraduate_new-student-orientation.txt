Since you will be registering for fall classes at orientation, the sooner you can attend, the better. Following are important things to consider about New Student Orientation: Once you have been admitted to the Cockrell School, review your next steps checklist. Prior to orientation, be sure to complete UT's Pre-Orientation Checklist. On the first day of orientation, all engineering students will attend college meetings to learn about courses and resources available to engineering students. Changes to your major or college should be discussed with your advisor on the second day of orientation. In many cases, changing your major requires an application and a series of required courses you must take in preparation. Your advisor can provide additional information on the various internal transfer processes, depending on your major(s) of interest. You will be able to select a First-Year Interest Group (FIG) during orientation. You will learn about resources, student support services and other opportunities available to you at UT Austin and in the Cockrell School.
