Importantly, much of our research is focused on health disparity populations with the long-term goal of informing health policy and clinical practice across the lifespan. Funding Columbia Nursing provides three years (eight semesters) of funding for tuition, related fees, health insurance, and a stipend for full-time PhD students. Program Design Our PhD program provides students with an understanding of the philosophical and theoretical underpinnings of nursing science and a strong foundation in research methods (design, statistics, measurement, quantiative and qualitative methods) for clinical, translational and health services research. All students are mentored by research advisors with active programs of research as they move toward independent research and assume the roles of doctorally prepared nurse scientists. As a Columbia Nursing PhD student, you will learn to: Design, conduct, and report multidisciplinary research studies that increase knowledge to improve the health and well-being of patients and families across the lifespan Advance the state of the science in a substantive area of research through application of innovative and rigorous methods Promote health and well-being for individuals and families in the context of their communities Provide leadership in improving the health care delivery system at local, national, and international levels Collaborate with other professionals to evaluate and develop policies for the organization and delivery of health service Translate evidence accumulated through research into practice and policy at multiple levels As part of Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC), Columbia Nursing enjoys a unique collaboration with the College of Physicians and Surgeons, the Mailman School of Public Health, and the College of Dental Medicine. CUIMC provides myriad opportunities for interprofessional collaboration in research. Curriculum The PhD curriculum builds on the foundation of nursing science by bringing together practice, policy, translational research, and leadership. The core courses provide the knowledge and skills necessary to conduct relevant and well-designed research studies. Electives strengthen an area of clinical interest or intensify understanding of a specific research or analytic method. Both post-master's and post-BSN students admitted to the program will complete a minimum of 57 credits. The curriculum plan is designed to make it possible to complete the program in three years for those students with clearly defined plans for their dissertation research. Coursework PhD courses are offered in three major areas: Theoretical foundations of nursing science Analytical foundations of nursing science Electives and application Students must be registered as full-time for the duration of the program (typically three to four years). The minimum number of semester credits in required coursework is 37 (four semesters) for eligibility to progress to the qualifying exam. Six of the 37 credits required to be completed prior to the qualifying examination are elective courses tailored to the studentâ€™s dissertation topic and/or dissertation methods. The PhD program requires nine credits of elective courses. A minimum of 57 total credits is required for program completion. Concurrent with Coursework Research Experience (participating in faculty research projects and/or a research practicum) Teaching assistant experience Request a Sample Academic Program Plan Qualifying Examination The Qualifying Examination was key to the formation of my research question. The theoretical and analytical foundations from my coursework along with elective courses offered at other Columbia schools prepared me to independently complete this milestone. Aluem Tark, PhD '19, FNP-BC, RN, CHPN In addition to coursework, students must successfully complete a qualifying examination with written and oral components. The Master of Philosophy (MPhil) is awarded after successful completion of the qualifying examination and the student enters doctoral candidacy status. Dissertation Students are expected to successfully defend a dissertation reporting original research. Four dissertation credits are required each semester during the dissertation phase of study. Scholarship Expectations My advisor and the Columbia Nursing faculty mentored me throughout the PhD program to extend my learning beyond the classroom with the goal of becoming an independent health services researcher. I began preparation of my successful AHRQ R36 grant during the grantwriting workshop and received guidance throughout the process by grants management staff. Cilgy Abraham, BS, RN Publication: At least one manuscript published in an appropriate peer-reviewed journal. Grantsmanship: At least one grant application submitted to an appropriate funding agency or organization. Presentation: At least one abstract submitted for presentation as a poster or oral presentation at an appropriate professional meeting. Networking: Student will attend at least one regional or national research meeting. Preparation for Postdoctoral Fellowship: Research Career Next Step The coursework and research mentoring at Columbia Nursing helped prepare me for the next steps in my education and career post-PhD. In addition to structured coursework and educational seminars, the school provided beneficial informal support and resources. Feedback sessions with both peers and faculty were very helpful in preparing me to present posters and presentations at research conferences. The school also provided funds for travel to conferences where I presented my research. The grant writing workshop and mock reviews of grant applications provided me with tools and feedback needed to successfully apply for additional funding for my research. Finally, interdisciplinary research collaborations with faculty provided me with opportunities to work with researchers from several disciplines to complete my dissertation.
