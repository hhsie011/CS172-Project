While an organization must hold a core value proposition at the heart of its enterprise, be it a service or a product that it provides to its customers, the ability to deliver that value proposition in a profitable way depends heavily upon the effective leadership, management and execution by individuals and teams. The courses in the Management major cover the range of issues that managers and leaders will encounter in their careers including motivation, project management, decision-making, teams, negotiations, ethics, organizational design, and human resource management, to name a few. These skills are not only essential, but are also applicable within a variety of functional areas and organizational settings. In fact, research has found that usually the skills covered in the Management major determine how high and how quickly an individual will rise within an organization.
