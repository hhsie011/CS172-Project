The University provides some support to these centers for use in a variety of ways including facilities maintenance, programming, and/or financial aid, but plays no role in their governance. The centers vary in their programming, hours, age range of students, and tuition. In addition to the list below, an Excel spreadsheet of the Affiliated Learning Centers is available for download. Unless noted below, the programs have both part-time and full-day enrollment options as well as part-time summer programs. These centers offer an optional early notification of their admissions decisions to applicant families who are current or prospective faculty, staff, or students of Columbia University. If interested, parents should ask each center director for information. Centers cannot require parents to opt for early notification but will ask for interest in writing.
