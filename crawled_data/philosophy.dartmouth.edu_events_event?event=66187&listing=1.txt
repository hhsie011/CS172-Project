Friday, September 23, 2022 9:00am – 5:00pm To be announced Sponsored by: Dean of the Faculty, Ethics Institute, Leslie Center for the Humanities, Philosophy Department, Rockefeller Center Intended Audience(s): Public Categories: Conferences Registration required. Issues of constitutional interpretation matter a great deal for the practice of contemporary democracy in America, and have a great deal of impact on what public policy is enacted and how it is enacted. This workshop aims to examine the philosophical foundations of some of the most pressing debates in contemporary American constitutional theory, and explore the implications of this for how we think about law, politics, and public policy in America. This workshop stems from the following trend: in recent years, constitutional theorists have increasingly been developing parochial (jurisdiction-specific) theories of constitutional interpretation that are more explicitly connected to general theories of law or legal content. American constitutional theory, in particular, appears to be becoming more jurisprudentially attuned and ambitious. We think this a very welcome development. This workshop will bring together scholars who have expressly rooted their theories of constitutional interpretation in general jurisprudential accounts along with several other scholars working either in constitutional theory or general jurisprudence. The aim will be to investigate both what light general jurisprudential theories of law or legal content can shed on jurisdiction-specific theories of constitutional interpretation and what we can learn about general jurisprudence (or metanormative matters yet more generally) from engaging seriously with constitutional law and theory. As a class, the theories we have in mind are both originalist and non-originalist, positivist and anti-positivist. Note: This will be a pre-read workshop. It will be free and open to all, space permitting. A dropbox link with the papers, and information about location, will be sent to registered participants. Registration will be open in August, and will be open up until 10 days before the workshop.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Philosophy People Curriculum Overview Major and Minor Course Schedule Honors Past Honors Theses Foreign Study Logic Software Foreign Study News & Events News & Events Student Prizes Gramlich Prize Winners Story Prize Winners Philosophy Faculty Prize Winners Lecture Series Gramlich Sapentia Race, Gender & Justice Workshops Philosophy & The Struggle Against Racism Social Justice Research Grants My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
