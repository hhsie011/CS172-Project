The Center aims to contribute to the academic and research environment of Turkey across a variety of fields, while also allowing members of the Columbia community to increase their knowledge and explore academic opportunities within Turkey. A key priority is to enhance the intellectual profile of the Center through hosting research projects and fellows whose work can make a discernable impact on issues of importance to the local and regional context, particularly in the areas identified above.
