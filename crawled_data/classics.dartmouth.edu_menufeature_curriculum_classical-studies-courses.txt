The numbering does not necessarily indicate increasing difficulty. Instead, it is by subject matter: CLST 2-5 and 10 take up topics in literature, philosophy and religion, CLST 11 and 14-19 are ancient history courses, and CLST 12 and 20-28 are archaeology courses. Those who have never studied anything about Ancient Greek or Roman culture may wish to start with CLST 1 (Introductory Topics) or CLST 4 (Classical Mythology). Another good entry point is CLST 6 (Introduction to Classical Archaeology), which is also strongly recommended for those considering one of our Foreign Study Programs. However, all CLST courses except 85 and 87 are open to all students without prerequisites. Students may choose freely on the basis of subject matter. Students in Professor Julie Hruby's "Introduction to Classical Archaeology" class examine artifacts in the Bernstein Study-Storage Center in the Hood Museum of Art.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Classics Curriculum Overview Course Offerings by Term Fall 2021 Winter 2022 Spring 2022 Summer 2022 Fall 2022 Winter 2023 Spring 2023 2023-24 Classical Studies Courses Entry points for Classical Studies Literature, Philosophy, Religion Ancient History Classical Archaeology Language Study -- Latin Latin Classes Placement in Latin Language Study -- Ancient Greek Courses in Ancient Greek Placement in Ancient Greek Majors and Minors Classical Studies track Ancient History track Classical Archaeology track Classical Languages and Literature track Culminating Experience Foreign Study NEW Classics FSP in Spring 2022 Greece Foreign Study Program Rome Foreign Study Program Projects & Awards Classics-Related Projects and Awards Student Research Archaeological Fieldwork Reid/Wiencke Funding for Research Senior Honors Projects Awards & Prizes Faculty Media Projects Annual Lecture Programs Faculty Books Inclusivity News & Events People Our graduates Graduating with a Classics Degree Alumni Support Tell Us Your Story Alumni Stories My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
