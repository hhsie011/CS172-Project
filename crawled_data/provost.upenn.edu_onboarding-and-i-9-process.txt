Onboarding All Provost Centers use Onboard@Penn to provide consistent, efficient, and friendly first-day services for new hires. Onboard@Penn is located at 3425 Walnut Street on the street level, and new hires can go to www.onboard.upenn.edu to schedule their in-person appointment. Provost Centers should refer new hires (including all faculty type appointments, student workers, and temporary staff) to Onboard@Penn on their start dates to complete the onboarding process, which includes: Complete I-9 (Part 2) Workers who are on campus at any time, for any reason, and remote workers who reside in Philadelphia, its suburbs, New Jersey, and Delaware (regardless of remote or on campus work) must present original, unexpired documents in person. Remote workers who reside outside Philadelphia, its suburbs, New Jersey, and Delaware may use one of two remote options: CUPA Consortium for Reciprocal I-9 completion or Equifax I-9 Anywhere (School/Center will be responsible for the cost) Collect W-4 Validate SSN Collect immigration and work authorization documents and transfer securely to Payroll, Payroll Tax, ISSS Confirm addresses Answer general questions Escalate complex questions to the Penn Employee Solution Center. Please make sure your new hires bring the appropriate documents to ensure timely completion of I-9 process. Onboarding Process When a worker is hired in Workday, they receive an email from Penn Community with instructions on how to set up their PennKey and password. Once the worker has set up their PennKey and password, they will receive an email from Workday with instructions on how to log into Workday and view their Onboarding tasks. It may take up to two hours for the worker to be able to log into Workday after setting up their PennKey. The new hire should complete their onboarding tasks in Workday before visiting Onboard@Penn. The Onboard@Penn specialists will follow these processes: Confirm the worker has been hired into Workday. If not, contact the HR Analyst responsible to assess where they are in the hire process. Onboard@Penn will assist with onboarding tasks, including completion of the I-9 and verifying IDs. Once they are hired into Workday and have completed onboarding tasks, Onboard@Penn will instruct them to go to the PennCard Center. If an employee has trouble making an appointment, please contact the Solution Center (solutioncenter@upenn.edu). The request will be forwarded to Onboard@Penn and a representative will contact the employee to set up a time.
