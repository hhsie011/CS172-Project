News and Events Featured Research Knocking Down Barriers to Inclusion: School Social Workers, Advocacy, and Equity for Immigrant Students By Sophia Rodriguez, Benjamin Roth, and Leticia Villarreal Sosa Immigrant students face numerous barriers to equity in public K-12 schools. Extensive research has enhanced our understanding of these barriers, their impact on immigrant children, and how educators and administrators address them. Schools are complex organizations with a range of personnel who ideally work together inside and outside of classrooms to ensure that all students have access to quality education. A complete picture of how schools are supporting immigrant students—and why, at times, they may fall short—must therefore explore how all school-based actors contribute to advancing equity. This issue brief summarizes findings from a study of school social workers to explain their role and contribution in the collective effort to advance equity for all.
