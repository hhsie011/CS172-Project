The DAT is offered at Prometric Testing Centers with locations throughout the country. The DAT is administered on computer almost every day of the week. An applicant with below average scores on the test may wish to retake the test in order to become more competitive. A 90-day waiting period is required before re-testing. Other resources include the Dental Admissions Testing Program. Application Procedures The school participates in the Texas Medical and Dental Schools Application Service (TMDSAS). This central processing service allows the applicant to apply to any or all of the four dental schools in the State of Texas. The TMDSAS accepts and processes all materials of the primary application for admission to the Doctor of Dental Surgery program only. Texas Residents MUST apply through the TMDSAS. Non-Texas residents can apply through TMDSAS and this is the preferred application for the school. However, the school participates in the American Association of Dental Schools Application Service (AADSAS) for out-of-state students. Out-of-state applicants who apply through AADSAS must also apply using the School of Dentistry application available online at TAMHSC Admissions Processing Portal (APP). To apply to the program leading to the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree, the applicant should: Access full information and the online application at the website for: The Texas Medical and Dental Schools Application Service http://www.tmdsas.com Applicants needing assistance or who have no Internet access may contact the TMDSAS: Telephone: (512) 499-4785 Fax: (512) 499-4786 Timetable for filing application: Earliest date: May 1, year prior to desired admission Latest date: Application deadline is October 1 in year prior to desired admission Application Fees: The TMDSAS has a flat fee. The School of Dentistry requires a secondary application but charges no additional processing fee for TMDSAS applicants. It is to the applicant’s advantage to apply as early as possible. The TMDSAS online application is accessible beginning May 1 of the application cycle. The Office of Recruitment and Admissions strongly advises that you submit your application by late August. Selection for interviews begins in July, and this requires a transmitted complete application. TMDSAS will not transmit incomplete applications to the participating dental schools. A definition of the completed application is available on the TMDSAS website. The TMDSAS may take up to 6 weeks to process the application before sending it to the dental school. The School of Dentistry requires the submission of a secondary application in addition to the primary application. This application can be accessed from links on the TMDSAS website or at the application site APP. The application for admission is not complete until the secondary application is submitted. Required Interview An interview is required. The applicant may be asked to come for an interview with the Admissions Committee. Interviews are scheduled by the Office of Recruitment and Admissions. Although an official interview is not granted to all applicants, the school gladly provides complete information and counseling for all prospective students. Visits to the campus for tours of the facilities can be arranged during spring months. Basis for Accepting Students The quality of academic achievement is the first point of consideration. The grade point average (GPA) and the Dental Admission Test (DAT) are the primary factors used in this evaluation. The interview with the Admissions Committee gives the opportunity for evaluation of noncognitive factors. Preference is given to residents of Texas and the surrounding states that do not have a school of dentistry. Consideration of any factors that may have impacted academic or personal history is important in interview selection and final acceptance decisions. Consideration is also given to how the student may contribute to the diversity of the class. Additionally, applicants seeking to enter the dental school must be able to perform the essential functions required to complete the curriculum successfully. Improving Chances for Admission The application for admission to the School of Dentistry may be strengthened by the following: keep the GPA as high as possible make above average scores in all areas of the DAT upper-division biological science courses similar to the foundational topics in the dental curriculum give careful attention to details in filing the application - apply early assure your personal statement explains your motivation for pursuing dentistry, including personal and academic achievements, hardships overcome and other factors that affected personal or academic progress observation in a general practice dental office is required participate in activities to improve manual dexterity and critical thinking abilities take advantage of opportunities for community service and develop people skills and empathy for others evaluate and be able to articulate your skills, abilities, attitudes, etc., to determine if you are motivated to make the commitment required for a career in dentistry Comprehensive Review of Application A comprehensive (whole-file review) of the application is performed to reveal characteristics critical to the practice of dentistry, factors that indicate success in the dental curriculum that are not evident from academic history or standardized test performance and potential for future contributions to the dental profession. They include: motivation to pursue a career in dentistry involvement in community service observation or involvement in a dental office or clinic involvement in a summer pre-dental preparatory program letters of evaluation communication capabilities including writing (as evidenced in personal statement) and conversational English proficiency the applicant’s ability to contribute to the diversity of the class including their race or ethnicity, socioeconomic background, talents, life skills and experiences and special attributes region in Texas in which applicant resides; all regions are sought after residence in a Texas county designated as underserved by dental health professionals employment while attending college preparation to attend and succeed in post-secondary education effect of parents’ educational background on student's success applicant is first college attendee in his/her immediate family history of extreme hardship leadership positions held in societies or organizations evidence of diverse cultural experience multilingual capabilities Becoming More Competitive as a Re-applicant All re-applicants must be enrolled in coursework to be considered as a competitive candidate. We recommend taking post-baccalaureate coursework in the biological sciences to further prepare for the dental school curriculum, keep current with study skills and prove to the Admissions Committee the applicant’s motivation and preparedness (for example: anatomy, physiology, biochemistry II, microbiology, histology, neuroscience, cell and molecular biology, immunology). Re-applicants need to critically review their applications for areas that may need further work: biological science coursework, DAT scores, GPA, community service and volunteer work, and general dental office shadowing experience. Re-applicants should continue to participate in shadowing and on-going volunteer activities during the application cycle. Re-applicants who follow this advice to improve their academic background and general application will be more competitive than those with little change from year to year. Working in a dental office alone will not improve the applicant’s competitiveness. More Information For up to date information, please go to the School of Dentistry website. Select the section on Questions and Answers About Admissions to quickly access updated information and resources to further your knowledge of the admissions process. Go directly to Procedure for Application if you need specific directions on how to apply. To aid in planning and as a gauge for how you may compare to the “average” entering student, access the statistics in the matriculation reports of the recent entering classes. Texas residents MUST apply through the Texas Medical and Dental Schools Application Service (TMDSAS). To access the full information and the online application, please visit TMDSAS. Out-of-state applicants have three options. They may apply through the TMDSAS, through the American Association of Dental Schools Application Service (AADSAS), or with the application packet. Please note: Out-of-state applicants who apply through the American Association of Dental Schools Application Service (AADSAS) MUST also submit the School of Dentistry application.
