The Construction Engineering program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org. Student Learning Outcomes Graduates of the construction engineering curriculum should have, at the time of graduation: an ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics an ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences an ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions an ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies. Program Educational Objectives: Three to five years after graduation, our graduates will have pursued successful careers and expertise in construction engineering or a related profession. They will collaborate effectively on multi-disciplinary teams to address the needs of society and the environment. They will pursue lifelong learning, professional development, and licensure as appropriate for their career goals. Students who successfully complete the curriculum will be prepared for entry into the field or for further study at the graduate level in construction engineering or related fields of study, such as law, business, and/or other engineering disciplines. Construction engineers need to possess a strong fundamental knowledge of engineering design and management principles, including knowledge of business procedures, economics, and human behavior. Graduates of this curriculum may expect to engage in design of temporary structures, coordination of project design, systems design, cost estimating, planning and scheduling, company and project management, materials procurement, equipment selection, and cost control. With the emergence of integrated project delivery methods such as design-build construction, the role of the construction engineer is expanding the need for trained professionals that understand both aspects of the project delivery environment. The curriculum offers opportunities to study emphases concerned with building, heavy, mechanical, or electrical construction. The process of construction involves the organization, administration, and coordination of labor resource requirements, temporary and permanent materials, equipment, supplies and utilities, money, technology and methods. These must be integrated in the most efficient manner possible to complete construction projects on schedule, within the budget, and according to the standards of quality and performance specified by the project owner or designer. The curriculum blends engineering, management and business sciences into a study of the processes of construction whereby designer’s plans and specifications are converted into physical structures and facilities. The curriculum develops the ability of students to be team workers, creative thinkers, and effective communicators. This is achieved by encouraging students to: interact with practicing professionals gain work experience during summer jobs, internship, and cooperative education assignments that emphasize the knowledge required of construction engineers develop leadership skills by participating in student organizations develop, analyze, and interpret alternative solutions to open-ended problems study abroad The construction industry is becoming increasingly global. Courses in humanities, social sciences, U.S. diversity, and international perspectives are included in the curriculum to broaden the student’s perspective of the work environment. In addition, the department has several exchange program opportunities for students to participate in study abroad programs. Qualified construction engineering students within 30 credits of completing their degree may apply for concurrent enrollment in the Graduate College. See Civil Engineering Graduate Study for more information.

Go to https://www.ccee.iastate.edu/prospective-graduate-students/concurrent-programs/ for further information. Graduate Study An area of specialization in construction engineering and management is offered within the graduate program of the Department of Civil, Construction and Environmental Engineering. This specialization focuses on project management including and beyond the traditional iron triangle of scope, technical, and schedule to include context and financing, enabling project management of more complex projects. Three graduate degrees including, Master of Engineering (30 credits), Master of Science (30 credits), and Doctor of Philosophy (72 credits) are offered. The Master of Engineering degree is a coursework only option and the other degree programs require a research component at a level adjusted to the degree sought. All degrees are offered on-campus and some degrees may be completed off-campus through distance education. All degrees require C E 501, C E 502, C E 503, and nine credits additional credits within construction focused C E courses. Course options include but are not limited to: C E 501 Preconstruction Project Engineering and Management 3 C E 502 Construction Project Engineering and Management 3 C E 503 Construction Finance and Business Management 3 C E 505 Design of Construction Systems 3 C E 594A Special Topics Construction Engineering and Mgt.: Planning and Scheduling 3 C E 594L Spl Topics Construction Engr and Mgt.: Adv Building Construction Topics - LEED for New Construction 3 Undergraduate students may also qualify for the concurrent bachelor of science/master of science (BS/MS) degree program. Courses are offered for minor work to students taking major work in other curricula or in interdepartmental programs. A graduate certificate is also available which requires 12 credits of coursework. Courses required for the certificate are C E 501, C E 502, and C E 503. For additional information see Civil Engineering, Graduate Programs, https://www.ccee.iastate.edu/academics/graduate/.
