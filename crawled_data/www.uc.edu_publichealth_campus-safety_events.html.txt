This may include: facial coverings (N95 and KN95 masks are preferred) clustering of people/attendees be avoided hand sanitizer provided When practical, a list of attendees be maintained to assist with possible later contact tracing if needed There are no food service restrictions at this time. It is important to remember that outdoor events are safer than indoor events. Virtual options are also an option to accommodate individuals that prefer not to meet in person.
