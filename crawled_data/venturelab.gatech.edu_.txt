Georgia Tech Home Map Directory Offices facebook twitter Research ➜ Innovation ➜ Startups Menu Close Home Programs Process Partners Portfolio News About Us Contact Us We work with faculty and students to create startups based on Georgia Tech research using evidence-based entrepreneurship. A remarkable array of funding opportunities is available to startups based on Georgia Tech research. The Georgia Research Alliance provides grant funding for early-stage startups, as well as loans and equity investments for companies that have demonstrated a viable business model. Federal grants from the NSF PFI: AIR-TT program as well as SBIR/STTR funds can provide fuel for growth. And we work closely with angel investors and venture capital firms in Atlanta and beyond to help startups accelerate their growth when the time is right. Our process emphasizes customer discovery—getting out of the building… …and talking to over a hundred potential customers and stakeholders to test the basic assumptions of the business. You may be eligible to receive funding to begin this work through the National Science Foundation I-Corps program, or you can participate in regional programs offered by I-Corps South. Staffed by engineers and entrepreneurs, VentureLab is the place to get guidance, funding, and best practices for building your startup. We don’t charge fees, and we don’t take equity in your company. We’re here to serve Georgia Tech and bring its innovations to market. Check out the companies we’ve helped, or meet our team and get in touch.
