Our family focused initiatives include: Childbirth and Adoption Accommodation Through the Childbirth and Adoption Accommodation Policy, enrolled graduate degree candidates in good academic standing who become parents are eligible for a period of accommodation during which teaching and academic obligations are suspended. The policy provides for three separate accommodations, and students may be eligible for one or more: 1) a 14-week suspension of academic work, 2) an additional term of enrollment, and 3) an additional term of financial support. More information can be found in the policy section of our website. Students who have questions about this accommodation are encouraged to be in touch with Dean Willey.
