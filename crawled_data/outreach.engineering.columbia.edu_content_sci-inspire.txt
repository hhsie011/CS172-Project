This school-based program supports STEM education and collaborates with other student groups on campus to train volunteers for educational and outreach activities, as well as to screen (fingerprint) them in compliance with the NYC DoE. The online platform empowers educators to specify individual STEM needs and to access the many talents of Columbia Engineering students. Sci-Inspire cultivates an active and vibrant STEM outreach community and aims to boost science attitudes and aptitudes in young learners. Columbia undergrad and grad students can volunteer by registering online through Sci-Inspire and attending trainings and screenings.
