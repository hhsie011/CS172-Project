LALACS courses cross the humanities, the social sciences, and interdisciplinary studies. LALACS offers an exchange program in Havana, Cuba, along with experiential learning courses working with local immigrant communities. Colonial church at Actopan in Mexico. PreviousNext Mission Statement The LALACS Program is committed to fostering a collaborative environment for students, faculty, and staff in which they can produce and share knowledge about Latin American, Latino, and Caribbean languages, cultures, societies, politics, geographies, and histories, LALACS makes great effort to reflect Dartmouth's history of excellence in liberal arts under graduate education, independent student research, international understanding, and community service. Our interdisciplinary curriculum allows faculty and students to work across more established disciplinary boundaries while at the same time promoting the rigorous demands of scholarly methodologies, theories, and critical approaches. Most of LALACS's classes are small and provide direct student-professor interaction. In addition, the affiliated faculty members regularly work with students on independent research projects and honors theses. LALACS Majors and Minors who study abroad in the Spanish and Portuguese Department's Foreign Study Programs (FSPs) in Buenos Aires, Argentina and Salvador, Brazil receive credit toward their electives, and students can also participate in Georgetown University's summer programs in Buenos Aires and Santiago, Chile for major and minor credit. LALACS also offers an exchange program in Havana, Cuba, and experiential learning courses in Latino Studies. Students who major or minor in LALACS leave the program with the analytical tools to conduct interdisciplinary research, the adaptability to engage with various types of communities (regional, ethnic, language-based, academic, business, etc.), and an acute awareness of the regional and transnational complexities of the Latin American, Latino and Caribbean experience.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Latin American, Latino & Caribbean Studies Undergraduate Major Overview Minor Honors and Independent Study Courses Courses in Latin American and Caribbean Studies Alumni Alumni Stories Resources Graduates Foreign Study Overview Casa Cuba FAQs Fellowships César Chávez Fellowship César Chávez Fellowship Past Recipients Guarini Dean's Postdoctoral Fellowship News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
