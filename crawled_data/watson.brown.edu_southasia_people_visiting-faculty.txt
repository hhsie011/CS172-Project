Moving beyond conventional frameworks of discrimination, my work takes into account structural disadvantages such as intergenerational transfer of wealth and prevailing social networks in the production of caste/racial inequality. Notwithstanding differences in histories of caste and race, I use comparative analysis of entrepreneurship to demonstrate how caste and race are mediated in producing structural inequalities in India and in the US.
