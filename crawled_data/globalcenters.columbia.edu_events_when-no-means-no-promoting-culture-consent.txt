10:30 AM Flacso Auditorium Dag Hammarskjold 3269 First Floor, Vitacura A Roundtable Discussion led by Suzanne Goldberg, Executive Vice President of Columbia University’s Office of University Life, on how to confront gender-based-misconduct, including sexual assault and harassment, partner violence, and stalking. The event will be chaired by Claudia Heiss, a Columbia alumna (GSAS’03) who teaches political science at Universidad de Chile. During this event, professor Goldberg will address Columbia University’s commitment to fostering an environment that is free from gender-based discrimination and harassment, including sexual assault and all other forms of gender-based misconduct. She will explain the multifaceted approach adopted by the University, which includes educational programs; services and resources for those affected by gender-based misconduct; accessible, prompt, and fair methods of investigation and resolution of reports of misconduct; and protections designed to prevent against recurrence.

From the Office of University Life, she has spearheaded the nationally-recognized Sexual Respect Initiative; University-wide task forces on Gender-Based Misconduct Prevention and on Race, Ethnicity and Inclusion; and Columbia’s new Awakening Our Democracy series focused on race, ethnicity, disparities and justice and other pressing issues of our time. *The event will be in English; parking available at Parque Bicentenario or at Hotel Atton Vitacura (Av Vitacura 3201).
