The good news is that enrolling in just 3 more credit hours per semester, at no extra tuition cost, will put you on track to graduating on time and with less debt. WHY 15? Taking 15 credits a semester is really about completing 30 credits per year. For example, if you’re enrolled in a 4-year degree program, completing an average of 30 credits a year means finishing your degree on time: 120 credits ÷ 4 years = 30 credits a year The math is the same, if you’re enrolled in a 2-year degree program and want to finish on time: 60 credits ÷ 2 years = 30 credits a year WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE IN TUITION COSTS?

Deciding what courses to take may not always seem straight forward, but fear not, your advisor can help you create a plan to complete at least 30 credits per year - credits that will count toward your degree program so you can stay on track to graduation.
