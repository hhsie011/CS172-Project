In addition, core areas of linguistic study include phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics and pragmatics. Students may also design a more specialized program of study that focuses on gender and language, computer-mediated communication, politeness theory, intercultural communication, medical discourse, and others. Students majoring in either TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) or Applied Linguistics often take courses in both areas. Many Applied Linguistics courses are available online. Graduate students in Applied Linguistics have presented papers at professional conferences such as The Southeastern Conference on Linguistics, NWAVE, Tennessee TESOL, and International TESOL. They have also taken advantage of the many opportunities to teach English as a Second or Foreign Language in the U.S. and abroad. Many students pursuing the M.A. in Applied Linguistics go on to earn a Ph.D. in the field.
