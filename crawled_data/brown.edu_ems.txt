Our service area is the Brown campus or remote student or academic occupancies in the city of Providence. BEMS personnel are trained and equipped to provide the same level of services as other EMS agencies in Rhode Island, but BEMS is unique in its programs and mission as a collegiate ambulance corps. EMS is located in the Health & Wellness Center at 450 Brook Street. BEMS is staffed primarily by Brown students who are licensed prehospital providers including EMTs, advanced EMTs and paramedics. Students engage in both clinical and administrative partnerships with medical students or non-student professional staff promoting continuous skill and leadership development. This partnership extends beyond ambulance operations to ancillary services that support specific needs, such as event medical coverage or logistical support within the campus community.
