MUSC Accelerated Pathways The purpose of the MUSC Accelerated Pathways to professional health degrees is to reduce the total student tuition debt while retaining the best and brightest students in South Carolina. This is accomplished by eliminating an academic year for competitive students, who are ready to transition early to MUSC. It is possible to pursue these programs through any degree-granting major at Clemson; however, some degree programs are more accommodating of the prerequisite coursework required by MUSC than others. Students are encouraged to review information provided in the pathway-specific "Student Intent to Participate" form and consult with departmental advisors regarding how prerequisite coursework may be accommodated within the curriculum. ➥ Learn about MUSC Accelerated Pathways University of South Carolina School of Medicine Greenville Early Assurance Program The Clemson University/USC School of Medicine Greenville Early Assurance Program (EAP) provides an opportunity unique to students of Clemson University, a primary academic partner of the Greenville Health System.
