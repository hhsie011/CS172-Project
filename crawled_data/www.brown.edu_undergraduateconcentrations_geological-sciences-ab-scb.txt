Geosciences is a highly interdisciplinary concentration employing principles from physics, chemistry, and biology to understand the structure of the Earth and other planetary bodies. Concentrators can study Earth and planetary interiors, including the formation of rocks and minerals, movement of the Earth’s tectonic plates, and the circulation of the planets’ core and mantle. Other areas emphasize surface processes, such as the movement and storage of water. This concentration is a good choice for students who seek a broad scientific understanding of the processes that shape the physical world around us. Both AB and ScB degrees are offered; the ScB requires more (19) courses, including a research course. DEEPS provides a highly collaborative learning environment that emphasizes process-oriented, hands-on approaches in the classroom, in labs and on field trips. There are many opportunities for students to do research working with faculty, graduate students, and researchers. The degree builds students’ skills in critical thinking, written and oral communication, data analysis and modeling, and applying systems approaches to problem solving, which prepare students for a wide variety of careers.
