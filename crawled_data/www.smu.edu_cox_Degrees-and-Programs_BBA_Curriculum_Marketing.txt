Though often associated with advertising or sales, marketing is actually much broader. Key marketing activities include designing new offerings, modifying existing offerings, pricing, logistics, sales management, and gathering market information. These and other marketing activities are grounded on a foundation of understanding the customer -- who they are today and who they are likely to be tomorrow, what they want, how people decide what to buy, and what happens after people make a purchase. Career opportunities include sales, retail management and buying, advertising account executives, marketing research associates, and general marketing management.
