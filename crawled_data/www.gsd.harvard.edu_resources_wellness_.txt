Other services include vision care, dental services, and a pharmacy, though not all covered by the HUSHP. The confidentiality of all records and other medical information about patients at HUHS is protected to the full extent of the law. Written authorization from the student is necessary to release information to any third party except in highly unusual circumstances as required by law, or as indicated in the HUHS Notice of Privacy Practices. Making an Appointment Appointments can be made online by logging into the Patient Portal or by calling the HUHS main number. Cancellations must be made at least 24 hours in advance of a scheduled appointment, or else you’ll incur a fee. HUHS Patient Portal huhs.harvard.edu/patient-portal Urgent-Care and Emergency Services If you are experiencing symptoms of a medical emergency, call 911 immediately. After-hours and weekend care for nonroutine, urgent medical concerns or symptoms are available through the After Hours Urgent Care Clinic, which is open nights, weekends, and holidays. When possible, try to call your primary care team or mental health provider for advice during regular office hours. Urgent Care Smith Campus Center 7 Days a Week: 6pm–8am After-Hours Care Nurse Advice Line (617) 495-5711 7 Days a Week: 6pm–8am Patient Advocate Mallory Finne is your Patient Advocate. She is available to discuss and assist with any HUHS-related questions, problems or concerns: navigating the health care system, available choices for your medical care, patients who feel they have encountered a problem, and special needs arrangements.

Students are assigned a PCP and primary care team and may change their PCP at any time for any reason. Students with chronic medical conditions are advised to establish a relationship with the primary care team early in the academic year. It’s also good to provide the HUHS staff with copies of medical records of health care received at other facilities.

Immunizations help protect you from illnesses and contribute to the overall well being of our community. We encourage you to receive any required immunizations before you arrive at Harvard—as many health insurance plans will cover their cost. If you are unable to obtain these prior to your arrival on campus, you may arrange to get immunizations at HUHS for a fee. Medical Records Smith Campus Center, 4th Floor (617) 495-2055 mrecords@huhs.harvard.edu Travel Health Immunizations and Info HUHS provides immunizations and related services, including expert counseling and advice for individual travel health needs on a fee-for-service basis. They recommend scheduling travel health appointments six to eight weeks before departure. (See “Traveling Abroad,” p. 167.) Confidential HIV Testing HUHS provides confidential HIV testing. AIDS Action Committee offers anonymous testing (see p. 77). Mental Health GSD Support Services The student experience at the GSD is intense and rigorous, and at times can be stressful or overwhelming. All GSD students are highly qualified and often come from previous educational experiences where they were top of their classes. It can be difficult to realize that you may not be accomplishing your goals as easily as in the past. Additionally, students for whom English is not their native language may struggle more than they had expected communicating their ideas. Finally, the student experience is often a challenge even when everything is basically fine emotionally and physically. An unexpected life event such as an illness, a death or other stress can trigger emotional distress and/or set the student back academically. During difficult times, it is good to know there are a number of resources at your fingertips within the GSD—for assistance with the English language, finding the right person to talk with at HUHS, or just someone to advise you on resolving an emotional difficulty. If you are encountering problems with your courses and/or studio, your academic advisor and program director are there to talk you through your difficulties and help you work through possible solutions. If you do not feel comfortable approaching them and you are not sure where to go for advice, Dean of Students Laura Snowdon can help you get started. She is the primary resource for GSD students with emotional, medical or disability concerns, difficulty with the English language, as well as any problems or issues within the GSD that you would like to discuss. As Dean of Students, Laura monitors students’ academic status and progress and is available to discuss problems or concerns that may arise. She can refer students to additional sources for assistance as necessary.

The following info is meant to give you a framework for dealing with your current concerns and helping you decide how to make the best use of the professional services available to you. AIDS Action Committee of Massachusetts was founded in 1983 as a not-for-profit, community-based health organization whose mission is to stop the HIV/AIDS epidemic by preventing new infections and optimizing the health of those people already infected. Each June, AIDS Walk raises funds for groceries, rental assistance, and medical services. Though there is a $10 fee for anonymous HIV antibody testing, no student will be turned away due to an inability to pay. You will not be required to give any identifying information, and the fee will cover both pre- and post-test counseling appointments.
