The concentration provides students with a broad-based understanding in fundamental molecular sciences, as well as a background for graduate studies in physical chemistry, chemical physics, or molecular engineering. Concentrators are required to take twenty courses in chemistry, physics, and mathematics, although approved courses in applied mathematics, biology, computer science, geological sciences, or engineering may be substitutes. Chemical Physics concentrators are also advised to take at least six courses in the humanities and social sciences. Chemical Physics concentrators at all levels (first-year through seniors) are actively involved in research with faculty members in both departments. Standard program for the Sc.B. degree Twenty-one semester courses1 in chemistry, physics, and mathematics, with a minimum of four semester courses in mathematics. The expectation is that courses required for a concentration in Chemical Physics will be taken for a letter grade. Core courses are: CHEM 0330 Equilibrium, Rate, and Structure 1 CHEM 0350 Organic Chemistry 1 CHEM 0500 Inorganic Chemistry 1 CHEM 1140 Physical Chemistry: Quantum Chemistry 1 PHYS 0070 Analytical Mechanics 1 PHYS 0160 Introduction to Relativity, Waves and Quantum Physics 1 PHYS 0470 Electricity and Magnetism 1 Select one of the following laboratory courses: 1 CHEM 1160 Physical Chemistry Laboratory PHYS 0560 Experiments in Modern Physics PHYS 1560 Modern Physics Laboratory Select one course in statistical mechanics: 1 CHEM 1150 Physical Chemistry: Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics PHYS 1530 Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics MATH 0190 Advanced Placement Calculus (Physics/Engineering) 1 MATH 0200 Intermediate Calculus (Physics/Engineering) 1 MATH 0520 Linear Algebra 1 Seven courses, primarily at the 1000 or 2000 level, in chemistry or physics. 7 Select two semesters of independent study: 2 CHEM 0970/0980 Undergraduate Research PHYS 1990 Senior Conference Course Total Credits 21 1 Other approved courses in applied mathematics, biology, computer science, geological sciences, or engineering may be substituted for some of the twenty-one. Students are advised to take at least six courses in the humanities and social sciences. Honors Requirements for Chemical Physics All Chemical Physics concentrators who have grades of A or S with distinction in a majority of their concentration courses will be considered for Honors; no separate application is necessary. The requirements for Honors in Chemical Physics are: * Grades of A or S with distinction in a majority of courses taken for the concentration. * Two semesters of Independent Study (CHEM 0970, CHEM 0980 or equivalent. Guidelines and requirements associated with Independent Study are in the Undergraduate Concentration Handbook which can be found at the department website. * A Thesis in a form approved and recommended by the research advisor. Additional information about thesis guidelines will be provided to seniors by the Concentration Advisor. * A Poster presentation at the chemistry department's spring undergraduate poster session.
