Beginning March 14, 2022 fully vaccinated/boosted members & instructors are no longer required to wear masks. See In-Person Group Fitness Classes COVID-19 Policies. When wearing a mask, some find it more comfortable to exercise when they pair a mask with a 3D silicone bracket support frame, as it supports the mask away from the mouth. Wristbands are required for entry into all In-Person Group Fitness classes and are available beginning 30 minutes prior to the scheduled start time for each class. Wristbands may be obtained in the following locations: For classes in Helen Newman Hall... Helen Newman Issue Room For classes in Appel Commons (3rd Floor Multipurpose Room and Fitness Center)...
