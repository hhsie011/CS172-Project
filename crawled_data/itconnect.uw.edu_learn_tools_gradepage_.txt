Contact UW-IT About UW-IT GradePage Available for Available for : Instructors Sign in to GradePage ABOUT GRADEPAGE GradePage is the official online grade submission tool for the UW. Any instructor of record for a course section, or assigned grading delegate, can view the grade roster and submit grades while grading period is open each quarter. Note: GradePage requires two-factor authentication for online grade submission. You will need to use both your UW NetID and DUO to sign in to GradePage. Please take a moment now to verify that you can use DUO. GradePage is integrated with UW’s Canvas LMS and Catalyst GradeBook, providing an import process to reduce manual entry of grades. Canvas Users Instructors using the Canvas learning management system can import and convert Canvas grades for submission. GradeBook Users Instructors who have used GradeBook in the past may be accustomed to using GradeBook to submit grades. No worries — you will still use GradeBook to start the submission process, and will be seamlessly transferred to GradePage to complete submitting grades online.
