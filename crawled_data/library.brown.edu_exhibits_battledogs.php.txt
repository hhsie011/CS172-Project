K. Brown Military Collection June 3 - August 30, 2009 John Hay Library, Bopp Seminar Room 20 Prospect Street Providence, Rhode Island 02912 » Library Hours Dogs have become associated with warfare, as the 'hounds of war' or Marine Corps bulldogs. They symbolize tenacity and resilience, but also ferocity and terror. They are an effective weapon, but more than just another piece of equipment. They can overcome the best of human technology, through their superior senses, but are vulnerable to the elements the same way that humans are. This exhibit explores dogs as a metaphor, warriors, companions, and mascots using items from the Anne S. K. Brown Military Collection. Exhibition design by Miranda Summers, AM'09 Public Humanities For further information contact Peter Harrington.
