8:30 PM 4, rue de Chevreuse, 75006 Paris Event Description According to the Tax Justice Network, between $21 and $32 trillion in hidden assets are held in offshore tax havens. The increasing outflow of money into the offshore world starves developing countries of government revenues, enables kleptocrats to hide their illicitly-acquired wealth, and allows global multinational companies to lawfully avoid paying hundreds of billions in taxes. Until recently, we lacked comprehensive and detailed academic studies for understanding the scope and inner workings of the offshore system. This panel brings together four leading scholars to discuss their path-breaking research on important aspects of the offshore world and financial system. Beyond sharing their latest research findings on global tax havens, the global citizenship market, wealth asset management, and the informal economy, our panelists will discuss the research and investigative techniques that they have pioneered to reveal important dimensions of the offshore world.
