From the concerns of inequitable socio-economic outcomes in the urban environment, through the spectacular revitalization of urban centers, such as Lower Manhattan, after the devastation of terrorism, natural disaster, and deteriorating infrastructure, to creating technological systems for optimized investment decisions, the Center serves as a forum for robust discussions and rigorous analysis by real estate professionals and scholars. Read More A major current focus of the Center is the development of advanced applied technology that can be achieved by bridging the gap between the compelling needs of the real estate industry and the advanced research and resources in technology within the extensive Columbia University ecosystem. Additionally, given its geographic advantage, the Center efficiently serves as the knowledge conduit between New York City’s global finance and real estate industries and Columbia University’s world-class academia in order to create transformative technology for the built world. As part of our commitment to advancing the real estate industry, the Center also contributes significantly to the curriculum of the graduate Real Estate Development program at Columbia: as students learn about finance, construction, design, and operation of real estate they are exposed to the integration of technology to these areas, advance their technological literacy, and are prepared to be the next generation of global real estate industry leaders. The Center hosts exciting, creative and forward-looking events that address the evolution of the industry as a whole, and very specifically, the application of advanced technology to achieving in the future a better built environment for all.
