It is also becoming a scarce resource in many parts of the world. Water borne diseases claim more lives and make more people sick than any other cause. As our population continues to increase and urbanize, clean water becomes more and more scarce. The pollutants in our water are also becoming more difficult to remove. Levels of antibiotics, pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals, and many other substances in our drinking water are all on the rise. It is clear that water issues are at the core of sustainability. Our research on water treatment methods, such as Advanced Oxidation Processes and membrane technologies, are at the forefront of the subject. BBISS director, John Crittenden, is the lead author of the classic text on the subject of water treatment.
