Laser cutting service At the Hill Library Makerspace, we offer a laser cutting service to all current NC State University students, faculty, and staff. Request an appointment to get started on a laser cutting project. You do not need to attend a Makerspace Orientation prior to your appointment. For safety reasons, only library staff are able to operate the laser cutter. Materials: We will only cut or engrave materials that we have sourced, which include a variety of wood, acrylic, cardboard and chipboard, Crescent matboard, and rubber. Milling Milling is the machining process of removing material from an object using a computer-controlled rotary bit. The Libraries now offers CNC milling on an Othermill desktop milling machine. How to access the Makerspace's milling machine In order to access the Othermill machine, you'll need to take two trainings: Makerspace Orientation (offered online) Tool-specific safety training: contact Justin Haynes to schedule this Using the milling machine Othermill device details Working with Othermill guide Materials: The Othermill may only be used with materials provided by the Libraries, which include birch plywood, machining wax and foam, polycarbonate, and printed circuit board (PCB) blanks.
