How can I use the 3D printers in the Makerspace? The Makerspace's 3D printers can be used by current students, faculty, and staff. Things to know about using our 3D printers: A safety Orientation is required before using the Hill Library Makerspace and our 3D printers. It's offered virtually on Moodle. Printers are available on a first-come, first-served basis. There is no cost to use our printers. We provide the filament. Research and instructional use of the Makerspace and its services are currently our top priorities. Services for personal projects may be limited based on time, material, and equipment availability. Request a 3D printed item You can also place a request to have an item 3D printed for you. Completed prints can be picked up at the Ask Us desk. What software can you use to make printable 3D models? For beginners, we recommend starting with Tinkercad. It is web-based and optimized for 3D printing. There are many other options. A few popular ones are SolidWorks, Blender, Rhino 3D, and Autodesk Fusion 360. Some of this software is available to students and staff through Software Licensing Management and Engineering Information Technology. What if I need to 3D print with higher resolution, faster turnaround time, or different materials? There are many professional 3D printing services available, including Craftcloud, Proto Labs, Shapeways and Fictiv. Spaces Makerspace, D. H. Hill Jr. Library Use in the Library Aleph Objects, inc.
