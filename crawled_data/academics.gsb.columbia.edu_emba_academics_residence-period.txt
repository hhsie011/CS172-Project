Academic building blocks. At the beginning of the Core term, you and your fellow EMBA-NY students will study together for three to five days, depending on your course schedule. The in-residence session takes place off campus at an all-inclusive conference facility in the New York City area. Away from the distractions of work and home, you will work intensely with your learning team and cluster to cover approximately a quarter of the term’s coursework over the course of a few days. Challenging and rewarding. Residence periods are consistently cited as a highlight to the EMBA experience, as students form strong bonds with their classmates and professors. These special alliances last well beyond your academics and into your professional career.
