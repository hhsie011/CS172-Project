This event will be an opportunity to bring together members of the Columbia community who have experience with institutional diversity, equity, inclusion, and anti-racism (DEIA) efforts through their leadership roles and visionary actions. It will be a targeted panel discussion, moderated by Alicia Roman, focused on the efforts taken by Columbia to expand DEIA and how such efforts can help support and inform the Climate School’s goals. This panel will help provide key insight into the actions, policies, and initiatives across Columbia and highlight important lessons and successes. As Columbia acknowledges systemic racism and its own historic shortcomings as an institution, it is essential to have these conversations and foster a collaborative environment to effect real change moving forward.
