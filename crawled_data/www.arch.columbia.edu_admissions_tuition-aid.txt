Awarded at the time of admission, GSAPP scholarships are competitive and based on a combination of merit and financial need in an effort to reduce financial barriers, increase equity and access to education, and yield the highest caliber students who are able to benefit from and contribute to the GSAPP experience. The School actively supports the recruitment of historically underrepresented groups at GSAPP and has established several scholarship funds for this purpose in the past years, including the George and Nancy Rupp Fellowship in 2018 honoring the legacy of the former President of the University, and the Milton and Yvonne Edelin Scholarship in 2019—the largest gift from a Black alumnus in the school’s history. In 2020, the School committed $1 million to establish the Norma Merrick Sklarek Scholars Fund to support a cohort of full tuition financial aid awards over the next three academic years. The Scholarship is named in honor of GSAPP alumna Norma Merrick Sklarek ‘50 B.Arch, who was among the first Black women to receive an architecture degree from Columbia and is recognized as the first Black woman to become a registered architect in the State of New York in 1954. Scholarships In order to be considered for a GSAPP scholarship, please complete the scholarship application in the online application. Allocations of scholarships are based on the following criteria. Funding is determined by the Program’s Admissions Committee. All applicants, domestic and international, are eligible. All applicants may complete a scholarship application that is included with the application for admission. The scholarship application must be submitted at the same time as the application for admission. The deadline is the same as the admissions deadline. Notification of a GSAPP scholarship is included in the admission letter. A direct tuition award is disbursed in the student’s account each term by the end of the change of program period (the second week of each semester). Full time enrollment and good academic standing are required. Scholarship awards are for the entire duration of the degree program and will be divided and disbursed evenly for each semester. For students in the M. Arch, M.S. UP, M.S. HP, MS. CCCP and NY/Paris programs, scholarships will be disbursed evenly for the Fall and Spring semesters. For students enrolled in the M.S. AAD, M.S. AUD or M.S. RED programs, scholarships will be disbursed evenly for the Summer, Fall, and Spring semesters. Emergency Fund Columbia GSAPP has renewed a $250,000 Emergency Fund for the 2021-2022 academic year to assist students with unexpected financial needs. Established and funded by the Dean’s Office, the GSAPP Emergency Fund was initially created in 2020 to support the student community facing hardships resulting from the impact of COVID-19. The Emergency Fund also welcomes gifts from friends and alumni whose contributions help support student success. The GSAPP Emergency Fund is for current GSAPP students who are enrolled full time and have urgent financial need that cannot be addressed by any other sources. These taxable stipends may vary in amount and will not exceed $1,000 per student in each application round. Students who have already received a stipend from the fund’s prior rounds and continue to experience financial hardship may re-apply for an additional stipend. Two rounds of funding in the Fall 2020 semester met 100% of requests by disbursing $91,138 in October 2020 and an additional $127,654 in December 2020. Further requests for support were met throughout the Spring 2021 semester, disbursing an additional $71,951. The School expanded the original budget to provide a total of $290,743 in emergency aid to 195 students during the 2020-2021 academic year. Read more and access the application form for 2021-2022 requests.. Employment Opportunities Assistantships Columbia GSAPP offers a limited number of merit-based teaching and research assistantships to students enrolled in full-time degree programs and to continuing non-enrolled students. Remuneration is based on the expected workload and is disbursed via semimonthly paychecks. An enrolled student receiving an assistantship will also be granted a tuition award, which is applied directly to the student’s account. Remuneration varies based on the position and falls within three ranges: 10 hours per week: $8,144 tuition award plus $2,320 salary 15 hours per week: $12,216 tuition award plus $3,480 salary 19 hours per week: $15,270 tuition award plus $4,410 salary The assignment of assistantships is made on the basis of qualifications for each position. Because these are merit-based positions, preference is given to applicants who have experience in the course or subject matter. Students are only eligible for one position per semester. A complete list of available positions is released to all students by the Dean’s Office in June. Applications are typically due the following month and students will be notified of their candidacy in late July. Positions are typically for the Fall and/or Spring terms (Summer term appointments are very limited). More information can be found on the Assistantships page. Casual Payroll GSAPP offers a range of hourly employment opportunities in the fabrication shop, output shop, exhibitions and events offices, and other administrative roles. Salaries are paid via bi-weekly time sheets at a rate of $16 and $17 per hour. Work-Study The federal Work-Study program is a form of financial assistance provided to students through part-time employment. This aid is usually $16 per hour and is awarded based on need. See the Student Financial Services Work-Study Overview for more details. Other Benefits Subsidized Travel GSAPP students receive travel stipends to offset required studio, conference, or thesis travel. Additionally, GSAPP hosts and funds international summer workshops. These faculty-led, non-curricular workshops take place each summer and are announced during the Spring Semester. Computers Each student enrolled in a design studio has 24-hour access to a dedicated computer and workspace. Computers are equipped with animation, modeling, and fabrication software and students do not need to purchase or maintain a personal computer. Columbia University & External Funding Columbia University Fellowships Columbia University offers a limited number of need-based institutional awards for graduate students.

External Funding Sources Many financial resources exist in addition to those offered by Columbia University. We urge students to research outside scholarships, including the selection and additional databases featured on the External Funding Sources page. Students may be eligible for a specific scholarship or grant from an outside agency. Some sources to explore are employers, unions, professional organizations, and special interest groups. Please also consult the Student Financial Services’ Outside Awards page for more information. Additional Domestic Student Funding Federal Aid Students interested in federal financial aid (loans and/or work study) should submit the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid). Please use FAFSA code 002707. Information on federal aid can be obtained by contacting Columbia University Financial Aid, 202 Kent Hall, 212-854-7040. Please note that although there is no official deadline for the FAFSA, Columbia University Student Financial Planning requires 4-6 weeks to prepare a Financial Aid Package.

Student Loans While student loans may be used to mitigate educational expenses, they are, nevertheless, loans that must be repaid after graduation or after you cease to be enrolled halftime in a degree-granting program. For this reason, we strongly urge you to be as prudent as possible when borrowing and to understand fully the terms and conditions of any loan that you may borrow.
