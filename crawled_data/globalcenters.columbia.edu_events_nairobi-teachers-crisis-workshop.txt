The training pack was developed through an inter-agency effort and is available as open-source materials on the Inter-agency Network for Education in Emergencies website (www.ineesite.org/tpd). The training pack consists of four modules based on the following core competencies: Teacher’s Role and Well-being; Child Protection, Well-being and Inclusion; Pedagogy; and Curriculum and Planning (note: the fifth module, Subject Knowledge, is not currently covered in the pack). Facilitators from Finn Church Aid, Norwegian Refugee Council, Save the Children and Teachers College-Columbia University will take participants through the four-day introductory version of the pack, with a fifth day for discussions about how to contextualize the pack across different settings and teacher profiles within the Kenyan context, hands-on opportunities to practice using the pack, and exploration of how to use the pack in teacher professional development, including peer coaching. Participants should meet the following criteria: Currently actively training teachers in refugee/host community education settings in Kenya High level of training facilitation skills Ability to adapt material to a teacher training program Expectation that they will be in post for at least a year following the training Commitment and availability to participate in the full 5 days of training There is a limited number of workshop spaces, therefore priority will be given to trainers working directly with teachers on professional development in emergency contexts in Kenya from CBOs, NGOs, UN agencies, universities and teacher training colleges, and the Ministry of Education. Regional advisers who train teacher trainers are also welcome. Participants will receive copies of the Teachers in Crisis Contexts Training Pack, refreshments and lunch. Participants will need to cover transportation, accommodation and per diems themselves. To begin the application process and/or if you have any questions, please contact Helena Sandberg ([email protected]) or Jonathan Penson ([email protected]). Please apply by Friday, May 5th.
