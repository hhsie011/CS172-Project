Application Information Apply Now Types of Support In the first year, fellowship support means that the student may concentrate entirely on coursework and preparation for the translation exams. In the second year, the student usually begins work as a teaching assistant, with a work expectation of not more than 20 hours per week. The stipend is obtained through this type of work, or by working as a teaching fellow, normally through the fourth year. Upon completion of the oral preliminary examination the student may apply for a dissertation fellowship from the University.
