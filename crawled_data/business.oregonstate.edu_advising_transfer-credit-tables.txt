If you didn't see your Oregon school listed, please view the Oregon College Articulation Tables page. Important things to know: Upper division credits must come from an AACSB-accredited business school. If your school is not AACSB accredited, then upper division business credits will be elective credits and not satisfy degree requirements. You must earn a C- or higher in all business requirements taken at a transfer institution. Meet with an advisor to determine how your transfer courses will apply to your major here. If you are interested in taking courses jointly at Oregon's community colleges, consider applying to the OSU Degree Partnership Program to simplify the transfer of credits. Beginning fall term 2016, the College of Business will also offer a 2-plus-2 Community College Partnership Program. Do you already have a bachelor's degree completed?
