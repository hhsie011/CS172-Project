Sociology is a social science that studies the social lives and behaviors of people, groups, institutions, and societies. Sociology examines social phenomena at multiple levels by using a variety of methods, including qualitative and quantitative approaches. It covers a wide range of social processes, from the analysis of brief interactions among strangers to the study of large-scale global change. Sociologists ask questions like: What types of social relations and processes create and maintain class or racial inequalities in society? What are the bases of social solidarity, trust and cohesion among people in an organization? What are the social causes and consequences of crime and deviance? How do social movements shape the health care system? What is the role of institutions in regulating gender and sexual behaviors? Are modern societies becoming more secular or more religious? Why Study Sociology? A degree in Sociology is part of a strong program of liberal arts studies that fosters critical thinking and analytical abilities as well as develops the writing and communication skills that prepare students for a diverse and increasingly global job market. Majoring in Sociology prepares students for a wide range of occupations including social work, market research and statistical analysis, education, criminal justice, business and management, graduate school, and community and social services, among others.
