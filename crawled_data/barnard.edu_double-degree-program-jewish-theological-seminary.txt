They pursue a major in the full array of liberal arts and a specialized course of study at Jewish Theological Seminary in fields such as Jewish Thought, Midrash, or Jewish Gender and Women’s Studies. The program is designed to be completed in four years, though summer coursework may sometimes be necessary. Students should consult with Academic Deans at both institutions during the Admissions process to learn more. Once enrolled, students will be assigned two advisors - one at Barnard and one at JTS - who will work together to help students navigate course credits and requirements. Double Degree students are also required to attend a coordinated orientation program between both institutions. All Double Degree students — per federal and College policy — must be registered in 12 or more credits to maintain good academic standing. As long as a student’s combined Barnard-JTS credits are equal to 12 or above, they are considered full-time students within the program. Double Degree students enrolled in 12 credits or more at Barnard in any given semester will be charged full tuition; if they take fewer than 12 credits, they pay on a per-credit basis. Students must decide how many credits they are taking by the time registration closes (usually during the first two weeks of the semester). Double Degree students who decide to drop below 12 credits AFTER the registration deadline (either by the "drop" deadline or by the "w" deadline — see the Academic Calendar for details) will still be charged full tuition. Only students who register for fewer than 12 credits at Barnard within the first two weeks will be eligible for per-credit payment. Tuition Details Full time at Barnard (12 credits or more) = $24,307 per semester (this does not include the comprehensive fees) Full time at JTS (9 credits or more) = $9,785 per semester Less than full time registration at either institution results in per credit charges for any courses taken at that institution. Barnard: $1,620 per credit JTS: $1,115 per credit Families can use a sample budget to figure out costs of the Double Degree program; this sample budget can be found on Barnard's Financial Aid website. Housing costs can also be found on that page. Barnard degree requirements must be fulfilled with appropriate courses taken at Barnard, Columbia, or on study leave. Program Enrollment Enrolled students acknowledge their intent to fulfill all of the requirements of the Double Degree Program at time of admission. The requirements and procedures for students who determine that they wish to transfer out of the program are as follows: Transfer out of the program will only be considered after two semesters of study at both institutions have been completed, and only for compelling, documentable reasons Student must write an appeal to the Academic Deans at Barnard and JTS explaining their reasoning; Submit their JTS transcript to Dean of Studies office at Barnard for review; Submit letters of approval from the Academic Deans at both institutions to the Barnard College Dean of Studies Office. The Double Degree appeals committee, made up of Deans and administrative staff from both institutions will meet to review the request and render a decision.
