To this end, our lab uses various model systems, including in vitro 2D cell cultures, ex vivo 3D explant and organoid models, and in vivo rodent and large animal models. Viral pathogenesis: Many veterinary species are naturally susceptible to pathogens closely related to those that infect humans. Since these animal and human pathogens frequently share similar pathogenesis profiles, animal diseases might be considered translational models for their human counterparts. The viruses we currently study are equine hepatitis-associated viruses, equine herpesviruses, and feline herpesvirus type 1. Stem cell biology: Our research group studies the basic physiology of adult stem cells as well as their potential in regenerative medicine. For example, we use a unique tool set consisting of mammary stem cell/progenitor cells (MaSC) from a variety of mammalian species, for comparative studies on the underlying molecular basis of susceptibility and resistance towards mammary/breast cancer. Stem cells also secrete a collection of bioactive factors, referred to as “the secretome”, which represents a new source to identify molecules with therapeutic potential. We are exploring the potential of the adult stem cell secretome to promote wound healing and fight infections.
