As a discipline, science communication brings together theory and practice to communicate scientific information to the public, with an emphasis on two-way and strategic communication with the public. This certificate is designed to encourage students who are interested in the intersection of science and society to pursue coursework that provides them with the skills to practice public-facing science and effectively engage the public around complex and sometimes controversial scientific topics. In addition, the certificate is designed to facilitate convergence across disciplines and encourage team-based collaboration at the undergraduate level. The certificate is open to students of any major, but may be of particular value to students who are planning to pursue science, environmental, health or agricultural communication as a career or students pursuing a career in a science, engineering, math and other technical fields interested in strengthening their communication skills. Objectives Encourage students to engage with community members, other students and faculty across interdisciplinary boundaries, diverse backgrounds, and divergent interests. Prepare students to communicate scientific findings and technological advances in a clear and compelling manner while also encouraging inclusive communication that acknowledges others’ values and concerns. Cultivate students’ understanding of the origins and dynamics of science related controversies and conflicts. Challenge students to identify and address scientific misinformation, scientific skepticism, and science denial across social media, blogs, and other social and online networks. Prepare students to engage in constructive conversations with diverse audiences over contested science, environmental, health, and agricultural topics. Student Learning Outcomes Students who complete the proposed science communication certificate will be able to: Create, co-produce, and evaluate public-facing science communication Understand and address the ethical, social, cultural, and historical factors that influence both the public communication of science and the rise and spread of science-related controversies Promote public and cross-disciplinary understanding of scientific information Co-produce knowledge with community stakeholders through public-facing projects Create effective and appropriate science messages across diverse and emergent media platforms, addressed to diverse audiences Critically analyze science messages addressed to public audiences around science Identify and address misinformation across social media, blogs, and other social and online networks Engage in constructive conversations about contested science, environmental, health, and agricultural topics To prepare students for the challenge of communicating effectively at the intersection of science and society, students will take a core of 12-credits from the Greenlee School of Journalism and Communication, the English Department, and the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies and 9-credits of electives from three tracks: science in practice, science and society, and communication in practice. The certificate requires 21 credits, where 9 of the credits taken do not fulfill any other requirements for other majors or general education. Students must complete ENGL 250 before enrolling in the certificate. Core Courses (12 credits) JL MC/P R/ADVRT 200-level core course TBD 3 PHIL 206 Introduction to Logic and Scientific Reasoning 3 ENGL 312 Communicating Science and Public Engagement 3 JL MC 347 Science Communication 3 Electives (9 credits) Students will take one course from each of the three categories of electives: Science in Practice, Science and Society, and Communication in Practice. 6 of the 9 credits must be at the 300+ level. Students who engage in an internship or research experience (including those connected to courses) may seek approval from the steering committee to have this experience counted as an elective course. This experience must include a public-facing communication/outreach component, and the steering committee will decide which of the 3 categories of electives this experience would fulfill. Students who wish to count the internship toward the certificate must track their hours as well as complete a final paper about their experiences.
