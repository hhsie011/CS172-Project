No one will receive such permission until lotteries are run on the 7 September. In order to seek entry, write to the instructor via the electronic mail address provided below (these addresses will be added toward the start of August -- please wait for this information rather than contacting the instructor through the instructor's standard electronic mail address -- this is to ensure all requests are accounted for). To participate in the lottery all requests must be received by 2 pm Wednesday, 7 September 2022. Requests received after that hour on 7 September will only be given consideration should space become available. The instructor will be in contact with you to share news (if a space is available, or if you are toward the top of the wait list).
