Current: Research Research Pursuing Purposeful Action Through Vigorous Research Researchers may focus on an individual or small group such as a team or family, an organization such as a business or a volunteer group, or a regional, national or international economy or society. Whatever the focus — local or international, for-profit or nonprofit — there is one thing in common: our faculty and students pursue purposeful action through vigorous research experiences. Sponsored Research In addition to research, this includes scholarly activity, creative activity, instruction or public service for which public, federal, university or private funding is sought to carry out the project. If a faculty member, staff or student is serving on a sponsored project, the project must be coordinated through the Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP), even if the person will not be the principal investigator. This coordination is required in order to ensure compliance with federal, University and private-sponsor regulations, terms and conditions. Other Research Other research includes journal publications, books/monographs or book chapters/proceeding for which no funding is pursued. This type of research is not required to be coordinated through OSP since no financial regulation is required.
