As a community of scholars and students, ESGS is dedicated to the study of the Humanities—in fields spanning Linguistics, East Asian and Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, Slavic and Eastern European Studies, and German Studies—reflecting on topics and studying languages that have special currency in our history, and for our times. With modern challenges on the rise, and with pressing questions dealing with societies in conflict, globalization, and migration becoming more pressing, the study of the Humanities is becoming all the more relevant, indeed crucial to addressing and making sense of growing global complexities. To this end, the Department of Eastern, Slavic, and German Studies brings forth intense curricular and disciplinary diversity, a unique dynamic academic ecosystem of sorts, that is reflected in the variety of the department’s undergraduate degree programs in Linguistics, Russian, East European Studies, Slavic Studies, German Studies, and an array of undergraduate departmental and inter-disciplinary minors in Linguistics, Russian, East European Studies, German, and East Asian and Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations.
