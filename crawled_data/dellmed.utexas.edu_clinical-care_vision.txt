The end goal is a complete revolution in how people get and stay healthy. Our Principles No. 1: Health care should be focused on you. Dell Med’s approach is defined by an interest in understanding the goals of the unique individual receiving care and creating person-centered teams of health care professionals prepared to support these goals. No. 2: Health care should be measurable. Improvement only happens when outcomes are measurable and when measurement is prioritized, which is why we’re committed to it. Our primary measure of success? Helping people reach their goals. No. 3: Health care should be value based. Better outcomes at lower costs — the definition of value-based health care — will require that traditional fee-for-service payment models be replaced by methods that reward prevention and early intervention. Dell Med is a leader in this movement. Starting with our own practice at UT Health Austin, we’re building a team-based approach to care whose primary mission is helping people meet their goals. C.
