First & Second Year Programming Careers in Medicine offers a number of specialty decision making programs in the first and second years. Careers in Medicine Seminar Series: This highly popular specialty series introduces first and second year medical students to several career disciplines in medicine. Approximately 10-15 programs are offered each semester during the lunch hour. The format for each event is a panel discussion followed by a Q&A session. Panelists typically include the department chair, residency program director, community provider, attendings and a resident. A robust discussion about the specialty, including what program directors look for in potential medical student candidates is the focus of each session as well as information on salary, hours, work life balance, and day to day activities in the field.
