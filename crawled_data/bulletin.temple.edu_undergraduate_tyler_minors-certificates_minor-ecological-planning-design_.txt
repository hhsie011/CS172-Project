The minor enhances students' understanding of the impact of development on natural resources and processes while gaining an appreciation of ecologically sensitive design and development. Students will develop leadership and decision-making skills relevant to ensuring that design and development takes into consideration ecological, social, political, economic, and governance factors. This minor prepares students for lifelong contributions to the sustainability of the communities in which they live and work. The Minor in Ecological Planning and Design consists of 18 credits, with two required foundation courses and four elective courses. The two foundation courses ensure that all students understand the fundamentals of natural and built systems and ecological planning. The electives allow students to develop a deeper understanding of ecologically sensitive development from the perspective of city planning, horticulture, and/or landscape architecture. Courses for this minor are offered at Ambler and Main campuses. Requirements Students must earn a minimum grade of C- in courses satisfying minor requirements and must have a minimum 2.0 grade point average in the required 18 credits to earn the minor.
