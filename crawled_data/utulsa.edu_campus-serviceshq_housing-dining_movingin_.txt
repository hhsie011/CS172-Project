All residents should have their student ID card to access and be in the pool area. In order to ensure everyone has a safe and fun time at the pool, we would like to remind everyone of some important pool policies: Glass is prohibited anywhere within the fence of the Pool area. Tulsa Health Dept requires that if broken glass is found within the fence the entire pool be shut down for days to drain, clean, and refill the pool.

Alcohol and tobacco products including cigarettes and vaping are not permitted in pool area. Animals prohibited from the pool area. No lifeguard on duty. No running, horse play, and please do not swim alone. Only campus residents with their student ID are permitted to use the pools. No persons under the age of 18 may be in the pool area unless their parent or guardian is a campus resident and supervising them from within the pool area. Current outdoor COVID-19 protocols are in place within the pool area. Although students will not need to wear a face mask, students must maintain physical distancing. 800 S.
