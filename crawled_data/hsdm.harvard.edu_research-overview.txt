HSDM’s long-term goal is to be at the forefront of research into the cause and cure for diseases of bone and craniofacial soft tissues. Such research enables dental medicine to impact new avenues of research and investigation into major skeletal disorders such as osteoporosis and osteoarthritis, autoimmune diseases, tumor biology, and wound healing, taking dentistry beyond the mechanical techniques, and repositioning the discipline firmly in the realm of biology. As the only School within Harvard University with its own clinical facility, HSDM continues to differentiate itself through a unique emphasis on clinical, translational, health policy and epidemiological research combined with exemplary patient care and education. HSDM has become a leader in oral health informatics, specifically dental diagnostic terminology in the electronic health record, patient safety, and quality improvement. Clinical research projects at HSDM are focused on dental genetics, regeneration, color science and soft tissue esthetics, early caries detection, fixed prosthodontics, oral implantology, and applied digital dental technologies.
