Our priorities are informed by a commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. Penn Libraries Diversity Statement The Penn Libraries seeks to support the educational and scholarly endeavors of the Penn community both locally and wherever students, faculty, and staff may be located around the world. As such, the Libraries supports the mission and goals of the Office of Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity Programs and the University's Nondiscrimination Statement. Specifically, the spirit present in the statement's preamble calling on the community to tap into our diversity, to strengthen ties across all boundaries, and enrich the intellectual climate to create a more vibrant community. And finally, with particular emphasis, calling on us to foster and nourish diversity especially among students, faculty and staff as part of the central core mission of the University. The Penn Libraries seeks to create an environment that is welcoming and open to its constituency offering resources of collections and services that are available in accordance with universal accessibility standards, delivered without respect to race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, national or ethnic origin, citizenship status, age, disability, veteran status or any other legally protected class, world view, political perspective, or purpose. In addition, the Penn Libraries seeks to maintain a workplace that fosters respect, and that encourages an environment in which each employee learns from, and thrives on the differences of their colleagues at all levels of the institution. GOLD The Group on Library Diversity (GOLD) supports the University of Pennsylvania Libraries Diversity Statement, including its commitment to foster and ensure a welcoming and respectful environment for all library staff and users. GOLD provides training and informational programs, assists with the recruitment process, and serves as a resource for raising awareness about diversity.
