Due to the spread of COVID-19 throughout the United States and globally, the hosting these types of events on campus will change. We have compiled best practices, resources and considerations for planning these experiences. Now is the perfect time to review and update policies for events, camps and large group meetings on campus. The American Camp Association (ACA) and YMCA are working together to create a Camp Operations Guide to provide educational resources for both day and overnight camps. Below you will find up to date resources and best practices that are meant to help spread awareness of the tools and knowledge necessary to ensure safety to participants and employees during summer programs. The State of Texas and Texas Tech University are committed to providing a safe and educationally enriching environment for all guests and participants of camps or programs held on University property. Any camps involving minors should register through the Minors on Campus website and adhere to specific guidelines set forth by the TTU Office of Risk Management. Please refer to the Office of Communications & Marketing, Operations Division , Office of Research and Innovation, Human Resources and Office of the Provost for TTU specific updates.
