The Certificate in Entrepreneurship equips students with an understanding of the fundamental building blocks of the entrepreneurial process: i) understanding and validating an unmet need; ii) developing a value proposition that addresses an unmet need; and iii) designing a sustainability model that allows the value proposition to be delivered repeatedly at scale. Two core courses introduce students to foundational entrepreneurial concepts. Two elective courses will extend students' foundational work into areas of particular interest. Finally, students will complete an entrepreneurship practicum that enables them to apply what they have learned in the classroom to a real-world project of interest.
