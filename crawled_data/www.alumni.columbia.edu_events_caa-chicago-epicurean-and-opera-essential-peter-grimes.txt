Join us for a discussion and audience participation about key passages in Benjamin Britten's masterwork. The evening will be filled with delightful musical performances, beautiful staging, and a lively set of observations on the opera's place in music history. Reviewing the Metropolitan Opera’s 2008 staging of the opera, Andrew Ross wrote: “You come face to face with the opera’s darkest elements: not just the much analyzed psychology of Grimes, who may or may not be guilty of abusing his apprentices, but also the psychology of the crowd, which lustily passes judgment on the fisherman without having heard the evidence.” Featuring some of the most powerful and evocative music ever written, Peter Grimes is an essential modern opera or is it? That's for our audience to decide. https://chicago.alumni.columbia.edu/the_epicurean_and_opera_sushi_and_peter_grimes?utm_campaign=newsletter_sept_8_supp&utm_medium=email&utm_source=columbia48 Contact Information CAA Global and Diversity Engagement [email protected] Upcoming Events Columbia Alumni Center 622 West 113th Street, Mail Code 4525 · New York, NY 10025 Phone 212-851-7800 Contact Us [email protected] Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
