As such, we serve the campus community as a resource for general policy and procedural information and provide direct, timely counsel to resolve individual questions or concerns regarding job descriptions, job classification, talent acquisition, search requirements, benefits, leaves of absence, workers compensation and disability claims, disability accommodations, payroll and time sheets, visas, merit increments, performance management, appointment renewal, and employment recordkeeping. While many actions require approvals from the Provost's Office or Central HR or others in affiliated departments with Columbia University, employment-related inquiries occur through LDEO-HR.
