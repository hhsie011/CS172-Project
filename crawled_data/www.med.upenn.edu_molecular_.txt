The scientific focus of the Center revolves around host-environmental interactions in digestive and liver disease research from bench to bedside. The Center is divided into three thematic areas: Intestinal Biology, Liver Biology, and the Microbiome. Center resources include four biomedical research cores to support research in both model systems and human subjects, a pilot & feasibility program, and various enrichment activities including a weekly seminar series, liver and intestinal stem cell clubs, and an annual retreat.
