Columbia Housing tries to accommodate students’ requests to live on campus after the first year, however there is no guarantee that Combined Plan students will be offered a room on campus beyond the first year. More information about the program is available on the SEAS Combined Plan website. Off-Campus Housing Assistance (OCHA) can assist students with housing in non-Columbia owned buildings.
