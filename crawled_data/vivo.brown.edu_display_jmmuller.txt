My interests in Flemish renaissance and baroque art expanded from there and embraced the question of how art made for the Counter Reformation changed society. Currently I am working on a new project about the Jesuit global strategy of accommodation. How did the Jesuits fashion their interactions with the diverse peoples from China to Peru whose souls they wished to save?

Full Text Research Research Overview My current research is centered on the Jesuit global strategy of accommodation. How and why did the Jesuits change their appearance and visual messages to agree with the customs and capacities of every group they tried to convert around the world, whether Japanese feudal aristocracy or Flemish peasants? Research Statement My research integrates the methods of art history and history with the purpose of reaching a fuller understanding of how works of art functioned in history.
