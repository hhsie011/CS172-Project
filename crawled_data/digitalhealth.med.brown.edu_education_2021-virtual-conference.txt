But we also saw many metrics of our country’s behavioral health--ranging from mental illness to violence to opioid overdoses--worsen. Now is the time to deploy effective digital tools for these forgotten epidemics, as well. To make progress, we must reinvent the methods and tools used for prevention and treatment. During the 2021 Center for Digital Health Virtual Conference - hosted by the Brown-Lifespan Center for Digital Health (CDH) in Providence, RI - we will explore the cutting edge of design and implementation of ethical and effective digital health to reductions in mental illness, violence, and opioid use. Panels and symposia explored some of the most promising innovations in these areas; discuss innovative digital measurements of loneliness, stress, and more; and dive deeply into questions of how clinicians, patients, communities, and technologists can collaboratively co-design products that enhance and expand prevention and treatment options. Learn from thought leaders, researchers, clinicians, computer scientists, and engineers to help set the stage for better digital health for the post-pandemic world. Speakers ranged from world-renowned academic experts, to the FDA Digital Health Center of Excellence, to start-up founders, to healthcare system leaders, to investors. The event was hosted on June 22, 2021 from 12:00pm - 4:00pm EDT.
