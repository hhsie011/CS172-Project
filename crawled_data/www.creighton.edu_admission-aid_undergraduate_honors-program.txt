For students with remarkable abilities, Creighton offers an extraordinary opportunity: our honors and leadership programs. Designed for students who excel in the classroom and in leadership roles, these programs will help you unlock your potential. You’ll receive personalized support from faculty advisers, optimize your personal and academic growth, and have the opportunity to apply what you know and make a difference. To be considered for one of these programs, submit 1) your Application for Undergraduate Admission and all required credentials; and 2) the Program Application with all additional required materials to the Admissions Office by January 10, 2022 at 11:59 PM (in your local time zone). Some programs require an interview. Because of the continuing impacts of COVID-19, 2022 applicants may elect to complete their interview virtually over Zoom, or sign up to attend an in-person interview on campus during Special Programs Day on February 6, 2022. The program applications will be available in the student portal for eligible students beginning in November. You may also find answers to your questions on our FAQ page. Students are encouraged to apply to all programs they are interested in and eligible for. Applying to multiple programs does not impact the review process or chances of being accepted into a program. However, students are only able to participate in one program.* This is determined via a mutual selection process. A student will be able to rank their program preferences after the application process is complete. *Creighton Pre-Professional Scholars Program (CPPSP) is the only exception to this. For example, a student may participate in both Honors and CPPSP, but not Honors and FLP.
