Program Information The Program in Medieval Studies encourages the interdisciplinary study of the Middle Ages: its art, literature (Latin and vernacular), music, religion, science, philosophy, politics, and economic and social structures. Supported by the vast resources for medieval studies at Princeton (including an outstanding medieval manuscript collection and the photographic archive known as the Index of Medieval Art), the program sponsors one course: an introductory seminar, and a (non-credit) thesis writers' colloquium for seniors. Approximately another 40 courses directly relevant to medieval studies are listed following this description. Admission to the Program During the first year or sophomore year, each student who wishes to enroll in the program should take MED 227 The Worlds of the Middle Ages or discuss with the director what other kinds of preparation might be otherwise acceptable. At the time of the selection of a major in a department, a student wishing to obtain a certificate in medieval studies at graduation should also seek admission to the program from the director. At this time, an on-line application (accessible from the Program website) to the program should be filled out and submitted. Program of Study MED 227 (or the equivalent such as HUM 216 and HUM 217) is required, as is, in the senior year, the thesis writers' colloquium. In addition, the student should take and pass four courses either that are cross-listed in Medieval Studies (for example, those listed in the following roster) or that are not cross-listed but cover a medieval topic. At least one of the four additional courses should be at the 400 level or above and not all can be from the same department. The senior thesis and at least one junior paper must deal directly with the Middle Ages. The student's course of study must receive the prior approval of the director of undergraduate studies (in the major) and the director of the Program in Medieval Studies. Languages Students should study an appropriate medieval or modern language, subject to the approval of the Program Director. Senior Thesis Colloquium Separate from any other departmental requirements, this noncredit colloquium will regularly bring together all seniors in the program in order to discuss issues and strategies related to conducting independent research and writing, such as problems of data collection, organization of ideas, and the process of writing. Meetings will be every other week during the Fall semester, and weekly during the Spring semester. In addition to discussing research strategies, students will have the opportunity to workshop drafts of their work in progress throughout the year. At the end of the Spring semester, students present the results of their research projects to the community in an afternoon mini-conference. Certificate of Proficiency Students who fulfill all requirements of the program will receive a certificate of proficiency in medieval studies upon graduation.

In between, we will trace the different trajectories that the area stretching from Iceland to Iran traveled along over the course of this fateful millennium. We will meet Northern barbarians, Arab armies, Vikings, Crusaders, Mongols, and the Ottomans; we will witness the birth of Islam and medieval Islamic civilization; Charlemagne's creation of the Western Roman empire; will see clashes between Popes and rulers and Caliphs and Muslim religious authorities. We will do all this and more, all the while asking: what were the Middle Ages? Instructed by: H. Reimitz, J.
