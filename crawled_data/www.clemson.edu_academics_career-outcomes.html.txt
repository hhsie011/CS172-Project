Alumni Once a Tiger, always a Tiger. We are proud to share the impact Clemson alumni make through their determined spirit. Meet Recent Clemson Alumni Walking across the stage at graduation was just the beginning for these Tigers. See how young alumni leveraged their Clemson degrees to land their dream jobs. Alyxandria Farkas, Marketing and Graphic Communications ’20 Many of Alyxandria’s favorite Clemson memories involve her time in the graphic communications program. During Homecoming Week in Fall 2019, she designed and printed the banners displayed across campus and helped run an indoor makerspace day in the Watt Center for fans and alumni. She traveled to the National Postal Forum and to Chicago twice for a print industry conference, experiences that revealed some of the real-world applications of her work. Following an internship with consumer goods company Unilever, Alyxandria was accepted into their Future Leaders Program after graduation. Ray Cummings, Packaging Science ’20 Few schools in the country offer a major in packaging science, and Ray chose Clemson University because of the hands-on, creative experience offered through a program emphasis in design and graphics. Ray took advantage of every opportunity he could pursue, from completing an R&D co-op with PepsiCo’s beverage division in Chicago to acting as the exhibit manager and design lead for Clemson’s booth at Pack Expo International 2018. A recent graduate, Ray aspires to work in the luxury packaging sector and contribute to its innovative and creative advancements.
