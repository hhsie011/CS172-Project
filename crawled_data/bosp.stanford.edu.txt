Regardless of the academic path you choose, you will be enriched by time spent in another country. Achieving cultural literacy and gaining a substantive understanding of other perspectives in the world will deepen your awareness of yourself, your educational goals, and your own society. Nearly one-half of each graduating class studies away through one of Stanford's off-campus programs. Financing Study Away Stanford is committed to providing all undergraduates the opportunity to study away with BOSP, regardless of financial circumstances.
