In addition, other important information about the chemical manufacturer, fire-fighting procedures, personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements, and spill clean-up procedures is provided. Chemical manufacturers and importers are required to provide SDS's with all shipments. It is the employer's responsibility to make this information available to their employees. Employers are also required to maintain SDS's for all hazardous chemicals in the workplace. This information must be readily accessible to all employees during the work shift. Employers must ensure that when a new product or chemical is brought into the workplace that employees are provided with the information from the SDS and are provided with training on the hazards of the new chemical. This information is available to Columbia University personnel via the web-based service, ChemWatch.
