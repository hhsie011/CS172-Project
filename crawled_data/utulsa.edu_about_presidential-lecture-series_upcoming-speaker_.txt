Sanger April 12, 2022 7:30-9 p.m. Reynolds Center The University of Tulsa Three-time Pulitzer Prize winner and national security correspondent for The New York Times, David E. Sanger is known for his extensive research and deep investigations into the complex events of our time. A member of the 2017 Pulitzer Prize-winning team in international reporting, Sanger is one of the nation’s most lucid analysts of geopolitics, globalization and cyber power. He is a national security and political contributor for CNN and a frequent guest on CBS This Morning, Face the Nation and PBS. With more than 35 years as a foreign correspondent, Sanger speaks on a wide range of diplomatic and national security issues, from the NSA to nuclear proliferation and the rise of cyber conflict between countries. Drawing from his investigative work, Sanger brings a unique view into the rise of Asia, cybersecurity, global competition and a volatile Middle East. His latest book, The Perfect Weapon: War, Sabotage, and Fear in the Cyber Age, is an incisive look into how cyberwarfare is influencing elections, threatening national security and bringing us to the brink of global war. Sanger’s national bestseller Confront and Conceal: Obama’s Secret Wars and Surprising Use of American Power is a riveting analysis of the Obama administration’s foreign policy, including its covert reliance on cyberwarfare, drones and special operations forces. The book sent shockwaves around the globe and was called an “astonishingly revealing insider’s account” by Foreign Affairs. His previous bestseller, The Inheritance: The World Obama Confronts and the Challenges to American Power, is an in-depth examination of American foreign policy successes and failures. TIME called it a “behind-the-scenes account … laced with scoops and secret conversations about a world spinning out of America’s control.” A 30-year veteran of The New York Times, Sanger’s coverage of the Iraq and Korea crises took home the Weintal Prize, one of the highest honors for diplomatic reporting. He also won the White House Correspondents’ Association Aldo Beckman prize for his presidential coverage. Early in his career, Sanger covered technology and economics, before turning to foreign policy. Over the years, he has focused on North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, the rise and fall of Japan and China’s increasing power and influence. Later, he covered domestic and foreign policy issues as the Times’ White House correspondent from 1999 to 2006. He is a featured journalist in Alex Gibney’s 2016 docu-thriller, Zero Days, based largely on Sanger’s investigation of the secret American and Israeli cyber program to attack Iran’s nuclear facilities. Sanger teaches national security policy as a visiting scholar and adjunct professor at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government. 800 S.
