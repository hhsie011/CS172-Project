When you report on the aid application that you have siblings in college for whom your parents provide financial support, we include that information in an effort to establish a fair and reasonable expected contribution. In the fall, we may request enrollment confirmation for each sibling reported to be enrolled. Your sibling will be asked to take our Sibling Enrollment Confirmation Form to their institution’s financial aid office or registrar to certify their enrollment status and college costs.
