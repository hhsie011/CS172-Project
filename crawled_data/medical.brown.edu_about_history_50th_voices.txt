Alexander Raufi ’08 MD’13 Oncologist, Assistant Professor of Medicine, The Warren Alpert Medical School Tweet this quote “ My Brown education … really prepared me to take care of patients. Not just those who are sitting in front of me in an office setting one-on-one, but also people who are outside your walls—thinking about systemic issues that affect the health of a population, figuring out problems in a community, and then being able to address them through research and then working on a higher level with other providers to improve problems that you've identified. ” Sofia Aronson ’14 MD’18 Plastic Surgery Resident, Northwestern Medicine Tweet this quote “ The Warren Alpert Medical School has given me the opportunity and confidence to pursue a diverse skill set.
