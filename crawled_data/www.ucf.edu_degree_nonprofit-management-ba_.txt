Learn How Nonprofits Operate and Explore Their Value in Communities The BA in Nonprofit Management degree at UCF helps you learn the fundamental elements of how nonprofit organizations operate. The program provides an in-depth look at two critical elements of nonprofits: fiscal resources and human (people) resources. Both are necessary for organizations to provide intended services to their community. As a nonprofit major, you’ll gain a well-rounded approach that provides you with the skills and knowledge required to support nonprofit organizations in a variety of capacities. Classes are offered fully online, mixed-mode, and at UCF Downtown, making it easy to select class options that work for your schedule. You’ll also get first-hand experience working with a nonprofit organization through your required internship course. This allows you to learn what it takes to succeed in the industry while making connections along the way. The UCF School of Public Administration also coordinates an annual nonprofit conference that provides you with additional opportunities to directly interact with nonprofit leaders around the region and country. Upon graduation, work in organizational support roles in areas such as development/fundraising, program management and evaluation, financial management, human resources/volunteer management and communications. The nonprofit degree could also be moderately equated to a business degree if your interests align more with nonprofit or charitable organizations. Plus, after completing your coursework, you’ll be prepared to pursue a national credential in nonprofit leadership and management from the Nonprofit Leadership Alliance and a certificate in fundraising from the Association of Fundraising Professionals. This helps you stay competitive and gives you an edge on the competition. Highlights First nonprofit management bachelor’s degree program in Florida.
