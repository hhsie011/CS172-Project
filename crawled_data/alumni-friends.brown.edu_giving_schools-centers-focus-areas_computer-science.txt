Faculty, students, and alumni pioneer breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and visual computing. Together, they've made Brown a premier destination for both talent development and collaborative research. As the influence of computer science on our lives continues to grow, the department is committed to amplifying its power through: The recruitment of faculty with diverse areas of expertise Centers of research excellence that build on the department’s strengths Innovative approaches to CS education Partnerships that bring into focus the social impact of computation Today, more than one in six Brown undergraduates concentrates in computer science, making it the largest concentration at the University. It's also garnered significant interest from many students outside the department, as more and more non-concentrators take CS courses every year. To meet the needs of these students and the demand for computational technologies that improve lives, the department has designed a strategic plan for expansion: CS with Impact. The CS with Impact plan calls for: Growing CS faculty by 50% with the addition of 10 new tenure-track faculty and five new lecturers. Curriculum development that takes into account the ethics of computing and the coherence of teaching methods at all levels. Enhancing interdisciplinary programs in cybersecurity, human-centered robotics, data science, and visual computing. Creating more opportunities for students to participate in high-level research. Support computer science at Brown. With your help, we can advance technology to solve real-world problems.
