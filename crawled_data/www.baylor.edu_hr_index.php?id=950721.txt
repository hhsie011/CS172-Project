Be prepared to discuss specific aspects of the job and relate how your skills and experience make you the best candidate. Be prepared to ask questions about the organization at the appropriate time as well. Remember, you are interviewing Baylor as much as Baylor is interviewing you. It is recommended that you become familiar with Baylor University’s mission statement and our vision statement, Pro Futuris. Be Prepared to Discuss Your Faith Baylor is affiliated with the Baptist General Convention of Texas and as such Baylor is permitted to consider religious affiliation in its employment decisions. If you have never interviewed with a religious organization previously, being asked about your faith in an interview will most likely be a new experience. Baylor is committed to providing a welcoming and nurturing work environment, and complies with all federal and state non-discriminatory laws, but as a private Christian university, our unique faith identity is an important part of who we are. Exercising our legal right to discuss matters of faith in the selection process is a critical piece of Baylor fulfilling its mission. Plan Ahead Remember the old adage, you only get once chance to make a first impression. Arriving late for an interview may create an obstacle you cannot overcome. To help ensure you arrive on time, plan your route prior to the day of your interview. If you have concerns about parking, ask your recruiter about parking options before the day of your interview. Make sure you leave your home or hotel well in advance of your arrival time, and allow for unforeseen circumstances such as issues with traffic. It is recommended you plan your route in advance so you can identify the shortest route, and potential alternate routes should encounter traffic issues. Prepare While there is no way to know exactly which questions will be asked of you in an interview, think through different scenarios that you might anticipate arising in your interview. A good tip is to write out questions you anticipate might be asked, and then prepare your answer. If you expect to present some data to support one of your answers, compile the data prior to the interview. It is always best if you can answer with solid information instead of speculating in an answer. Remember, your answers to interview questions should demonstrate why you would be a great candidate to fill the job Be Specific Listen closely to each question and then answer directly. For example, if the interviewer asks you to tell about a time you had a difficult interaction with a customer, tell about a specific interaction. Answers that give specifics about the issue involved, the actions taken, and the outcome are much stronger answers than speaking hypothetically about how you would handle a situation if it were to occur. Questions that ask for specific examples require specific answers. Dress for Success You want to make a good first impression, and your choice of apparel can say a lot about how serious you are treating the interview. Our dress code is business casual, but the specifics can vary from department to department. When in doubt, ask your recruiter for suggestions.
