Problem solving is a skill you develop over time, but how do you teach it in a semester? The Problem-Solving Course Design Institute (PSCDI) is an opportunity for faculty, staff, postdocs, and graduate student teams* to (re)design assignments that engage students in the problem-solving process. Instructors will be able to apply evidence-based approaches to teaching and learning, reflect on their own problem-solving process and how to effectively communicate those skills to students. PSCDI is a cohort-based model, so instructors will have an opportunity to share their insights with colleagues in a supportive environment and synthesize new ways to approach teaching the problem-solving process. *We strongly encourage faculty to invite members of their instructional team (i.e., a postdoc, graduate student, and/or undergraduate student) to participate. Faculty participants may choose to co-design their course with a graduate or undergraduate student, or an undergraduate problem-solving fellow. PSCDI is the instructor complement of UNIV 1110: Theory and Practice of Problem Solving. STEM undergraduate teaching assistants who take this course will become Problem-Solving Fellows who will have the skills necessary for effective problem solving, engaging in diverse learning spaces, and reflective learning and teaching practices.
