Mentoring Award Award Winners Support for Editors Previous Recipients Admissions Categories Matriculated graduate status is granted to an applicant who has been accepted into a graduate certificate or degree program and has met all admissions criteria. Note that applicants first receive a provisional acceptance, and conversion to matriculated graduate status is dependent upon receipt of an official transcript that confirms that the student holds a baccalaureate or higher degree from a college or university regarded as standard by a regional or general accrediting agency. Please note that additional official documentation may be required (e.g. if the transcript does not contain information about degree conferral or if a foreign degree needs confirmation as baccalaureate equivalent). Instructions and deadlines for meeting this requirement are included in the section on Submission of Official Transcripts for Accepted & Confirmed Students. Provisional graduate status is granted to applicants who have been accepted into a graduate certificate or degree program, but who have NOT yet met all admissions criteria. As described above, one routine requirement for all students is the submission of an official transcript. However, some students must in addition take undergraduate courses or improve English language proficiency to satisfy prerequisites, and these students may be accepted by the program on a provisional basis that is contingent on satisfying those additional prerequisites. Letters of admission should be read carefully to make sure all requirements tied to provisional status are identified. Unclassified graduate status allows students to take courses for graduate credit when they have not been admitted into a graduate degree program. Should this non-matriculated student subsequently matriculate into a certificate or degree program, a maximum of 12 semester hours may be applied to the certificate or degree program. Students are not eligible for tuition or stipend awards allocated by the Graduate School while in unclassified (non-matriculated) graduate status. This policy and other funding policies are further explained in the Financial Support section. Graduate School at the University of Cincinnati 110 Van Wormer Hall P.O.
