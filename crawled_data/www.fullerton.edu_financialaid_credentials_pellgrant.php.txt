At that time your courses are evaluated to ensure you are eligible for a disbursement. If you are taking prerequisites courses, those are not counted as eligible for a Pell Grant disbursement. disbursement for pell grant Enrollment Status Number of Units Enrolled Percentage of Disbursed Amount Full-Time 12 or more units 100% Three-Quarter-Time 9-11 units 75%* Half-Time 6-8 units 50%* Less-Than-Half-Time **Note: Credential Students must be enrolled in a minimum of 6 units of required credential coursework 1-5 units 25%* *In some instances a student enrolled in less than 12 units may lose eligibility for his/her Pell Grant, as the EFC's in the higher end of the Pell Grant range does not allow for less than full-time enrollment. Pell Grant recipients who change enrollment status - adding or dropping courses - will have their eligibility recalculated based on their enrollment status as of the University's census date for each semester, typically the beginning of the fourth week of class. Likewise, Pell Grant fund will be recalculated for students who drop classes and the revised Pell Grant will be based on "census" enrollment status. In some instances, this recalculation may results in repayment of fund already disbursed as a result of the reduction in units following the disbursement of Pell Grant funds.
