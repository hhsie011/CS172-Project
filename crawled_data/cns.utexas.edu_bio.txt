Scientists and mathematicians love to ask the questions "why?" and "how?" and dig in to find the answers. The college is dedicated to preparing our students to be this nation's next leaders, creators, and inventors. No matter what your future profession - whether a health profession, biotechnologist or computer entrepreneur - we are preparing you to succeed. Our Mission Our goal at BIO is to provide undergraduate students with the best possible experience in their Biology classes. We foster teaching excellence, creativity, and innovation. What We Do BIO coordinates the teaching and scheduling of all courses taught by the three Biology Departments. We also develop the curriculum for entry level Biology and non-majors biology classes. And importantly, all of the Professors of Instruction who teach your classes have a home base in BIO.
