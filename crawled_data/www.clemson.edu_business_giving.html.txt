to the College Give to the College By investing philanthropically in the Wilbur O. and Ann Powers College of Business' Annual Fund, your gifts enable us to enhance the best efforts of our students, faculty and programmatic needs. Your unrestricted support demonstrates your passion and affinity for Clemson University at a time when we are asking our Clemson Family to consider their proudest gift and to rise and support our Will to Lead campaign. With these 100% tax-deductible gifts, we are able to advance the needs of the college and are grateful to our many alumni who have invested their resources in support of our mission. Our strength has always been in our numbers and together we can achieve more. Thank you for enriching the lives of our students and priorities for the Wilbur O. and Ann Powers College of Business. If you would like to support Wilbur O. and Ann Powers College of Business, please go to our online giving form. Top Funding Priorities Dean's Excellence Fund Every day, the competition increases for the best faculty, the brightest students and the most cutting-edge research. In order to remain a viable business school, the Wilbur O. and Ann Powers College of Business must provide funds to increase programmatic offerings to our students and faculty that will make the college a top-10 business college. Wilbur O. and Ann Powers College of Business Building The new home for the Wilbur O. and Ann Powers College of Business is a think-tank environment, bringing students, faculty and industry together in a collaborative, inspiring space that is forward-thinking in its design and daily application. Business students have the kind of attractive environment that compels them to work, engage, study, ask hard questions, challenge themselves and work together. Undergraduate Scholarships and Graduate Fellowships Dwindling public funding, growing tuition rates and more people entering higher education have created an urgent need for additional scholarships and fellowships. Need-based funding will open doors for students who would not otherwise be able to afford college, and prestigious merit-based awards will attract the nation's top students. In turn, these students will contribute to both the college and Clemson's academic reputation. Endowed Chairs and Professorships To reach its full potential as a top-tier research university, the Wilbur O. and Ann Powers College of Business must recruit and retain eminent scholars, teachers and researchers to continue the tradition of excellence established by current faculty. Endowed chairs and professorships help the college import the intellectual capital needed to be at the pinnacle of academic research. We must continue to attract faculty of this caliber to help shape the educational environment for our students, the national reputation of Clemson University and the economic prosperity of our state. You can support Wilbur O. and Ann Powers College of Business online or through other methods of giving.
