In accordance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (Clery Act), Brown University is making information available regarding campus security policies and procedures, as well as crime statistics reported to law enforcement agencies for the area where Brown University is located. The Clery Act is a federal law that requires colleges and universities to disclose certain timely and annual information about campus crime. The Department of Public Safety (DPS) is responsible for the collection and reporting of crime statistics, as required by the (Clery Act). Each year, DPS files a report of campus crime statistics with the U.S. Department of Education. These crime statistics are compiled from local police agencies, the Department of Public Safety, and officials of the University defined as Campus Security Authority (CSA). Crime statistics for the past three calendar years are maintained in our 2021 Annual Security Report. Daily Crime Log The Clery Act requires colleges and universities to keep a daily crime log. The purpose of this log is to provide criminal or alleged criminal activity that is reported to the University and surrounding areas. This log includes incident classification, report number, reported date and time, occurrence date and time, location of incident and disposition; it does not include any identifying information about persons involved in an incident. The Department of Public Safety is responsible for maintaining this log for the University and for ensuring that it is updated within two business days of being notified of an incident. To view the log for the most recent 60-day period, please visit the Department of Public Safety at 75 Charlesfield Street in Providence, RI during business hours (Monday through Friday, 8:30 am-4:30 pm). The fire log is available at the Office of Environmental Health & Safety at 164 Angell Street in Providence, RI. DPS retains Daily Crime Logs for seven years. Requests for logs that are more than 60-days old will be fulfilled within two business days.
