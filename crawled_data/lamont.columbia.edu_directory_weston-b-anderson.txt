Anderson Weston B. Anderson I’m an agro-climatologist studying the dynamics of climate variability and its relation to food security using reanalysis products, remote sensing observations and model simulations. I’ve recently been working on how global-scale modes of climate variability pose a risk to major agricultural production regions. I am currently an Earth Institute Fellow working on climate and food security Fields of Interest Climate science, Agriculture, Food Security Expand all Collapse all Publications Anderson, W.
