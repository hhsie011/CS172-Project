It provides viewers with a quick and distinctive impression of the university and is a critical element in telling its stories. Maintaining high standards and using photographs that support the Cornell brand reflects the excellence of the university. Professional photography should be used as often as possible. This is particularly important for external communications. Web sites and print materials should be created by professional designers familiar with the proper use of photography. All photographs should be printed at 300 dpi at the actual size. Do not increase the size of digital images as this can cause the image to be distorted. Cornell Photos image library The Cornell Photos image library provides approved photography in support of the university's marketing and communications needs. Images can be searched and downloaded at sizes and resolutions appropriate for use on Cornell websites and in Cornell publications.
