Philanthropic Impact Through planned giving, you can use a variety of strategies and assets to support HBS during your lifetime or at your passing, while also fulfilling your financial planning goals. Wills and Estate Plans Bequest Including HBS in your will is an easy way to leave a legacy at the School. Retirement Plan or Life Insurance Naming HBS as a beneficiary of a life insurance policy or retirement plan, such as a 401(k) or IRA, is a tax-efficient way to support the School. Gifts That Provide for You and Others Charitable Gift Annuity A CGA provides secure, fixed payments for life to one or two individuals you choose, and ultimately supports the HBS purpose you specify. Charitable Remainder Trust With a CRT, Harvard pays you and/or others you choose variable income for life, and uses the remainder as you directed. Charitable Lead Trust A CLT enables you to support HBS and transfer assets to children or other heirs at a reduced tax cost. Gifts of Assets Complex Assets Tangible personal property (e.g. artwork or jewelry), private-company stock, pre-IPO shares, private equity, and hedge fund investments may be used to make a gift. Real Estate You can use real estate that you no longer need or enjoy, such as a personal residence, vacation home, or commercial property, to support HBS. Simplify Your Philanthropy Donor-Advised Fund Establishing a donor-advised fund at Harvard can help you achieve your philanthropic goals for HBS, as well as other charities. John C.
