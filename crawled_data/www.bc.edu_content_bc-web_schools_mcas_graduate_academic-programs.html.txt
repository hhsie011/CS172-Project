Many individuals choose this option to either explore the seriousness of their interest in pursuing an advanced degree or to strengthen their credentials for later application to degree-granting programs. Instructor permission is required prior to starting nondegree applications. Please consult Boston College's Course Schedule to identify intended coursework and contact instructors on record to inquire about attending their class as a nondegree student. Applicants should then submit the following requirements: MCGS Application Form, Application Fee, Statement of Purpose (noting intended coursework and instructor permission received) and Transcripts. Please Note: Nondegree students may only take courses in the department and academic term into which they have been admitted. Departmental permission is required to continue beyond that term. Admission does not guarantee subsequent admission for degree candidacy. Individuals admitted as nondegree students, who later wish to apply for degree study, must reapply in full and be accepted into a degree-granting program. The number of credits earned that may be applied toward degree completion is determined by academic departments, in accordance with MCGS regulations. Applicants are not eligible for University financial aid or any financial aid that requires matriculation in a degree-granting program. International Students requiring a Boston College-sponsored student visa are not eligible for nondegree study. Fifth Year B.A./M.A. and B.S./M.S. In cooperation with the College of Arts and Sciences, the Graduate School offers a five-year B.A./M.A. program in some departments. Application to the program normally takes place early in the second semester of the junior year. Students in the two-year M.A. program cannot be retroactively considered for the five-year B.A./M.A. program. That is, students who begin the two-year M.A. program cannot switch to the B.A./M.A. program. The applicant must complete an application to the Master's degree program in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Application requirements may differ slightly from the traditional Master's program. Please check with the department to determine required materials. Admission to the B.A./M.A. program normally requires an overall GPA of 3.333 and a GPA of 3.5 in the major, although specific B.A./M.A. program requirements will vary across departments. The program limits the number of courses to two in total credited towards the Master's degree that may also be counted towards the undergraduate degree. The undergraduate degree will be conferred upon completion of undergraduate requirements. The Master's degree will be conferred upon completion of degree requirements as specified by the department.
