This program introduces students to advanced studies in historic preservation. Ordinarily completed in two years, it requires 48 hours of coursework including a Professional Report that is crafted during the last year. This master's program, or equivalent, is a prerequisite to enter in the Ph.D. program. Sample MSHP Curriculum* Fall I Architectural Conservation: Lab Methods Graphic Documentation Building Construction 1 National Register Documentation Spring I Preservation Studio (6 cr.) Architectural Conservation: Field Methods Preservation Planning & Practice Summer (open for students to seek internships) Fall II Preservation Law Preservation History & Theory Final report A or elective elective** Spring II American Architecture Final report B elective** elective** Total hours — 48 * Program curricula are tailored to individual background and emphasis and will be determined by the Program Director. ** We don't necessarily encourage that you take all your electives in the final year. Take a look at electives for every semester starting in your first year, and consult with faculty about rearranging MSHP core courses if appropriate. ARCHITECTURE PH.D. HISTORIC PRESERVATION TRACK The program leading to the Ph.D. in the area of historic preservation builds on the M.S.H.P degree and provides students with advanced training to prepare them to teach and to conduct research at the highest level. Students who have completed the M.S.H.P. degree must apply for continuation to the Ph.D. level. The Ph.D. requires a minimum of 21 hours of coursework leading to the comprehensive examination. Students must demonstrate reading proficiency in a second foreign language approved by the Ph.D. Committee. The comprehensive examination tests general knowledge of architectural history, an area of concentration, and a minor area. Following successful completion of the comprehensive examination, the student develops a dissertation topic and makes a public presentation to the Ph.D. Committee, which then recommends candidacy to the Dean of the Graduate School. The writing, oral defense, and revision of the dissertation follow. Sample Program of Study* First Ph.D. Year** (First Semester) ARC 388R Architectural history seminar ARC 389R Reading course in historic preservation Minor elective (or language study, if necessary) First Ph.D. Year (Second Semester) ARC 388R Research in historic preservation ARC 389 Reading course in preservation Minor elective (or language study, if necessary) Second Ph.D. Year (First Semester) Reading course in minor area Plus additional courses, as necessary Note: students are normally required to take 21 hours in advanced courses before sitting for the comprehensive examination Second Ph.D. Year (Second Semester) Comprehensive examination Third Ph.D. Year, First Semester Dissertation colloquium Third Ph.D. Year, Second Semester Dissertation and defense *** Total hours — 21 The combined time from the Master's degree to comprehensive exams is 30 + 21 = 51 hours. Added are 398T (Supervised teaching, if necessary), dissertation colloquium, and dissertation. * Program curricula are tailored to individual background and emphasis and will be determined with the Program Director. ** Number of hours will vary depending on the student's individual situation. *** The length of time required to complete a dissertation varies according to individual situations. In principle, the scope of the dissertation should be such that it can be researched and written in two to three years of steady work. COMMUNITY & REGIONAL PLANNING PH.D. HISTORIC PRESERVATION TRACK - CURRICULUM The program leading to the Ph.D. in the area of Historic Preservation and Community and Regional Planning builds on the M.S.H.P. degree and provides students with advanced training to prepare them to teach and to conduct research at the highest level. Students who have completed a Master's degree must apply for a continuation of the Ph.D. The student must accumulate a minimum of 51 total hours of graduate credit (21 hours beyond the M.S.H.P. degree) as part of the doctoral degree program in planning. These 51 hours must be distributed as follows, subject to the approval of the Graduate Studies Committee: Required courses: 9 hours CRP 391D - Planning Theory CRP 391D - Research Design CRP 391 D - Colloquium on Planning Issues Advanced quantitative methods: 6 hours Courses in the Historic Preservation specialization 12+ hours Courses outside the field of planning: 12 hours Dissertation: 9 hours After completion of coursework, subject preparation, and research, the student will take a set of comprehensive examinations. The student then submits his/her program of work for approval by the CRP Graduate Studies Committee. The title and a complete proposal for the dissertation will also be submitted to the CRP Graduate Studies Committee. The student must successfully defend the dissertation proposal in an oral examination. The CRP Graduate Studies Committee then certifies that all departmental requirements have been met and recommends that the student be advanced to candidacy. After being advanced to candidacy, the student works with the faculty to form a dissertation advisory committee; and the completion, final oral defense, and revision of the dissertation will follow. Opportunities for Interdisciplinary Study Students may combine their research on historical topics with a broad array of related subjects. As a major research university, the University of Texas at Austin offers a wide selection of electives, including courses in Art History, Classics, Cultural Geography, History, Anthropology, Museum Studies, African-American Studies, Latin American Studies, and Asian Studies.
