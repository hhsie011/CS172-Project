Research in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics at Cornell is focused on the fundamental development and analysis of mechanical and mathematical models for a wide variety of scientific applications. Current research topics focus on the mechanics and dynamics of fluids and solids in a broad range of physical and biological systems. Examples include complex systems and networks, planetary rings and asteroids, fracture mechanics, contact mechanics, adhesion and friction of bio-inspired surfaces, soft material mechanics, granular mechanics, nonlinear dynamics, mechanics of cellular and biomolecular structures, the ballistic impact of fibrous systems, animal locomotion and cardiac dynamics and mechanics of soft materials, design of multifunctional, active and polymeric materials, biological interfaces and pattern surfaces, membrane fusion, rheology of complex fluids, suspension mechanics, micro-hydrodynamics, stability of capillary surfaces, and capillary adhesion devices. TAM is the study of Engineering Science. TAM research often tends more toward science and engineering concepts and applied mathematics than direct engineering applications. Research tools include experiments, analytical mathematical solutions, and computer simulations. All students are required to minor in at least one subject from a field outside of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics. Frequently selected minors are aerospace engineering, applied mathematics, applied physics, astronomy, electrical and computer engineering, geophysics, materials science, mathematics, mechanical engineering, physics, and structural engineering. Ph.D. students take a qualifying examination, typically after completing two semesters for those students entering with a Bachelor's degree and at the end of one semester with those entering with a Master's degree. Ph.D. students are required to serve as teaching assistants for two semesters.

The GayogoÌ±hÃ³êž‰nÇ«' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of GayogoÌ±hÃ³êž‰nÇ«' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of GayogoÌ±hÃ³êž‰nÇ«' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional GayogoÌ±hÃ³êž‰nÇ«' leadership.
