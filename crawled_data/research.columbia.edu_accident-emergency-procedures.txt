Additional instructions for this email can be found below. Expand all Collapse all OSHA Reportable Incident Notification The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) revised the requirements for reporting work-related fatality, injury and illness information, effective January 1, 2015. The rule retains the requirement to report all fatalities to OSHA within eight hours, but amends the regulation to require employers to report all work-related in-patient hospitalizations, as well as amputations and losses of an eye, to OSHA within 24 hours; inpatient hospitalizations must be reported only if they occur within 24 hours of the incident. OSHA defines inpatient hospitalization as a formal admission to the inpatient service of a hospital or clinic for care or treatment. In order to streamline reporting for the University community, EH&S serves as the University-wide reporting entity for OSHA-reportable incidents. In the event of a workplace incident, the manager of the employee involved in the incident should send an email to [email protected], with the subject line “Urgent - OSHA Reportable Incident” and include the following information: Brief description of the work-related incident Location of the work-related incident Time of the work-related incident Type of reportable incident (i.e., fatality, inpatient hospitalization, amputation or loss of eye) Number of employees who suffered the incident Names of the employees who suffered the incident Contact person and his or her phone number Popular Links Chemical Waste Pick-up Request Chemtracker Lab Certificate of Fitness (FDNY C-14) LION database Radioactive Waste Pick-up Request Safety Data Sheets (SDS) Safety Training Medical Center 212-305-6780 Morningside & Manhattanville 212-854-8749 [email protected] Related Links Accident Reporting (Workers Compensation) Chemical Fume Hood Use Procedures Ergonomics General Shop Safety Hazard and Risk Evaluation Form Respiratory Protection (Fit Testing) Specific Chemicals Guidelines Office of the Executive Vice President for Research313 Low Library, 116th and Broadway · New York, NY 10027 Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
