Architectural engineers work together with architects and civil engineers, but are unique in both their skills and role as part of the building design team. The BS in Architectural Engineering (AE) degree program, beginning in 2019, provides students with breadth and depth in the engineering sciences of buildings and their systems: structural systems heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems electrical and lighting systems construction engineering and management Learning Outcomes View planning documents and a sample plan of degree progression on the CCE advising page. Graduates of the Architectural Engineering program should attain the following outcomes: An ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics. An ability to apply the engineering design process to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration for public health and safety, and global, cultural, social, environmental, economic, and other factors as appropriate to the discipline. An ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions. An ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences. An ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts. An ability to recognize the ongoing need to acquire new knowledge, to choose appropriate learning strategies, and to apply this knowledge. An ability to function effectively as a member or leader of a team that establishes goals, plans tasks, meets deadlines, and creates a collaborative and inclusive environment.
