There is a cosmopolitan mix of cultures here, with people drawn to Dartmouth College, major teaching hospitals, and a burgeoning high-tech sector with global connections. Hanover is frequently judged one of the best places to live in the United States. The surrounding area—known as the Upper Valley for its location on the Connecticut River—is at the heart of a region of spectacular natural beauty and extensive cultural resources. It offers year-round recreational opportunities: the best skiing in the eastern United States, easy access to Atlantic Ocean beaches, and the sophistication of Boston, Montreal, and New York all within a few hours of campus.
