Among the provisions included in the bill is an updated definition of the term ‘Veterans Education Benefits’. Previously, Veteran, National Guard, and ROTC Education Benefits were counted as part of a student’s overall financial aid package. This legislation exempts these benefits, resulting in the potential for expanded eligibility for various types of federal financial aid programs including but not limited to the Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant, Federal Work-study, and Federal Direct Student and Parent Loans. The ISU Office of Student Financial Aid takes this legislation into consideration when awarding financial aid to Veteran, National Guard, and ROTC students who file a FAFSA . Veteran, National Guard, and ROTC Education Benefits will be considered when awarding institutional need based aid. Veterans Veteran Students may be eligible for Veterans Educational Benefits. For instructions regarding Veterans Benefits Eligibility under Chapters 30, 31, 33, 35, or 1606, contact the Veterans Certification Officials at vacertofficials@iastate.edu or contact the Office of the Registrar. To be considered for financial aid beyond VA Benefits, the student must complete the FAFSA . The FAFSA should be submitted by the annual FAFSA priority deadline for the student to be eligible for ‘need’ based priority financial aid. Students who file after the annual FAFSA priority deadline may still be eligible for remaining funds such as Federal Pell Grant (if qualified), Federal Student loans, Parent Plus Loans, or Private Loans. If the student is currently on active military duty and plans to attend Iowa State University after their discharge, they should provide a copy of their DD-214 form to the Office of Student Financial Aid. This will document the student’s veteran status and expedite the processing of the student’s aid application. National Guard In addition to the potential eligibility under Veterans Benefit Chapters 30, 31, 33, 35, or 1606, a National Guard member may also qualify for the following state grant. The Iowa National Guard Service Scholarship (INGSS) provides annual awards to Iowa National Guard members who attend eligible Iowa colleges and universities. Maximum individual awards are determined by the Iowa National Guard. The Iowa Adjutant General determines eligibility. ROTC Benefits Students interested in becoming officers in the United States Armed Forces (Army, Navy/Marine Corps and Air Force) may qualify for financial assistance as part of the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) Program. Benefits vary depending on selected program and class year but may include tuition, book allowance, and monthly stipend of up to $400 per month.
