Many Iowa State students experience daily barriers to their educational goals. Creating barrier free access to hardware and software falls under the broad area of digital accessibility. Digital accessibility is not only the production of course materials, websites and communications in an accessible manner, it is a mindset and related directly to the student experience. Fully experiencing content and materials using assistive technology is essential in supporting this mindset. The Digital Accessibility Lab is a physical space on campus for students with disabilities to work together using assistive technology, and a place for them to try out new technologies that could increase their course engagement. Research The Digital Accessibility Lab is included in several grants campus wide with faculty researchers. For example, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has released its expectations for digital products to be accessible and to include budget in your grant request for this work. Securing grant money is vital to the Iowa State University strategic plan, and including accessibility is necessary for diversity, equity, and inclusion. User Experience and Usability Testing Our team has expertise with many UX process, assistive technology, and design methods.
