Leganto Reading Lists Baylor University Libraries supports Leganto, a system that enables instructors to build reading lists directly in their Canvas courses. For more information on setting up Leganto, see these step-by-step instructions or contact Denyse Rodgers (denyse_rodgers@baylor.edu) for more information. Our priority is to provide reserve materials online, providing the greatest level of access for all students. Online reserves can include: digital content (e-journal articles, e-books, e-book chapters, streaming video, streaming music, etc.) to which the Baylor Libraries have subscribed access linking to openly accessible content, or linking to copied materials (within the fair use exception for copyright-protected materials). Physical Reserves Physical materials from circulating library collections and personal materials from instructors may be placed on reserves as a last resort if digital reserves are not possible. For questions or more information, please contact Reserves Coordinator, Jordan Popp (reserves@baylor.edu 254.710.6785). For recorded media (audio and video) or musical scores, please contact Jamie Duerksen (jamie_duerksen@baylor.edu or 254.710.6733). Instructors may place personal materials on reserve such as books, videos, or audio recordings. Library personnel will label and barcode all personal materials. Although library personnel will take all reasonable precautions, personal materials on reserve are at some risk. Be sure your name is on your materials, and please do not place valuable or irreplaceable works on reserve. Copyright Baylor adheres to U.S. Copyright Law (USC Title 17) when assessing materials for inclusion in electronic reserves, especially when determining if Fair Use applies. For specific details on Baylor's copyright policies, visit the Baylor University copyright site. A more "user friendly" guide is also available. For copyright questions, contact copyright@baylor.edu. Copyright Clearance Service As a service to Baylor instructors, reserves personnel handle the copyright permissions process (when needed) for copied materials placed on electronic reserves. Especially for journal articles, before creating a digital copy, search for the journal citation in OneSearch to make sure we don’t already have access to the full text of that article. For those works that are copied, please provide a complete and accurate citation in order for us to ensure compliance with copyright law and guidelines. What Can Go on Reserve? Important Note: Material will not be placed in the system until copyright permission (if needed) is received. Therefore, it is imperative that instructors submit requests by the deadline established by reserve personnel, which is ideally six weeks before the beginning of the semester. Works placed on Electronic Reserve that do not require copyright permission: Links to electronic content to which the Baylor Libraries has subscribed access or are openly accessible. Exams. Class notes. Other works for which the instructor owns the copyright or retains the right to reproduce, distribute, and display publicly (with appropriate documentation). Works for which instructors have already secured copyright permission (with appropriate documentation). Most government publications. Works in the Public Domain. Works meeting Fair Use. Works placed on Electronic Reserve if copyright permission can be secured at a reasonable cost (or if the academic unit agrees to cover the additional cost): Works that do not meet Fair Use. A copy of an entire out-of-print book (we will attempt to acquire a copy of the physical item for physical reserves before we attempt to secure permission to scan the work for electronic reserve). Examples of works we will not place on reserve: Non-circulating print works (such as works from reference collections or periodicals). Articles from the Harvard Business Review; Harvard requires instructors to work with them directly and pay appropriate fees for using this content. Course packs (these require separate copyright permissions, and permission for a course pack does not automatically imply permission for electronic reserve). Works in Section 2 above that require copyright fees that significantly exceed library limits. Works in Section 2 above for which copyright permission is denied and the Fair Use exception doesn’t apply. Consumables: works (such as workbooks or lab books) that are intended for one-time use. Materials borrowed from other libraries (books, videos, and similar materials). Other Ways We Can Assist with Online Reserves We can acquire multi-user e-books, in lieu of print books, whenever possible. We can acquire streaming video or streaming audio licenses, whenever possible. We can digitize parts of works, within Fair Use limitations. Your subject librarian can work with you to find alternative resources. We can digitize an entire work if it’s deemed essential for the course curriculum and there is no viable alternative – but – this is only as a last resort. Under these circumstances, the preferred solution would be for the students to purchase the work (if it’s available for purchase). For more information or questions about general reserve services, contact Jordan Popp (reserves@baylor.edu or 254.710.6785). For more information or questions about audio and video reserve services, contact Jamie Duerksen (jamie_duerksen@baylor.edu or 254.710.6733). These guidelines are subject to change.
