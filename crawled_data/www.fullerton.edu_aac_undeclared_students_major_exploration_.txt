Through active involvement, students will explore themselves, discover and define their interests, while recognizing individual abilities that will lead to a successful education experience and timely degree. Whether you are Undeclared or have declared a major but would like to explore other opportunities, the Major Exploration Program can assist with this process. Being Undeclared, simply means you have declared to explore the many opportunities CSUF has to offer. We understand the exploration process can be lengthy when done properly and your time is valued. For that reason we are allowing Undeclared and Exploratory students, as well as students ready to declare, the opportunity to make an appointment with an academic advisor.
