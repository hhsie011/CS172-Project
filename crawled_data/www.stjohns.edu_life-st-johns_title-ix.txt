Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 protects people from sex discrimination in educational programs and activities at institutions that receive federal financial assistance. Sex discrimination includes sexual harassment, sexual violence, and sexual misconduct. St. John's University is committed to providing an environment that is free from all forms of discrimination on the basis of sex and offers many resources to students, faculty, administrators, and staff to address concerns relating to discrimination on the basis of sex or gender identity. Who Are the Title IX Coordinators? Danielle Haynes, Interim Director of Equal Opportunity and Compliance and Title IX Coordinator, serves as the Title IX Coordinator for overall campus compliance for the University. In this role, she monitors and maintains overall compliance with University policies and procedures in preventing, addressing, and remediating all forms of discrimination and harassment. Additionally, Ms. Haynes works with the Title IX Deputy Coordinators, to investigate and respond to each complaint and monitor incidents to ensure remediation and continued compliance. The Title IX Deputy Coordinators also identify and address any patterns or systemic problems that arise during the review of such complaints.
