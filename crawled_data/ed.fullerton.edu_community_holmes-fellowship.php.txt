Holmes Faculty Fellowship provides a mechanism for renewing faculty engagement in the field, by supporting a 3-unit course release that enables tenured professors to spend time working side-by-side with educators in local p-12 schools, community colleges, or other community agencies. The Fellowship aims to strengthen the College's commitment to faculty professional development and to our community partnerships by providing an opportunity to collaborate and share expertise that will inform and improve our practices. Priority will be given to work that aligns with college priorities and that is completed in high need schools and communities.
