The Bergamo-born publisher believed that the aesthetics of the book and philological accuracy should always go hand in hand. The Tallone catalog abounds with masterpieces printed in their original languages that stand as a testimony that Tallone achieved his goal, a goal pursued today by Tallone’s son and grandchildren whose exquisite books continue Italian fine printing traditions.
