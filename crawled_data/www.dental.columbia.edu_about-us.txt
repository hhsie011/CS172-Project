Leveraging our position within a world-class academic medical center at an Ivy League university, we advance dentistry’s practice, teaching, and scientific research. One of our founders, William J. Gies, PhD, asserted that because oral health is inextricably linked to overall health, dental medicine is best taught within an academic medical setting. His words transformed our field, and their full expression is one of the college’s defining features today. In our classrooms, DDS students spend their pre-clinical years studying alongside medical students. In our clinical settings, scientific research and new technologies enhance care. In our laboratories, we advance the frontiers of science, often with students working under the mentorship of renowned research faculty. As part of an engaged global university, our work extends far beyond campus. We cultivate partnerships across disciplines and continents to fulfill research, educational, and social justice goals. I welcome you to learn more about our offerings. Prospective students will find rigorous academics offered alongside extensive opportunities for mentorship, leadership, exploration, and service as they chart unique paths in our rapidly changing field.
