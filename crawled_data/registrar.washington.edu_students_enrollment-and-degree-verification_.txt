Verification For Students Current Quarter Enrollment Verification Current (and some former) University of Washington students can download a free, electronic enrollment verification instantly via the National Student Clearinghouse after logging into MyUW with a UW NetId. Future Quarter Certificate of Registration The University of Washington only officially verifies enrollment through the National Student Clearinghouse once the quarter has begun. If you require documentation showing that you are enrolled for a quarter that has not yet started, as long as you have already registered for courses for that future quarter, you may download an advanced registration certificate instantly via the National Student Clearinghouse.
