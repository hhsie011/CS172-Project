Newhouse's Collection Events Past Event Introduction to S.I. Newhouse's Collection Share Add to Calendar: Google Yahoo April 27, 2019 2:30 PM - 3:30 PM Columbia Global Centers | Beijing, No. 26, 1F Core Plaza, 1 Shanyuan Street, Zhongguancun, Haidian District, Beijing On April 27, Columbia Global Centers | Beijing invites you to an introduction on S.I. Newhouse's esteemed collection. Every year in May, Christie's New York will hold the most important Impressionist and Modern art auction for the first half of the year. This season, the sales will be led by 11 extraordinary masterpieces from the esteemed Collection of S.I. Newhouse, among which are several exceptional masterpieces such as Paul Cézanne's Bouilloire et fruits and van Gogh's Arbres dans le jardin de l'asile painted in Saint Remy, October 1889. S.I. Newhouse was one of the most important collectors of the 20th century and well into the 21st. He personified the rare combination of a great intuitive eye and equally great intellectual curiosity. He read voraciously about the artists he admired, and nothing could stop him once he decided to acquire a work of art that measured up to his exacting standards. Giovanna Bertazzoni, co-chairman of Christie's Impressionist & Modern Art Department will offer her perspectives about this collection and introduce to the audience some of these artists' pioneering styles and legacies. Speaker Giovanna Bertazzoni Co-chairman, Impressionist & Modern Art Department A senior specialist since June 2006, Giovanna Bertazzoni became Department Head in October 2008 and was promoted to International Specialist Head of Impressionist and Modern Art in January 2012. Under her leadership, the Impressionist and Modern Art Department in London achieved the then highest sales week total for the category in London 2012, with the February sales realising £179,085,337. The auctions were led by Henry Moore' s masterpiece Reclining Figure: Festival, 1951, which sold for £19.1 million, setting a world record price for the artist, and a record price for any British sculpture.
