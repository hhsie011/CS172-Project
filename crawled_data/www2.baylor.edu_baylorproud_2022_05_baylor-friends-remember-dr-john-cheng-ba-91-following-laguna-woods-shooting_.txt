Cheng’s actions almost certainly saved multiple lives. What you may not have heard was that Cheng was a Baylor Bear — Class of 1991. (The photo above right shows Cheng during a study abroad trip with two Baylor fraternity brothers.) Both his final actions and the life he led are the epitome of making us all “BaylorProud.” Just listen to the words of those who knew him: “He was such a servant, and he was such a guy willing to do whatever for his friend,” said Kappa Omega Tau fraternity brother James Runnels (BA ’89, MA ’92). “Basically, he laid down his life for his friends. He was just a solid, Christian doctor. And on our fraternity Facebook page, alumni, many of the guys said it didn’t surprise them at all that he gave his life protecting others. That’s just the kind of person he was. He always put others himself, and lived his life like Jesus did — sacrificing for others.” “He really had a heart for the Lord in a way that not any other man that I ever met did, and from a young age,” says Heidy McWhorter (BBA ’93), who attended both Marshall High School and Baylor with Cheng. “He was indeed [a] light to the very end — to professional athletes as their official doctor, his community, his medical practice patients, his martial arts academy clients, his church family and friends. John was a rock star making Christ more famous one person at a time with every genuine, loving, caring and kind interaction he had with each person God brought in his path.” “He’s a hero,” says Baylor history professor Stephen Sloan (BBA ’90, MA ’98), another fraternity brother. “He undoubtedly saved lives, and that’s what John would have wanted. It is not a surprise to me that John led the charge to save others. … He was a black belt in kung fu, he was a committed Christian, he had very varied interests, but he was sincere in everything that he did. The Lord could have been preparing him for this, because of the training and hours he has put into self-defense and the artistry in which he pursued that. It all came together on that one day, and he was able to use it to protect others.” “You could just tell he was a very loving person,” adds Jinny Henson (BSED ’92), who knew Cheng from a college Bible study. “He was very calm, very centered, loved the Lord. He was born to be a protector and to be a helper.” “I was at lunch [one day] in Penland and pledging Phi Kappa Chi,” recalled Taekuk Cho (BA ’94). “John, a KOT, asked if he could have a chat. He thanked me for going Greek, as we were two of the only four Asians in the entire Greek system. That day still resonates.” “We spent many sunny Saturdays as sparring partners in Cameron Park some three decades ago,” remembers Dr. Blake Leath (BBA ’92). “He was fast as lightning, warm-hearted, kind, approachable, funny, internally driven, and always had a smile on his face… yet ‘humility’ is the singular, overarching word that comes to mind whenever I think of John. … All the good John did for so many, the love he put out into the world through his words and deeds, and the legacy of light he leaves behind will surely illuminate the futures of everyone who came into contact with this dear man.” I didn’t know Dr. Cheng — but I do know Jesus’ words: “Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.” (John 15:13) Recent Posts Not ‘Can we?,’ but ‘Should we?’: Baylor grad’s company aims to center ethics in technology May 27, 2022 Baylor students again circle the globe in service through Baylor Missions May 26, 2022 Updates to Founders Mall and Quadrangle will more fully tell Baylor’s history May 20, 2022 Baylor friends remember Dr. John Cheng (BA ’91) following Laguna Woods shooting May 19, 2022 Summer reading suggestions from Baylor Family authors May 18, 2022 Tweets by @BaylorProud Tweets by BaylorProud Archives Archives Select Month May 2022 April 2022 March 2022 February 2022 January 2022 December 2021 November 2021 October 2021 September 2021 August 2021 July 2021 June 2021 May 2021 April 2021 March 2021 February 2021 January 2021 December 2020 November 2020 October 2020 September 2020 August 2020 July 2020 June 2020 May 2020 April 2020 March 2020 February 2020 January 2020 December 2019 November 2019 October 2019 September 2019 August 2019 July 2019 June 2019 May 2019 April 2019 March 2019 February 2019 January 2019 December 2018 November 2018 October 2018 September 2018 August 2018 July 2018 June 2018 May 2018 April 2018 March 2018 February 2018 January 2018 December 2017 November 2017 October 2017 September 2017 August 2017 July 2017 June 2017 May 2017 April 2017 March 2017 February 2017 January 2017 December 2016 November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 July 2010 June 2010 May 2010 April 2010 March 2010 February 2010 January 2010 December 2009 November 2009 October 2009 September 2009 August 2009 July 2009 June 2009 May 2009 April 2009 March 2009 February 2009 January 2009 December 2008 November 2008 October 2008 September 2008 August 2008 July 2008 June 2008 May 2008 April 2008 March 2008 February 2008 January 2008 December 2007 November 2007 October 2007 September 2007 August 2007
