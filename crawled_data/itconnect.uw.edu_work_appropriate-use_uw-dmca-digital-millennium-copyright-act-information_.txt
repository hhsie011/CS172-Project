Contact UW-IT About UW-IT UW DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) Information Information for Copyright Holders UW Registered Agent: Damien Koemans, Director, UW-IT: Customer Service and Support University of Washington 4333 Brooklyn Ave NE O336 Box 359540 Seattle, WA 98195-5850 (206) 221-5000 Allegations of infringement must be sent to: uwdmca@uw.edu UW Compliance With the DMCA The University of Washington is committed to ensuring that copyrights in creative works are respected and used appropriately by UW faculty, students, staff and visitors. Our policies require those using our computers or networks to respect U.S. and international copyright laws and failure to do so may result in disciplinary action or termination of access. The University does not monitor what individuals do while online, but does respond to all notices from copyright holders alleging inappropriate activity across our networks. If an individual chooses to host or exchange files unlawfully, that individual will be personally responsible for any consequences from that activity. Ignorance of the law is not a useful defense. The University strongly recommends that individuals using University of Washington networks and computers learn the rules and the laws before sharing files on line. Overview of the DMCA U.S. Copyright Law protects a wide range of creative works and grants to the owner of the work the exclusive right to make copies of the work, to make new works using part of the original work, distribute copies of the work, and display or perform the work publicly. Works protected by copyright include: written works, movies, music, photographs, art, software, and other original works of authorship. A provision in Copyright Law known as the DMCA allows internet service providers to shield themselves from liability for copyright infringement due to infringing activity by users of the service provider’s networks. Owners of copyright materials, including record companies, movie studios and software manufacturers, routinely monitor internet traffic and identify IP addresses that are hosting or sharing files that appear to be unauthorized copies of the owners. works. In compliance with the DMCA, the copyright owners notify the service provider and the service provider must expeditiously remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing material. The individual responsible for infringing activity, not the service provider, will be responsible should the copyright owner wish to seek damages for infringing activity.
