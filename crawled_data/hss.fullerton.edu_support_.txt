Support HSS What Makes the College of Humanities and Social Sciences Special? The College of Humanities and Social Sciences offers students depth of understanding in their field of study and the useful core skills that are most attractive to prospective employers and to success in graduate school. Our bachelor's and master's degrees prepare students for a wide range of professions, for graduate school, and for advanced professional study in fields such as law, education, public administration, clinical psychology, and business. Knowing that important learning takes place outside of the formal structure of classes as well, H&SS provides many opportunities for students to participate in professional internships, faculty research projects, and for being active members of numerous student clubs and organizations. Students can study in Washington, D.C. or in one of several overseas programs that take place during the regular academic year, summer, and intersession.

Internships, scholarships, endowments, and donations ensure the longevity of our programs and centers; support the scholarly advances of our faculty; and provide academic, financial, and professional assistance to our students. Giving to the College is one important way to continue the Titan tradition of reaching out to fellow students and the H&SS commitment to excellence in teaching and scholarship. Who benefits from my gift? Everyone! Through scholarships and other programs, such as professional internships, study abroad, or the Cal State D.C. program, our students learn beyond the borders of the university. A liberal arts education not only prepares students for careers, but also gives them the background necessary to be critical thinkers and culturally astute, globally minded, and engaged citizens.
