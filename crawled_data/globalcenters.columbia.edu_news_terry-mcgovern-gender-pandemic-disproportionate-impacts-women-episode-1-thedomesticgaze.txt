By Sinead McCausland June 30, 2020 Welcome to the first episode of The Domestic Gaze! We are honoured to have Terry McGovern speak in the inaugural episode of our new series. A strong proponent of women's rights, particularly for women's access to reproductive health services, McGovern has spent years fighting for equal health rights for women. Now, McGovern is Harriet and Robert H. Heilbrunn Professor and Chair of the Heilbrunn Department of Population and Family Health, where she has led the #SpeakEvidencetoPower campaign, a campaign in support of reproductive health justice. Read more about the campaign here. In her episode "Gender in the Pandemic: The Disproportionate Impacts on Women", McGovern draws on her research and work as a poverty lawyer during the AIDS crisis in the 80s to compare the disproportionate impacts pandemics have on women of color, particularly Black women. Listen to the episode in full at the link above, or on our Spotify, YouTube, or IGTV. Further Reading For further reading, please see the list of journals, articles, and more below.
