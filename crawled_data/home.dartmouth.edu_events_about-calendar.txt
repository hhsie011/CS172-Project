Events published on the calendar are open to the public or at least one Dartmouth audience (students, faculty, staff, and/or alumni) and are sponsored by recognized Dartmouth organizations. Additionally, events are expected to reflect Dartmouth’s Principles of Community. Any event that violates these principles of integrity and respect may be removed from the calendar.
