Must submit final thesis according to the Master's Thesis Guidelines. Master of Science Design Track [ScM- Thesis (Design)] Typical Full-Time Design Program Timeline: Must complete a minimum of 8 tuition units. ENGN1930L and ENGN1931L: Biomedical Engineering Innovation and Design I and II are required up to 1 course can be independent research at least 5 should be structured (non-independent study) advanced-level (1000 or 2000 level) courses at least 2 courses in biological topics at least 2 courses in engineering topics at most 1 design based course Must complete ethics training module. Must receive a grade of B or better, courses must be taken for a grade rather than credit/no credit. May work in a team up to 4 students. Must work on design project through two academic years. Must present prototype for critique and pass final oral examination by Thesis Committee. The Thesis Committee is jointly selected by the student and the advisor. It consists of the thesis advisor and two other Brown faculty (one must have a primary faculty appointment in the School of Engineering, one with a primary faculty appointment in the Division of Biology and Medicine, and one listed as a primary faculty member in the Center for Biomedical Engineering). It is also encouraged that one panel member have a design, industry, or clinical background. Each team member must submit final thesis according to the Master's Thesis Guidelines. Master of Science Non-Thesis Track [ScM - Non-Thesis] Typical Full-Time Non-Thesis Program Timeline: Must complete a minimum of 8 tuition units. no independent research credits all 8 should be structured (non-independent study) advanced-level (1000 or 2000 level) courses at least 3 courses in biological topics at least 3 courses in engineering topics Must receive a grade of B or better, courses must be taken for a grade rather than credit/no credit. Time to completion can be less than two academic years depending on the preference of the student. Important notes for all tracks: Credit for graduate level courses taken at Brown or elsewhere is not accepted or transferable. Do not register to audit a course. If you do, you will be charged for the course. An audited course does not count towards your degree. Do not register for BIOL 2230 or BIOL 2240: Biomedical Engineering and Biotechnology Seminar Course. If you register for BIOL 2230 or 2240, you will be charged for the course, and it will not count towards your degree. A master's student taking 2 or more courses per semester is considered a full-time student. Any student taking 1 course per semester is considered a part-time student for that semester. Part-time status can have implications for student loan repayments and visa status of international students.
