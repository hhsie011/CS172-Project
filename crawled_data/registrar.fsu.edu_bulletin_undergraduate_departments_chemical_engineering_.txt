Locke; Professors: Alamo, Kalu, Locke, Ramakrishnan, Siegrist, Yeboah; Associate Professors: Arnett, Grant, Guan, Hallinan, Li; Assistant Professors: Ali, Chung, Driscoll, Holmes, Mohammadigoushki, Ricarte; Research Faculty I: Rosenberg; Teaching Faculty I: Thourson, Wandell; Teaching Faculty II: Arce, Hunter; Professor Emeritus: Collier; Affiliate Faculty: Hsu, Sachdeva, Shanbhag, Zheng Program Overview The vision of the Department of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering as an educational unit is to be recognized as a place of excellence in fundamental and applied chemical and biomedical engineering education and life-long learning, and to maintain a national research leadership in modern areas of engineering challenge. To attain this vision, the department realizes that it has to continually satisfy its major stakeholders: students, industrial employers, alumni, departmental faculty, the college, the universities, the community, the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, Inc. (ABET), and other professional societies. Chemical engineering encompasses the development, application, and operation of processes in which chemical, biological, and/or physical changes of material are involved. The work of the chemical engineer is to analyze, develop, design, control, construct, and/or supervise chemical processes in research and development, pilot-scale operations, and industrial protection. Chemical engineers are employed in the manufacture of inorganic chemicals (e.g., acids, alkalis, pigments, fertilizers), organic chemicals (e.g., petrochemicals, polymers, fuels, propellants, pharmaceuticals, specialty chemicals), biological products (e.g., enzymes, vaccines, biochemicals, biofuels), and materials (e.g., ceramics, polymeric materials, paper, biomaterials). The graduate in chemical engineering is particularly versatile. Industrial work may involve production, operation, research, and development. Graduate education in medicine, dentistry, and law, as well as chemical engineering, biomedical engineering, and other engineering and scientific disciplines are viable alternatives for the more accomplished graduate. The Department of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering has made a long-term commitment to emphasize a biological component in its curriculum. The increasing importance of biological and medical subjects within the field of engineering cannot be underestimated. Many of the remarkable breakthroughs in medical science can be directly attributed to advances in chemicals, materials, and devices spearheaded by biochemical and biomedical engineers. Currently, biomedical engineering represents the fastest growing engineering discipline in the U.S. and it is likely to continue as such. The biomedical/biotechnology industries are also the fastest growing of all current industries that employ engineers. Training in biological and biomedical engineering provides an excellent background for graduate and/or medical school, especially in light of the increasing technological complexity of medical education. Biomedical engineering concerns the application of chemical engineering principles and practices to large scale living organisms, most specifically human beings. As one of the newest sub-disciplines of chemical engineering, the field is rapidly evolving, involving chemical engineers, biochemists, physicians, and other health care professionals. Biomedical research and development is carried out at universities, teaching hospitals, and private companies, and it focuses on conceiving new materials and products designed to improve or restore bodily form or function. Biomedical engineers are employed in diverse areas such as artificial limb and organ development, genetic engineering research, development of drug delivery systems, and cellular and tissue engineering. Many biomedical engineering professionals are engaged in medical research to model living organisms (pharmacokinetic models), and to make biomedical devices (e.g., drug delivery capsules, synthetic materials, and prosthetic devices). Because of increasing interest in biomedical sciences and biotechnology, the degree in biomedical engineering also provides an avenue for students interested in pursuing a career in medicine, biotechnological patent law, or biomedical product sales and services. The Department currently offers two Bachelor of Science (BS) degrees. The first is in Chemical Engineering with two major options (Chemical Engineering and Chemical-Materials Engineering). The second is the Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in Biomedical Engineering with three major options (Cell and Bioprocess, Biomaterials and Biopolymers, and Imaging and Signal Processing). The BS degree takes between four and five years to complete. The undergraduate curriculum emphasizes the application of experimental and computer analysis to classical chemical and biomedical engineering principles. This includes laboratory instruction in modern, state-of-the-art facilities in the transport phenomena, unit operations, process control, anatomy and physiology, biodynamics, biomaterials, and bioinstrumentation laboratories. Students are instructed in and utilize state-of-the-art computational programs such as MATLAB, Simulink, Aspen, and COMSOL Multiphysics. To meet newly developed interests in chemical and biomedical engineering and related fields, elective courses are available in bioengineering, polymer engineering, materials engineering, electrochemical engineering, and petroleum engineering. The major options build upon the core chemical and biomedical engineering principles developed for the original BS degree in Chemical Engineering and then expanded to the new BS degree in Biomedical Engineering. Consult an advisor for specific requirements for the three major options.
