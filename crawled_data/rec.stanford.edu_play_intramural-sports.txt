League Schedules Reminder: Your team is confirmed once you have the minimum number of players and have paid for the league. Your status will be pending until you have done so. General Information Our Intramural Sports Program offers over 20 individual and team sports throughout the year, with flag football offered in the fall, basketball in the winter, outdoor soccer in the spring, and softball in the summer. All sports are separated between two to three divisions in order to accommodate a wide variety of skill levels and experience in each sport. Divisions include: Beginner: Players will focus on learning the rules and having fun, not competition. Intermediate: For players who know the rules and game play but are looking for less intense competition. Advanced: The most competitive league where players are highly skilled. Our staff reserves the right to assist teams in finding the most comfortable league for them. Players are not able to play on two teams in the same division. All leagues are open with no gender restrictions. Leagues typically run 4-6 weeks for the regular season with 1-2 weeks for playoffs, concluding with a single elimination tournament to determine the team champion. This can vary based off of facility access and weather. Games are not typically rescheduled unless deemed necessary by the Intramural Sports Office. All leagues and sports are on a first come basis. Limited space is available and we encourage you to register during the first day of registration. All participants must have a SUID to participate in Intramural Sports. Courtesy card holders need to email Jordan Hunt at jrdn38@stanford.edu to register.
