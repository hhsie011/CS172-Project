PreviousNext Instructor Permission Courses Spring 2022 Due to the need for prerequisite completion, the following courses will require Instructor Permission (IP) to enroll. Admission for these courses may be obtained by emailing the professor to discuss the course and requesting permission to enroll. THEA 10.71: Plays on Stage, Acting Comedy (Jamie Horton at ARR) THEA 27: Movement Fundamentals II (Keith Coughlin at 2A) THEA 54: Directing (Peter Hackett at 2A) THEA 80: Independent Study (Dan Kotlowitz at ARR) THEA 92: The Honors Thesis II (Dan Kotlowitz at ARR) Courses Requiring Instructor Interviews Because of high demand and other reasons, admission to certain theater performance courses is determined through a process of very informal instructor interviews. It is not possible to pre-register for these courses. Registration is possible only after a student has secured instructor permission to enroll; Instructor Permission is given after the interview process is complete. Courses Requiring an Instructor Interview - Fall 2022 If you are interested in taking a theater course that conducts instructor interviews, we recommend that you also register for a different, additional course that you would like to take in case you are not able to secure permission for the theater course you want. If you secure a spot in the course for which you have interviewed, you can then drop the additional course.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Theater Undergraduate Overview Equity and Inclusivity Peer Advisors and Student Representatives The Major Major Requirements Honors Thesis The Modified Major Modified Major Requirements Modifying another Major with Theater The Minor Minor Requirements Courses: offerings by term Course Descriptions Instructor Permission Courses Independent Study Off-Campus Exchange National Theater Institute For Prospective Students Onstage Overview Get Involved Performing and Auditions Directing and Designing Playwriting Stage Managing The Scene Shop The Costume Shop Now Onstage: Upcoming Productions Season Archives: Past Productions Production Photos About Student Productions Workshops and Full Productions Studio Lab: Exploring Theatrical Boundaries YourSpace: Performance Spaces for Creative Minds Student Work in the time of COVID About MainStage Productions Opportunities Overview Summer Theater Lab: Cultivating New Work VoxLab Frost and Dodd Play Festival New York Theatre Workshop Residency The VOICES Program Experiential Learning with Northern Stage Testimonials Student Funding Opportunities Kingsdale Fund Need-Based Funding Goldner Mini-Fellowship Other funding opportunities Funding for Graduate Studies Internships, Fellowships, and Graduate Programs The Neukom Institute Literary Arts Award in Playwriting Foreign Study News & Events All News and Events MainStage Production News Student Production News Honors Thesis Productions Summer Theater Lab News Faculty News Student News Visiting Artist News Alumni News People Faculty and Staff Visiting Artists Alumni Tell Us Your Story Theater and Performance Studies My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
