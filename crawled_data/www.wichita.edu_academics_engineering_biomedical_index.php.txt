Through laboratory experiences that bridge multiple disciplines, we develop materials, processes, implants, devices and informatics approaches for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of disease, for patient rehabilitation and for improving health. Fueled by our aging society, the demand for bioengineers is increasing, a trend expected to continue for years. Graduates of the program go on to graduate studies, medical school or work in industry. Employers of biomedical engineers include pharmaceutical firms, medical equipment manufacturers, hospitals and rehabilitation centers and biomedical research institutes.
