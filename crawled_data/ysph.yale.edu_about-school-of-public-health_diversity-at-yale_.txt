Skip to Main Content About Us Admissions Education & Training Research & Practice Faculty Alumni myYSPH Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging Across the YSPH community, the dean, faculty, staff and the alumni have adopted mentorship, recruitment, retention and professional development practices to help meet our goal of having an outstanding and diverse School of Public Health—a place that better reflects the local, national and international communities we study. Our scientists investigate the role of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, aging, socio-economics and geo-politics in health disparities — in all of our research endeavors. We offer MPH students the opportunity to expand their expertise through the U.S. Health Justice Concentration, regardless of their primary department affiliation. Through their internships, our students work with diverse populations from New Haven to the shores of Africa, from the mountains of South America, to the cities of Asia. Our reach is limited only by our imaginations and access. With leadership from the School’s diversity committee and student ambassadors, as well as the activism of our student and alumni groups, we strive for equity in our community, our curriculum and our work in research and practice. We are committed to offering a welcoming environment to all prospective and existing members of our community. Special Edition Focus: Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, Belonging See the Digital Edition Diversity Research Awards For PhD candidates who identify as underrepresented minority students, first-generation college graduates and students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds.
