During the Saturday campus tour, you'll hear from Undergraduate Admissions and other campus representatives before you head out on a two-hour walking tour of campus led by a current OSU student. Please note that while we provide the best experience possible during a Saturday campus tour, many facilities are closed and faculty members are not available to meet with students. For this reason, explore majors sessions are NOT available on Saturday tours. We recommend students attend a weekday tour, if their schedule allows, to experience more of what OSU has to offer.
