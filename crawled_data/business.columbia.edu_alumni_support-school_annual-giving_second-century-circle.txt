Second Century Circle members understand that the success of the Business School’s second century—that is, the School’s ability to truly thrive during its next 100 years—absolutely depends on their investment. As such, members pledge at least $100,000 to the Columbia Business School Annual Fund and enjoy a calendar of special events and engagement opportunities. Contributions have a direct, tangible, transformative impact and support everything that makes Columbia Business School great. In short, the Second Century Circle ensures the School’s thought leadership and strengthens the Columbia brand. Second Century Circle Members Michael E.
