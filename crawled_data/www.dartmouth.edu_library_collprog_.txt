The Collections Program departments and staff provide selection, purchase or lease, access management, metadata, and preservation services to support this goal. The Collections Program staff is also involved with partnerships and consortia among libraries, publishers, and vendors to provide greater access to resources than would otherwise be possible. Dartmouth College Library also develops digital collections through the Dartmouth Digital Collections initiatives. The subject specialist librarians select materials in consultation with the faculty and administrators in the departments, institutes and centers at Dartmouth College. Collection Development Policies give an overview of the programs and collections. The collections include materials such as print and digital books, journals, article databases, maps, videos, web resources, numerical datasets, musical scores and recordings, and visual image databases, as well as objects, manuscripts and archives.
