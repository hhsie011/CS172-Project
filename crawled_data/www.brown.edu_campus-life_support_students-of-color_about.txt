Vocalize. Mobilize. The Brown Center for Students of Color serves as a gathering space for communities of color on campus. We host events and programs that build and affirm community by centering our ways of knowing and being. We situate our lived experiences in a socio-historical context through self-reflection and critical dialogue. With an understanding of the structural causes of individual and communal experiences, we are then able to explore tangible ways to create change.
