Paris-Sorbonne. Organized by Martha Howell (Columbia). The Power of Space brings together a group of scholars, senior and junior, from the United States, France, Italy, Belgium, The Netherlands, and Switzerland to share research on how cultural, social, political, and economic practices were constituted by spatial organization in cities of Italy (Venice, Lucca, and Naples among others) and northern Europe (Paris and its environs, Brussels, Ghent, Amsterdam, and Lille among others) during the late medieval and early modern centuries. Although recognized as the most commercialized parts of late medieval Europe, justly famous for their sociopolitical innovations and cultural achievements, the two regions differed in ways that have made comparative analysis difficult. In addition to pursuing questions particularly informed by anthropological work on the way space not only contains but also confers meaning, the conference is intended to provide a frame for systematic comparison of these two regions.
