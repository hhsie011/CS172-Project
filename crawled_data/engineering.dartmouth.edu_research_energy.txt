Dartmouth supports a non-departmental structure that highlights the intersection between energy and biological and chemical, electrical and computer, mechanical, operations and systems, and materials engineering. Graduate engineering students are expected to propose a plan of study that supports their interests, potentially including distinctive intellectual paths unconstrained by disciplinary boundaries and enriched by interdisciplinary synergies. We foster accessible communities among students and faculty within Thayer School as well as across campus—including at Dartmouth’s Irving Institute for Energy and Society—and involving researchers and practitioners from around the US and the world. The following research sub-areas have been strategically chosen to address key challenges and opportunities and are supported by leading faculty in their fields. On This Page Biomass Energy Energy Materials Energy Systems Power Electronics Sustainable Design Biomass Energy Providing 10% of today’s global primary energy, plant biomass-derived fuels (biofuels) are widely thought to be the leading alternative available for decarbonizing aviation, long-haul trucking, and ocean shipping. Because biofuels require land, their production has strong linkages to food security, rural economic development, and land-based ecological services. Research Subfields Microbial cellulose utilization, including fundamental and applied aspects Metabolic engineering, focusing on thermophilic bacteria for fuel production Innovative biomass processing technologies, including development, design, and evaluation Sustainable bioenergy futures, including analysis of resource, environmental, and social development aspects Researchers include the faculty below as well as Research Scientist Evert Holwerda. Researchers Mark Laser Lee Rybeck Lynd Daniel Olson Energy Materials Materials play a critical role in energy production, storage and utilization. These include high temperature alloys for power plants, semiconductor materials for solar panels, magnetic materials for wind turbines, battery materials for energy storage, and optoelectronic materials for energy-efficient data centers, to name a few. Through the investigation of structure-property relationship, fundamental materials science leads to the discovery of new materials that boost the efficiency of energy systems and the deployment of renewable energy sources. Research Subfields High temperature materials Magnetic materials Solar materials and other optoelectronic/nanophotonic materials Battery materials and electrochemistry Materials for nuclear fuel Thermoelectric Materials Functional nanomaterials design and synthesis Researchers Ian Baker Weiyang (Fiona) Li Yan Li Jifeng Liu Charles R. Sullivan Energy Systems Systems research involves a holistic approach to a class of systems characterized by a high degree of technical complexity, social intricacy and elaborate processes aimed at fulfilling important functions in society. At their core, engineering systems integrate multiple technologies which often exhibit complex dynamics at multiple time scales. These dynamics necessitate the need for similarly complex layers of control, decision, and information technologies so that they may sustainably, reliably, and economically deliver their intended services. Research Subfields Smart power grids Energy platforms Energy internet-of-things Bio-energy The food-energy-water nexus Electrified transportation systems Industrial energy management Integrated smart city infrastructures Big data analytics Multisector dynamics Researchers Amro M. Farid Klaus Keller Lee Rybeck Lynd Erin Mayfield Geoffrey G. Parker Power Electronics The capability of power electronics to control and convert electrical energy is essential to the use of many modern high-efficiency components such as LED lighting and brushless motors as well as interfacing renewable energy sources to the power grid. Research Subfields Integrated circuit design for power electronics Resonant switched capacitor (ReSC) and other advanced power converter topologies Applications in battery management, photovoltaics, and digital systems Magnetics and passive component modeling, design and optimization Wireless power transfer Microfabrication of power magnetics for integrated power conversion Researchers Jason T. Stauth Charles R. Sullivan Sustainable Design Sustainable design seeks to re-engineer material culture for a future of health and beauty for coming generations. This means optimizing buildings, products, and other industrial systems to eliminate their burden on the world and ideally help revive beneficial natural and social systems. This also means quantitatively measuring environmental and social impacts through life-cycle assessment, certifications, and other metrics. Research Subfields Efficient power electronics Engineering biomaterials Mechanical performance of natural materials Measuring environmental transport processes Environmental fluid mechanics Green additive manufacturing (3D printing) Sustainable design methods Researchers Benoit Cushman-Roisin Jifeng Liu Erin Mayfield Charles R.
