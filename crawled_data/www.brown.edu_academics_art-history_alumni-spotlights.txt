Her piece about Jordan Carter ’12, “Curating the Ephemeral,” appears in the January 24, 2022 edition of the Brown Alumni Magazine. She explores the challenges he faces as a curator who showcases Fluxus and conceptual art — works that resist traditional means of exhibition and display in museums and galleries. In “Documenta ‘76: How an Avant-Garde Art Sensation Almost Happened in Philadelphia,” for Hidden City Philadelphia, Comberg writes about the plans to bring the 1976 Documenta exhibition to Philadelphia, none of which came to fruition.
