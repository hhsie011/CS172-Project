It is designed to provide an appreciation and recognition of the impact of law and legal institutions on society and the ways law is shaped by the values, behavior, and organization of social, economic, and political systems. Courses from the Departments of Economics, Geography, Political Science, Urban and Regional Planning, and Sociology, as well as the Askew School of Public Administration and Policy, are included. Students may minor in law and society or select a major concentration in law and society through the interdisciplinary social science major. The Program in Law and Society is appropriate for a variety of educational and occupational goals because it provides an introduction to the links between law and other human activity and serves as a broad liberal education in the social sciences. Although prelaw students may enroll in law and society, the program is not a prelaw or pre-professional program, and a minor or major concentration in law and society is not offered as preparation for law school. Computer Skills Competency All undergraduates at Florida State University must demonstrate basic computer skills competency prior to graduation. As necessary computer competency skills vary from discipline to discipline, each major determines the courses needed to satisfy this requirement. Undergraduate majors in the law and society concentration in the Interdisciplinary Program in Social Science satisfy this requirement by earning a grade of “C–” or higher in CGS 2060 or CGS 2100. Requirements for a Minor in Law and Society Note: Required courses for a minor in Law and Society are currently under review. Please contact the College of Social Sciences at coss-advising@fsu.edu or contact Dr. Lisa Turner De Vera for more information.
