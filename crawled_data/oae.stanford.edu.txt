The mission of the Office of Accessible Education (OAE) is to promote an accessible and inclusive environment for all students with disabilities.

We are dedicated to supporting students with disabilities to give them the opportunity to perform at their highest academic potential. We also strive to promote the inclusive environment they need to experience full membership in our diverse Stanford community. Learning & Coping During COVID-19 What is a disability? Disability occurs on a spectrum. An individual with a disability is defined as someone with a physical or mental impairment which impacts that person’s major life activities. There isn’t an exhaustive list of disabilities; if you are experiencing limitations because of an impairment, you should get in touch with our office. Sometimes disability-related accommodations are simple -- a power door for example. Sometimes the accommodation(s) can be complex; our job is to work with you so that together we maximize your access. Disabilities can be visible when someone uses a wheelchair, hearing aids, or cane. The majority of disabilities are invisible and include broad categories of learning disabilities, psychological, and chronic illnesses. Whether your disabilities are visible or invisible, temporary or chronic, the OAE wants to assist each individual find accommodations which work for them in a completely individualized process.
