This article describes a multi-semester engaged scholarship course and laboratory (the 2016-2017 TRI-Lab) that trained students to design, prototype, and implement health education programs that target health literacy issues often encountered by justice-involved individuals (including current and former prisoners) and other low-income, underserved populations. In the Spring 2016 course that inaugurated the TRI-Lab, students were provided the background and skill sets required to create health education programs focused on the particularly acute health needs of this population.
