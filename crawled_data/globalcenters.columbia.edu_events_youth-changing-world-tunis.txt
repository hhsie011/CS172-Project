Through a series of workshops with youth around the world, this project will identify the commonalities and differences among global youth populations, towards producing concrete proposals for both global and local approaches to meet ongoing challenges. The Youth in a Changing World-Tunis (YCW-Tunis) workshop will be one of several workshops that will span the globe in countries including the United States, Brazil, China, France, India, Jordan, and Kenya. A member of the Columbia University research team would lead the Youth in a Changing World workshop in Tunis around June 18, 2019. Attendees would include 20 to 25 local youth participants between the ages of 18 and 24. Through large group activities and concurrent small group discussions, the workshop will explore the project’s five interrelated thematic areas: 1) Aspirations and the future 2) Education and the future of work 3) Digital technologies, identity, & communication/connection 4) Security and well-being 5) Engagement with the world & youth as agents of change. The central goal the YCW-Tunis workshop is to both gather the insights of youth participants and have them help shape a global conversation. It is jointly organized by Columbia University’s Committee on Global Thought and the Columbia Global Centers.
