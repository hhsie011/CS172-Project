This two-day event aims to provide a platform for students who are interested in drama to communicate and perform, and hope that through round-table talks with professionals, participants can further learn about and fall in love with drama. The forum invites six drama and theatre scholars of Barnard College, Emory University, and Tsinghua University to discuss the past, present, and future of the industry. The workshop allows participants to rehearse with six experienced Chinese directors and perform their signature works by the end of the second day. Drama Forum Panelists Online William B.
