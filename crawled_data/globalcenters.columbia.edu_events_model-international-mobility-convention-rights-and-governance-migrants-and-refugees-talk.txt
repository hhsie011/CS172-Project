A Talk by Michael Doyle Events Past Event A Model International Mobility Convention: Rights and Governance for Migrants and Refugees - A Talk by Michael Doyle Share Add to Calendar: Google Yahoo May 6, 2018 6:30 PM - 8:00 PM Columbia Global Centers | Amman RSVP on Eventbrite here In this talk, Michael Doyle will present the “Model International Mobility Convention”, a holistic and rights-based framework for international mobility with the goals of reaffirming the existing rights afforded to mobile people (and the corresponding rights and responsibilities of states) as well as expanding those basic rights where warranted. He will also discuss the Model Convention’s significance in the context of the ongoing global migration crisis and address how the humanitarian and development response to meet the growing needs of refugees is not evolving fast enough. Michael W. Doyle is the Director of the Columbia Global Policy Initiative and University Professor of Columbia University in the School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia Law School and the Department of Political Science. His current research focuses on international law and international relations. Doyle served as Assistant Secretary-General for Policy Planning and Special Adviser to United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan where his responsibilities included strategic planning (the “Millennium Development Goals”), outreach to the international corporate sector (the “Global Compact’) and relations with Washington. He also served as an individual member and the chair of the UN Democracy Fund in 2006-2013 and currently chairs the International Peace Institute. Doyle's major publications include Ways of War and Peace (W.W. Norton); Empires (Cornell University Press); Making War and Building Peace (Princeton Press); Striking First: Preemption and Prevention in International Conflict (Princeton Press); and The Question of Intervention: J.S. Mill and the Responsibility to Protect (Yale University Press). He received his B.A. from Harvard College (1970), and an M.A. (1972) and PhD (1977) from Harvard University.
