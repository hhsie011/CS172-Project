All ACE inductees are full-time faculty who have served at Columbia for five or more years and exhibit exemplary patient care marked by evidence-based clinical science and deeply compassionate humanism. The 2022 Bill Campbell Clinical Champions Symposium was delivered alongside this year’s ACE class induction. This year's lecture was titled, “Communicating in the Time of COVID: Triumphs, Pitfalls, and Lessons Learned," and featured Wafaa El-Sadr, MD, MPH, MPA, University Professor of Epidemiology and Medicine, director of Columbia World Projects, and founder and director of ICAP. El-Sadr is an international expert in epidemiology and research on the prevention and management of HIV, tuberculosis, and other infectious diseases. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, El-Sadr has shared her expertise as a member of the Mayor’s Scientific Advisory Council, the NYC Test and Trace Group, and the Columbia University COVID-19 Task Force. In 2017, ACE inducted its first class of members to honor clinical faculty members who demonstrate excellence in clinical care and who spend more than half their time caring for patients and training young physicians. The new inductees were nominated and elected by their peers. Following are the newest inductees. 2022 ACE Inductees Janice James Aubey, MD, MPH, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology Karen L.
