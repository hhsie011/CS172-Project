Professor Angelo Riccaboni, Rector of the University of Siena, and Columbia Professor Jeffrey Sachs, director of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), chaired the conference that brought together a unique combination of experts, researchers, policy makers, civil society leaders and students from 18 of the 21 countries in the Mediterranean region. The Italian Minister of Education, Universities and Research, Maria Chiara Carrozza, also attended the launch of Med Solutions. Discussions focused on two priority issues for the region: the health of the Mediterranean Sea and de-carbonizing the energy system.
