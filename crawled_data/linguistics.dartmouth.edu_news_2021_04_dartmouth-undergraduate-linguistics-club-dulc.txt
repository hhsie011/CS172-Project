The club helps facilitate academic communication between students, faculty, and researchers, and create a community centered around the study of linguistics. In the past two terms, the DULC has hosted research forums with linguistics faculty, game nights, podcast discussions, and an alumni career panel! The organization is excited to grow in future terms and plan on continuing to facilitate a sense of community among those interested in linguistics at Dartmouth with happy hours and research panels. The DULC also hopes to engage with students, whether those being introduced to linguistics for the first time or majors and minor in the department, and allow students to learn more about how to apply the field of linguistics by connecting with faculty and alumni about their experiences. If you're a Dartmouth student and interested in joining or learning more about the organization, feel free to shoot us an email at Dartmouth.Undergraduate.Linguistics.Club@dartmouth.edu. We're excited to have you and hope to see you in the spring term!

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Linguistics Undergraduate Overview About Linguistics Learning Outcomes Courses Major/Minor Modified Minor Computational Linguistics Major Undergraduate Research Opportunities Student Presentations and Publications Honors Past Honors Theses Awards and Prizes Alumni and their Career Paths Foreign Study Research Overview Faculty Research Recent Grants Undergraduate Research Opportunities Student Presentations and Publications Linguistics Lab Research Roundtable Linguistic Discovery (Dartmouth journal) DARLA: Dartmouth Linguistic Automation News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
