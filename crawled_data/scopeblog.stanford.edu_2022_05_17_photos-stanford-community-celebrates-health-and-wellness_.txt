Author Hanae ArmitagePublished on May 17, 2022May 18, 2022 Dog-petters, popsicle eaters, nutrition enthusiasts, yogis and other health-oriented members of the Stanford Medicine community gathered on the lawn outside of Stanford University School of Medicine's Li Ka Shing building for the annual Health Matters event, which occurred in person for the first time since before the pandemic began. Health talks were held throughout the event, attracting crowds hoping to learn more about how they can take control of their own healthy living: Christopher Gardner, PhD, a professor of medicine, and other nutrition experts dove into all things diet, discussing the and pros and cons of popular fad diets, as well as how to think about eating for a sustainable future. Ron Levy, MD, a oncologist and cancer researcher, spoke about how researchers and doctors can harness the immune system to fight cancer. And Anna Lembke, MD, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, broke down the biology of addiction and why and how people can become addicted to certain substances and behaviors. Outside the talks, more than 800 participants wandered from cooking demos to yoga classes, popsicle stands to health food trucks, and fluffy canine friends to blood-glucose monitoring stations.
