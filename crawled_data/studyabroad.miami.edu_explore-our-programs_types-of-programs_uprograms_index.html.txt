UPrograms are customized for UM students as a packaged experience which often include housing, travel, and internship opportunities. The UPrograms involve a cohort, typically ranging from 5-25 students, who participate in academic as well as co-curricular activities together. One of the components that make UPrograms unique is the foundations course, which is specially designed to enhance and enrich your study abroad experience. UProgram participants will receive UM credits that will be part of their UM GPA and count towards their degree progress. UM scholarship and financial aid can be used on ALL UPrograms.
