(GAB) 405.744.1156eeo@okstate.edu Prevention One of the most important ways we can work toward a campus community free of sex discrimination and sexual harassment is by turning our focus to prevention. Prevention means focusing up-stream and addressing the causes of discrimination. We know that true culture change can only be achieved by addressing the patterns, beliefs and behaviors that are at the root of sexual violence. OEO's Responsibility The Office of Equal Opportunity implements and supports prevention strategies through training and education efforts, and supporting prevention programming by campus partners. Tailored educational opportunities are available for your department, division, organization, or class. To request a tailored training or workshop contact eeo@okstate.edu. In addition to customized programming the following opportunities are offered: Mandatory Title IX Training Both Title IX and university policy prohibit discrimination in services or benefits offered by the university based upon gender.
