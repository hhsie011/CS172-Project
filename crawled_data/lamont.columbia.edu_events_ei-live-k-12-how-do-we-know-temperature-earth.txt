Over the past 150 years, human emission of greenhouse gases has led to increased global temperatures with the last seven years being the seven warmest years on record. While the global mean temperature is important to know, it is not straightforward to calculate, particularly 100+ years ago. In this session, we will explore the history of global mean temperature calculations, discuss how scientists currently calculate changes in the temperature of the Earth, show how confident these calculations of global temperature are, and discuss the various sources of data used to calculate and verify the temperature record over the past 150+ years. Presenter: Nathan Lessen, PhD Candidate, Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences Target Audience: Grades 9-12 (and undergraduates) This event is free but registration is required.
