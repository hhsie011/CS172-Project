If you do this, you will receive a decision about your admission by January 15 with automatic maximum scholarship consideration. Students who apply for regular or rolling admission will still be automatically considered for any remaining awards/scholarships. Choosing to apply by November 1 does not make it easier to gain admission to MSU and the Office of Admissions promises no special privileges to early action candidates in the admissions review, such as giving your application a higher priority or a more lenient review. Applying by the early action deadline is simply a way to receive a decision on your application by January 15 and increase your scholarship consideration. Early action is non-binding, which means that you do not have to attend Michigan State University if you are admitted.

You will need to order your ACT or SAT scores well in advance and ensure that we receive those scores by the application submission deadline. However, please note that MSU is test optional, which means that freshman applicants have the option to apply without submitting an ACT or SAT score. Michigan State University continues to accept undergraduate applications as long as space is still available. However, the number of qualified applicants has exceeded available space in recent years, so students should apply by November 1 to ensure highest consideration.
