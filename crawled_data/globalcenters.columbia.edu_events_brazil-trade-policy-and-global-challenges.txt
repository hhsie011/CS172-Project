Following independence in 1822, Brazil opened its ports and expanded its trade with other nations, particularly Britain. Extensive government regulation of trade continued, however, with tariffs providing over half of the government's revenue before World War I. Other forms of intervention in trade included the 1906 coffee price support plan, which was a sophisticated attempt to exploit Brazil's monopolistic position in the world coffee market. In this presentation, Abrão M. Árabe Neto, Executive Vice President for Amcham Brasil, will discuss the latest trends of the Brazilian trade policy and some of the global challenges faced by the country. KNOW MORE ABOUT ABRÃO M.
