No such written guide can, however, foresee every programmatic, administrative, or scholarly detail that might arise. Furthermore, plans of study in the program are individualized and distinctive scholarly combinations are possible. So while this handbook provides a framework, you are encouraged to consult actively and consistently and with your faculty advisor, department staff, and fellow graduate students throughout your time in the program. More generally, we urge you to engage in regular and collegial conversation with MCM faculty and graduate students. It is every student’s responsibility to be aware of the contents of this handbook; please consult it from time to time when questions or problems arise, and/or when preparing for the next stage of the program. Because MCM faculty and the profession itself are continually changing, these guidelines may be revised on a regular basis. When changes have been approved, they will be introduced as quickly as possible.
