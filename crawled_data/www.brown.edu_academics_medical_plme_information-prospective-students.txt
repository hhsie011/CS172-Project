Admission & Aid Information for Prospective Students PLME is the only combined baccalaureate-MD program in the Ivy League. Learn more about this unique program and find out if it's the right fit for you. The Program As undergraduates, PLME students may choose to work toward an AB or ScB degree in the sciences, or toward an AB in the humanities, social sciences, or behavioral sciences. PLME students may choose any one of the nearly 100 departmental and interdepartmental concentration programs offered at the university. Undergraduate Years The undergraduate experience is designed to best prepare students for the last four years of the program, which constitute the Medical School years and culminate in the MD degree. During the undergraduate portion of the program, the summer period is free but may be used for independent study, elective coursework, or laboratory research. During the Medical School years, students may pursue, in parallel with the MD degree, an advanced degree in their area of interest (e.g., MPH, MD/PhD) or other professional development such as a Scholarly Concentration (See Advanced Scholarship). Advanced Scholarship The expected duration of the PLME is eight years. However, undergraduate PLME students have the option to defer their entry to the Medical School for one year while they pursue opportunities in other fields such as education, research, public service, government, health care, and business.
