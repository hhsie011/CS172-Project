Socially Responsible Computing @Brown SRC @Brown CS education which puts Socially Responsible Computing front and center As the role of technology increases in nearly every area of life, the work of computer scientists can increasingly exacerbate systems of social inequity. Technical decisions, if widely adopted, can intentionally or inadvertently function as policy decisions, and computer scientists are often given broad leeway to make those decisions. Computer scientists must understand the societal context of their work and the social implications of different design choices. Those who work in tech must consider the consequences of their work and collaborate across disciplines to avoid creating technology that is harmful or unjust. The SRC program strives to reimagine CS education to not only familiarize future engineers with the ethical, and political challenges and social impacts of modern digital technology, but to provide them with the tools to reason critically about those challenges.
