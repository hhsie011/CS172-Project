students. Additional information is provided on the UC International website. Key Terms for International Students I-20 A/B: Immigration and Naturalization Form (Certificate of Eligibility) for F-1 Visa Uses: To obtain an F-1 visa from the American Embassy/Consulate in his/her home country To enter the U.S. for the first time To re-enter after a short visit outside the U.S. To transfer to another school For entry of family To extend expected graduation date DS2019: Certificate of Eligibility for Exchange Visitor Status (J-1 Visa) Uses: To obtain a J-1 visa from the American Embassy/Consulate in his/her home country To enter the U.S. for the first time To extend stay and renew Entry Permit (I-94) To re-enter after a short visit outside the U.S. For entry of family To extend expected graduation date I-94: Arrival/Departure Record The I-94 is issued electronically upon admission to the U.S. It includes the visa classification and expiration date of the student's authorized stay written when he/she enters the U.S. International students can download the I-94 card from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection website. All students should have F-1 (exchange students should have J-1) written as the visa classification D/S stands for duration of status, which means the period during which the student is pursuing a full course of study, one year to twenty-nine months for practical training (18 months to three years for J-1 students), and 60 days in which to depart the country (30 days for J-1 students). Passport A passport is a person's country's identification of him or her as a citizen. The passport must remain valid at all times and may not expire. It may be renewed by contacting one's home-country Embassy/Consulate within the U.S. Visa: Stamped Page in Passport A visa normally is a stamp placed in one's passport by an official of the U.S. (or the country being entered) that permits entry. Unless someone is visa-exempt, he/she must have a valid visa to enter the U.S.; however, unlike a passport, a visa is allowed to expire once in the U.S. International Student Fee At UC, international students are charged the same tuition fees as other U.S. students who are not Ohio residents. The university incurs additional expenses associated with hosting international students, which include federal tracking and monitoring requirements associated with the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). The university also provides services and resources necessary to international students for academic and personal success. To help support these goals, international students pay a $125 fee per semester. Please contact UC International Services at 513-556-4278 or international.students@uc.edu for more information.
