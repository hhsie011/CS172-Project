The unrestricted support received through the fund plays a critical role in maintaining the School’s stature as a global leader in graduate business education. A gift to the annual fund acknowledges and ensures the continued value of the Columbia MBA degree. Every contribution has a direct and meaningful impact on faculty research, student financial aid, and industry-focused programs that benefit students, alumni, and the business community. Furthermore, annual giving liberates limited operating funds that can then seed new pursuits, permitting the School to seize opportunities without having to source restricted support. Seed Capital The Columbia Business School Annual Fund provides seed capital for new programs and initiatives, enabling us to capitalize on opportunities as they arise. The list below contains just a few examples of unrestricted support at work. Healthcare and Pharmaceutical Management Program Private Equity Program The Media Program Program for Financial Studies CaseWorks Master Classes Leadership Lab Critical Support The Columbia Business School Annual Fund provides critical support for key operating expenses, including: Student financial aid Faculty research Facility maintenance and improvements Tuition Relief While more than 75 percent of our operating revenue is generated by tuition and fees, tuition alone does not cover the cost of a Columbia Business School education. Alumni gifts are invaluable in bridging the gap between tuition revenues and the cost of each student's degree. Make a gift to the Columbia Business School Annual Fund.
