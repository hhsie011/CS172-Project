Disco-tech on internet shutdowns: "It's like being cut off from the world" Awareness and condemnation of internet shutdowns have increased in recent years from the United Nations, the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights, the Freedom Online Coalition, the Internet Society and the African Network Information Centre (AFRINIC), alike. This is in a large part due to efforts by civil society to send a clear message that internet shutdowns violate human rights, harm communities and undermine economic development. Nonetheless, shutdowns continue to plague the continent, especially around key political moments like elections, and can signal further human rights violations to come. While campaigns to end internet shutdowns have not yet been successful, civil society has learned quite a bit from enduring this blunt violation of their freedom of expression over the years. And we want to share those learnings on this special evening! What will we do? In this edition, Disco-tech will increase responsiveness to and awareness of internet shutdowns and explore how to detect, document and bypass them. It will also offer concrete examples of ways in which civil society and techies can support actions to combat them. Disco-tech also provides a safe space for sharing stories and experiences, in personal and powerful ways, facilitates cross-regional collaboration and seeks to connect with key actors who can link local struggles and global action. Disco-tech will create a space for participants to share strategies, make links and connections for technical and advisory support, and build on and further support solidarity and networks that can respond to internet shutdowns. Disco-tech 2019 will: • Explore the meaning of a shutdown and forms that it could take through personal stories of those who have studied or lived through shutdowns. • Bring to light stories of the shutdowns’ effects on human rights at an individual, national or regional level. • Share strategies and techniques to avert or lift shutdowns, including tech demos, policy ideas, advocacy strategies or litigation. Tunisian activists, who lived through these problems for decades before the Revolution, can talk about their experience. Disco-tech is proactive. Presenters and participants will share best practices and visionary ideas and make connections that will have direct impact on their work.

About Disco-tech Disco-techs are informal evening events that are designed as learning exchanges, to bridge the gaps between technical and political solutions to attacks on internet rights and freedoms. In order to ensure meaningful exchanges between techies, activists and policy advocates, informal discussions in a comfortable setting are sparked by stimulating short presentations during an evening event the day before a major forum like the IGF or RightsCon. Disco-techs have been held since 2013, focusing on counter-surveillance and cybersecurity (2013), the 16 Days of Activism to End Violence Against Women and Girls campaign (2013), internet censorship, blocking and filtering (2014), privacy and anonymity as fundamental rights (2015), community networks (2016), criminalisation of tech expertise (2017), and disability and accessibility to the internet (2018). We are excited to bring this important event to RightsCon in 2019!
