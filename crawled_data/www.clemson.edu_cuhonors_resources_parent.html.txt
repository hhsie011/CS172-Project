Typically, first year students arrive on campus with little experience in independently managing their time, money, or many activities. It isn’t always easy, either for parents or for students. Both federal law and our educational philosophy require us to talk directly to students, working with our campus partners to help them to address any difficulties while maximizing their educational experiences. Parents help by continuing to support their students in every way, encouraging them to take advantage of the many opportunities offered by the Honors College, and keeping in touch with us when urgent matters develop. Honors students leave Clemson and the Honors College having faced and overcome new challenges, whether on campus, in the workplace, or across the globe. Thanks to all our Honors parents for allowing us to work with your children throughout their Clemson experience! Honors Curriculum Tracks There are three different graduation tracks that Honors students have the option to graduate with: General Honors Departmental Honors Interdisciplinary Honors General Honors requires at least 18 credit hours in at least three different disciplines. The requirements (i.e., amount of credit hours, course, and final project) for Departmental Honors differs depending on the department the student chooses to pursue. Lastly, Interdisciplinary Honors requires at least 14 credit hours. A list of 1000- and 2000-level Honors course sections, as well as a list of Honors seminars, can be found on the student's Honors Course module in the virtual orientation program. Please note that course availability may change. Orientation Information Students are required to meet with their department's academic advisor before they register for classes. Academic advisors will reach out to students to schedule their pre-registration advising meetings. Students are not required to meet with their Honors advisor; however, if students have Honors-specific questions, drop-in advising hours will be shared with them in their orientation program, and will also be sent to them via their Clemson email. Priority Course Registration Honors students receive priority registration during orientation. This does not mean "first-come, first-served" or that an earlier registration time equates to more access to courses. Seats in courses (both Honors and non-Honors courses) are allocated and opened during each registration block (morning and afternoon) of course registration; they are not all opened during the first orientation session. Whether an Honors student registers on the first day of course registration or on a later registration date, their Honors priority registration provides them the first opportunity to select available courses. However, keep in mind that each student may not get the “perfect” schedule. Your student should go into registration with some back-up options and the willingness to be flexible. Course Registration Plan The registration plan is a tool within iROAR (where students register for classes) that allows them to create up to two planned schedules of classes prior to the start of registration. Creating a plan is no guarantee of gaining a seat in a class and does not mean a student is registered for a planned class. A tutorial on using the registration plan feature can be found in the student's virtual orientation module. Students will create their registration plan in iROAR, where they will also register for classes. Note: Honors students are required to take one Honors course in the fall and spring semesters. However, they may register for more than one Honors course, if desired, and if it is conducive to their schedule. AP/IB Classes Review the list of AP courses (PDF) and IB classes (PDF) accepted by Clemson University. AP and IB credits can count toward your student's degree requirements, but not toward an Honors course requirement. If your student hasn't received their AP/IB scores before course registration, have them inform their advisor (before course registration) which AP/IB courses they have taken and their anticipated scores. Their academic advisor will advise them to register for the appropriate courses. Support for Honors Students Throughout your student's time in the Honors College, we aim to provide as much support as possible including, but not limited to, Honors advising, peer mentoring, discussion groups, and social events. Honors Advising Honors advisors serve as a supplemental advisor, in addition to your student's academic advisor, to assist your student throughout their Honors experience. Honors advisors can answer questions related to Honors courses, Honors graduation requirements, opportunities available in the Honors College, and much more. Honors advising is optional, but students are required to meet with their department's academic advisor at least once a semester to plan their next semester's courses. Honors Peer Mentoring Program The Peer Mentoring program creates a community of students working and learning together to develop a unique perspective of living and learning through shared experiences. Peer mentors are current upperclassmen in the Honors College that work with groups of 8-10 newly admitted Honors students throughout the academic year. Your student can expect to receive emails about this program and how to join. Dixon Fellows Program The Dixon Fellows Program pairs undergraduates with a top Clemson professor to explore a wide range of intellectually challenging topics through readings, theater, film and travel. The application deadline is typically late August, shortly after classes start. Social Events There are a large variety of social events offered in the Honors College including engaging discussions; networking with industry professionals and graduate and professional school representatives; movie nights; and much more! Throughout the Fall and Spring semesters, the Honors College will keep your student informed through a weekly Honors newsletter (via email), announcements on Canvas (Clemson academic messaging system), posts on social media (i.e., Facebook and Instagram), and opt-in text reminders. Find Out More If you have any Clemson Honors-related questions that aren't answered on this page, please contact Katie Maxwell, Director of Advising and Student Development. Other orientation inquiries should be directed to orientation@clemson.edu. Opportunities to Engage Every spring, Clemson Honors hosts information sessions for incoming students and their parents. These sessions are designed to give you more information about the Honors experience, such as next steps before move-in day, programs available to help your student settle into their new home on campus, and experiences that prepare our students for their future careers. Watch this page for information about upcoming information session dates!
