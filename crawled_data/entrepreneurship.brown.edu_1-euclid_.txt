This home, located right across the street from the Brown bookstore, we hope will be an integral part of the Brown ecosystem. The built-from-scratch, 10,000-square-foot four-story building will provide space for new student ventures, events, entrepreneurs-in-residence, visiting faculty and student organizations, like Brown EP. As we explained in Brown’s official announcement, “This will encourage the kind of accidental collisions between experts and disciplines that are central to entrepreneurship and to the missions of both the center and Brown.” We would like to thank all the people involved in this process, especially Jonathan M. Nelson ‘77, whose $25 million transformational gift has catalyzed the center’s launch, the brilliant architects at 3SIXØ whose eye for design has made this space ideal for collaboration and community, and all of our friends whose generosity has made our new building possible: Charles M. ’82 and Jan P. Davis ’83, Liz Lange ’88 and David E. Shapiro, Christian J. Anthony ’96 and M. Hilton Locke, Greg ’83 and Anne Thorson, Victoria S. ’91 and Henry J. Rotenstreich, Steven B. ’87 and Sarah C. Kaufman ’87, Kenneth S. Orkin ’84 and Sondra Baker. Welcome! We hope to see you soon. Danny, Jonas, Liz, Sheila, and Tori FALL 2021 ANNOUNCEMENT Friends, Consistent with the University’s broader effort to normalize operations on College Hill, we are incredibly excited to re-open our building on Thayer Street once again. We will be doing so beginning September 8th, at which point all Brown ID holders will be able to access the building during our normal hours.
