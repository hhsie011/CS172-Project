financial assistance to help meet the cost of education. We recognize that situations exist when tax year information reported on the financial aid application does not reflect current financial circumstances. If you have experienced a sudden and drastic change in financial circumstances, our staff can evaluate your situation to determine if an adjustment is possible. The most frequently cited situations that justify reconsideration include: Loss of employment or change of employment status Divorce/separation or death of a parent/spouse Loss of untaxed income (i.e. child support) Disability Unusually high medical bills or disability-related expenses not covered by insurance Loss of one-time income Education expenses not adequately reflected in the cost of attendance (i.e. technology expenses, unusual transportation expenses) Child care expenses Please note that the aid reconsideration process requires that we collect documentation to confirm the accuracy of the financial information intially reported on the financial aid application and the change in financial circumstances. While our staff will make every effort to assist you, please understand engaging in the aid reconsideration process in no way guarantees an adjustment in the financial aid offer. The aid reconsideration process generally takes 3-4 weeks. If you would like to discuss your circumstance with a member of our team, please contact us at reconsideraid@ncsu.edu .
