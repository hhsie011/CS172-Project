Created as a collaboration between Student Outreach and Support (SOS), Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), and the Women and Gender Resource Center (WGRC), REACH centers the experiences of Latina scholars and provides participants with a space to receive support, share resources, and build community. REACH recognizes that the Latina identity is diverse. Everyone's experience is unique and informed by a variety of factors including but not limited to ethnicity, country of origin, native language, immigrant status, role within the family, degree of acculturation, generational presence in the US, intersecting identities, and more. For this reason, REACH aims to honor this diversity while acknowledging the core values, histories, and philosophies that influence Latina identity and the educational experience. REACH discussion groups meet regularly (via Zoom or in-person) during the Fall and Spring semesters. All discussion groups are free and open to current students. Join us this semester as we welcome Latina leaders from across the University and engage in conversation around topics that support student scholarship and success.
