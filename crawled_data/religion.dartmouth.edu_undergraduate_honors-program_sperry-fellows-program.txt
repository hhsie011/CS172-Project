Sperry GP '16, '20 Academic Enrichment Fund, the Department of Religion launched the Sperry Fellows Program in 2019-20. Through this unique and innovative program, we aim to provide every Religion major who is writing an Honors Thesis with a "Sperry Fellow"—a scholar outside of Dartmouth who has particular expertise in the topic addressed by the thesis. During the thesis-writing process, the student is supervised by a faculty member within the department, but also maintains regular contact with his or her Sperry Fellow to ask questions, locate relevant sources, work through challenges, and receive feedback on drafts of the thesis as it develops. In May of each academic year, the Sperry Fellow is invited to travel to Dartmouth, if possible, to participate in the student's honors thesis defense and/or to attend the Department's annual public presentation of honors theses. Thanks to the Sperry Fellows Program, our honors thesis writers gain a valuable opportunity to be closely mentored by a recognized expert outside of the regular department faculty. 2019-2020 Tina Li '20 Thesis: "Religion and Spirituality in 21st Century America: a Social Economic Analysis of Shifting Affiliations" (advisor: Professor Jeremy Sabella) Sperry Fellow: Philip Gorski, Professor of Sociology and Religious Studies, Yale University Related DepartmentClassicsRelated DepartmentFilm and Media Departments African and African American Studies Anthropology Art History Asian Societies, Cultures, and Languages Program Biological Sciences Chemistry Classics Cognitive Science Comparative Literature Computer Science Earth Sciences Economics Education Engineering Sciences English Environmental Studies Film and Media Studies French and Italian Geography German Studies Government History Humanities 1 & 2 Institute for Writing and Rhetoric Jewish Studies Latin American, Latino and Caribbean Studies Linguistics Mathematics Medieval and Renaissance Studies Music Native American Studies Philosophy Physics and Astronomy Psychological and Brain Sciences Religion Russian Sociology Spanish and Portuguese Studio Art Theater Women’s and Gender Studies Inclusivity “Dartmouth’s capacity to advance its dual mission of education and research depends upon the full diversity and inclusivity of this community…Diversity and inclusivity are necessary partners. Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Religion Undergraduate Overview Major and Minor Curriculum Course Schedule Dickinson Seminar Focus on Race Non-Western Courses Honors Program Sperry Fellows Program Past Honors Theses Career Information Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Awards and Prizes The Charles Howard Dudley Prize The Dickinson Senior Writing Prize in Religion The Hans Penner Prize The Religion Department Faculty Award The Sperry Writing Prize in Religion Foreign Study Program News & Events Overview Dickinson Distinguished Lecture Forum on Race & Religion Hardigg Family Fund Lecture Past Fellows Orr Lecture on Culture & Religion Past Lectures People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
