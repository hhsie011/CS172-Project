He will bring his perspective on Latin America, and Brazil in particular, to a chat in the Global Center. The title – A Marvelous Country? – makes a wordplay with the way Brazilians, sometimes, refer to their country ironically. Professor Moya aims to cover the features that make Brazil unique – for better or worse – and the characteristics that are shared by other countries in the New World. José C. Moya BA, Kean University MA, PhD, Rutgers University José C. Moya, Professor of History, joined the Barnard faculty in 2005 after teaching at UCLA for 17 years. In addition to his teaching duties for Barnard's Department of History, Professor Moya is affiliated with the Human Rights Studies Program. He teaches courses in Latin American history, Latin American civilization, and world migration. He has written extensively on global migration, gender, and labor. Professor Moya has received three Fulbright Fellowships, a Burkhardt Fellowship, and a Del Amo Fellowship. His research and scholarship have also been supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities. His book, Cousins and Strangers: Spanish Immigrants in Buenos Aires, 1850-1930, received five awards. The journal Historical Methods devoted a forum to its theoretical and methodological contributions to migration studies. He is currently editing Latin American Historiography for Oxford University Press, as well as working on the socio-cultural history of anarchism in belle-époque Buenos Aires and the Atlantic world. Professor Moya is the Director of the Barnard Forum on Migration.
