For positions geared more toward full-time, post-graduation work or internships, a separate system called CyHire is used. CyHire is an online, career management system operated by Career Services at Iowa State. With this system, employers can post positions, schedule on-campus interviews and supply information that students may find useful when evaluating whether to apply for a particular position. Students can easily search the employment opportunities and apply to positions of interest. There are no fees associated with using the system. : Job Board Resources for Students Welcome to the Student Job Board!

Tips for Avoiding Employment Scams As you search through available student jobs, please keep in mind that Iowa State University does not endorse these employers. The Office of Student Financial Aid cannot vouch for the validity or legitimacy for any of the jobs. This includes, but is not limited to wages, hours worked, working conditions or safety. Common sense goes a long way – if an employer asks you to do something you are not comfortable with, don’t do it. If a job seems too good to be true, be wary of the employer and do more research. Trust your instincts. You should not be asked to deposit a check or money order into your personal account, especially if asked to forward money to another individual or if the check has “extra” money. Job listings with language such as “money transfers” or “wiring funds” should be avoided. Scammers often ask to wire money using Western Union, MoneyGram, and similar services. Don’t apply for jobs that are randomly emailed to you. Your employer should not ask for your bank account, credit card, or other information over email or phone. Personal information, such as ID’s and Social Security numbers should only be given if you know how and by whom they will be used.
