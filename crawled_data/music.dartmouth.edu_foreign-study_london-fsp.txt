Guarini Institute for International Education Share London FSP London FSP Spring 2017 London FSP Spring 2017 London FSP Spring 2017 London FSP Spring 2017 PreviousNext About The Department of Music offers a foreign study program in London, England, and is operated in partnership with a third-party provider. The program provides an opportunity for students to combine the hands-on study of music with intensive, experiential exposure to musical performance. The program is open to students (both music majors and non majors) who are instrumentalists, vocalists, and composers, as well as to students whose focus is on music history, theory, sonic arts or ethnomusicology. Courses bring together the many diverse aspects of musical performance through attendance of more than thirty public performances; students will also participate in weekly individual lessons with UK professionals. Courses offered include Music 70: "Perspectives in Music Performance" (taught by the FSP director), which brings together the many diverse aspects of musical performance through attendance of more than thirty public performances; Music 71: "The History of Music in England," and Music 87: "Special Studies in Music Abroad," consisting of weekly individual lessons with UK professionals. Student musicians will reap the benefits of a term in London, the undisputed musical capital of Europe. The opportunity to attend concerts and rehearsals, meet performers and artists, and experience firsthand the vibrant musical traditions of London offers unique learning opportunities outside the classroom. Participant selection will be based on each applicant's interest in music and in musical performance, as demonstrated by past study. Please note that enrollment is limited to 16 students.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Music Undergraduate Music at Dartmouth Major and Minor Courses Spring 2022 Summer 2022 Fall 2022 Winter 2023 Spring 2023 Honors Honors Projects Funding Graduate Overview Apply People Current Students Performance Overview Individual Instruction Student Recitals Performance Laboratories Hopkins Center Ensembles Practice Rooms Instruments and Lockers Foreign Study Overview London FSP Vienna FSP News & Events News Events Arts Awards Leonard J.
