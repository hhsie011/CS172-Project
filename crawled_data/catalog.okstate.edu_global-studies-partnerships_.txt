Studies and Partnerships is focused on preparing students to address critical global challenges. Our curriculum reflects a global orientation to understanding issues such as economic development, geopolitics, crisis management, global trade, and public diplomacy. Academic Programs The School of Global Studies and Partnerships offers an interdisciplinary Master of Science degree in Global Studies and an undergraduate, interdisciplinary minor in International Studies. The Master of Science degree in Global Studies is designed to prepare students to cope with international responsibilities and address world problems that confront individuals working in the public and private sectors around the world. The curriculum is designed to educate students in the challenges and issues facing local and global communities, with an emphasis on understanding the economic, political, environmental, social, and cultural contexts that drive contemporary society. This interdisciplinary structure allows our students to draw from the best courses that Oklahoma State University has to offer, as well as to gain a global skill-set that will allow graduates to influence the world in a variety of career paths. The graduate program in global studies is designed to prepare students for internationally-oriented careers in a number of professional contexts including business, trade development, cultural industries, nonprofit organizations, media, and public and international policy. The program at OSU emphasizes the real challenges that face developing and developed nations alike, and seeks to bring a global problem-solving perspective to address those challenges. Students have opportunities to participate in research or internships abroad, tailor coursework to meet their educational needs, and to gain skills necessary to compete and thrive in an ever-growing global society. Graduates of the program work in numerous industries around the world including business, non-profit organizations, or government service around the world. There are two tracks within the program: thesis and non-thesis. Thesis Track: 33 hours of coursework including 6 hours of thesis Non-thesis Track: 33 hours of coursework including 3 hours of capstone experience This interdisciplinary program allows students to choose from one of four focus areas.
