They explore the barriers that subtly but effectively discourage women from entering and staying in the industry at each point in the pipeline. At the entry-level, the lack of visible role models discourages students from considering the field, and those who do embark on an investment management career face many obstacles to retention and promotion. Carr and Dudley highlight the importance of informal knowledge about how to navigate career tracks, without which women are left at a disadvantage in an industry that lionizes confidence.
