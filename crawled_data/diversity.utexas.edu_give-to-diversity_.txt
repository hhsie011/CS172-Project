Learn More About the Division The Division of Diversity and Community Engagement is a national model for integrating diversity and community engagement into the core mission of a university. It works with a broad range of student, faculty, staff, and community constituents to help The University of Texas at Austin connect its intellectual resources to communities across Texas and offer education to those who may face the greatest challenges in accessing it. The Division focuses on four core pillars: inclusive campus, community engagement, K-12 education, and student success. Know where you want to give?
