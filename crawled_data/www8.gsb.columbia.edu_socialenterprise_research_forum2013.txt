The caricature often presented in the press depicts data-obsessed reformers who believe in getting rid of low-performing teachers, standing off against unions who do not trust any teaching metric. One promising area that can potentially serve as a middle ground is developing classroom-tested, replicable, and scalable approaches to teacher training. We focused on the challenges facing educators working in urban settings, guided by presentations from leading thinkers. Discussion topics ranged from in-the-classroom techniques for using feed back to increase student motivation, to larger design questions around how to convince the many constituencies involved to put change into practice, with the aspiration of finding and implementing ways of improving schools.
