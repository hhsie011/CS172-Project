The University of Memphis Department of Art offers a BFA in Art Education and post degree licensure options, including an MAT in Art Education. This masters degree program leads to a K12 teaching license for the Visual Arts and meets all the requirements and competencies issued by the Tennessee State Department of Education. Students must provide evidence of a range of visual art accomplishments prior to qualifying for admission to this M.A.T program. Candidates with a BFA degree in studio fields, such as painting or sculpture usually have the most appropriate coursework needed to begin the program. Students with extensive experience in drawing, design and other creative visual activities and/or work experience may also have fewer hours of needed preliminary work. Upon completion of all degree requirements, including student teaching, and all testing (PRAXIS) requirements, students may apply for initial teacher licensure in Tennessee. The program provides students with the specific professional education knowledge and skills necessary for teaching art to students in kindergarten through grade twelve. The program includes coursework in comprehensive art education and teaching methods for diverse populations. Some courses have fieldwork in local school settings and community cultural institutions.
