Click the “New Student Application” button on our homepage. Step 2 The second step is to submit documentation of the disability. Documentation must be submitted to our office via email accessibility@okstate.edu or fax 405-744-1143. We need either a dated letter from a professional, a copy of the evaluation, or a copy of the 504/IEP that must state the diagnosis. The following information is required on your documentation: A diagnostic statement identifying the disability or condition A description of current functional limitations The licensed professional’s signature Step 3 The third step, after we receive and review the documentation, is for the student to set up an Intake meeting to discuss accommodations (academic, housing, dining, etc.) and resources available at OSU. For students beginning in the Fall Semester, the Intake typically occurs the summer before school starts, or you can schedule your Intake meeting for the first or second week of the semester. Please note accommodations are effective the day the professor receives the Accommodation Letter, so waiting until the semester begins could delay receipt of your accommodations. Our summer appointments fill up quickly; therefore, you will want to schedule as soon as possible.
