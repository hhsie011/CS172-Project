Foster Campus for Business and Innovation Media contact: Eric M. Eckert, (254) 710-1964 or the Office of Media Communications at (254)710-1961 Since 2001, Baylor University has invested more than $1 billion in new academic, residential and athletics facilities on its campus. In fall 2015, Baylor will open a dynamic new home for the University’s nationally ranked Hankamer School of Business: the $100 million, 275,000-square-foot Paul L. Foster Campus for Business and Innovation. Following a remarkably successful fundraising campaign - including an historic $35 million gift from El Paso businessman and Baylor graduate Paul L. Foster, B.B.A. '79, and major gifts from 530 additional donors - construction on the Foster Campus began in December 2013 on property along Bagby Avenue between Third and Fourth Streets. Once open, the Foster Campus will expand the size of the business school by 40 percent and increase opportunities for student and faculty collaboration across areas of business, science and technology. The building's architectural design features a highly corporate and sustainable business environment, including a centerpiece atrium that showcases some of the school's signature classrooms, such as the Financial Markets Center. A variety of classroom learning spaces will fully incorporate the latest classroom technology while providing flexibility to adapt as technology advances. A 350-seat auditorium will accommodate a wide range of guest lectures and events, and an adjacent Conference Center will host seminars, symposia and conferences for business professionals of all kinds. Established in 1923, Baylor’s Hankamer School of Business currently offers 24 undergraduate and 13 graduate areas of study with more than 3,300 undergraduate and graduate students and 200 staff and faculty members. The Hankamer building, which houses most of the administrative offices for the school, was constructed in the late 1950s and early '60s, while the Cashion Academic Center next door, which houses the classrooms, was added in the 1980s.
