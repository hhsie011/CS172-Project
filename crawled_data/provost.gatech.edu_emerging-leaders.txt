The program is a collaboration between the Office of the Provost, the Office of the Executive Vice President for Research, the Institute for Leadership and Social Impact, and the Office of Graduate Education and Faculty Development. 2021-2022 Cohort Selected The sixth cohort of Georgia Tech’s Emerging Leaders Program has been selected.
