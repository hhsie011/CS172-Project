Applicants must live in New Jersey or within a 50 mile commuting distance to the Princeton University campus. The program, founded in 1973, does not grant degrees and principally serves students who are: preparing for a career change or entrance into professional or graduate school, pursuing advanced training in their fields, resuming their education after a break, or seeking personal enrichment. Qualified continuing education students may enroll in most Princeton courses, along with Princeton undergraduate and graduate students. Some limited-enrollment courses such as creative writing and studio courses are not open to continuing education students. This program is distinct from the Community Auditing Program (CAP), which is a not-for-credit program with limited course selection for community residents. For additional information, please visit CAP. If you have any questions please call (609) 258-5226 or email the continuing education office.
