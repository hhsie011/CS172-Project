FAQ Contact Nonacademic Factors The Admissions Committee conducts holistic application review, evaluating both academic and nonacademic application elements. The AAMC Core Competencies for Entering Medical Students provides additional information for pre-medical student self reflection and assessment. While there are no minimum requirements to be met in order to be considered for admission, applicants should consider the following potential areas in demonstrating their interest in and preparation for medical education and training. Experiences Information on these areas may be included in the AMCAS Experiences section, as well as addressed in one's personal statement and letters of recommendation. Shadowing and Medical Related Experiences It is essential for pre-medical students to have an understanding of medical settings and experience the interaction of physicians and patients. Service and Volunteerism Demonstration of a concern for others as evidenced by a sustained commitment to one's community through volunteer or service activities. Leadership, Extracurricular Involvement, and Work Experience Provides the opportunity to demonstrate the areas important to an individual applicant, while developing life skills important for the transition to medical school. Research Provides the opportunity to better understand scientific investigation and discovery, especially important for those students interested in participating in research while in medical school. Personal Attributes Attributes important to becoming a well-rounded physician are assessed through completion of the AMCAS application, secondary application, and during the interview, if invited. These may include and are not limited to characteristics of honesty and integrity, the ability to communicate effectively, a sincere call to medicine, and an individual's contribution to a diverse medical class. Potential to Meet Medical Need The UofL School of Medicine seeks to meet the medical needs of the Commonwealth of Kentucky and underserved populations, particularly through primary care serving rural populations and racial and ethnic minorities.
