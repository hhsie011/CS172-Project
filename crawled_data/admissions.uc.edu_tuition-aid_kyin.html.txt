Metropolitan Rate The Metropolitan (Metro) Rate provides eligible students with the opportunity to enroll at University of Cincinnati and pay the Ohio resident tuition rate plus a $25 per credit hour surcharge (maximum of $300 per semester; 12-18 credit hours per semester) for both Indiana and Kentucky residents. Eligible students must: Reside or attend high school in Indiana (View Exceptions); or Reside or attend high school in the Commonwealth of Kentucky (View Exceptions) Reciprocity Rate Residents of specific counties in Indiana and Kentucky are eligible for the Reciprocity Rate.
