Unfortunately, the current energy mix in the Indian scenario comprises largely fossil fuel-based thermal power. What can India do to address global climate concerns and its own vulnerability to climate change threats? To better understand India’s policies on energy and the perspective of the renewable energy industry as a key solution provider, Columbia Global Centers | Mumbai collaborated with Columbia Global Centers | Beijing, and the Center on Global Energy Policy (CGEP), SIPA at Columbia University to host the third session of the Global Seminar Series on Energy and Climate Policy on June 24, 2021. The session began with an introductory overview and global perspective by Dr. Pierre Noel, Global Research Scholar at CGEP, who noted that India and other Asian economies are key to climate change negotiations. This was followed by a presentation by Mr. Sumant Sinha, SIPA alumnus and Chair and Managing Director of ReNew Power, one of India's leading renewable energy companies, and a discussion with him that was moderated by CGEP’s Director, Laurie Fitzmaurice. Mr. Sinha presented from his recent book, Fossil Free: Reimagining Clean Energy in a Carbon-Constrained World, referring to the carbon budget of the earth and showing how our carbon emissions can raise the average global temperature by 1.5 to 2 degrees celsius. At the rate of nine gigatons of current average global annual emissions, we have 10 to 15 years to take any action; postponing this action will make carbon neutrality for countries very difficult. Under this scenario, as India’s current average per capita energy consumption is a quarter of that of the rest of the world, and as India grows as a consumer economy, its policies and practices will be critical for the world, Mr. Sinha observed. According to him, the Indian government needs to take several policy measures in promoting and expanding two key transitions that are happening globally - electrification and the expansion of renewable energy. He acknowledged that even with the favorable cost efficiencies achieved in putting up renewable energy plants, there are multiple challenges the Government of India faces, including considerable investment to install 500,000 to 600,000 MW of renewable energy to completely replace coal for a transition that will practically take no less than 20 to 30 years. Another big challenge remains the creation of employment opportunities for shifting the labor force to other livelihood options, perhaps training them in green job skills and creating more jobs in that sector. A third factor is adequate storage for absorbing the enhanced supply, especially during the peak generation time, that can be remedied by policies encouraging innovation in electricity storage solutions and designing innovative dynamic pricing of electricity usage. Mr. Sinha emphasized that cost factors will have to be balanced equitably through a forward-looking, lucid, and inclusive policy approach and continued dialogue with multiple institutions at national, sub-national, and international levels to identify and deploy the required solutions.
