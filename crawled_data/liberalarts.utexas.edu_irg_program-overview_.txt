The purpose of the seminar is to have students complete an independent research project on a subject that builds upon previous IRG major requirements. The specific case study may be narrowly focused in a geographic and chronological sense, but it should address a broader contemporary debate in international and global affairs. Students in the capstone seminar engage in a few weeks of common reading, develop a research proposal and outline, write draft pages and review fellow students’ work, present their findings in an oral presentation, and submit a final paper of around 25 pages. Students may choose to apply for IRG Honors, a 6-hour, 2-semester course that takes the place of the Capstone course. See Honors for more information. Students in the 18-20 catalog or earlier who complete a one-year honors thesis in a second major may be able to substitute that thesis course for the IRG Capstone course. Students are encouraged to consult with an IRG advisor as early as possible to ensure that their thesis will meet the necessary conditions to substitute.
