Penn Undergraduate Research Fellowships The Wolf Humanities Center offers fellowships each year to Penn undergraduate students from any school who are interested in conducting extracurricular research in the humanities on some aspect of the Center's annual theme. Fellows become members of the Wolf Undergraduate Humanities Forum, a community of undergrads who meet to discuss and present their research, pursue various cultural activities of common interest, and occasionally meet in special receptions with the Wolf Humanities Center's distinguished speakers. In the past, these speakers have included Zadie Smith, Michelle Alexander, Junot Diaz, Slavoj Žižek, and Colson Whitehead. The year's program culminates in a spring conference at which students give formal presentations on the results of their research. Fellows are required to attend and participate in regularly scheduled meetings. During the 2022-23 academic year, in-person meetings will be held on Fridays between 2:00pm and 4:00pm. Fellows are also required to participate in the Undergraduate Humanities Forum Research Conference, scheduled next year for Friday, March 24, 2023. Additional opportunities and outings for fellows will be announced during the year. Students must be full time, on campus for the full academic year of the award, and in good academic standing. Three positions are available on the Wolf Undergraduate Humanities Forum Executive Board. The UHF Chair and Executive Board Fellows work closely with UHF Director David Spafford and the Wolf staff, and serve important leadership roles, planning and organizing activities throughout the year as well as the spring research conference.
