Today, the School of Medicine’s faculty stand on the shoulders of giants such as Samuel D. Gross, the patriarch of America’s trauma surgeons, and Abraham Flexner, whose work reshaped medical education in the United States. As our dean notes, we are a community of scholars and we are dedicated to helping the next generation of physicians translate new discoveries and leading-edge knowledge into excellent, compassionate care that enhances and preserves quality of life. We invite you to find out more. "During medical school at the University of Louisville, I observed that the General Internal Medicine faculty were the most approachable, the most supportive, and the best teachers on the medical faculty. This made my choice of residency program an easy one. In addition to the excellent teaching faculty, the program allows for numerous research opportunities. I have been fortunate to be allowed to participate in both basic science and clinical projects while a resident. During my residency I will be completing my PhD in Physiology and Biophysics. I would highly recommend the residency program for those interested in a career in academic medicine." -- Ryan Hurt, M.D., Internal Medicine The Graduate Medical Education Program is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME).
