By Maeve McQueeny 05-11-2022 Atlanta ’Canes walk for MS research on ’Canes Day of Service. ’Canes Communities celebrate return of two national programs By Maeve McQueeny 05-11-2022 This spring saw two signature national events return to ’Canes Communities: ’Canes Day of Service and Global Networking Week. More than 650 alumni and friends of the U participated. This spring, as the University of Miami Alumni Association and ’Canes Communities sprang back into action with in-person events following the long pause imposed by the pandemic, two signature national initiatives staged hugely successful comebacks. On April 23, to coincide with Earth Day, alumni nationwide harnessed the collective power of their ’Canes Communities in service of the environment and their communities by participating in ’Canes Day of Service. Alumni and friends of the University of Miami showed up in droves to cities like Atlanta, Charlotte, and Los Angeles, to serve some of our most vulnerable people and ecosystems. Moments from ’Canes Day of Service 2022 The flagship event was hosted by the Miami ’Canes Community at Virginia Key Outdoor Center, just off mainland Miami, where volunteers participated in shoreline and coastal cleanup, followed by a lunch-and-learn discussion on coral reef restoration with Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science researchers. ’Canes in Charlotte partnered with Samaritan’s Feet to outfit children with new shoes and alumni in Atlanta walked to raise funds for Walk MS. In total, 11 ’Canes Communities across the country participated, including Orlando, which will partner with Second Harvest Food Bank to support the latter’s annual fundraising event on May 21. A few weeks earlier, the Office of Engagement hosted its annual Global Networking Week, a mix of virtual and in-person career-oriented events offering helpful resources for alumni to add to their professional toolkit, create new connections, and discover new professional opportunities. Recent graduates and experienced professionals alike attended to leverage the strength of the ’Canes network and maximize the potential of their degrees. Moments from Global Networking Week 2022 ’Canes Communities throughout the country hosted networking events for alumni to connect, engage, and do business together, while supporting brighter futures for all alumni and discovering opportunities for mentorship, collaboration, and professional development. ’Canes Day of Service and Global Networking Week are proof positive that whether you’re looking to give back to your community, forge new friendships, or find fulfillment through a worthy cause, ’Canes Communities offer stellar opportunities year-round to connect with a network of nearly 200,000 alumni worldwide and to become an even greater force for good.
