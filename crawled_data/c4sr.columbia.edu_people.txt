Columbia | Center for Spatial Research Projects News Courses Tutorials Publications People Contact x Close Menu Columbia | CSRCenter for Spatial Research Menu About Projects News Courses Tutorials Publications People Laura Kurgan ContactLaura Kurgan is a Professor of Architecture at the Graduate School of Architecture Planning and Preservation at Columbia University, where she directs the Center for Spatial Research , the Master of Science in Computational Design Practices, and the Visual Studies curriculum. More She is the author of Close Up at a Distance: Mapping, Technology, and Politics (Zone Books, 2013). Her work explores the ethics and politics of digital mapping and its technologies; the art, science and visualization of big and small data; and design environments for public engagement with maps and data. From 2004 - 2015, she founded and directed the Spatial Information Design Lab at GSAPP. The SIDL "Million Dollar Blocks" project is in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, and her work has also been shown at Palais De Tokyo and the Fondation Cartier in Paris, MACBa in Barcelona and the ZKM in Karlsruhe. In 2009, Kurgan was awarded a United States Artists Rockefeller Fellowship. Dare Brawley ContactDare Brawley is assistant director of the Center for Spatial Research. Her work focuses on the interactions of technology, urban governance, and spatial politics using methods from critical urban studies and geographic information systems. More Her work has been exhibited and published by the Venice Architecture Biennale, Storefront for Art and Architecture, The Architectural League, and the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy. She received her M.S. in Urban Planning from Columbia, GSAPP and holds a BA in Architecture from Barnard College. Dan Miller ContactDan Miller is a Research Associate at the Center for Spatial Research, where he brings experience in critical, historical GIS and digital mapmaking to the Mapping Historical New York project. Dan uses maps to examine, deepen, or augment understanding of events, communities, and landscapes—historical, ecological, social, and digital. More His work predominantly explores methodologies, collaborative processes, and tools that engage or activate data and media toward spatial justice. Prior to joining the CSR, Dan managed human rights and spatial analysis casework at Brooklyn-based architectural practice SITU as well as access to and visualization of historical US Census data at Social Explorer. He has contributed to work exhibited at the Storefront for Art and Architecture, the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, and the Yale University Art Gallery, and he has taught methods in environmental and urban sociology at Queens College CUNY. Juan Moreno ContactJuan Moreno is a Mellon Associate Research Scholar at the Center for Spatial Research. His work explores urban informality in Latin American cities from multiple perspectives, using urban history, geographic information systems, and qualitative methods to study the transformation of cities and their peripheries. More He is currently examining the connections between waste management infrastructure and informal settlements in several Latin American cities – an expression of the political economy of informality in the region. Juan holds a M.Sc. in Urban Planning from Columbia, GSAPP (where he was also part of the Housing Lab) and a M.A. in Geography from Universidad de los Andes, located in his hometown Bogotá, Colombia. Jia Zhang ContactJia Zhang is a Mellon Associate Research Scholar at Columbia University's Center for Spatial Research. She experiments with communicating quantitative and qualitative data visually. Her research examines and utilizes technical processes and abstract visual forms found in data representation. At the CSR, Jia works on visualizations of public urban datasets and the U.S. Census. More She is currently building projects that deal with public facing data of the urban environment and interactive tools that allow individuals to directly engage with urban information for their own well-being. Jia recently completed her PhD at MIT’s Media Lab. Her personal website is: https://dataminding.blog/ Wright Kennedy ContactWright Kennedy specializes in geographic information systems (GIS) and spatial analysis to study past and present health, environmental, and socioeconomic issues in cities. He has investigated a wide range of urban topics with GIS, including epidemics, streetcar corruption, hurricane recovery, and shifting environmental disease burdens linked to Jim Crow and residential segregation. More He is a lecturer in the History Department at Columbia and the Postdoctoral Research Scholar on Mapping Historical New York, a spatial history project on immigrants and neighborhood development in the city during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. His teaching interests include spatial history methods, urban geographic history, and the history of medicine. Adeline Chum ContactAdeline is a Graduate Research Assistant at the Center for Spatial Research and is currently a third-year student in the MArch Program at GSAPP. She has worked in small and medium-sized architecture firms in Toronto, New York, and London. In her current work, she is interested in land use productivity and is critical of the relationship between forest land, wildlife reserves, sites of extraction and infrastructure. More Maria Doku ContactMaria Doku is a Graduate Research Assistant at the Center for Spatial Research. She is currently a first-year Master of Architecture student at GSAPP. More Maria has experience working in the fields of architecture and data science--both independently and in unison. Maria previously worked at Gensler in Workplace Research and Data Analytics under the Microsoft Real Estate Center of Innovation of Redmond, Washington. She has also worked as an Architectural Design intern for Module, the Pittsburgh based design-build company that builds optimal-sized, energy efficient homes through the means of prefabricated modular construction methods. An avid reader, Maria is always open to new book suggestions and works as a freelance Editorial Contributor for the online architectural journal of Archinect. Adam Vosburgh ContactAdam Vosburgh is a Graduate Teaching Assistant at the Center for Spatial Research. He is interested in how various power structures shape our urban landscapes both physically and in how we navigate them. Adam is currently pursuing a Master of Architecture at the GSAPP. More His work has been exhibited at the Venice Biennale and the Fondation Cartier. Prior to being at the GSAPP, Adam earned his Bachelor of Arts in Architecture from UNC Charlotte, and worked as an architect at SANAA in Tokyo and OMA in New York.
