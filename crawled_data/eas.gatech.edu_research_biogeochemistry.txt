Our research objectives are to characterize and understand the biogeochemical processes that regulate the distribution of inorganic and organic compounds to determine their impact on the environment in the past, the present, and the future. Geochemical measurements are also used in geological and biological archives such as corals, deep sea sediments, and cave deposits to investigate ocean and climate history. Some of our research is field-based and includes oceanic cruises, in situ measurements in coastal and deep-sea environments, and investigations in pristine or polluted rivers, lakes, aquifers, and coastal marshes. Laboratory-based research investigates interactions between minerals, microorganisms, and dissolved chemicals to characterize the processes that mediate their dissolution and precipitation.
