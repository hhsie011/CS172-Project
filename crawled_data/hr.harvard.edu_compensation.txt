Survey sources represent local and national markets, along with specialty markets such as biotechnology, information technology, museums, etc. Eligibility for overtime pay, as well as review of internal equity is also closely monitored. Individual compensation discussions begin during the hiring process. They may then occur at a variety of times, including following a job review, during the annual increase process, and related to the performance assessment discussion. Pay practices for staff members represented by a union at Harvard are established through the collective bargaining process. Starting salaries Starting salaries vary depending on experience, skills and the market for the position. The hiring department, working with guidelines from the Harvard Compensation department, determines the externally competitive and internally equitable salary for each new employee. Starting salaries will generally be in the lower part of the salary range for the position. Annual salary increase program Harvard annual salary increase program depends up your employee type. For administrative and professional staff and other nonunion staff, consideration for an annual merit salary increase typically follows the formal performance management process near the end of each fiscal year. To strengthen the link between performance and pay, the University encourages regular meetings between staff and supervisors throughout the year. Salary increases for staff represented by a union are established through the collective bargaining process and union members should consult their contract for details.
