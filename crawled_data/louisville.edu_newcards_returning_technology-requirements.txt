Mac laptops should run at least MacOS 10.14 (Mojave) ITS recommends MacOS 10.5 (Catalina). Unit-specific Requirements Arts & Sciences (Fine Arts) - Many students in the Department of Fine Arts use a MacBook Pro. Most Graphic Design students use MacBook Pros. Interior Design students need to have the ability to run CAD/Revit software. Within the department there are a limited number of desktop computers in some of the classrooms in Interior Design and Graphic Design as well as the Photo Digital lab, for students in those areas to use, in addition to their own computer. For those who are unable to purchase more expensive technology, the department will work with students, within the constraints of availability of equipment and scheduling. In addition, the Art Library also has desktops for general student use. Incoming students with further questions can contact the department at hite@louisville.edu. We recommend investing more when buying a laptop at the beginning, to get as robust a system as you can manage. As programs upgrade, they constantly consume more processor speed, RAM, etc. so purchase a computer that can get you through 4 years, rather than trying to update two years down the road. Business - For CIS students, 8 DRAM, a slightly bigger drive and a secondary power source Dentistry (includes Dental Hygiene) Law Medicine - School of Medicine provides each student with a MacBook Pro Nursing Speed SPHIS Example Devices Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 Windows 10 Home 64-bit Intel Core i5 8GB Memory (RAM) 256 GB SSD Dell Inspiration 14 3000 Laptop Windows 10 Home 64-bit Intel Core i5 8GB Memory (RAM) 256 GB SSD Lenovo Thinkpad L13 Windows 10 Home 64-bit Intel Core i3 4GB Memory (RAM) 128 GB SSD You can view purchasing options at the University's Campus Store. *iPads may be acceptable for the majority of a students' classwork (depending on the program) but will not be compatible with online testing softwares.
