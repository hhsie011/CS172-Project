Student Information Turnitin is a web-based service to which papers are submitted by students as part of course assignments and compared to resources in the database, with the results of the comparison (including hyperlinks to web pages or other papers with the same text) sent to the instructor. Turnitin also offers other services including Peer Review, an online collaborative learning solution to protect against peer collusion and Research Resources, for preemptive plagiarism education. The easiest way to use Turnitin is through the Canvas LMS. Baylor faculty are not able to use Turnitin to check their own scholarly writing. Instead, Turnitin offers a separate service called iThenticate which can be purchased independently or through your own department for this purpose. IMPORTANT NOTE: When Turnitin is used for a class, Baylor's office of the General Counsel requires that: The course syllabus for each course making use of Turnitin must provide the following notice: "Students agree that by taking this course, all required papers, exams, class projects or other assignments submitted for credit may be submitted to turnitin.com or similar third parties to review and evaluate for originality and intellectual integrity. A description of the services, terms and conditions of use, and privacy policy of turnitin.com is available on its web site: http://www.turnitin.com. Students understand all work submitted to turnitin.com will be added to its database of papers. Students further understand that if the results of such a review support an allegation of academic dishonesty, the course work in question as well as any supporting materials may be submitted to the Honor Council for investigation and further action." If use of Turnitin is instituted after the distribution of the syllabus, then an equivalent written notice must be provided by the instructor to the students. For legal reasons, you cannot use Turnitin for suspect papers belonging to individual students. Turnitin must be used for the papers of all of the students in the class. Require that all students in a class submit their own papers as opposed to submission by instructors or submission of individual papers singled out by instructors. This action ensures that the students are fully aware that Turnitin is being used. Do not make statements to students that Turnitin is being used in a given class when the class is not registered for use with Turnitin. Availability Faculty, staff, and students can access Turnitin via Canvas (https://canvas.baylor.edu) or directly from Turnitin (https://turnitin.com).
