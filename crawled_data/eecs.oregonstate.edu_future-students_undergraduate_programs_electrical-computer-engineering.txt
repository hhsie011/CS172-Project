Oregon State offers several focus areas shown on the tabs below. The ECE curriculum includes hand-on learning in which students to apply their knowledge of electrical and computer engineering to create a variety of different projects from freshman to senior year. Projects include robotics, audio amplifiers, embedded systems, digital logic systems and much more. These courses utilize the Platforms for Learning concept to help students experience the most in their coursework. Adding a CS minor: A minor in computer science can be easily added to an ECE major. If planned correctly, ECE students can obtain their CS minor with one extra CS course that does not go toward their ECE major. See more details on the CS minor option page.
