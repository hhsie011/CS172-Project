Graduate Programs Current: Animal & Veterinary Sciences (MS, PhD) Animal & Veterinary Sciences (MS, PhD) Students interested in a professional career in the animal sciences will be exposed to educational and research experiences involving the many facets of animal nutrition, physiology, microbiology, genetics, and meat science through a rigorous curriculum of graduate-level courses and challenging experimentation approaches. The most current ideas and concepts in animal sciences will be provided to the students through their daily interactions with the faculty in both the classroom and laboratory environments. Goal The purpose of the Animal and Veterinary Sciences (AVS) graduate program is to provide a high-quality education for graduate students with diverse goals, and to develop, through research, the knowledge and technology necessary to continually improve productivity, efficiency, and sustainability of animal agriculture. Specialization & Research Emphasis One Health One Health is defined as “the integrative effort of multiple disciplines working locally, nationally, and globally to attain optimal health for people, animals, and the environment.”. Learn more about One Health here. Our group focuses on applying this approach in the following areas: Antimicrobial resistance mitigation Comparative Medicine/Translational Research Zoonotic Diseases Disaster preparedness and response Food Safety and Security Human - Animal bond Education and training of the next generation of One Health professionals Welfare / Well-being of animals Faculty Members (see the full Graduate Faculty directory) Ahmed Ali, DVM, PhD Brian Booth, PhD Celina Checura, DVM, PhD, Dipl.

In animal nutrition, an in-depth understanding of several disciplines is necessary to undertake its exploration. Some of these areas are Animal Physiology, Nutrient Metabolism, Microbiology, Analytical Chemistry, Biochemistry, Anaerobic Fermentation, Management Practices, Statistics, Ecology, Forages, among others. Our research encompasses the improvement in nutrient content of meat, milk and eggs with the overall goal of achieving a healthier environment and human population. During your research in your graduate program, you will gain the skills to analyze, synthesize, plan and critically evaluate independently new and complex phenomena, problems and situations in animal nutrition while seeking and investigating possible solutions. Faculty Members (see the full Graduate Faculty directory) Matias Aguerre, PhD Mireille Arguelles, PhD Susan Duckett, PhD Gustavo Lascano, PhD Jim Strickland, PhD Admission Requirements (in addition to Graduate School requirements) The AVS Department requires GRE scores, a resume, a personal statement and three letters of reference for application to our graduate program. For M.Sc. thesis, M.Sc. nonthesis, and Ph.D. degree programs, the AVS Department also requires that you identify a faculty member who is willing to serve as your major advisor prior to admission. For assistance choosing a major advisor, please contact the AVS Graduate Program Coordinator, Dr. Nathan Long nlong2@clemson.edu. Requirements for Degree Animal and Veterinary Sciences, MS Applicants to the Animal and Veterinary Sciences programs should have a strong background in the animal, biological and physical sciences. Students with deficiencies in these sciences may be admitted provided they correct these deficiencies during the first year of the program of study. MS students are required to complete coursework in an area of interest approved by their graduate advisor or advisory committee. MS students may select a thesis or non-thesis option. Master of Science, Non-Thesis Option: Students in the M.S. non-thesis option must complete a minimum of 30 hours of coursework, excluding thesis research.

Financial Information The most common mechanism of support is a thorough Graduate Research (GRA) and Teaching (GTA) Assistantships. Interested students are encouraged to contact prospective advisors regarding these assistantships’ availability and eligibility. These assistantships are awarded on a competitive basis directly by the Principal Investigator of each research project. Applications from students who have not been in communication with their prospective advisor before applying to the AVS Graduate Program are rarely admitted. Types of assistantships: Graduate Research Assistants (GRA) conduct supervised research or assist with research funded from any source administered by the University. Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTA) teach undergraduate classes or laboratories under the supervision of a faculty member. GTAs are not responsible for assigning grades. Graduate Teachers of Record (GTR) assume primary responsibility for teaching undergraduate classes or laboratories and are responsible for assigning grades. The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) requires that all Graduate Teachers of Record (GTR) have “earned at least 18 graduate semester hours in their teaching discipline, be under the direct supervision of a faculty member experienced in the teaching discipline, receive regular in-service training and be evaluated regularly. The department chair has the responsibility for determining that the 18-hr requirement is met either through coursework or with a memo containing documentation that the graduate assistant meets the requirement as an exception. The Enrolled Student Serves Office will certify that the 18-hour requirement has been met. A few recruitment fellowships and other merit-based scholarships are also available to be awarded on a competitive basis. Job Placement Graduate School is not a race is a marathon. We get it. Your graduate degree will provide you with options to immerse yourself in several different areas that throughout this experience you have learned you are passionate about.
