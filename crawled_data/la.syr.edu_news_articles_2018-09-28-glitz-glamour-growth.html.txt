Now in its ninth year, the fall program welcomed 63 students — its largest class to date. The SULA Semester is a one-semester, career-oriented program that provides students a unique opportunity to take entertainment industry-related academic courses while working part time as interns at a vast array of media companies. In addition to the real-world internship, students meet with alumni who are working at the highest levels of the entertainment industry, as well as alumni who have recently relocated to Los Angeles and can offer their perspective on starting a career there. Students also enjoy some showbiz glitz and glamour. This semester, students have been treated to the Fall Television Preview event at the Paley Center and tapings of the hit TV shows "Mom", "America’s Got Talent", and "Dancing with the Stars: Junior." Later this semester, students will act as “seat fillers” at the American Music Awards. Also setting an enrollment record is the SULA Semester summer program, with 20 students in attendance in 2018. Launched in 2016, the 12-week, six credit program welcomes all majors and includes an opportunity for an internship. Students from Newhouse, the College of Visual and Performing Arts, the College of Arts and Sciences, the Whitman School, and Falk College, have already experienced the SULA Semester's entertainment-based curriculum taught by industry professionals, along with the opportunity to work as an intern at a media company. The SULA Semester program offers a wide array of classes, including screenwriting, acting, communications law, producing, directing, cinematography, music, and video production.
