During orientation week just before the start of fall term, when incoming students get access to DartWorks via DartHub, information about your writing placement and which term you are assigned to take Writing 5 (if relevant) will appear in the Prematriculation Credits and Exemptions section of DartWorks. Information on interpreting the information in this section of DartWorks can be found on the Registrar's website. Please note that students who have been accepted into an approved equivalent of Writing 5 (such as fall Humanities 1) will receive notification and additional instructions for registration via email but may still show a term assignment for Writing 5 in the system. This is normal and expected. This represents your term assignment for Writing 5 should you change your mind about participation in the approved equivalent of Writing 5 and decide to take Writing 5 instead. Writing 5 Registration During the normal course registration process for the upcoming term, students who are scheduled to take Writing 5 review the sections of Writing 5 offered and elect/request the section they prefer, along with their other course elections. Whether they get into the section they elected/requested is determined during the registration processing period. Students who did not get into their first choice during initial course election choose another Writing 5 class from among those with space available during the course changes period prior to the start of classes. Students enrolled in Writing 5 may use the online registration system to switch into a different section of Writing 5, as long as there is space available, during the course changes period or during the add-drop period in the first week of classes. The details on the schedule for initial course election, course changes period, and add-drop period for a given term can be found on the Registrar's website. Advice on switching among Writing 5 courses during the course changes and add-drop periods can be found on our website on our switch page. Writing 5 class size is limited to 16 to allow for individualized attention. Enrollment above the limit is never allowed in a Writing 5 course. Open slots are first-come, first-served. No waiting lists are maintained. Students must successfully complete Writing 5 or its approved equivalents to fulfill the first-year writing requirement and then complete a First-year Seminar (or Humanities 2) to complete the first-year seminar requirement. Writing 5 does not serve in partial satisfaction of the General Education requirements such as distributive requirements or the world culture requirement. Writing 5 Course Descriptions See Writing 5 Section Descriptions Page for more information on the topics offered in the current or upcoming term. The descriptions page will display the descriptions for the upcoming term shortly before registration opens to first-year students for that term. Archived examples of descriptions from past terms are available here. Writing 2-3 Registration Writing 2-3 is a two-term, two-credit course that provides more intensive guidance through the reading, writing, and research processes. See this page for a comparison between the two Writing 2-3 courses and Writing 5. Students who complete the online directed self-placement process and accept placement into a Writing 2-3 course will be preregistered for Writing 2 before fall term course election. Writing 2 students will be pre-registered for Writing 3 before winter term course election. Students who take the Writing 2-3 sequence take their First-year Seminar in the spring term, and will need to register for a First-year Seminar at the same time they register for their other spring term courses. Writing 2-3 is limited to 15 students per section and is taught only in fall and winter terms. Writing 2-3 is taken in place of Writing 5. Students must successfully complete both terms of Writing 2-3 to fulfill the first-year writing requirement and then must take a First-year Seminar to fulfill the first-year seminar requirement. Writing 2-3 does not serve in partial satisfaction of the General Education requirements such as distributive requirements or the world culture requirement.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Institute for Writing and Rhetoric Philosophy & Aims About Writing at Dartmouth Speech at Dartmouth Our Stories The Story of Writing Instruction at Dartmouth The Story of Speech at Dartmouth The Story of Writing Support at Dartmouth Curriculum Overview Writing Courses Writing 2-3 WRIT 5 First-Year Seminars Humanities 1-2 Speech Courses Speech 20 Speech 25 Speech 26 Speech 27 Speech 30 Speech 31 Speech 33 Speech 34 Speech 36 Speech 37 Speech 40 Placement and Enrollment Policies First-Year Writing & First-Year Seminar Requirements Differences Among First-Year Writing Courses FAQ Directed Self-Placement Process for Writing Registration for Writing 5 or Writing 2-3 Registration for First Year Seminars FAQ First-year Writing Registration First-year Writing Choices Prizes Writing Prize Winners Speech Contest Winners Speech Contest Call for Entries Learning Overview Writing Center Make an Appointment Materials Sources and Citations at Dartmouth Teaching Overview Guidelines Teaching Writing in the First Year Expectations for Writing 2-3 Expectations for Writing 5 Teaching the First-Year Seminar First-Year Writing: Pedagogies, Methods, & Design Active Learning in the First-Year Writing Classroom Syllabus and Assignment Design Teaching Writing as Process Integrating Reading and Writing Diagnosing and Responding to Student Writing Conducting Writing Workshops Collaborative Learning/Learning with Peers Teaching Argument Teaching Research Addressing Grammar Useful links Support The Writing Assistant Program Research Past Research Activities Research Overview Multilingual Overview Support for Undergraduate Students Support for Graduate Students Faculty Support News & People People News Employment Upcoming Events Past Events My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
