Students/ Paths to Success/ Guide to Practice Areas/ Water Law Water Law As a lawyer focusing on water law, you will often be at the center of major development projects with significant community, economic and environmental implications. Your work will ensure the continuous and sustainable availability of the world’s most critical resource — fresh water — for businesses, landowners, communities and the environment. Here are just a few examples of the work you may expect as a lawyer who practices water law. Procure freshwater resources for private companies and agricultural interests. Work with governmental agencies on regulatory compliance and permitting issues. Aid environmental organizations on habitat and flows protection regimes. Appear in court for enforcement and water rights challenges. Lawyers focusing on water law also help ensure the replenishment and long-term availability of freshwater resources. This often involves engaging with cutting-edge technological and legal developments that facilitate water reuse, desalination, aquifer storage and recovery, and integrated water resources management.
