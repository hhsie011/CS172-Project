COVID 19 Update Updated August 26, 2021 The Stanford travel policy for the Bing Stanford in Washington Program has been updated, as follows: Travel associated with the Bing Overseas Studies Program (BOSP) and Stanford in Washington are exceptions and will be permitted for fully vaccinated undergraduates. Unvaccinated students who wish to participate in BOSP programs both abroad and in New York, or in Stanford in Washington, must begin the vaccine exception request process for travelers at least 4 weeks in advance of the program withdrawal deadline. Given current COVID-19 conditions, permission for travel through Bing Overseas Studies Program or Stanford in Washington is unlikely to be granted to unvaccinated undergraduate students in Fall 2021 and Winter 2022. For Stanford in Washington, internships and many learning opportunities will not be available to unvaccinated students. Approval for vaccine exemption for on-campus enrollment does not automatically extend to off-campus programs. For more information about program specific withdrawal deadlines please see the Stanford in Washington Handbook and Contract. Our COVID 19 Health Protocols can be found in the document linked here: siw_covid_health_protocols.pdf Why Washington?
