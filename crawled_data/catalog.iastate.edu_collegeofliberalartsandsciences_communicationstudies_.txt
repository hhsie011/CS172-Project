Communication Studies majors master a focused course of inquiry into interpersonal processes as they create and sustain relationships and impact individuals, groups, and organizations. The Communication Studies curriculum builds primarily on social science traditions in developing a liberal arts education emphasizing human communication. Students in the Communication Studies major study applied communication theory and research in interpersonal, small group, organizational, intercultural, and other contexts. The Communication Studies (ComSt) major teaches students how to think critically, giving them the ability to examine complex communication issues, and develop and implement strategies grounded in evidence-based research. This prepares students for careers in business and industry and graduate education. Students majoring in ComSt will find their career opportunities enhanced in professions requiring applied communication expertise, e.g., human resource management, public relations, training and development, sales management, recruitment, event planning, sales, management, organizational development, business communication, law, and international and intercultural relations.
