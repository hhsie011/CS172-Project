From competitive doctoral stipends to on-campus opportunities and federal financial aid, types of funding available to MCGS students include: Related Links Graduate Cost of Attendance Graduate Financial Aid Departmental Aid Federal Financial Aid On-Campus Opportunities Departmental Aid Academic Awards Academic awards are available through the Graduate School to ensure that outstanding, academically qualified students have financial support while they work toward their degrees. Stipends and scholarships are offered in the form of: Graduate Assistantships Research Assistantships Teaching Assistantships Teaching Fellowships University Fellowships Tuition Scholarships Awards vary by discipline in both nature and size and awards are generally made at the time of admission. A complete admission application serves as your Department Financial Aid application; there is no separate application for Department Aid. The scholastic requirements for obtaining these stipend awards are necessarily more exacting than those for simply securing admission to the Graduate School. These awards are usually renewable given satisfactory performance. The amounts of the awards and the number of years for which they are renewable may vary by department. Graduate students may not receive University financial aid (stipends and/or tuition scholarships) from two schools or departments simultaneously. If awarded, recipients will be notified as part of their official MCGS admissions correspondence. Research Grants Research grants obtained under University auspices by members of the faculty represent another source of financial assistance for graduate students. The availability of such grant funds change from year-to-year and vary markedly among the academic disciplines, with the natural sciences being by far the largest beneficiary. Students are routinely considered by the principal investigator for financial assistance those funds afford. Federal Financial Aid The Office of Student Services is responsible for administering and awarding all need-based federal financial aid opportunities. Please review their comprehensive website for information and deadlines. For information on financial aid terms and conditions, disbursement, loan repayment, continued eligibility for aid programs, and rights and responsibilities, please visit Student Services’ contact information and the graduate financial aid representatives noted therein. On-Campus Opportunities Boston College academic offices and departments offer a number of positions varying in duties and compensation, ranging from hourly payment to semester stipends and tuition reimbursement. Openings are posted when available, with most listings added over the summer months and closer to the start of each academic year.
