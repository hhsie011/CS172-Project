TU’s program analyzes how contemporary and historical dynamics impact women and men while exploring ways in which they seek equality. TU’s interdisciplinary curriculum requirements provide students with analytical frameworks and methodological tools to understand life experiences, human interactions, and economic and social institutions. By promoting awareness and knowledge of status-based oppression, interrelationships and ways in which historical civil rights movements have struggled for equality, TU seeks to change attitudes and practices that silence voices or devalue people’s choices and life experiences. Students may major or minor in women’s and gender studies or pursue a dual bachelor of arts/master of arts degree. All students must complete the Henry Kendall College of Arts and Sciences core and general curriculum standards. Those who major in the program are required to complete at least 30 hours of coursework, 6 hours of women’s and gender studies classes and 24 hours of electives, followed by a capstone senior project. The minor includes 12 hours of program-related courses. STUDENT OUTCOMES Many women’s organizations hire experts in women’s and gender studies; and professionals in law, medicine, social work, teaching and counseling seek expertise in gender issues. Recent graduates have pursued jobs in diverse career settings such as AmeriCorps, Teach for America, Girl Scouts of Eastern Oklahoma, Counseling & Recovery Services of Oklahoma, U.S. Marine Corps and Tulsa Family & Children’s Services. Program Objectives Students will: 1. Understand and analyze different ways in which genders and sexualities impact individuals and societies. 2. Analyze and evaluate facts and ethical positions regarding real-world women’s issues in local and global contexts. 3. Analyze and evaluate feminist, gender, and sexuality theories, and apply them to historical and contemporary texts and situations. 4. Write and communicate effectively in styles appropriate to the program’s participating disciplines. Degree Options Women’s and Gender Studies, B.A. Interdisciplinary program considers how gender and other factors, such as race, class, culture, sexuality, and age, have worked to shape the life experiences. Women’s and Gender Studies Minor Non-majors interested in learning more about women’s and gender studies are encouraged to add it to their degree program as a minor.
