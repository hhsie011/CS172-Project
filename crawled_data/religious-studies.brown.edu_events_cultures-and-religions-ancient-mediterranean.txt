Brooke Anderson Lecture Past Events Cultures and Religions of the Ancient Mediterranean The Brown University seminar on Cultures and Religions of the Ancient Mediterranean (CRAM) serves as a gathering to promote high-level, interdisciplinary dialogue among faculty and graduate students who deal with religion and culture in the ancient Mediterranean basin and west Asia in the broadest terms. CRAM meets monthly during the academic year. Each meeting lasts about an hour, and typically is centered on a pre-circulated paper by one of our participants. We are especially interested in work in progress; CRAM is a great context for working on new ideas and thinking through new problems. CRAM is administerd by the Program in Early Cultures. For details or questions, please contact Susan Harvey, Director of the Program in Early Cultures. Below is the CRAM schedule for the 2018-2019 academic year. Please note, all events except for the September 13 meeting, will take place on a Tuesday. All meetings take place 12:00-1:00p.m. at the Joukowsky Institute, RI Hall, Room 008. Papers will be emailed out approximately two weeks ahead of the date indicated. If you have difficulties accessing the upcoming paper, please contact Sara Wintz. Light luncheon fare will be provided! Please come and enjoy! Newcomers are always welcome. For the most up to date information, including a list of dates and presenters, please visit the Program in Early Cultures website.
