The minor in sustainability at Iowa State University is available to any ISU student who wants to further learn about sustainability issues affecting humans today and in the future. The interdisciplinary minor in sustainability exposes students to ideas and issues related to a sustainable, balanced and ethical future for the planet and its inhabitants. The minor is at the interplay between environmental, social and economic factors in improving the quality of human life within the capacity of supporting ecosystems. The minor will help students understand the dynamics of biological population growth and decline in the natural world, predator-prey models, over-exploitation of natural resources, energy balances, and much more. Students also will study how human behavior affects the natural world and the ability of earth to sustain life and understand how the decisions they make as consumers, workers, resource owners, citizens and policymakers affect human welfare in this and future generations. Student Learning Outcomes As a result of their coursework for the sustainability program students will be able to: articulate why some environmental, social and economic profiles are sustainable and others are not. apply sustainable practices in their personal and professional lives. The colleges of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Design, Engineering, and Liberal Arts and Sciences sponsor the minor in sustainability.
