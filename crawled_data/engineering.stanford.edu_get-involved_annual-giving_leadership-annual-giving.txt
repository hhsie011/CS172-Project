Main navigation Skip to main content Secondary Navigation Welcome Engineering Alumni Support Engineering Why Give Funding Initiatives Engineering Fund Planned Giving How to Make Your Gift Development Contacts Industry Collaborations Main content start Donors to the Engineering Fund play a vital role in enabling our faculty and students to seize opportunities and pivot their work toward emerging problems. Annual giving Your generosity matters Gifts of all sizes have an essential role in providing the flexible resources that enable Stanford Engineering to stay at the forefront of research and education. Most gifts to the Engineering Fund are less than $1,000, but together they have a powerful and immediate impact on the student experience and work of faculty. Make a gift Giving at leadership levels Play a special role Each year, Stanford Engineering relies on a small but vital group of donors whose contributions at the leadership level represent almost half of all unrestricted dollars raised each year. Their gifts allow us to direct significant resources where and when they are most needed, providing us with the flexibility we need to tackle the most complex problems of our day. There are three levels of leadership giving: Terman Circle: $25,000+ | Dean’s Circle: Starts at $10,000 | Leadership Circle: Starts at $1,000 Alumni who have graduated within the past 10 years are recognized at these levels for gifts of $12,500, $5,000 and $500, respectively. Help us solve the world's challenges Matching gifts Magnify your impact Many employers sponsor matching gift programs and will match any charitable contributions or volunteer hours made by their employees. Find a matching program Why giving matters “It is indeed my pleasure and my duty to give back to Stanford. The school has played a major role in shaping my career and I attribute a significant part of my success to the training I received at Stanford. My gift, although not very large, is one way for me to say ‘Thank you, Stanford.’ ” -Dhruv Agarwala, MS ’94, Materials Science and Engineering Gifts to the Engineering Fund Where your gifts go Big ideas and innovative approaches are at the core of everything we do. From COVID-19 prevention, detection, and treatment to self-charging electric cars and artificial intelligence, your gift to the Engineering Fund lets us take on the challenges of the 21st century. Your support is an investment in outstanding faculty and students, programs that foster intellectual curiosity and shape future leaders, and in cutting-edge facilities that enable some of the most innovative work in the world.
