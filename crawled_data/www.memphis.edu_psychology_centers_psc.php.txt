Our mission includes: Providing affordable outpatient services. We use a sliding scale for therapy services and offer low-cost evaluations to individuals and families. Training graduate students to become competent psychologists. Our students are closely trained and supervised by licensed psychologists with doctoral degrees. Promoting research. We support research projects that investigate how psychological services help the community. Because we are a training clinic, hundreds of individuals and families who could not otherwise afford psychological assistance receive quality services at a reduced fee every year. In-Person and Telehealth Appointments Therapists have been providing services through telehealth during the pandemic. Telehealth has facilitated access to some services, and it also has been a barrier for some individuals. The PSC will start slowly opening its doors to in-person services observing best practices. Beginning September 7, 2021, the PSC will offer in-person services and will continue to provide telehealth. Our therapists, examiners, and supervisors will evaluate the type of service that can best fit clients’ needs while observing safety practices. Therapy Services Individual Therapy The PSC provides interventions to help children, adolescents, and adults dealing with interpersonal difficulties, grief, stress, depression, anxiety, trauma, and other mental health symptoms. Family Therapy The PSC provides interventions to families and couples struggling with communication, structure, and conflicts within the family or relationship. Behavioral Health The PSC provides interventions to change unhelpful habits. We provide treatment for those who want to quit smoking, other substances, and gambling. We also provide treatment to manage weight, sleep problems, and chronic pain. Behavioral Consultation The PSC provides brief parent consultation to assess a specific behavioral concern (e.g., sleep problems, toileting, tantrums, noncompliance, etc.) to develop a behavior plan. Academic Evaluations and Support Academic Interventions The PSC provides a brief assessment for specific academic concerns (e.g., reading fluency, sight word recognition, math fact fluency, etc.) to determine the most effective intervention for the individual, which can then be implemented at home. Comprehensive Evaluations The PSC conducts assessments for a variety of academic disabilities (e.g., dyslexia, dyscalculia, and/or dysgraphia) and neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, intellectual disability). Optional Evaluations The PSC conducts assessments of one or two academic areas (i.e., reading, math, or written expression) or an IQ test to determine eligibility for enrollment to an optional school in Shelby County Schools. For further information or to request services, please call us at 901.678.2147. Fees for Services Therapy session fees are based on the total family income of the client. University of Memphis students enrolled at least part time and University of Memphis faculty receive a discount for therapy services. Evaluation fees are based on low-cost flat fees according to the type of evaluation needed. Because the PSC uses a sliding scale and flat fee for assessments, we do not bill insurance companies.
