Research Interests Dr. Opperman’s research focuses on understanding the developmental mechanisms regulating craniofacial bone development and growth, and in developing bone substitutes and bone distraction devices. Dr. Opperman’s expanded research program addresses the issues surrounding bone repair, fracture healing and bone augmentation, all major issues related to surgical repair of craniofacial bone anomalies in children, but also relevant to bone repair and bone augmentation procedures required as a result of trauma, or as a necessity for providing optimal dental reconstruction. Dr. Opperman has an active sponsored research program testing novel dental materials and optimizing implantable dental devices. She has developed and tested novel bone transport distraction osteogenesis devices and her start-up company holds three U.S. patents for devices pertaining to bone reconstruction. She has published over 100 peer-reviewed scientific papers and has an h-index of 38. Dr. Opperman is currently a member of the Association of Anatomy, Cell Biology and Neurobiology Chairpersons Nominations Committee, a site visitor for the Commission on Dental Accreditation, a member of the Biomedical Engineering Society Affiliations Committee, and a member of the Federative International Programme for Anatomical Terminology Orobiology Committee of the International Federation of Anatomical Associations. Dr. Opperman has served as President of the American Association of Anatomists; President of the Craniofacial Group of the International Association for Dental Research and President of the Biomaterials Interest Group of Dallas-Fort Worth (BIG-DFW). She is a Fellow of the American Association of Anatomists, and an honorary member of Omicron Kappa Upsilon. Dr. Opperman is or has served as a member of the editorial boards of Developmental Dynamics, Frontiers in Craniofacial Biology, the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research, Experimental Biology and Medicine, and on the scientific advisory board of the Journal of Endodontics. In addition to her national and international service commitments, Dr. Opperman has served multiple terms as Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Texas A&M Health Science Center Faculty Senate.
