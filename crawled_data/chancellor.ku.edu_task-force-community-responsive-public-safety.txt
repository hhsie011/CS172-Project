The task force comprised students, faculty and staff and was chaired by Distinguished Professor Charles Epp. In October 2020, the task force published a preliminary report and recommendations and invited the KU community to provide feedback. On Nov. 10, the task force shared its final report and recommendations with Chancellor Girod for review. On May 24, 2021, Chancellor Girod announced that the university would be implementing all of the task force's recommendations and provided a point-by-point summary addressing each recommendation. The Chancellor has committed to regularly reviewing progress on the implementation of task force recommendations and providing updates to the community as needed. That group will comprise the university’s chief of police, vice provost for student affairs, vice provost for operations, associate vice chancellor for public affairs, chancellor’s chief of staff, and chair of the task force.
