Through educational programs and training, it continues to expand its role and competencies. Yet challenges such as overcrowded and understaffed healthcare facilities minimize opportunities for a quality learning environment for nursing students. Columbia Global Centers | Mumbai invites you to a symposium to address the use of technology in nursing education and probe advances in simulation-based learning to skill nurses more effectively. The workshop will discuss how such technology-based and experiential education methodologies can contribute to the preparation of a new workforce and reduce the burden on traditional nursing education systems. Professor Jennifer Dohrn and Professor Kellie Bryant from the Columbia School of Nursing will present on cutting edge technology-based learning tools, including those at Columbia University’s Simulation Center that houses state of the art facilities and serves as a hub for simulation-based medical training. Simulation-based education is increasingly being recognized as an effective nursing education modality that can enhance key competencies by replicating clinical scenarios and allowing students to gain hands-on experience, bringing theory to life. Participating nursing schools will be invited to present on their institution’s use of technology into curricula and practice and the challenges they face. The goal of the symposium is to share knowledge and form a network of professionals working on improving nursing education. This workshop is by invitation only.
