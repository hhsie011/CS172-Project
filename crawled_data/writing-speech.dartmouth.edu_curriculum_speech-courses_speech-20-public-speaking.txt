Building on ancient rhetorical canons while recognizing unique challenges of contemporary public speaking, the course guides students through topic selection, organization, language, and delivery. Working independently and with peer groups, students will be actively involved in every step of the process of public speaking preparation and execution. Assignments include formal speeches (to inform, to persuade, and to pay tribute), brief extemporaneous speeches, speech analyses, and evaluations. No prerequisites. Limited enrollment. Instructors: Compton, Drummond, Grushina. Distributive: ART Offered: 21F: 9L, 2A; 22W: 2A; 22S: 10A, 2A; 22F, 23W: 2A; 23S: 10A, 2A. To view the ORC description, follow this link: Speech 20 In this course, we’ll discover answers to a seemingly simple question: What is good public speaking? We will discover answers to this question using a number of strategies. We will consult ancient canons of rhetoric. We will talk about contemporary findings of social scientific and rhetorical scholarship. We will also discover what constitutes good public speaking by practicing public speaking. We will try some techniques and strategies, see what works, learn what doesn’t, and then try again. We will consider challenges of selecting and refining topics, organizing arguments, supporting positions, and delivering speeches of impact. Perhaps most importantly, I’ll help you to find your unique voice, preserve what’s effective, improve what’s lacking, and become a more successful speaker. There will be two longer speeches in the course, several brief speeches, written activities, peer evaluations, and class discussions/activities. You’ll be asked to post entries to our class blog on Blackboard, and you will also keep a Blackboard-based journal during the term to help monitor your progress in public speaking. You will have experience speaking extemporaneously and from manuscript. The challenges of this course are demanding yet motivating: How do we transform our ideas into clear and convincing speeches? How do we craft and deliver messages that matter? How do we not only answer, but also demonstrate an answer, to the fundamental question of this course: What is good public speaking? Course Goals The overriding goal of the course is for you to become a better public speaker, with improved skills in researching, organizing, developing, and delivering speeches. To achieve this goal, we will aim for two primary learning objectives: to become better speakers through the practice of public speaking; to help others to become better speakers through observation, collaboration, and constructive criticism. To meet these primary objectives, I will help you to: apply ancient rhetorical principles to contemporary public speaking contexts; approach each stage of speechmaking with a mindfulness of audience and situation; select and refine speech topics and theses; evaluate and implement organizational strategies and craft transitions that guide audience understanding; use wording that is clear, concise, accurate, and interesting; enhance skills of memory and familiarity; practice delivery that aids in audience understanding and elicits and maintains audience interest; create and apply criteria of good public speaking; improve critical listening skills; create, prepare, and deliver public speeches; consider ethics of public speaking; develop a deeper understanding of speech as more than a way of showing what we know.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Institute for Writing and Rhetoric Philosophy & Aims About Writing at Dartmouth Speech at Dartmouth Our Stories The Story of Writing Instruction at Dartmouth The Story of Speech at Dartmouth The Story of Writing Support at Dartmouth Curriculum Overview Writing Courses Writing 2-3 WRIT 5 First-Year Seminars Humanities 1-2 Speech Courses Speech 20 Speech 25 Speech 26 Speech 27 Speech 30 Speech 31 Speech 33 Speech 34 Speech 36 Speech 37 Speech 40 Placement and Enrollment Policies First-Year Writing & First-Year Seminar Requirements Differences Among First-Year Writing Courses FAQ Directed Self-Placement Process for Writing Registration for Writing 5 or Writing 2-3 Registration for First Year Seminars FAQ First-year Writing Registration First-year Writing Choices Prizes Writing Prize Winners Speech Contest Winners Speech Contest Call for Entries Learning Overview Writing Center Make an Appointment Materials Sources and Citations at Dartmouth Teaching Overview Guidelines Teaching Writing in the First Year Expectations for Writing 2-3 Expectations for Writing 5 Teaching the First-Year Seminar First-Year Writing: Pedagogies, Methods, & Design Active Learning in the First-Year Writing Classroom Syllabus and Assignment Design Teaching Writing as Process Integrating Reading and Writing Diagnosing and Responding to Student Writing Conducting Writing Workshops Collaborative Learning/Learning with Peers Teaching Argument Teaching Research Addressing Grammar Useful links Support The Writing Assistant Program Research Past Research Activities Research Overview Multilingual Overview Support for Undergraduate Students Support for Graduate Students Faculty Support News & People People News Employment Upcoming Events Past Events My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
