Scholarships available starting 2022-2023 We take seriously the reality that children learn differently, so our teacher preparation students learn to develop lessons, teaching strategies, and assessment of student learning that accommodate those differences so that children can access the curriculum and show their knowledge in different ways. T&L is committed to developing knowledgeable, innovative, thoughtful, caring, and professional educators and leaders who welcome the challenges of figuring out how to meet each individual child’s needs. The hours that our preparation program students spend in practicum work in the schools exceeds state standards by well over 100%. Students feel well prepared for student teaching and their first job, often expressing excitement about having their own classrooms in which to put theory into practice, be innovative, thoughtful, caring, and in which to raise expectations for all learners. Our faculty are prominent leaders in their fields, continually writing and doing research, and bringing the latest findings in the field into the university classroom. Many are active in creating innovative and inclusive learning environments in local urban settings.
