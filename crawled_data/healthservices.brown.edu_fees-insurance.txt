This fee covers all services provided in person and through telehealth by the medical providers at Health Services, therapists and psychiatrists at Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), and by the staff at BWell Health Promotion. There are also benefits such as 24-hours-a-day, 7-days-week nursing advice, on-call physicians, and CAPS after-hours services. Don't hesitate to call - most services are covered by the Health Services fee that you've already paid, regardless of your insurance. Information About the 2021-2022 Health Fee Back to Top The first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in Rhode Island February 29th, two weeks before the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. For the entire year of 2020, the Health and Wellness staff have been diligently working to ensure continuity of safe and accessible healthcare for all of our students. This healthcare, along with other Health and Wellness Services, are and will continue to be available whether a student chooses to be here in person or study remotely. Health Services never closed their doors. We, along with other Health and Wellness departments continued to care for our students in person and/or via telehealth. Health and Wellness clinical and administrative staff also continue to be actively involved in many planning committees across the University that aim to enhance student health and wellbeing. Their clinical and professional expertise is a significant contribution to Healthy Brown 2020-2021 for all degree-seeking students. As indicated on the Bursar and Health Services websites, students studying remotely are not eligible for a waiver of the Health Services. Waivers of the Health Fee are only available to students who meet one of the following criteria listed below: Non-degree candidates other than guest students from other institutions; University regular employees; special students; faculty; and faculty/staff spouses with tuition benefits. We hope this information is helpful and you now understand how much is included within the health fee that will benefit you and your health and wellness during your remote studies along with the safety of the entire Brown Community. We hope you and your family are staying safe in this unpredictable time.

Health Insurance Back to Top In addition to the mandatory health fee, all students are required to have health insurance, either through a plan offered by the university or through a comparable health insurance plan. The health insurance can be waived if a student has comparable coverage through parental, personal, or spousal health insurance. The insurance is designed to cover services not covered by the health fee, such as offsite labs, pharmacy, consultant visits, and hospitalizations, etc. All students at Brown are charged for the Brown Sponsored Student Insurance Plan (SHIP). This may be waived if you are covered by a comparable plan. Any questions may be directed to studenthealthinsuranceplan@brown.edu. Insurance Card Be prepared when you come to Brown and know who your health insurance company is. Bring your insurance card, or a copy, each time you come for health care and keep Health Services up to date with any changes in your coverage. Prescription Plan Card Some students may also have an insurance prescription plan. Generally, this is a separate card from your insurance and you will want to bring the card or a copy of the front and the back of the card. Present the information to the pharmacy prior to having your prescription filled.
