The Department of Physics at UW educates students at all levels from general education, through preparation for teaching and scientific careers, to doctoral and post-doctoral education. The department welcomes and encourages the involvement of undergraduates in research. This program of study leads to the following credentials: Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Physics: Applied Physics Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Physics: Biophysics Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Physics: Comprehensive Physics Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Physics: Teacher Preparation Admission Requirements Completion of PHYS 121 (or PHYS 141), PHYS 122 (or PHYS 142), PHYS 123 (or PHYS 143); and MATH 124, MATH 125, MATH 126 (or MATH 134, MATH 135, MATH 136). Enrollment in minimum one physics lecture course with course number higher than 220 during the application quarter. Completion of minimum one physics lecture course (any course number, either at UW or elsewhere) within the two quarters prior to application. Standard admission is twice a year. Application deadlines: third Friday of autumn quarter and third Friday of spring quarter. Winter quarter transfer admission: Students transferring to the UW in autumn or winter quarter may also apply the third Friday of winter quarter. Meeting minimum requirements does not guarantee admission. Admission is capacity constrained, based on holistic review of a student's record as follows: Personal statement which should discuss reasons for choosing a physics major and strategies for success in the major, including discussion of lessons learned from previous successes and difficulties and plans for accessing support in the major. The statement should also address how the chosen degree option (applied, comprehensive, biophysics, teaching) and submitted graduation plan (see 4.c.) are suited to life and career goals. In cases of extenuating circumstances, a personal statement may also include a petition for waiver of one of the stated minimum requirements. Academic performance as measured by GPA; grades in courses required for admission; difficulty of other courses completed; frequency of incompletes, repeated courses, and withdrawals; relevant work and life experience. Graduation plan completed in MyPlan and printed to a pdf file, submitted with the application. Preapproval of graduation plan by Physics Student Services is recommended; incoming majors must have their Graduation Plan approved no later than six weeks after acceptance into the major to avoid having a hold placed on registration. See department website for a description of degree requirements for the four physics degree options, sample graduation plans, and suggestions of topics to include in a personal statement. Successful applicants typically have over a minimum 2.60 cumulative GPA in physics and math courses, especially those taken recently. Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Physics: Applied Physics Credential Overview The Applied Physics degree option is aimed at students who plan to enter a technical job with their physics B.S. or pursue a masters degree in engineering or data science after a grounding in physics. The Applied option replaces some of the more mathematically-based required classes of the Comprehensive option with additional laboratory and computer programming requirements, and allows for breadth via selected introductory science and/or advanced laboratory classes as allowed electives. This is an excellent option for students interested in engineering or computers, but who seek a deeper understanding of the underlying phenomena and who prefer not to specialize in a particular branch of engineering at the undergraduate level.
