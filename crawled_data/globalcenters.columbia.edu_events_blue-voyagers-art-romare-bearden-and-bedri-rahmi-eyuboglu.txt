Background information about the exhibition “Romare Bearden: A Black Odyssey,” curated by Dr. Robert G. O'Meally, Zora Neale Hurston Professor of English and Comparative Literature, first opened at Columbia’s Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Art Gallery in November 2014, accompanied by an exciting program of lectures and performances. In January 2015, an adaptation of the exhibition was shown at the Paris Center, featuring works by Henri Mattise. Along with works from Romare Bearden's "A Black Oddyssey," the exhibition in Istanbul will feature works by the Turkish modernist Bedri Rahmi Eyüboğlu, (who, like Bearden) was instrumental in blending modern Western aesthetics with Anatolian themes. Focusing on journey as a central theme in their works, both Bearden and Eyüboğlu envisioned a "global odyssey" as a search for a new home that used the legacies of the ancient Greek civilization as a common point of reference. What brings Bearden and Eyüboğlu together? Born in 1911, both artists were strongly influenced by the works of Matisse and Picasso. They were both in Paris during the 1950s. While Eyüboğlu was in search for Anatolian identity as part of Blue Anatolianism (Mavi Anadoluculuk) a humanist school of thought, Bearden was re-thinking African American identity in reference to ancient Greek civilization. They were both literary figures and artists, simultaneously using various mediums of artistic and literary expression. Both artists were strongly influenced by improvised music, Bedri Rahmi fascination with Aşık Veysel, and mystic bards, whereas Bearden strongly influenced by jazz. The works that will be displayed The exhibition will feature Bearden’s A Black Odyysey silk screens alongside by Bedri Rahmi Eyüboğlu’s remarkable works from Eyüboğlu Family collection. Some of the works include; Bedri Rahmi Eyüboğlu: Torun, Seni Düşünürken, Baltabaş Kemnçeci, Kağnı, Ana ve Çoban, Aşık Veysel, Saz Çalan ve Yavuz Geliyor Yavuz Romare Bearden: Sirens' Song, Sea Nymp, The Fall of Troy, Odyssey Leaves Nausicaa, Home to Ithaca, Cattle of the Sun God Upcoming Events Columbia Global CentersAmman / Beijing / Istanbul / Mumbai / Nairobi / Paris / Rio / Santiago / Tunis Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
