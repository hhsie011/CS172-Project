Engineering Overview Courses Undergraduate Programs Graduate Programs Faculty The School of Electrical and Computer Engineering is highly recognized throughout the nation for its student-centered, laboratory intensive curriculum. It is a partner of choice for employers seeking well-educated, highly-motivated and uniquely creative college graduates dedicated to life-long learning. The School has devoted professors who serve, instruct and mentor undergraduate and graduate students pursuing Bachelor of Science (BS), Master of Engineering (MEng), Master of Science (MS), or Doctorate (PhD) degrees in electrical engineering (EE) or a BS degree in computer engineering (CpE). The Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering degree program (BSEE) and the Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering degree program (BSCpE) are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, www.abet.org/. Electrical engineers and computer engineers have been at the center of the technological revolution that has occurred over the past 100 years. Marvels such as the transistor, radio, telephone, television, internet, microprocessor, computer, tablet, radar system, motor, wind generator, GPS, smart phone, laser, microwave oven, electric car, pacemaker, antenna, and the flat panel display, to name only a handful, have resulted from the hard work and creative talents of electrical engineers and computer engineers. And since electricity and computers are essential in a modern society, the electrical engineer and the computer engineer will always be in high demand. Electrical engineering encompasses many exciting subdisciplines including energy systems, machines, power electronics, analog electronics, digital electronics, mixed-signal electronics, VLSI chips, instrumentation, sensors, signal processing, machine vision, artificial intelligence, communications, control systems, robotics, wireless devices, electromagnetic fields, photonics, embedded controllers, networking, software development, biomedical devices and computer architecture. The School encompasses all of these subdisciplines in its curriculum or research activities. Computer Engineering is a relatively young engineering discipline that combines a strong foundation of electrical engineering with elements of computer science, including hardware and software integration, and design. Computer engineering includes digital logic design, computer architecture, digital data communications, computer and sensor interfacing, microprocessors, digital control, VLSI circuits and systems, operating and software systems, and computer arithmetic. Beyond creating technology, electrical engineers and computer engineers of tomorrow must be aware of the social, economic, ethical and environmental impact of their respective technologies. They must also communicate effectively, possess excellent teamwork skills, and understand, perform and complete the process of engineering design. The undergraduate programs in electrical engineering and computer engineering at Oklahoma State University equip graduates with these critical skills.

Undergraduate Program and Student Learning Outcomes To support the aforementioned Program Educational Objectives, the School has established Student Learning Outcomes that are regularly assessed and expected of all students upon completion of their chosen program in Electrical Engineering or Computer Engineering. Attainment of the following outcomes prepares graduates to enter the professional practice of engineering: 1. an ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science and mathematics; 2. an ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental and economic factors; 3. an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences; 4. an ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental and societal contexts; 5. an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks and meet objectives; 6. an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions; 7. an ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies. The undergraduate electrical engineering and computer engineering programs at Oklahoma State University prepare each graduate for a life-long professional career. During the first two years of study, students complete a carefully designed set of lower-division courses in the areas of electrical engineering, computer engineering, computer science, mathematics, physics, chemistry, humanities, and social sciences. After successfully completing these courses, students enroll in both required and elective upper-division courses in electrical engineering and computer engineering. Electrical engineering and computer engineering students obtain fundamental knowledge and technical skills needed by tomorrow’s professionals. Students pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering are required prior to graduation to have taken a set of area courses in a single area in ECEN. These areas include a) control systems, digital signal processing, and communication systems, b) energy and power, c) computer systems and digital electronics, d) analog electronics, and e) microwaves and photonics. Students pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering are required to take specialized computer engineering courses dealing with microcontrollers, embedded controllers, robotics, computer architecture, discrete mathematics, digital logic design, networking, programming, coding, computing and digital electronics. Instructional laboratories are a central part of the undergraduate curriculum to provide opportunities for hands-on experience in areas such as microcomputers, digital logic design, electronics, networks, instrumentation, optics, real-time digital signal processing, communications and electromagnetics. These laboratories are located in the College of Engineering, Architecture and Technology’s new 70,000 ft2 teaching facility, Endeavor, and are equipped with state-of-the-art, industrial-grade equipment. Engineering design laboratories require students to solve open-ended, practical problems in a manner that demonstrate the students’ ability to apply fundamental concepts, creativity and imagination. These problems have several possible outcomes; students must choose an acceptable approach and demonstrate that the optimal outcome has been met. All electrical engineering and computer engineering students receive multiple engineering design experiences. The capstone design experience is a two-course sequence typically taken during the students’ last two semesters of the BS program. The capstone experience gives students an opportunity to apply and demonstrate the skills that they have developed throughout the program. These design courses integrate theory, analysis, simulation, design and experimental skills to achieve a specific design outcome. Teamwork, communication skills, and the complete engineering design process—from problem definition to prototype that includes both presentation and documentation—are emphasized. Student design teams receive individual project mentoring from an appropriate faculty member who provides project management advice and supervision. The capstone experience concludes with a formal public design demonstration, oral presentation and written report. Degree Programs and Options The School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECEN) offers a full range of undergraduate and graduate program choices that allow students to excel in their careers. Specifically, the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering offers five degrees: Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering (BSEE) Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering (BSCpE) Master of Engineering in Electrical Engineering (MEngEE, non-thesis) Master of Science in Electrical Engineering (MSEE, thesis) Doctor of Philosophy in Electrical Engineering (PhDEE) Bachelor of Science: This degree program is designed to provide fundamental scientific and mathematical knowledge needed for an engineering education and an entry-level engineering career. Broad-based and in-depth technical courses are provided to teach the fundamentals of the electrical engineering and computer engineering professions. The degree focuses on analysis and design methods, laboratory and simulation experiences, and theoretical and practical problems. Requirements: 124 credits hours (BSEE) and 125 credit hours (BSCpE). Master of Engineering: This degree program is tailored to students who wish to gain advanced knowledge and expertise in subject areas associated with their professional pursuits. This non-research, non-thesis instructional program is ideal for Distance Education students or for baccalaureate graduates interested in professional development. This program is available online. Requirements: 33 credit hours of coursework. Specific requirements for the MEngEE program are available on the web in the document entitled “Memorandum to Graduate Students”; see https://ece.okstate.edu/. Master of Science: This degree program is tailored to students who wish to gain advanced knowledge in subject areas associated with their professional pursuits. The program emphasizes research as part of the learning experience and culminates with the defense of a thesis. This program is ideal for students who wish to pursue a PhD. This program is available online. Requirements: 24 credit hours of coursework and 6 credit hours of thesis research. Specific requirements for the MSEE program are available on the web in the document entitled “Memorandum to Graduate Students;” see https://ece.okstate.edu/. Doctor of Philosophy: This degree program is tailored to students who desire to have a teaching and research career in academia or a research career in industry or government laboratories. This program is ideal for those students who have a passion to acquire in-depth knowledge. The program emphasizes the creation of new knowledge during the research process, the publication of that knowledge, and the defense of a dissertation. Requirements: 73 total credit hours beyond the BSEE/BSCpE degree. Specific requirements for the PhD program are available on the web in the document entitled “Memorandum to Graduate Students;” see https://ece.okstate.edu/. Options: Students are also given the option to combine degrees to take advantage of common courses between various degrees, thereby reducing the total number of credit hours relative to non-combining options. These combining options are highly attractive from a financial and career point of view. That is, these options are less expensive and take less time. Knowledge gained in these degree programs adds value to what the student can do once or while employed. The current combining options are: Dual BSEE and BSCpE degrees (137 credit hours) Joint “4+1” BSEE/BSCpE plus MEngEE degrees (148/149 credit hours) With effective planning, the dual BSEE and BSCpE program can be completed in four years by taking approximately 17 credit hours of courses each semester. It may take less time if students have Advanced Placement credit hours. This dual degree program allows a student to have a true comprehensive education across the electrical and computer engineering spectrum, thus preparing the student for just about any entry-level career in electrical engineering or computer engineering. The program effectively requires the completion of the BSCpE degree plus 12 additional credit hours in non-computer, electrical engineering courses. An advising sheet for the dual program is posted on the School’s web page; https://ece.okstate.edu/. This sheet has been devised to assure that the degree requirements for both the BSCpE and BSEE degrees are satisfied in the most expeditious manner. The “4+1” program—available only to OSU baccalaureate students—is a five-year accelerated program that combines the BSEE or BSCpE degree with the M.Eng.EE degree. It is designed to give students a broad-based undergraduate education in electrical engineering or computer engineering along with a highly in-depth graduate education in a few key areas. This program is ideal for those students who want advanced knowledge to enhance their competitiveness in the work force and to satisfy their longing for in-depth knowledge that cannot be obtained in the baccalaureate degrees. Specific requirements for the “4+1” program are available on the web in the document entitled “Memorandum to Graduate Students;” see https://ece.okstate.edu/. ECEN has submitted a new Option in Software Engineering as part of the Computer Engineering degree for approval in fall 2021. As the title suggests the option emphasizes software solutions in the context of computer engineering applications with a focus on the software-hardware interface. A total of 128 credit hours (i.e., 3 credit hours beyond the CpE degree) is required to complete this option. Of those 128 credit hours, 12 credit hours of software specific courses, as approved and listed by the School, must be completed. A degree in electrical engineering or computer engineering is an excellent foundation for other professional fields such as medicine and law. Many graduates also pursue advanced programs in business and management after earning a degree in engineering.

These graduate degree programs are flexible in course selection and emphasis. Both the Mater of Engineering and the Master of Science programs are available online. The Master of Engineering degree program is tailored to students who wish to gain advanced knowledge and expertise in subject areas associated with their professional pursuits. This non-research, non-thesis, instructional program is ideal for Distance Education students or for baccalaureate graduates interested in professional development to enhance their competitiveness in the workplace. It is well-suited for students who have little interest in a research-centric education. The Master of Science degree emphasizes advanced mathematics, theory, design and research. It is intended for students interested in cutting-edge careers or who want to prepare for advanced research associated with the PhD program. This degree combines coursework with research that allows students to expand their knowledge in an in-depth area of electrical engineering or computer engineering. The MSEE program culminates with the defense of a thesis. The Doctor of Philosophy degree is designed to prepare students for positions in academia, industry and government. This degree emphasizes the creation of new knowledge through the in-depth research process, as documented in the doctoral dissertation. The School of Electrical and Computer Engineering also offers a “4+1” degree program that combines the BSEE/BSCpE degree programs with the MEngEE degree program. The “4+1” program is only available to OSU baccalaureate students. It is designed to be completed in five years and to give students a broad-based undergraduate education in electrical engineering or computer engineering along with a highly in-depth graduate education in a few key areas. This program is ideal for those students who want advanced knowledge to enhance their competitiveness in the workforce and to satisfy their longing for in-depth knowledge that cannot be obtained in the baccalaureate degrees. Specific requirements for the “4+1” program are available on the web in the document entitled “Memorandum to Graduate Students;” see https://ece.okstate.edu/. Students typically select coursework and participate in research and design projects in the following areas: Communication systems, cybersecurity and networks Control systems, robotics and mechatronics Analog, mixed-signal and RF electronics Computer architecture, VLSI digital circuits and arithmetic Electromagnetics and THz sciences Microcontrollers and embedded control Photonics and electro-optics Digital signal, image and video processing Energy and power Bioengineering Admission Requirements Admission to the Graduate College, as described under “General Regulations” in the “Graduate College” section of the University Catalog is required. Graduation from an electrical engineering or computer engineering program accredited by the ABET is required for admission to the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. In addition, sufficient GRE scores are required for admission to the doctoral program in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Graduates from non-engineering fields such as mathematics, physics and computer science are also admitted to the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering graduate programs if an evaluation of the applicant’s official transcript indicates that the applicant is prepared to succeed in graduate-level course work in electrical and computer engineering, or can be expected to do so after a reasonable amount of remedial coursework has been completed. This condition also applies to graduates of unaccredited engineering programs and engineering technology programs. Degree Requirements The Master of Engineering degree in Electrical Engineering (MEngEE) is awarded to those students who successfully complete an approved plan of study. The degree requires 33 credit hours of coursework; a thesis is not required. The plan of study requires, at a minimum, 24 hours of 5000-level courses, covering four areas in electrical and computer engineering (designated by second digit of the course number). Most plans of study include additional 5000-level courses, depending upon the background and particular educational goals of the student. Additional remedial work in undergraduate electrical and computer engineering courses may be required for students who do not have a sufficient background in electrical engineering. Specific requirements for the MEngEE program are available on the web in the document entitled “Memorandum to Graduate Students;” see https://ece.okstate.edu/. The Master of Science degree in Electrical Engineering (MSEE) is awarded to those students who successfully complete an approved plan of study. The degree requires 24 credit hours of coursework plus 6 credit hours for the thesis. In addition to the thesis requirement, the plan of study requires, at a minimum, 21 hours of 5000-level courses in at least two areas in electrical and computer engineering (designated by second digit of the course number). Most plans of study include additional 5000-level courses, depending upon the background and particular educational goals of the student. Each student is encouraged to include courses in supporting disciplines such as mathematics, physics, computer science or other engineering fields. Additional remedial work in undergraduate electrical and computer engineering courses may be required for students who do not have a sufficient background in electrical engineering. Specific requirements for the MSEE program are available on the web in the document entitled “Memorandum to Graduate Students”; see https://ece.okstate.edu/. The Doctor of Philosophy (PhDEE) degree is granted to recognize high achievement in coursework selected from the broad field of electrical and computer engineering. The degree is conferred on those who demonstrate the ability to perform independent research in a chosen field of specialization that generates new knowledge, as presented in a dissertation. For this degree the Graduate College requires a minimum of 73 credit hours of acceptable academic work beyond the bachelor’s degree, including credit for the dissertation. Specific requirements for the PhD program are available on the web in the document entitled “Memorandum to Graduate Students;” see https://ece.okstate.edu/. The School of Electrical and Computer Engineering also participates in several interdisciplinary degree programs (See “Graduate Programs” under “Industrial Engineering and Management,” and “Telecommunications Management" the “Graduate College” section of the Catalog.).
