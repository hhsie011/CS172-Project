The space includes a common area and reservable workrooms, focus rooms, and a conference room. At the D. H. Hill Jr. Library, there is also a Faculty Research Commons and faculty can apply to use one of the research study rooms for an entire semester. These private rooms are located throughout the bookstacks. Visualization spaces The NC State University Libraries provides spaces for high-definition visualization, simulations, ideation, and innovation. These spaces accommodate various projection and display configurations; real-time video capture, broadcast, and collaboration, and offer new ways to approach public engagement with research. Dedicated videoconferencing spaces are available at the Hunt and Veterinary Medicine Libraries. Research data services We can provide assistance with data management planning, discovery and description, sharing, and preservation. Contact us at library_datamanagement@ncsu.edu to set up a consultation or request a workshop. Research assistance Librarians are available to support your research needs and answer questions. Contact us for one-on-one assistance with literature searching, citation management, measuring your research impact, or finding funding opportunities. The Librariesâ€™ Open Knowledge Center provides guidance on scholarly communication and copyright issues. Training and instructional support Do members of your research team need help formulating research strategies or locating needed information? Librarians can provide in-person or online instruction and can assist in developing learning tools for students to use independently. Research workshops are offered on a regular basis covering topics from literature review research to navigating subject specific databases.
