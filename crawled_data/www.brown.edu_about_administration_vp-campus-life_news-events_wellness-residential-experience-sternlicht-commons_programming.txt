With the support of a special partnership between BWell Health Promotion and Residential Life, residential students will cultivate an environment that empowers them to share their interests, explore areas of growth, and develop meaningful personal and interpersonal connections that support wellbeing practices. Students will engage in wellness interventions and demonstrate measured knowledge gain and behavior change in a community with shared governance. Together, the Health and Wellness departments and residence hall will serve as an innovative site for peer education, community building, collaboration, and outreach in ways that benefit the entire campus. Departmental Mission Statements BWell Health Promotion: BWell holistically supports the health and wellbeing of all Brown University students through individual and community level engagement that is evidence informed, rooted in social justice and recognizes the social determinants of health. Our work empowers students through knowledge and skill building to promote lifelong wellness and community care. Health & Wellness: Health & Wellness at Brown University holistically engages students in collaborative and compassionate care to support their self-discovery, intellectual growth, and lifelong wellbeing. Residential Life: The Office of Residential Life fosters a meaningful, holistic residential experience where students can experience a sense of belonging to the Brown community, practice and expand what they are learning in their course of study, be supported in the development of healthy practices, and gain the fullest benefit of the fellow students with whom they are being educated. Interventions/Programming Model: Professional and student staff in BWell Health Promotion and Residential Education will work directly with residential students to deliver programming and interventions that organically promotes students’ sharing of their strengths and pro-health practices with others, (e.g., teaching active listening, yoga, sleep hygiene). Mini-grant research projects will be available for cohorts of students to design and implement an intervention (typically workshops and programs) with the support and supervision of BWell Health Promotion and Residential Education staff. Each intervention will be grounded in health promotion program development best practices including clear objectives, evaluation measures, and the use of a co-learning model. This method supports and recognizes the resources that students already have, and showcases their pro-health behaviors and resiliency. This model enhances students’ experience and skills, and it builds community with tangible health behavior outcomes. Objectives/Goals: Professional and Student Staff Will: Facilitate relationships that allow for the co-learning of wellbeing practices Create opportunities for students to grow and develop Identify and articulate social wellness practices Through self-efficacy, encourage students to engage in wellness activities Foster relationships and communication across differences Promote and facilitate sustainable interventions that foster healthier individuals and communities Be a steward of the physical space and the mission of the program Student Residents Will: Express high levels of satisfaction with their overall experience of living in the residence hall Experience a meaningful sense of connection to community Demonstrate measured knowledge gain and behavior change in holistic wellness practices Partake in healthful living practices while striving for wholeness Increase self-confidence/esteem and self-image Foster fulfilling relationships and communicate across differences Be a steward of the physical space and the mission of the program Wellness Residential Experience at Sternlicht Commons Space Programming Housing Selection FAQs Housing Application Division of Campus Life Division of Campus Life Brown University Box 1896 20 Benevolent Street Providence, RI 02912 Phone: 401-863-1800 Email [email protected] Instagram Instagram Brown University Giving to Brown Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA 401-863-1000 Contact Us Maps Directions Career Opportunities Campus Safety Accessibility All Social Media © 2022 Brown University | Back to top
