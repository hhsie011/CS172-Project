Today, we remain committed to a pedagogy that considers the vanguard of change as moving-image media continue to evolve into the present. But we also explore what cinema has been historically as both an American and an international sociocultural phenomenon. Students in our program learn from a world-class faculty while living in one of the leading cities for film research and filmgoing. The MA in Film and Media Studies program and the undergraduate Film and Media Studies major give students a unique opportunity to study film history and theory in the midst of an active filmmaking community and a world capital of film culture.
