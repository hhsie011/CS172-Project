It also established procedures for adoption of BOG and university regulations. Useful Links Florida Board of Governors Website BOG Regulations Development Procedure Regulations versus Policies University Regulations are adopted by the Board of Trustees and are university-wide “laws”. Regulations must be consistent with federal and state law and BOG Regulation. Policies are adopted by the President or Vice Presidents under the specific executive authorities granted to the President by the FSU Board of Trustees. Policies generally involve more detailed matters of procedure and matters not specifically addressed in state law or BOG or FSU Regulation. FSU Policies may not conflict with State and Federal law, BOG Regulation or FSU Regulation.
