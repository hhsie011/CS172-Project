Masks reduce the risk of being infected and possibly spreading it to others. Read the latest CDC guidelines. You might choose to wear a mask regardless of the level of transmission if you have a weakened immune system or if, because of your age or an underlying medical condition, you are at increased risk for severe disease, or if a member of your household has a weakened immune system, is at increased risk for severe disease, or is unvaccinated. Under Oklahoma law (EO 2021-16 and 70 O.S. 1210.189), we are not permitted to require the use of masks in public spaces. These exceptions exist: Masks can be required in the classrooms — which are not considered public spaces while class is in session — for limited periods of time or following positive cases, on transit buses due to Department of Transportation requirements, and masks may be required in certain areas of University Health Services. COVID-19 can be spread when people are asymptomatic, which means they do not know they are sick yet. Wearing face coverings has been shown to reduce the spread of COVID-19 to others. It is important that OSU is a safe place to work and study, and taking this step creates a safe environment for all of us as advised by the CDC. As a reminder, face coverings do not replace the need to maintain social distancing, frequent handwashing, and rigorous cleaning and disinfecting routines. Help do your part to keep our campus community safe. Please adhere to the following guidelines for face coverings: Masks are encouraged in all indoor, public spaces on campus for faculty, staff and students The more effective N-95, KN-95 and surgical masks are preferred over single-layer cloth masks The face covering must not have an exhalation valve or introduce a hazard in the workplace (near any flammable liquids, for example). Information regarding face coverings is provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) It is encouraged that you wear a face covering at all times in hallways, classrooms, public spaces, restrooms, and other common areas across campus where social distancing is hard to maintain Face coverings are also recommended outdoors if safe social distancing is not possible Your face covering should meet the following criteria: fits snugly but comfortably against the side of the face completely covers the nose and mouth allows for breathing without restriction can be laundered and machine dried without damage or change to shape The face covering is primarily a protection for others near you to prevent you from unknowingly spreading the COVID-19 virus to others. Studies have shown that if everyone is wearing a mask and following other safety measures the spread of viruses is reduced Questions?
