Students may earn a Biology BA with a General Biology Option. The Biology BS degree can be earned with one of 5 options: Ecology Evolution and Conservation Biology (EEC), General Biology, Molecular Cellular and Developmental Biology (MCD), Physiology, and Plant Biology. Minors in Paleo Biology and Marine Biology are also part of the curriculum offered to Undergraduates. This program of study leads to the following credentials: Bachelor of Arts degree with a major in Biology Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Biology: Ecology, Evolution, and Conservation Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Biology: General Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Biology: Molecular, Cellular, and Development Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Biology: Physiology Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Biology: Plant Admission Requirements Admission is capacity constrained.

Two 300- or 400-level laboratory courses Back to Top Program of Study: Minor: Paleobiology Program Overview Paleobiology at UW, which began in 1907, has undergone significant expansion in recent years. The program now includes ten faculty with research interests ranging from the earliest evidence of life on Earth to the Permian-Triassic extinction, origin of mammals, mid-Cenozoic ‘greenhouse’ to ‘icehouse’ transition, and Neogene expansion of grasslands. We integrate new analytical approaches, such as stable isotope geochemistry and 3D visualization, with field explorations to Washington’s many locales as well as far-off sites in places like India, Antarctica, and Peru. On campus, the paleontological collections of the Burke Museum boast microfossils and invertebrate, plant, and vertebrate fossils from the Pacific Northwest and beyond. This program of study leads to the following credential: Minor in Paleobiology Minor in Paleobiology Completion Requirements Minimum 30 credits BIOL 354 Electives: Two from the paleobiology core content area and one from each of the three other content areas, selected from approved courses available on the paleobiology website.

Minimum 15 credits completed through the UW. Back to Top Additional Information Student Outcomes and Opportunities Learning Objectives and Expected Outcomes: The department graduates between 350 and 400 students each year. Biology degrees are applicable to many different fields, depending upon student interests. Students in the program gain analytical and laboratory skills that prepare them for entry-level positions in a variety of biologically related areas, including, but not limited to, biotechnology, laboratory and/or field research support, health science support, wildlife biology, and ecology and conservation work with a variety of agencies, consulting firms, and research organizations in the Northwest. Students may enter graduate programs that focus on some aspect of biological science (such as genetics, microbiology, immunology, ecology, environmental health, or cell and molecular biology), or enter a variety of professional programs, such as veterinary medicine, medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, laboratory medicine, and nursing. Instructional and Research Facilities: The Department of Biology occupies 128,000 square feet in Hitchcock, Johnson, and Kincaid Halls. Extensive research laboratories, teaching laboratories, computer workstations, and support services are found throughout the department. Specialized facilities include more than 16,000 square feet of greenhouse, seawater facilities, growth rooms, electron microscopes, and other specialized equipment. Undergraduates have access to most of these facilities, especially those engaged in undergraduate research. Off campus, the internationally recognized Marine Research Station, Friday Harbor Laboratories, provides many opportunities for undergraduates, from courses to research apprenticeships. Honors Options Available: With College Honors (Completion of Honors Core Curriculum and Departmental Honors); With Honors (Completion of Departmental Honors requirements in the major). See adviser for requirements. Research, Internships, and Service Learning: Biology faculty welcome undergraduates into their research programs, often working closely with them. Approximately 40 percent of the 900 undergraduate biology majors finish with undergraduate research experience. UW proximity to such Seattle area organizations as the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Swedish Hospital, numerous biotech companies, NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Research Center, the Seattle Aquarium, and the Woodland Park Zoo, as well as the close ties of Biology faculty to Friday Harbor Laboratories and the faculty in the College of the Environment provide opportunities for biology majors to develop internships within these organizations. See adviser for ways to get credit for such experiences. Department Scholarships: Several scholarships are available, in a few cases to biology majors only. Most of these support students wishing to pursue an undergraduate research experience. They are competitive, sometimes highly so. They include: Howard Hughes Undergraduate Research Internship: approximately 20 per year for freshmen and 20 per year for juniors and seniors. Friday Harbor Laboratory (FHL) Apprenticeships: $3,000 for one quarter, spring or autumn. Mary Gates Scholarships: very competitive, across all science disciplines. Herschel and Caryl Roman Scholarship: $2,500-$5,000 annually to one or two students who have an interest in genetics research. Porath/Johnson Endowed Scholarship: one-year, $5,000 scholarship to an outstanding biology major.
