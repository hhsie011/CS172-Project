March 29 - Payment Due Date* April 4 - Classes Begin *When currently enrolled students early register for an upcoming term, they are then billed approximately two weeks prior to the due date. Students registering after a certain point are on a rolling “register—bill—due” cycle. This means the due date will be determined by the date of registration. Financial Aid Verify financial aid and/or loans are properly reflected on your student account. If accepted loans have not been applied and you are registered for less than full time (8 hours or less), then you will need to contact the Student Financial Aid office to request the loan(s) be reset for less than full time enrollment. If necessary, review the Online Student Financial Aid Checklist and contact the Student Financial Aid office at 254-710-2611 with any questions.
