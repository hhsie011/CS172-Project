Executive Education Reunions Executive Education alumni who are marking their 2-year or any 5-year graduation milestone from an alumni-status granting program (i.e., AMP, CSERP, GMP, ISMP, OPM, PGL, PLDA, PMD, SELP, SEPME, SEPSA, TGMP) are invited to participate in HBS Reunions. See which cohorts are invited back for Reunion Celebration 2022 and Fall Reunion 2022. Volunteers → Reunions simply aren’t possible without a team of diverse classmates helping to make them happen. Just a few hours of your time can help ensure that you and your classmates have a memorable reunion. There are two ways to help out: you can plan class and section events or encourage your classmates to invest in the future of HBS by fundraising for your class gift. In alignment with the School’s commitment to advancing racial equity, we are actively seeking program volunteers and fundraising volunteers from different backgrounds and perspectives and encourage you to get involved today! Reunion Liaisons Reunion Liaisons work closely with programming volunteers to coordinate details of your visit back to campus, and around all class-specific events, to ensure that the weekend runs smoothly. If you have questions about the reunion or would like to volunteer on the committee, please contact: Reunion Office, 617.495.6890 Development Liaisons Development Liaisons work closely with fundraising volunteers, helping classes build a lasting legacy at HBS through broad based class participation in reunion gift campaigns.
