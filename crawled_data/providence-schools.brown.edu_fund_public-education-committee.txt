Members also play a key role in guiding the direction of K-12 education initiatives at Brown and ensuring that Brown is optimizing its resources to support PPSD in the most effective ways possible.

Every three years the committee will conduct a review of the distribution of proceeds from the fund and oversee a survey on the same schedule that will provide an assessment of Brown’s K-12 education initiatives and their alignment with evolving PPSD priorities.
