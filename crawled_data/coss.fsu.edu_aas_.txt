Our program offers an interdepartmental and interdisciplinary approach to the study of ethnicity, identity, human relations, and cultural dynamics. The curriculum provides an intellectually powerful analysis of individual achievements, cultural phenomena and paradigms, institutional behaviors, global trends, and public discourse. The curriculum also focuses on educational and social policy issues. This site offers both information about our program and resource tools to aid individual exploration and research.
