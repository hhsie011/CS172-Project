The invitation-only tournament, now in its 12th year, pits the best advocates from 16 trial advocacy schools against one another in a head-to-head, winner-takes-all tournament, that will be held June 4-6 at Baylor Law. Top Gun is the flagship competition in Baylor Law’s ‘Triple Crown’ of intense intramural legal competitions, alongside The Closer, Baylor Law’s demanding, invitation-only transactional law competition, and ‘The Paper Chase,’ the most competitive legal writing contest in Texas. Unlike traditional mock trial competitions, participants do not get to prepare for the case prior to the start of the event. The 16 competitors are given a case file a mere 24 hours prior to the opening rounds. Given just one day, participants must review hundreds of pages of documents, focus on the most important facts of the case, and prepare for trial.
