This certificate allows students to integrate these areas into a cohesive experience and knowledge base in preparation for careers within a wide range of sport perspectives, including those of sports organizations, media outlets, athletes and brands, and connecting with audiences through sport. Given that Cincinnati offers a wide variety of opportunities for sport media and promotion from professional sports and events to high school sports and, of course, UC’s own athletic programs, there is ample opportunity for placement and utilization of this type of educational experience both locally and beyond.
