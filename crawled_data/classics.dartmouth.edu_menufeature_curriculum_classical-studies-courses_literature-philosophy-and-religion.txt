We also consider the relation of these plays to ritual, oratory, music, dance, and theatrical space. There will be practical workshop opportunities for those interested. CLST 3 Reason and the Good Life: Socrates to Epictetus An introduction to philosophical thought in antiquity, especially that of Socrates, Epicurus, and the Stoics. We will concentrate especially on ethical questions; e.g. what kind of life is best for humans to pursue, how thoughtful persons should weigh the potentially competing claims of reason, pleasure, and emotion; and on how intellectual activity was perceived at Athens and at Rome. TMV, W CLST 4 Classical Mythology An introduction to Greek myths and their use and transformation in ancient Greek and Latin literature. Lectures will regularly incorporate material culture, history, and contemporary scholarship to contextualize the readings. We will also examine how these myths shape and express identities in both ancient and modern settings. TMV, CI CLST 5 The Heroic Vision: Epics of Greece and Rome Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, Vergil's Aeneid, and Ovid's Metamorphoses will be studied in their entirety, together with the Argonautica of Apollonius of Rhodes and extensive selections from Lucretius' De Rerum Natura. Emphasis will be placed on the historical and cultural contexts in which the poems were produced and on how each poet uses the works of his predecessors to define his own place in the epic tradition. CLST 10.03 Mind, Heart, Brain What physical substances and/or bodily organs give rise to sense-perception, self-movement, and self-awareness? How it is that human beings are capable of concept-formation, reasoning, memory, and emotion, and to what extent are these capacities present in other animals? Does the mind have its own forms of illness, and are there ways to treat such illnesses? Students work collaboratively to analyze these and related issues in a range of philosophical, scientific, and medical texts. CLST 10.13 New Testament Studies the collection of Christian texts now called the "New Testament" for the insights they provide into the complex cultural interactions in the first-century Mediterranean world. Three primary texts, the Gospel of Mark, Paul's letter to the Colossians, and Paul's letter to James, will be examined in light of their original Jewish context and their embeddedness in Greek thought and Roman socio-political structures. This small-enrollment class is taught conjointly with GRK 29, but with assignments and assessment appropriate for students reading entirely in English. CLST 10.16 Ancient Medicine This course will explore the Greek and Roman origins of medicine in the West. We will analyze how disease came to be understood as a natural phenomenon, and we will examine the different procedures, philosophies, and social roles of doctors in the ancient world.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Classics Curriculum Overview Course Offerings by Term Fall 2021 Winter 2022 Spring 2022 Summer 2022 Fall 2022 Winter 2023 Spring 2023 2023-24 Classical Studies Courses Entry points for Classical Studies Literature, Philosophy, Religion Ancient History Classical Archaeology Language Study -- Latin Latin Classes Placement in Latin Language Study -- Ancient Greek Courses in Ancient Greek Placement in Ancient Greek Majors and Minors Classical Studies track Ancient History track Classical Archaeology track Classical Languages and Literature track Culminating Experience Foreign Study NEW Classics FSP in Spring 2022 Greece Foreign Study Program Rome Foreign Study Program Projects & Awards Classics-Related Projects and Awards Student Research Archaeological Fieldwork Reid/Wiencke Funding for Research Senior Honors Projects Awards & Prizes Faculty Media Projects Annual Lecture Programs Faculty Books Inclusivity News & Events People Our graduates Graduating with a Classics Degree Alumni Support Tell Us Your Story Alumni Stories My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
