The 160,000 sq. ft. ECSC building opened its doors for business just as the spring term got underway. It will be shared by the CS Department, Thayer School of Engineering, and the Magnuson Center for Entrepreneurship. Department Chair Devin Balkcom is delighted to welcome CS students, staff and faculty to the new premises -- "It has been wonderful to welcome Spring in the new ECSC building. Students and faculty are starting to come together in the new labs and social spaces to talk about their plans, their research, and their classes. It is so nice to see all of you again in person, and to be reminded of the value and strength of our community. Over the coming months, we'll start to have events in the building: speakers, social events, and other chances to get together and celebrate our community. Thanks to everyone who has made this new intellectual environment possible: the donors, the designers, the builders, the planners who came together to make it happen. I hope to see you in ECSC soon!" Here are some snapshots from the first day of classes. 20220328_ecsc_eb_411.jpg Professor Lorie Loeb meets with her teaching assistants (Photo by Eli Burakian '00) 20220328_ecsc_eb_232.jpg (Photo by Eli Burakian '00) 20220328_ecsc_eb_181.jpg (Photo by Eli Burakian '00) 20220328_ecsc_eb_285.jpg (Photo by Eli Burakian '00) 20220328_ecsc_eb_222.jpg (Photo by Eli Burakian '00) 20220328_ecsc_eb_403.jpg (Photo by Eli Burakian '00) Tags: faculty , students , undergraduate students Departments African and African American Studies Anthropology Art History Asian Societies, Cultures, and Languages Program Biological Sciences Chemistry Classics Cognitive Science Comparative Literature Computer Science Earth Sciences Economics Education Engineering Sciences English Environmental Studies Film and Media Studies French and Italian Geography German Studies Government History Humanities 1 & 2 Institute for Writing and Rhetoric Jewish Studies Latin American, Latino and Caribbean Studies Linguistics Mathematics Medieval and Renaissance Studies Music Native American Studies Philosophy Physics and Astronomy Psychological and Brain Sciences Religion Russian Sociology Spanish and Portuguese Studio Art Theater Women’s and Gender Studies Inclusivity “Dartmouth’s capacity to advance its dual mission of education and research depends upon the full diversity and inclusivity of this community…Diversity and inclusivity are necessary partners. Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Computer Science Undergraduate Overview What You Will Learn Advice & Contact Declaring your CS Major/Minor Programs The Major Modified Majors The Minors Honors Program AIT-Budapest for Dartmouth Students Courses Upcoming Class Schedule Prizes Previous Winners Considering Graduate School?
