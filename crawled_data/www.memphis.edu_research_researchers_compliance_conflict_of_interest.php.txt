In order to ensure that all employees engaging in sponsored research recognize, manage and report financial conflicts of interest, training is required at the following points: Prior to engaging in sponsored research Updated training every four years Annual training if there is an active financial conflict of interest If the researcher is found to be not in compliance with this financial conflict of interest policy.
