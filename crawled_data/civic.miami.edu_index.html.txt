View here > WELCOME The University of Miami Office of Civic and Community Engagement (CCE) is a university-wide initiative that fosters campus-community collaboration by engaging the university’s academic resources in the enrichment of civic and community life. CCE develops teaching and research strategies that directly link academic scholarship to public practice by fostering stronger connections between the University and the South Florida community, integrating civic engagement and community-based partnerships into the curriculum, and promoting community service through experiential learning for students. The goal is to promote a model of engagement based on a culture of collaboration and an ethic of reciprocity, recognizing the importance of knowledge co-creation and diverse forms of expertise. This year, CCE is celebrating its 10th anniversary! We invite you to celebrate our accomplishments with us by visiting the 10-Year Anniversary By The Numbers page. CCE has that ability to know and bring together all the right people at the right place and time, in the right forum, and with the right information. 2015 CCE Community Partner EVENTS UMIAMI ON: University of Miami Coral Gables, FL 33124 305-284-2211 Office of Civic and Community Engagement 1111 Memorial Drive 125 Dooly Memorial Classroom Building Coral Gables, FL 33124 305-284-6636 305-284-6636 Resources About UM myUM CaneLink Academic Calendar Blackboard UM Network Alumni Association Medical Center Hurricane Sports Employment Opportunities Visit Campus Map Parking & Transportation Connect social-facebook social-twitter social-instagram social-youtube Copyright: 2022 University of Miami.
