Our long-standing interdisciplinary doctoral program has a legacy of preparing researchers in child language and language impairments in a way that bridges knowledge of language acquisition, children’s language impairments, developmental psychology, and linguistics. We are broadening our scope to include genetics and quantitative modeling methods. We will continue our strong emphasis on: Empirical methods and theoretical frameworks Accurate description and documentation of children’s language acquisition Identification of symptoms of impairments We believe these are essential for accurate phenotyping of individuals in genetics studies. We are adding courses in genetics intended to bridge expertise in behavioral phenotyping with expertise in molecular genetics. We welcome students with a background in either behavioral phenotyping/language acquisition or molecular genetics. We are adding a new series of courses on multivariate modeling methods tailored to the research designs used in studies of language acquisition and language impairments. These new directions are led by new faculty: Dr. Hashim Raza and Dr. Lesa Hoffman. Dr. Hashim Raza is an Assistant Professor and joins us from the Genetics research labs of the National Institute on Deafness and other Communication Disorders (NIDCD)/NIH, where he worked in the lab of Dr. Dennis Drayna on the genetics of stuttering. Dr. Raza found several new stuttering loci and recently published a new stuttering gene, AP4E1. He is extending his genetics studies to children with language impairments. He will teach three new courses. Dr. Lesa Hoffman is an Associate Professor and also the Scientific Director of the Research Design and Analysis Unit of the Schiefelbusch Institute for Life Span Studies. She specializes in modeling within-person data, such as is found in longitudinal analyses of long-term change, short-term fluctuation, or psychometric designs for intensive measurement. Dr. Hoffman published a new textbook in 2015: Longitudinal Analysis: Modeling within-person fluctuation and change, New York and London, Routledge. She teaches three new courses.
