The committee is advised by the Office of General Counsel. Public Comment The Public Safety Advisory Committee is committed to lead a collaborative and transparent community engagement process, including facilitating several community listening and input sessions. Public Safety Principles As an institution of learning, members of the Public Safety Advisory Committee believe that interactions involving members of the Oregon State University community, the general public and public safety personnel should strive to follow an educational model, be responsive and non-escalatory, and be restorative, not punitive, whenever possible. Members of the university community should value and feel a strong sense of safety. Yet, each person’s experience with law enforcement differs. As a Public Safety Advisory Committee, we seek to advance and support an environment within Oregon State University that is welcoming, compassionate and caring, understanding, trusting and diverse.
