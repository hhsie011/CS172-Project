This year, we also are fortunate to celebrate the beginning of Community Impact’s 40th anniversary. Despite the challenging current environment, we are truly grateful for our student and community volunteers who remain committed to delivering safe, quality, and effective programs. We are immensely proud of and amazed by the work of CI’s staff and volunteers over our four decades of serving the community. From our very first volunteer, Joe DeGenova (CC ’82) tocurrent students like Deborah Moreno Ornelos (CC ’23), Community Impact would not be in existence without its thousands of volunteers. Learn more as you read this newsletter, visit our website, or follow us on social media. Please consider a gift to Community Impact’s Spring Appeal.
