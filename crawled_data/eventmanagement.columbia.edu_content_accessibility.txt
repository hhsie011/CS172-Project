For Event Organizers All promotions (electronic, paper, etc.) advertising University sponsored events must include a statement informing attendees how they may request disability accommodations for the event. Promotions should also include locations and instructions for using the accessible entrance (if applicable – e.g. Low Rotunda is wheelchair accessible via northeast building entrance) and any other accommodations that have been pre-arranged for all participants (e.g. ASL interpreters, large print materials, etc.) For Event Attendees Columbia University makes every effort to accommodate individuals with disabilities.
