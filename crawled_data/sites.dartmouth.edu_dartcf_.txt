Therapeutic advances have extended lifespans and improved quality of life, but patients still suffer from airway infections, in addition to CF-related diabetes, digestive complications, and inflammatory responses. Our comprehensive Dartmouth Cystic Fibrosis Research Center (DartCF), funded by NIH NIDDK (P30DK117469), the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (STANTO19R0), an endowed Dartmouth College Cluster (CF Cluster), and institutional support from the Geisel School of Medicine, proposes to build on strength in airway infection and preclinical drug development, to include gut disease and diabetes and changes in patient microbiomes. We believe that these phenomena are interconnected, and that parallel investigations, coupled by powerful new data-science strategies can find new therapeutic approaches by understanding the complex underlying biology. Our overarching goal is to: Catalyze new directions in CF basic and translational research at Dartmouth Develop integrative strategies to address CF pathobiology Develop new research tools and support CF research through shared services Build research capacity to strengthen CF research locally, regionally, and nationally Visit our Virtual DartCF Retreat where you can view keynote talks and student presentations!
