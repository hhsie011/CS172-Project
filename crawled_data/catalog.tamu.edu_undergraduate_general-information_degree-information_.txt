A student will not be granted a degree based upon completion of the requirements set forth in a catalog more than seven years old. Before changing catalogs, the student must consult his or her academic advisor. A student changes catalogs by filing a written notification with his or her dean, or designee. It is incumbent on the student to verify that the change has been made. Texas A&M University Student Rules (including periodic revisions) is the governing document in case of conflict between this catalog and Texas A&M University Student Rules. It is the responsibility of the individual student to read this information carefully and to use it as a reference. Please refer to the Student Rules for this information. Whereas each college must retain the flexibility to improve its curriculum, course offerings may be changed during the student’s education. If a course required under a previous catalog is no longer offered, a student eligible to graduate according to that catalog should consult his or her academic advisor or dean to identify another course that may be used to fulfill the requirement. Course adjustments in the degree program are permitted only with the approval of the dean through the department head or program director. Furthermore, the University reserves the right to make any changes in requirements it may consider necessary and desirable by due notice in the catalog. Students are required to take the courses listed in a curriculum. This display is intended as a guide to indicate the preferred order for completion of degree requirements. Exceptions to certain requirements may be petitioned through the department head to the dean of the college. Degrees Offered The following degrees are offered for the satisfactory completion of resident study in the appropriate curriculum: Bachelor of Arts (BA) Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) Bachelor of Environmental Design (BED) Bachelor of Landscape Architecture (BLA) Bachelor of Science (BS) Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) Master of Agribusiness (MAB) Master of Agriculture (MAGR) Master of Architecture (MARCH) Master of Arts (MA) Master of Biotechnology (MBIOT) Master of Business Administration (MBA) Master of Clinical Nutrition (MCN) Master of Computer Science (MCS) Master of Education (MED) Master of Engineering (MENGR) Master of Engineering Technical Management (METM) Master of Equine Industry Management (MEIM) Master of Financial Management (MFM) Master of Fine Arts (MFA) Master of Geoscience (MGSC) Master of Health Administration (MHA) Master of Industrial Distribution (MID) Master of International Affairs (MIA) Master of International Policy (MIP) Master of Land and Property Development (MLPD) Master of Landscape Architecture (MLA) Master of Laws (LLM) Master of Legal Studies (MLS) Master of Marine Resources Management (MMRM) Master of Maritime Business Administration and Logistics (MMAL) Master of National Security and Intelligence (MNSI) Master of Natural Resources Development (MNRD) Master of Ocean Science and Technology (MOST) Master of Public Health (MPH) Master of Public Service and Administration (MPSA) Master of Real Estate (MRE) Master of Recreation and Youth Development (MRYD) Master of Science (MS) Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) Master of Science in Public Health (MSPH) Master of Urban Planning (MUP) Master of Water Management and Hydrological Science (MWM) Master of Wildlife Science (MWSC) Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS) Doctor of Education (EdD) Doctor of Engineering (DEng) Doctor of Medicine (MD) Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Doctor of Public Health (DrPH) Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) Juris Doctor (JD) The buying, selling, creating, duplicating, altering, giving or obtaining the Texas A&M diploma or other academic record is prohibited by state law. A person who violates this statute or who aids another person in violation is guilty of a misdemeanor and is subject to a fine and/or confinement if convicted. The University has the right to rescind a previously granted degree if the University becomes aware of information indicating that the degree never should have been granted. Tuition Charged for Excess Credit Hours The State of Texas will not provide funds to state institutions of higher education for excess semester credit hours earned by a resident student. Because funding will not be provided by the State, and as permitted by State law, Texas A&M will charge tuition at the non-resident rate to all students who exceed the semester credit hour limit for their program. Excess semester credit hours are those which accrue after the student attempts more than 30 hours beyond the number of semester credit hours required for the completion of the degree program in which the student is enrolled. Thus, the student may accumulate up to 30 hours beyond those required for the chosen degree program and not exceed the limitation. The limitation on excess credit hours applies only to those undergraduate students who first enter higher education in the fall 1999 and thereafter. The semester credit hours counted toward the limitation include all hours attempted by the student except: Semester credit hours earned by the student before receiving a baccalaureate degree that has been previously awarded. Semester credit hours earned by the student by examination or other procedure by which credit is earned without registering for a course for which tuition is charged. Credit for remedial education courses, technical courses, workforce education courses funded according to contact hours, or other courses that would not generate academic credit that could be applied toward a degree program at Texas A&M. Semester credit hours earned by the student at a private or an out-of-state institution. Semester credit hours earned by the student before graduating from high school and used to satisfy high school graduation requirements (Effective June 2009). Hours not eligible for formula funding. Semester credit hours earned 10 or more years before the student began his or her degree program that have been excluded from the student record due to an election of admission under the Academic Fresh Start program. Supplementary Fee for Courses Attempted More than Twice Certain courses that are attempted by a student more than twice at a public institution of higher education in Texas may not be reported for state funding. As a result, the institution must either pass the non-funded portion to all students, or charge a supplementary fee to the student who is repeating the course. Texas A&M has chosen to assess a supplementary fee to those students attempting a course more than twice. A student attempting certain courses more than twice at Texas A&M will be subject to a supplementary fee of $125 per semester credit hour ($375 for a 3 hour course) for the repeated course, in addition to tuition and required fees associated with the course. Students will be notified at the time they register for a course that it has been taken twice at Texas A&M and is subject to the supplementary fee. Requirements for a Baccalaureate Degree To be a candidate for a degree at the end of the semester, a student must: Be enrolled in or have completed all degree requirements by the 60th class day of the fall or spring semester, or the 15th class day of the second summer term either in residence or at another college or university. Proof of enrollment in any courses taken at another college or university must be provided to the Office of the Registrar, Degree Audit, by the above deadlines. A student must be enrolled in his or her degree-granting college(s) and major(s) at the beginning of the student’s last semester at Texas A&M to be a candidate for a degree from that college. Complete a minimum of 120 credit hours. Complete, with at least a 2.0 grade point average, all undergraduate coursework attempted at Texas A&M. Complete, with a 2.0 grade point average, all courses included in the major field of study. Meet the Residence Requirement. A minimum of 25% of coursework applying to a degree must be completed in residence at Texas A&M University. Upper-level Residence Requirement: A minimum of 36 semester hours of 300- and/or 400-level coursework must be successfully completed in residence at Texas A&M to obtain a baccalaureate degree. A minimum of 12 of these 36 semester hours must be in the major. A student participating in Texas A&M off-campus study programs approved by the student’s college may apply upper division credits earned in the programs toward the residence requirement up to a maximum of 18 semester hours, including hours transferred from another institution as part of one of these programs. These Texas A&M off-campus study programs may involve domestic or international institutions and may be taught by Texas A&M faculty or faculty from other institutions. Students choosing to participate in such programs and wishing to apply credits earned from the programs toward the residence requirement must receive college approval prior to the student’s participation in the off-campus study program. Students participating in international programs must contact the Education Abroad Programs Office for details on how to obtain approval for courses taken outside the United States. Students participating in domestic off-campus programs must contact the dean’s office of their college for approval procedures. Complete the University Core Curriculum. Core Curriculum courses are listed on the University Core Curriculum page. For additional information, please reference http://core.tamu.edu. Complete the citizenship requirement, which includes at least 6 credit hours in government/political science and at least 6 credit hours in American history. American National Government (POLS 206) and State and Local Government (POLS 207) fulfill the government/political science requirement. Both the government/political science and American history requirements may be met, in whole or in part, by equivalent coursework satisfactorily completed at another accredited college or university. State law permits the substitution of 3 hours of history and 3 hours of government/political science for a student in the program of an approved senior ROTC unit. With the approval of the dean of the appropriate college, students successfully completing the required 12 hours of upper-level ROTC courses will be deemed to have completed the equivalent of POLS 206 or POLS 207 plus HIST 105 or HIST 106 (or another appropriate course) for a total of 6 hours. Students pursuing teacher certification are not allowed to substitute ROTC credits for this requirement. Complete the Foreign Language requirement. A minimum of one year of foreign language is required for all baccalaureate degree programs at Texas A&M. For many programs, this degree requirement can be satisfied by the satisfactory completion of two units of the same foreign language at the high school level or a two course sequence of the same language at the college level. International students whose native language is not English are exempt from satisfying the university foreign language requirement. These students may not register for the beginning and intermediate level courses in their native language (course numbers 101, 102, 201, and 202) which are used to fulfill the foreign language requirement. Many Bachelor of Arts degrees require at least 6 additional semester credit hours of foreign language at the 200-level. Students should consult with an academic advisor about specific language requirements for their degree program. Students who wish to demonstrate foreign language proficiency without taking acceptable high school or college courses may do so through the existing credit by examination process. In cases where students wish to demonstrate proficiency in a language not taught at Texas A&M, the following procedures shall apply. The student shall request an examination from the Head of the Department of Hispanic Studies or the Head of the Department of International Studies. This department will coordinate the administration of special examinations to demonstrate foreign language proficiency. This will include finding an appropriate examination to test the student’s proficiency, informing the student how to arrange to take the examination and certifying the results to the student’s advisor. All arrangements shall be made and fees paid by the student. American Sign Language (ASL) may be used to fulfill the foreign language degree requirement unless otherwise specified by the student’s college or department. Students may either transfer ASL credits or arrange to be tested at another institution. (Texas A&M does not offer courses in ASL.) Complete the Writing requirement. The requirement may be met by passing two writing (W) courses or one writing (W) course and one oral communication (C) course in the student's major. The requirement may not be met by any course listed as a University Core Curriculum communication requirement, nor may it be met through credit by examination. It may be met by a course transferred from another institution of higher learning, with the approval of the dean of the student’s college and the Associate Provost for Undergraduate Studies. Upon request, students will provide their dean with a course description, syllabus or writing sample from the course being transferred. Complete the International and Cultural Diversity and Cultural Discourse requirements (6 credit hours). The International and Cultural Diversity (ICD) requirement will prepare graduates for a diverse, global society and address the following University Baccalaureate Learning Outcomes: 1) Live and work effectively in a diverse and global society; 2) Articulate the value of a diverse and global perspective; 3) Recognize diverse opinions and practices and consider different points of view (including but not limited to economic, political, cultural, gender, and religious opinions). Students must take one course (3 credit hours) from the list available on the International and Cultural Diversity Requirement page. For additional information, please reference http://icd.tamu.edu. b. The Cultural Discourse (CD) requirement will prepare graduates to be leaders in an increasingly diverse world and act in a multicultural and global society and will address the following: 1) Hold respectful discussions on difficult topics (controversial topics or topics that involve conflict) 2) The ability to understand conflict from multiple viewpoints 3) Recognize aspects of personal and society interactions including but not limited to power and authority structures, tolerance and intolerance, and promoting informed dialog Students must take one course (3 credit hours) from the list available on the Culture Discourse Requirement page. For additional information, please reference http://icd.tamu.edu. c. If a course listed as ICD or CD, but it also satisfies a Core Curriculum requirement, then the course may be used to satisfy both requirements. Undergraduate Minor Programs A minor is a selection of courses that focus on a single area or an interdisciplinary perspective as developed by the department or program that offers the minor. The department or program offering the minor is responsible for setting enrollment limits and deciding which courses are used to meet the minor. Coursework consists of 15-18 hours with a minimum of 6 in residence at the 300-400 level. If a minor is offered by a department or academic unit, then the minor is considered to be available to all students as resources permit. Students must declare a minor no later than the date on which they apply for graduation. A maximum of two minors per degree can be completed by students. A minor is displayed on the transcript after graduation but not displayed on the diploma. Two Degrees A student pursuing a second baccalaureate degree must complete all university, college, and department/curricular requirements for the second degree not covered in the first. All essential work required for a second degree must be defined in advance in writing by the Dean or designee of the college granting the second degree. In all such cases, the total semester hours required must be at least 30 hours additional to the greater number required for either degree. At least 12 hours of 300- and 400-level course work must be completed in each field of study. A student who has previously not been enrolled at Texas A&M and who is seeking a second degree must have a minimum of 36 hours of 300- and 400-level courses, 12 hours of which must be in the major field of study, in residence at Texas A&M. The student must also meet the citizenship requirements for American history and government/political science. Baccalaureate Degree Option for Students Granted Early Admission to Professional Programs A current undergraduate student who opts in to the early admission to professional program may be eligible for a Texas A&M University baccalaureate degree after completing their first year of professional school. In order to be eligible, the student must complete the minimum 120 hours as required for a baccalaureate degree from Texas A&M, including courses specified by the department and outlined in this catalog. To be eligible, the student must have satisfied all University Core Curriculum requirements as specified in this catalog. A student intending to use this baccalaureate degree option must coordinate early in their program with the appropriate undergraduate advisor in order to ensure that degree requirements are met. The student must complete at least half of the total hours required for the baccalaureate degree while in residence at Texas A&M. This requirement includes a minimum of 24 hours of upper division courses in residence; 12 of the 24 hours must be in the major. Students selected into an approved professional program will be required to successfully complete a minimum of one full year of acceptable work at an accredited school of medicine, dentistry, optometry, pharmacy, law, or veterinary medicine in the United States. The student will be responsible for submitting official transcripts to the Office of Admissions to verify completion of agreement requirements. The participating undergraduate department or program will complete the required degree audit, approve the necessary substitutions and clear the student to graduate. Baccalaureate degrees will be awarded in May, August, and December after the completion of the first year of the approved professional program or the necessary hours for the desired baccalaureate degree. Students must apply for graduation at Howdy. Check the academic calendar for deadlines and for commencement dates. Questions may be emailed to degree-audit@tamu.edu or call (979) 845-1089. For additional information about graduation, visit the graduation website. Former students who have received a professional degree and did not receive a baccalaureate degree from Texas A&M prior to starting professional school may request the conferral of a baccalaureate degree with completion of core curriculum and the residence requirement as stated in this catalog. Although this is a University-wide policy, not all colleges choose to participate. The use of this baccalaureate option will remain a college initiative in that each individual college and/or program must clear each candidate for graduation. Graduation with Honors Undergraduate Students To be eligible for graduation with Latin honors, a student seeking a baccalaureate degree must enroll in and complete a minimum of 60 semester hours at Texas A&M University, Texas A&M University Galveston campus, or Texas A&M University Qatar campus preceding graduation and have an institutional grade point average equal to or greater than that required for the appropriate category of honors. Course credit received by examination, and courses reserved for graduate credit only, are excluded from the calculation of the number of hours and the grade point average for graduation with Latin honors. Categories for Latin honors shall be designated as follows: Summa Cum Laude: A student may be graduated Summa Cum Laude with a grade point average of 3.90 or above. Magna Cum Laude: A student may be graduated Magna Cum Laude with a grade point average range of 3.70 through 3.899. Cum Laude: A student may be graduated Cum Laude with a grade point average range of 3.50 through 3.699. Grade point averages used to determine Latin honors designations are calculated during the final degree audit the day before the ceremonies and include hours and final grades in courses taken during the graduation semester. Latin honors designations will not be changed after the final graduation clearance deadline. Information regarding other honors designations may be found on the Honors and Undergraduate Research page. Please note: Students are not required to enroll in honors courses to graduate with Latin honors. Taking designated honors courses does not mean students will graduate with Latin honors. No Upper Division student found guilty of academic misconduct may receive Cum Laude, Magna Cum Laude, or Summa Cum Laude honors at graduation. Upper Division status is defined as having earned 60 or more credit hours, including transfer hours, prior to the date of the violation. This sanction is automatic upon a finding of academic misconduct, and is imposed without regard to the severity of other sanctions imposed by the instructor or Honor Council. For more information, please see the Aggie Honor System Office section in the catalog. First-Professional Students Students who complete their entire course of study at Texas A&M University in the School of Medicine are eligible for academic honors. In the School of Medicine, students must obtain a grade point average of 3.50 or greater to graduate with honors. In the Irma Lerma Rangel School of Pharmacy, students are eligible for Latin Honors as follows: Summa Cum Laude (4.0-3.90), Magna Cum Laude (3.89-3.75), and Cum Laude (3.74-3.50). In the School of Law, JD students may qualify to graduate Summa Cum Laude by holding a final cumulative grade point average of 3.80 or above, Magna Cum Laude with a final cumulative grade point average of 3.60-3.79, and Cum Laude with a final cumulative grade point average of 3.40 through 3.59.

Graduation Application, Diploma and Commencement Formal application for degrees must be submitted online in Howdy by the deadline stated in the academic calendar. The diploma of the University, with the appropriate degree, will be granted to the student who has made formal application for the degree by the published official deadline, has all grades on record in the Office of the Registrar, including grades pertaining to graduation with honors, and has satisfied all degree requirements by no later than 5 p.m., Friday, the first week of classes of the succeeding semester or summer term following commencement. Students must have settled all financial obligations to the university prior to receiving a diploma. A degree will not be awarded until full resolution of cases for which a student has been charged or is being investigated for one or more violations of a University or Student Rule that could result in suspension or expulsion. Graduate and undergraduate students who plan to attend a commencement ceremony must do so the semester they apply for graduation and complete their degree requirements. Formal application for a degree at Texas A&M University at Qatar is done via the Howdy Portal. Students should navigate to the My Record tab and use the link in the Degree Evaluation channel to submit an Application for Graduation. Students must also pay the required diploma fee and the optional regalia fee (if planning to attend the commencement ceremony) using the Online Payment Portal. Applications for graduation should be submitted by the deadline stated in the Texas A&M University at Qatar academic calendar. Under unusual circumstances, an application for a degree may be accepted after the stated deadline. Students must have settled all financial obligations to the university and Qatar Foundation prior to receiving a diploma. Texas A&M University at Qatar graduate and undergraduate students completing their degree in July or December will have the opportunity to participate in the commencement ceremony in May, following the completion of their degree. Students must participate in the commencement ceremony at their home campus. Requirements for a Certificate A student must receive permission from the department offering the certificate and their primary academic advisor in order to pursue a certificate. All requirements outlined in the catalog and degree evaluation for the specific certificate program must be met in order for a certificate to be awarded. Certificate types: Major-dependent - A student is admitted to the program through the offering department. Admission to the program requires the student to pursue a specific degree/major at Texas A&M University. This type of certificate program typically serves as a track within a degree program. The certificate and degree are awarded simultaneously. Degree-dependent - A student is admitted to the program through the offering department. Admission to the program simply requires that the student pursue a degree at Texas A&M University. The certificate may or may not be related to their specific degree/major. The certificate is awarded upon completion of the requirements independent of a degree. Stand-alone - A student is admitted to the program through the Office of Admissions. The student may pursue the certificate without being enrolled in a degree program. The certificate may be awarded upon completion of requirements. Graduation Application, Certificate and Commencement Beginning fall 2017, formal application for certificates to be awarded must be submitted online in Howdy by the deadline stated in the academic calendar. Certificates are granted to students who make formal application for the certificate to be awarded, have all grades on record in the Office of the Registrar, and have satisfied all certificate requirements. With the exception of major dependent certificates, which are awarded at the end of each term along with the student's associated degree, certificates are awarded on the last calendar day of the month in which they are completed. In months where a commencement ceremony is held, degree-dependent and stand-alone certificates will be awarded with the conferral date for that term's commencement. Students that have made a formal application for a certificate in a given semester/term must have all requirements satisfied no later than 5 p.m., Friday, the first week of classes of the succeeding semester or summer term for the certificate to be formally awarded. Students must have settled all financial obligations to the university prior to receiving a certificate. University certificates will either be mailed directly to the student or issued to the college for formal presentation. Certificate/Graduation Fee At this time, there is not a fee associated with the awarding of a certificate from Texas A&M University. For additional information regarding certificate tracking and awarding, please visit the Office of the Registrar website. Combination Programs Combination programs represent two degrees of different academic levels that are pursued and awarded simultaneously. Combination programs may allow a shorter time for completion due to the “double-counting” of some coursework. Even though the programs are combined, students must satisfy the required hours of both programs. See the specific program for more details.

Please review them here. The delivery platform differs among these programs. Most are available 100% online, some are web-supported with interactive video and others require periodic campus visits. The delivery platform in most programs changes depending on the course/program content, needs of the students and their geographic locations. Students should carefully consider distance education and address any specific questions to the department offering the program of interest. Only a student who is admitted to Texas A&M University may enroll in these distance education programs and the associated courses. A student wishing to enroll in any of the distance education programs must be admitted as a degree-seeking graduate student or as a post-baccalaureate non-degree seeking student. Please see http://admissions.tamu.edu for graduate admissions information. A student may take up to 12 hours in non-degree-seeking post-baccalaureate status and apply these hours to a master’s program with the approval of the student’s advisory committee, the head of the department (or Chair of the Intercollegiate Faculty, if appropriate), and the Office of Graduate and Professional Studies if all admission requirements to the selected master’s program are fulfilled. Courses offered for extension credit may not be used on the student’s degree plan. Post-baccalaureate non-degree status does not establish eligibility for admission to degree-seeking status. Students who are not enrolled in an approved distance education program cannot take more than 50% of their required courses online. The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB) rules that no more than 50% of courses can be taken online if the program is not approved to be offered online as a distance education program. Texas A&M University provides students pursuing a graduate degree by distance a wide variety of student support services, including access to library resources, advising, technology support and course materials acquisition through the online bookstore. A complete listing of services, degree program descriptions, appropriate points of contact within each program, and costs are available through the distance education website at http://distance.tamu.edu. Additional distance education programs are in development. Interested students should check the website periodically for updates. Students should contact the department offering the program for any questions. State Authorization State authorization allows Texas A&M University to offer educational opportunities to students among other states and nationwide. National Council for State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements (NC-SARA) Texas was approved as a SARA state in 2015, and is administered by the Southern Regional Education Board (SREB.) "The State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement is a voluntary agreement among its member states and U.S. territories that establishes comparable national standards for interstate offering of postsecondary distance-education courses and programs. It is intended to make it easier for students to take online courses offered by postsecondary institutions based in another state." -NC-SARA Approved Minors Interdisciplinary Entrepreneurship Leadership College of Agriculture and Life Sciences Agribusiness Entrepreneurship Agricultural Communications and Journalism Agricultural Economics Agricultural Systems Management AgriFood Sales Agronomy Biochemistry Bioenvironmental Sciences Ecology and Conservation Biology Entomology Environmental Soil Science Extension Education Financial Planning Genetics Horticulture International Agricultural Development Leadership Park and Natural Resource Management Plant Breeding Poultry Science Recreation, Park and Tourism Sciences Tourism Management Youth Development School of Architecture Architectural Fabrication and Product Design Architectural Heritage Conservation Art and Architecture History Facility Management Global Art, Design and Construction Global Culture and Society Leadership in the Design and Construction Professions Sustainable Architecture and Planning Urban and Regional Planning College of Arts and Sciences Africana Studies Anthropology Arabic Studies Asian Studies Astrophysics Bioinformatics Biology Chemistry Chinese Classical Studies Climate Change Communication Comparative Cultural Studies-International Comparative Cultural Studies-U.S. Earth Sciences Economics English Environmental Geosciences French Gender and Health Geographic Information Science and Technology Geography Geology Geophysics German Global Culture and Society Health Humanities Hispanic Studies for Community Engagement History Italian Japanese Journalism Latino/a and Mexican-American Studies Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ) Mathematics Meteorology Museum Studies Neuroscience Oceanography Philosophy Physics Pre-Medicine Professional Writing Psychology Religious Studies Russian Science Fiction and Fantasy Studies Sociology Spanish Statistics Women's and Gender Studies Mays Business School Business School of Education and Human Development Coaching Creative Studies Human Resource Development Secondary Education Sport Management College of Engineering Aerospace Engineering Analysis, Design and Management of Energy Conversion Systems Biomedical Engineering Chemical Engineering Computer Science Control of Mechanical Systems Cybersecurity Design and Simulation of Mechanical Systems Electrical Engineering Embedded Systems Integration Engineering Concepts Engineering Project Management Game Design and Development Industrial Engineering Materials Science and Engineering Nuclear Engineering Petroleum Engineering Radiological Health Engineering Technology Management School of Military Science Military Studies School of Performance, Visualization and Fine Arts Art Dance Film Studies Game Design and Development Performance Studies School of Public Health Global Health Health Occupational Health and Safety Public Health Studies School of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences Biomedical Sciences Texas A&M University at Galveston Clinical Laboratory Sciences Coastal Environmental Science and Society Diving Technology and Methods Marine Biology Maritime Business Administration Maritime Cybersecurity Maritime Studies Texas A&M University at Qatar Analysis, Design and Management of Energy Conversion Systems1 Chemical Engineering1 Chemistry1 Control of Mechanical Systems1 Design and Simulation of Mechanical Systems1 Electrical Engineering1 Geology1 Mathematics1 Natural Gas Production and Processing Petroleum Engineering1 Physics1 Political Science 1 Minor is offered by College Station academic departments.
