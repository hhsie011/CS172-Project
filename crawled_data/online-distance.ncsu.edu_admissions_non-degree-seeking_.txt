At NC State, NDS means Non-Degree Studies. This classification is right for many people. If you are: An undergraduate certificate or licensure student; Someone considering an NC State degree program, but not yet ready to apply; A visiting student from another institution, taking NC State distance education courses to meet degree requirements at your home school; A post-baccalaureate student taking prerequisites for a graduate program; A high school Academic Enrichment Opportunities (AEO) student; An adult brushing up academically for professional or personal reasons; then Non-Degree Studies is your classification! There are two NDS categories: Undergraduate Studies (UGS) is for those who have not earned a bachelor’s degree while Post-Baccalaureate Studies (PBS) is for those who have. If you are participating in an undergraduate certificate or licensure program, your classification is NDS, but you will be enrolled in an academic plan that indicates the certificate or licensure you are pursuing. Residency Determination Effective February 20, 2017, The University of North Carolina System will manage and process all residency determinations. All NDS students requesting in-state residency consideration for tuition purposes are required to complete the North Carolina Residency Determination Service (RDS) form prior to completing the NDS application. Complete the Residency Determination Service (RDS) Form Non-Degree Studies/Open Enrollment Application Dates: Term Available From 2022 Summer I 8/20/2021 – 5/18/2022 2022 Summer II 8/20/2021 – 6/27/2022 2022 Fall 1/7/2022 – 8/19/2022 Certificate Seekers Students who are interested in pursuing an Undergraduate Certificate are classified as NDS students and must apply to Non-Degree Studies. If you’re interested in pursuing a Graduate Certificate, please consult first with the specific program in which you are interested then apply through The Graduate School. Explore Certificate Programs Undergraduate Certificates Graduate Certificates Registration Details As an NDS student, you may register for a maximum course load of 8 hours per semester on a space-available basis. Some courses carry prerequisites or are limited to degree-seeking students, so review the course schedule to determine your eligibility. All coursework carries degree credit. Most of the university’s academic support services, such as the library, are available to NDS students; however, social, athletic, health and similar non-academic services are not available. Admission to NDS does not imply admission to an undergraduate or graduate certificate or degree program. NOTE: NDS applications are good for a full year. For example, if you apply for Summer I, you do not need to submit a separate application for Summer II, Fall or Spring. NDS students must maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0 to retain their eligibility. Credit for Degree Students subsequently admitted to an undergraduate program will have all coursework, including grades, applied to the undergraduate degree total GPA. Students subsequently admitted to a graduate program may request up to 12 credit hours be transferred into their degree program. Transferred hours are subject to Graduate School approval, rules and procedures.
