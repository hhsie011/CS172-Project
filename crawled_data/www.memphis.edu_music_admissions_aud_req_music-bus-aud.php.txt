Students have the option of auditioning for music scholarship consideration and/or entrance into an applied studio. It is highly recommended but not required for students to attend one of our audition event days. These sessions are a great way to learn about both concentrations in Music Industry, help you determine the best concentration for your career goals, and answer any questions you may have. In your School of Music Application, you will be asked to answer one of the following questions: Identify 3 career paths for a music business professional and discuss the pros and cons of each. Should music be free to download? How does this affect the owner of protected works? How does technology affect the way consumers listen to music? What life event, producer, or artist inspired you to choose a career in the music industry and why? If you do not have a background in one of the primary instruments listed on the application, please select “Music Industry No Instrument.” Based on your interests, students will be placed in voice, guitar, or piano lessons to fulfill the degree requirements.
