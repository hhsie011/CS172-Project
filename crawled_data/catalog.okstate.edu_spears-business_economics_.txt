Economics studies how humans make decisions and interact with one another to achieve individual or common goals when resources are not freely available to all. Our discipline is based on a simple set of principles that can be widely applied to model decision-making in nearly every form of human endeavor. Economic principles are used to guide individuals, businesses, governments, non-profit organizations, charities, foundations and churches. Ultimately, Economics is useful because of its focus on how to evaluate and predict the intended and unintended consequences of human action. The principles provide a comprehensive view of how a society is organized to transform the limited resources available into want-satisfying goods and services. We investigate the underpinnings of the economic system and conduct research that identifies its weaknesses and strengths, which can be used to prescribe policies that will improve society. In the process, economic principles shed light on important problems confronting contemporary society—financial crises, pandemics, environmental quality, depressions, inflation, income inequality, poverty, education, development, climate change, and so on. The primary objectives sought in the undergraduate curriculum are to develop a broad understanding and perspective of the economic aspects of people's activities coupled with thorough training in the fundamental tools of economic analyses. Elementary mathematical and statistical skills are highly desirable, as is complementary study in the social and behavioral sciences, accounting and business administration. A major in economics prepares students for positions with business firms, non-profit private organizations and national or international government agencies. A degree option in business economics and quantitative studies is offered to provide additional training in analytical methods and communication skills for both public- and private-sector occupations. The undergraduate degree in economics also provides an excellent background for studying law or international relations and, to this end, there is a pre-law option and an international economic relations option. A student interested in pursuing graduate studies in economics should include a wide range of math courses in their undergraduate plan-of-study. ECON 1113 The Economics of Social Issues (S) Description: Issues-oriented approach. Basic economic principles introduced and developed through study of important social issues: for example, inflation, unemployment, poverty, discrimination, crime, population growth and environmental quality. Develops the economist's approach to social problems, and evaluates the contribution of economics to their solution. May not be used for degree credit with ECON 2003 or ECON 2103. No general education credit for students also taking AGEC 1113.

The graduate program in economics prepares economists for academic careers as well as research and administrative positions in business and government agencies. Graduate fields of specialization include regional and urban economics, international economics and economic development. In addition, graduate courses are offered in energy economics and econometrics. The initial admission to a graduate program is determined by the graduate studies committee on the basis of the applicant's previous academic record; verbal, quantitative and analytical scores of the Graduate Record Examination and three letters of recommendation. The Master of Science Degree1 Admission to the master's program in economics is granted to college graduates with superior academic records. Students must have an undergraduate economics degree, be well grounded in economic theory, and have an excellent mathematical background. A total of 30-33 graduate credit hours are required to earn an MS in economics. Each graduate student is guided in the preparation of a plan of study by the graduate advisor. At the master's level, there are two options. One provides the student with a well-rounded program that does not specialize in a particular area of economics. The second option is applied economics, which stresses communication skills, quantitative analysis and coursework from other disciplines related to a career objective. The candidate for the master's degree is required to show competence in basic economic theory and statistical methods, together with an understanding of the fundamental institutional operations of the United States economy. A research report or thesis is required of all students who take only the MS degree. A foreign language is not required. 1 Our MS in Economics is not subject to AACSB accreditation because Economics programs are often taught in either business colleges or arts and sciences colleges. The Doctor of Philosophy Degree1 Admission to the doctoral program in economics is granted to college graduates who have superior academic records. A total of 64 graduate credit hours are required to earn a PhD in economics. The PhD program stresses balanced preparation in economic theory, mathematics and statistics, as well as competence in subject-area fields of specialization. The student is required to pass qualifying examinations in the theory core and in one field of specialization. (The theory core is not considered a field of specialization.) Competence must be demonstrated in a second field of specialization through coursework. The graduate advisor helps the student develop a plan of study to achieve these objectives. A foreign language is not required. A dissertation based upon original research is required of the candidate for a PhD degree in economics. The final oral examination is the dissertation defense. 1 Our PhD in Economics is not subject to AACSB accreditation because many Economics programs reside and are administered in colleges of arts and sciences.
