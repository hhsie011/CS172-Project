Your commitment level is entirely up to you. Groups Student Organizations We have more than 450 student organizations focused on everything from politics and photography to dance and debate.

Our first-year day of service introduces new students to this approach, and to our neighbors in Cambridge and Boston. By beginning their time at Harvard with humble acts that benefit their new community, students lay the foundation for a lifelong commitment to good citizenship.
