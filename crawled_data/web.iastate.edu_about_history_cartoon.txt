In 1862, Congress' Morrill Act, created a new kind of university. Iowa was the first to accept the law's provisions. The land-grants were founded on three radical ideas . . . Idea No. 1: Higher ed should be open to all -- women, minorities, the working class. Idea No. 2: Universities should teach practical subjects, like farming, engineering and home ec. Idea No. 3: Universities should share knowledge with people throughout their states. Iowa State profs started the first traveling farmer institutes and "seed corn trains." Written by D.
