In keeping with this custom, and in the spirit of shared governance, the Staff Advisory Council respectfully submits this statement on the recent developments at The University of Tulsa. We believe that the strength of our university is based upon the contributions of five important groups: the students, administration, alumni, faculty, and staff. We support the role that each of these groups plays in building and maintaining a healthy university. Accordingly, we are encouraged to see initiatives from all corners of campus intended to position TU on a more solid financial footing and to enable the university to meet and overcome the challenges inherent in today’s changing higher education landscape. We recognize that the current educational model at TU is unsustainable and that institutions of higher education must adapt to survive. As such, the SAC supports the administration’s proactive and earnest response to the challenges facing our university, and we are encouraged by continued opportunities for constructive feedback and engagement from alumni, faculty, staff, and students regarding the implementation of that plan. We support a healthy and good-faith dialogue as changes are being proposed and modifications debated, and we remain dedicated to advancing the mission of The University of Tulsa by working in collaboration with the administration, alumni, faculty, and students to best serve and support our beloved institution. The TU family has endured periods of change in the past which have proven to strengthen the bonds between administration, alumni, faculty, staff, and students. It is our hope that once again The University of Tulsa will emerge a stronger, more fiscally responsible institution that encourages and enables students to reach their highest potential. 800 S.
