The First Gent and I attended last Thursday’s performance, and we were amazed by the sets, costumes, choreography and even the behind-the-scenes logistics that made the 17 acts come to life. A thank you to our students for participating in this special Baylor tradition, and congratulations to those groups who advanced to Pigskin Revue during Homecoming this fall. Some updates for this week: Beginning yesterday with Ash Wednesday, we have now entered the season of Lent, a time of reflection and preparation as we journey together to the cross and the celebration of Resurrection Sunday. To further engage with this season of contemplation, the students, faculty and staff of Baylor’s Truett Seminary have composed a Lenten Devotional Guide, with a devotional for each day from Ash Wednesday to Easter Sunday. The guide is available to view and download at baylor.edu/truett/lent2022. More than 60 students along with faculty and staff leaders will be serving on Baylor Missions over Spring Break. Beginning this weekend, students will be helping with clean-up and rebuilding efforts in Mayfield, Ky., and LaPlace, La., two communities devastated by natural disasters in 2021 and from which they are still working to recover. In addition, an education team of students will be traveling to Santa Elena, Costa Rica, to work in two schools as well as serve the local community. May the Lord bless your journey and the impact you will have on these families and their communities. Although many of you will be away from campus next week, I encourage you take the spirit of Baylor’s caring community with you by looking out for your friends and peers. Typically, after Spring Break through the end of the semester, colleges and universities across the country experience an increase in Title IX reporting. With that in mind, please know that there are many resources on campus should you need help, such as Baylor’s Title IX Office, the Baylor Counseling Center and the University Chaplain. Let us continue to “set the standard” at Baylor. Spring Break also is a good time to remind everyone about personal safety while traveling. John Kolinek, Baylor University Police Chief, offers several safety tips for our campus community to consider: If you are going to be away from your home for long periods during the break, lock and bolt all doors and windows. Also, keep on a light, or schedule a light to turn on, to make your home appear occupied. Avoid posting vacation and trip information on social media. When driving, switch drivers often, especially when you start to feel signs of fatigue. Do the majority of your driving during daylight hours. If you are traveling abroad, make sure to be aware of the laws of the country and consider sharing your itinerary and hotel information with family or friends. Although students will be away on break next week, BUPD operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and will be available should the need arise. BUPD can be reached by calling 254-710-2222 or by using the BU Campus Guardian smartphone app or any of the 81 call boxes available around campus. A few years ago, Baylor launched Summer of Discovery – expanding and discounting our summer class offerings with both in-person and online class options so students can complete core or advanced-level courses that help them get ahead on their degrees or add minors or certifications to their degrees. Spring Break is a great time for parents and students to discuss how Summer of Discovery can benefit them. The summer schedule of classes is now available online and class registration opens in April. Students can select both their summer and fall class schedules during their assigned registration period. If you will be in New York City in late May, seven of our most talented students from the School of Music will be performing May 26 in Carnegie Hall’s Weill Recital Hall, one of the most important recital venues in the world where young musicians make their NYC debuts. The Baylor student musicians and one vocalist competed for this performance honor through the rigorous Semper Pro Musica Solo and Chamber Competition, which inspires our students within the School of Music toward musical excellence. It certainly will be an unforgettable experience for each of our students! Did you know that Baylor could claim the Big 12 Championships for football, men’s basketball and women’s basketball all in the same academic year? I hope you will make the trek to the Ferrell Center on Saturday at 5 p.m. as our third-ranked men’s team goes for Baylor’s Big 12 trifecta against Iowa State. And then on Sunday, we’ll celebrate our fifth-ranked and Big 12 Champion women’s team in their regular season finale at 2 p.m. against Texas Tech. Sic ’em, Bears! Linda A. Livingstone, Ph.D. President PHOTO OF THE WEEK The Baylor Family gathered at Elliston Chapel Monday to #PrayForUkraine. Please continue to pray daily for those in harm’s way, for Godly discernment by leaders and for all who are working toward peace. Are you looking for more News?
