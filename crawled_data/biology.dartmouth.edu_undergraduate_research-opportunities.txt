Undergraduate researchers working in Professor Robert Hill's laboratory. PreviousNext Research Opportunities The Biology Department offers a number of opportunities for undergraduate research. Some students pursue research only for one term, while others spend up to four years working in the same laboratory. Dartmouth-sponsored Research Programs Independent Study & the Honors Program Funding and Finding an Advisor Undergraduate Research in Biology: In this video, Alana Bernys '20 talks about finding a lab, research for credit and completing an honors thesis. Department faculty host undergraduate researchers through campus-wide programs such as WISP and Presidential Scholars, our departmental independent study and Honors programs, and nationwide programs such as Leadership Alliance and NSF's Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU). We encourage all undergraduates interested in a research experience to talk with faculty, graduate teaching assistants, and other undergraduates about what type of research experience might be most appropriate for them, and to be assertive about contacting prospective research advisors. Please keep in mind that most research laboratories sponsor a few undergraduates at a time, and so lack of a research opportunity in a particular lab at a particular time often means only that there is a lack of space. Be persistent and flexible — in our experience, most everyone who truly wants a research experience is able to find one during his/her time at Dartmouth. More information Please check out the Biology Department bulletin board outside the main office where you will find job listings for opportunities here at Dartmouth and at other institutions.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Biological Sciences Undergraduate Overview Welcome Class of 2026 Welcome Back Classes of 2023, 2024, 2025 Major & Minor Course Schedules & Syllabi Current and Upcoming Bio 11 and Foundation Classes First Year Writing Seminars - Biology 7 Biology 11 Foundation Course Offerings Foundation Level Course Syllabi Intermediate Level Course Syllabi Advanced Level Course Syllabi Non-Major Course Syllabi Foreign Study Program Faculty Advisors Teaching Science Fellows Independent Study & the Honors Program Research Opportunities Dartmouth-sponsored Research Programs Funding and Finding an Advisor Transfer Credits Graduate Overview Ecology, Evolution, Environment & Society Molecular and Cellular Biology Research Overview Resources & Research Facilities Life Sciences Light Microscopy Facility Faculty Publications Neukom Postdoctoral Fellowship Foreign Study Program Seminars, News & Events News & Events Cramer Seminar Series Chris Reed Memorial Lecture Past Symposia and Conferences Travel People SEPA My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
