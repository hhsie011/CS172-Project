The Committee was charged with advising the Interim Provost and University leadership regarding: whether changes are needed to Columbia’s existing policies on conflict of commitment to protect the University’s key mission – research, teaching, and service – while continuing to acknowledge that outside activities make faculty better scholars and teachers and thereby better equip them to serve the University. Considerations include evolving regulatory requirements and external sponsor requirements; how to handle part-time or split appointments [i.e., concurrent appointments as described below] at other institutions or entities; any required prior approvals; how to ensure that responsibilities to the University are prioritized; and concerns about science and security. The Committee will also consider procedural issues related to disclosure, review and management of potential conflicts of commitment.

It was established by then-Provost Jonathan Cole in 1997 but it had not met in recent years. In the 2015 academic year, the Committee was reinstated by Provost John Coatsworth following the recommendations of an external and internal review of the University Libraries. Members of the Provost's Advisory Committee on the Libraries serve the University by "reviewing the current state of the Libraries; reviewing proposed actions needed to be taken to improve upon the current situation; helping to formulate policy related to libraries and academic information systems; discussing the types of investments the University should make; and acting as a communications conduit between the Libraries and the academic units that it serves." The Provost relies on the Committee to provide faculty input and guidance to ensure that the Libraries are as responsive as possible to the needs and aspirations of Columbia's schools and departments and their faculties. The Provost meets with the Committee each academic year to review its recommendations. 2021-22 Members Vanessa Agard-Jones Assistant Professor of Anthropology Manan Ahmed Associate Professor of History Elizabeth Blackmar (Chair) Mary and David Boies Professor of American History Bruno Bosteels Professor of Latin American and Iberian Cultures; Chair Department of Latin American and Iberian Cultures Lydia Chilton Assistant Professor of Computer Science Seth Cluett Lecturer in Music, Assistant Director of the Computer Music and Sound Art Program Rόisín Commane Assistant Professor of Earth and Environmental Science Nicholas Dames Theodore Kahan Professor of Humanities Andrew Dolkart Professor of Architecture, Planning and Preservation Yasmin Ergas Senior Lecturer in the Discipline of International and Public Affairs David Helfand Professor of Astronomy Jean Howard George Delacorte Professor in the Humanities Joe Howley Associate Professor of Classics Theodore Hughes Korea Foundation Professor of Korean Studies in the Humanities Soulaymane Kachani Senior Vice Provost, Columbia University; Professor of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, Columbia Engineering Laura Kurgan Associate Professor of Architecture, Planning and Preservation; Director of the Visual Studies Sequence in the Faculty of Architecture, Planning and Preservation Ioannis Kymissis Kenneth Brayer Professor of Electrical Engineering; Chair, Department of Electrical Engineering Rosalind Morris (Chair, Collections Subcommittee) Professor of Anthropology Victoria Rosner (Chair, Education Working Group) Dean of Academic Affairs; Adjunct Associate Professor of English and Comparative Literature Soumitra Sengupta Associate Professor of Biomedical Informatics at the Columbia University Medical Center Caleb Scharf Senior Lecturer in the Discipline of Astronomy, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Director of Astrobiology and Co-Director of the Habitable Planet Network, Columbia Astrophysics Laboratory Shelly Silver Associate Professor and Director of Moving Image, Visual Arts Program, School of the Arts Clifford Stein Professor of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research and Professor of Computer Sciences David Schiminovich Associate Professor of Astronomy Jill Shapiro E3B Senior Lecturer; Program Advisor for the Evolutionary Biology of the Human Species Major; Ecology, Evolution, and Environmental Biology Brent Stockwell (Chair, Research Subcommittee) Professor of Biological Sciences and Chemistry Simon Tavaré Professor of Statistics and Biological Science and Director, Herbert and Florence Irving Institute for Cancer Dynamics Provost's Advisory Council for the Enhancement of Faculty Diversity The Provost's Advisory Council for the Enhancement of Faculty Diversity was established to attract, advance and retain a diverse faculty of outstanding scholars who more closely reflect the composition of national pools of qualified candidates in their respective disciplines. 2021-22 Members Walter Bockting Department of Psychiatry, College of Physicians and Surgeons; School of Nursing Anke A.

Blair Simpson Vice Chair of Research, Department of Psychiatry Pamela H. Smith Director, Center for Science and Society Susan V. Smith Associate Provost for Academic Programs Debra J. Wolgemuth Associate Director for Research, Institute of Human Nutrition Tenure Review Advisory Committee (TRAC) Columbia employs a standing committee system to conduct a final University-wide evaluation whenever a school or department, including Barnard College but excepting the Faculty of Law and Teachers College, recommends a candidate for tenure. By examining both the process by which candidates are nominated and their qualifications, the standing committee seeks to ensure a University-wide consistency in the evaluation of nominations to tenure and thereby to promote the appointment of faculty of exceptional quality and distinction throughout the institution. The standing committee–the Tenure Review Advisory Committee (TRAC)–serves in an advisory capacity to the provost, who determines whether the candidate should be recommended to the president and trustees for tenure. The University’s standing committee system of tenure review is administered on behalf of the provost by the vice provost for faculty affairs.
