Home What We Believe The University of Texas at Austin’s College of Natural Sciences is steadfastly committed to enriching and transformative educational and research experiences for every member of our community. The College of Natural Sciences seeks to be a welcoming place for science to all its students, scientists and staff. Our academic disciplines in science, math and technology require many perspectives and backgrounds to achieve the excellence we’re known for. We know we are stronger as an institution when a diverse community of rigorous thinkers and doers come to our campus together, bound by a shared passion for science and curiosity about the world. Advancing excellence and inclusion in this community means working to develop tomorrow’s leaders in science, technology, mathematics and the world from a base of people who reflect the many ethnicities, religions and identities of that world. We are a friendly home, full of rich academic and research opportunities, where a start in Texas Science leads to discovery that changes the world.
