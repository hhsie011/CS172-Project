He will discuss the post-Oslo era of the Palestinian national movement, and the growing recognition on the ground of the need to shift to a rights-based approach for individual and collective equality across the land of historic Palestine. Tareq Baconi is the analyst for Israel/Palestine and Economics of Conflict at International Crisis Group based in Jerusalem. He is the author of Hamas Contained: The Rise and Pacification of Palestinian Resistance (Stanford University Press, 2018).
