The technology improves the government's ability to operate in the millimeter band, which has become increasingly congested amid the push to 5G mobile technology. Development of BLUESHIFT was supported by GTRI’s Independent Research and Development (IRAD) program and won an IRAD of the Year award in fiscal year 2021. 12.15.2021 Developing 5G Solutions for the State of Georgia, Nation The Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) is leading several efforts to develop next-generation 5G wireless technology for government partners and the state of Georgia that directly contribute to national security and economic development. GTRI currently houses a 5G laboratory where researchers test and prepare 5G networks for Department of Defense tactical deployments and explore ways to advance the technology. 10.20.2021 Related Initiatives Electromagnetic Test and Evaluation Facility (EMTEF) Electromagnetic Test and Evaluation Facility (EMTEF) Materials Analysis Center Materials Analysis Center Medical Device Test Center Medical Device Test Center Have a question?
