BROWN UNIVERSITY Facilities Management Maps & Buildings Download Maps Building Brown Login Help BROWN MAPS About Us The Brown Maps is developed and maintained by Fortune Ganesh Corporation (FGC). Behind the web interface is a robust application that provides a comprehensive data management tool for exploring hundreds of buildings managed by Brown Universityâ€™s Department of Facilities Management (FM). The system is seamlessly integrated with Google Maps API which provides users with an easy interactive way to search and locate Brown University buildings, departments, rooms and find related building information such as pictures, floor plans, videos and documents to assist in navigation around the campus. To provide up to date information, the Brown Maps web application automatically synchronizes the underlaying data in real time with the central Famis database at FM. All the searches are logged and are used to update central search tags of buildings. This will improve Brown Maps over time to accurately locate names like 'Ratty' that the Brown community uses in lieu of the official name. FM and FGC are continuously developing and improving Brown Maps to meet the future needs of the Brown community. Your comments and suggestions are very important for the development of the next version of Brown Maps. Brown University Providence, RI 02912 (401) 863-1000 Feedback About This Site
