Individuals with 100% Post 9/11 eligibility honorably discharged from active duty, or a dependent eligible for Transfer of Entitlement may qualify for the Yellow Ribbon Program. What is Baylor University’s Yellow Ribbon Program? Baylor University is a private school. For private schools, the VA sets a yearly maximum tuition and fee amount, often referred to as the “VA cap payment,” which is paid toward applicable tuition and fees each year. Once the yearly cap payment is exhausted, Yellow Ribbon payments begin. Under the Yellow Ribbon Program, Baylor will match the VA’s 50% Yellow Ribbon contribution, resulting in $0 balance for applicable tuition and fees. Students are responsible to pay room, meals, parking permit, etc. Who is eligible? To be eligible for the Yellow Ribbon Program (YR): You must be approved by the VA to receive Chapter 33 Post 9/11 GI Bill® benefits at the 100% level. For questions concerning your eligibility percentage visit, https://www.va.gov/resources/how-we-determine-your-percentage-of-post-911-gi-bill-benefits/. You can be receiving benefits under the John Fry Scholarship. You must be accepted to the University. You cannot be active duty or an active duty spouse using transferred benefit.
