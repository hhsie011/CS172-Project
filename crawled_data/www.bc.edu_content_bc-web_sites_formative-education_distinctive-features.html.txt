Intellectual Social Ethical Spiritual Formation in Action Formative education at Boston College is distinctive because we integrate the academic, residential life, experiential learning, volunteer, and campus ministry experiences of our students in a holistic manner. We do so to help them to flourish in their search for understanding, and in their quest for a meaningful and purposeful existence. “The goal of formative education within the Jesuit context has always been the education of the whole person. Formative education helps form individuals who look in wonderment at life’s possibilities and how they themselves can impact the world.” Fr.
