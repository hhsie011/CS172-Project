For information and access to the Zoom room, please contact the Seminar organizer. Putting People in the Earth System Researchers and policy makers urgently require insights into how human societies have adapted to—or failed to adapt to—climate change across diverse regions, cultures, and time periods. Archaeological and paleoenvironmental data are crucial for expanding our view of 20th century Western experience to the full scope of human history, yet they are largely inaccessible to those working on contemporary climate challenges. I show how state-of-the-art computational methods from geography, ecology, and climatology can help synthesize legacy cultural and natural history data and reveal our species’ long-term role in the dynamic Earth system.
