These spaces are found on every floor of each branch, offering a variety of furniture, technology, and uses to fit each person’s needs. Cooper Study Spaces Only Cooper Library has dedicated study zones that are marked as either collaborative or silent. Collaborative Group work Conversation permitted Set phone to silent Silent Silent study No talking Set phone to silent About Library Study Spaces Our libraries offer a number of different spaces and tools to help you learn. Learn about the different spaces below and where you can find them. Open Collaborative Space Open collaborative space can be found on most floors of each library. For more creative collaboration, you can visit the Adobe Digital Studio to cast your screen onto a large monitor or the Education Media Center to use their whiteboard tables or interactive whiteboard panels. Rolling whiteboards can be found throughout the floors of Cooper Library and the Gunnin Architecture Library, too, if you are willing to look for them! Private Meeting Space If you need a private space to meet with another person or a group, we have numerous bookable study rooms in each library. Rooms are equipped with a flat-panel TV or projector screen with HDMI, VGA, and/or network hookups and a dry erase board. Most rooms can accommodate 4-5 people with a select few hosting up to 24 people. These can be reserved either through our automated booking form or by calling the service desk at the location that you wish to visit. Computers Although Clemson requires that all students have laptops, we do have public access computers at each location. These are located on the main floors of each branch with additional lab computers found on the 4th and 5th floors of Cooper Library. Study Carrel If you are looking for an independent study space, carrels can be found on the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th floors of Cooper Library and the lower level of the Gunnin Architecture Library. Study nooks can be found on Cooper Library's 5th floor or behind Education Media Center's collections.
