Levine The Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences has three major missions: leading edge patient and client care, transformational learning, and clinical research. Each of these activities is intended to improve the quality of life for companion animals and their owners. Faculty and staff in the department participate in all four years of the professional curriculum, although most interactions with students occur in the third and fourth years. The department offers a one-year internship program for the newly graduated veterinarians, and three-year and four-year residency programs in several clinical disciplines for veterinarians seeking advanced training and board certification. Faculty and staff frequently contribute to continuing education programs and may teach and mentor students earning the interdepartmental graduate degrees in Biomedical Sciences offered by the School of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences. Scholarly programs of the faculty are centered mainly on the study of the spontaneously occurring diseases of the patients presented to the Small Animal Hospital. Investigative programs are active in aging biology, anesthesiology, animal behavior, cardiology, clinical nutrition, dermatology, feline internal medicine, gastroenterology, general surgery, G.I. Lab, internal medicine, neurology/neurosurgery, oncology, and orthopedic and soft tissue surgery. We also have a growing portfolio of clinical trials aimed at improving animal and human health. Approximately, 23,500 animals are presented to the Small Animal Hospital for advanced diagnostic procedures and state-of-the-art treatment methods. Faculty, staff, and fourth-year students participate as a team in the care of these patients. Many of these patients are referred from veterinarians throughout Texas and the region, so that they may receive the benefits of the unique expertise and diagnostic and therapeutic technology offered by the Small Animal Hospital.
