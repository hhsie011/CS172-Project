The field is widely defined and includes foundations in computer science, applied mathematics, statistics, biochemistry, molecular biology, genetics, ecology, evolution, anatomy, neuroscience, and visualization. Ph.D. program The Ph.D. program is interdepartmental and the result of a collaboration between the four academic units that comprise the CCMB: Applied Mathematics, Computer Science, Ecology & Evolutionary Biology, and Molecular Biology, Cell Biology & Biochemistry. Undergraduate program The Undergraduate program offers three possible specializations in Computational Biology: Computer Sciences, Biological Sciences, and Applied Mathematics & Statistics. The program requires a senior capstone experience that pairs students and faculty in creative research collaborations. Hsin-Ta Wu, The first CCMB PhD Candidate, presented his thesis proposal. Congratulations Hsin-Ta!
