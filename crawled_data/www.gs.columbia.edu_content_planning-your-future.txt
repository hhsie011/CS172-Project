It is important to ask yourself right away if after graduation you plan to continue the career you have already been cultivating, start a new career, attend graduate or professional school, engage in research opportunities or fellowships, enter the military, or seek a volunteer opportunity such as the Peace Corps or Teach for America. Resources Planning your future can be daunting. The good news is that you will be supported along the way. Your Columbia education will open many doors for you, and there are many resources on campus and off campus to help you get started. Your GS Advisor The GS Dean of Students Office is an excellent resource for learning about what programs and events are being offered to help you explore career paths or prepare for graduate or professional school. Your advisor will help you navigate the University's many offices such as the Center for Career Education and Graduate School Coaching. It's also important to read the twice-weekly News and Announcements email for news about upcoming deadlines and information sessions. These announcements are also listed on the Undergraduate News and Announcements page.
