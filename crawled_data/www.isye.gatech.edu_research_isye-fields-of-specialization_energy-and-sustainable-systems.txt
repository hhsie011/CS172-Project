Unlike traditional disciplines in engineering and the mathematical sciences, the fields address the role of the human decision-maker as key contributor to the inherent complexity of systems and primary benefactor of the analyses. ISyE Fields of Specialization Interdisciplinary Research Centers ISyE Centers and Labs ISyE Postdoctoral Fellowship Program Georgia Tech pursues leading-edge research with industry, government, and community partners. At ISyE, we are a national leader in 10 core fields of specialization: Advanced Manufacturing, Analytics and Machine Learning, Applied Probability and Simulation, Data Science and Statistics, Economic Decision Analysis, Energy and Sustainable Systems, Health and Humanitarian Systems, Optimization, Supply Chain Engineering, and Systems Informatics and Control.

Home Research ISyE Fields of Specialization Energy and Sustainable Systems Other Research Areas Advanced Manufacturing Analytics and Machine Learning Applied Probability and Simulation Data Science and Statistics Economic Decision Analysis Energy and Sustainable Systems Health and Humanitarian Systems Optimization Supply Chain Engineering System Informatics and Control Energy and Sustainable Systems After studying the efficiency of honeybees, Craig Tovey and colleagues realized that bees and computer servers had strikingly similar barriers to efficiency. They then worked to translate bee strategy for idle Internet servers improving and inspiring a new server strategy. ISyE faculty and students are engaged in a wide range of analysis of energy, industrial, infrastructure, and natural systems, investigating their functioning principals and their environmental and economic impacts. ISyE’s sustainable systems researchers bring a strong methodological capability including: Sustainability methods such as environmental life-cycle assessment and physical energy and material analysis. Operations research and industrial engineering methods including optimization, game theory, and financial engineering. Collaborations to integrate climate models, air quality models, and chemical process models into sustainability and operations research types of models. The combination of these modeling and quantitative approaches are allowing ISyE faculty and students to improve our understanding of existing and future engineered systems, and to provide a stronger basis for innovation, investment, and policy. Current Research Topics Integration of health impact costs into the design and management of energy systems. Financial approaches to the management of energy and carbon markets. Environmental life-cycle assessment of biofuels and bioproducts. Least-cost approaches to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts. The functioning of natural systems including ants and honeybees. Analysis of resilience and sustainability in integrated energy, water, and transportation systems.

Valerie Thomas and team work on a variety of projects investigating cost and potential of energy, energy and greenhouse gas impact of biofuels, and the effect of biofuel production on agriculture and food prices. Chen Zhou and Leon McGinnis recently tackled a sustainability issue that investigated ways to minimize greenhouse gas emissions, waste, and cost of packaging.They tracked packaging from its source to its final resting place, whether it went into another product or landfill. The team created a model, a globally sourced auto parts packaging systems, that optimized cargo container space and enabled the use of packing materials that were fully reusable. H.
