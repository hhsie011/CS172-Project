Founded in 1972, KPSA is a pioneer of graduate-level education for nurse anesthetists. Graduates have achieved academic excellence and have been recognized for significant contributions to clinical practice and research in the field of anesthesia. These alumni have also attained leadership roles in clinical settings as well as national professional organizations. As part of the Southern California CSU DNP Consortium, the School of Nursing at CSUF and KPSA have developed a three year sequential academic and clinical graduate program for nurses with a baccalaureate degree. Upon completion of the program, a Doctor of Nursing Practice degree with a concentration in Nurse Anesthesia is awarded by CSUF.
