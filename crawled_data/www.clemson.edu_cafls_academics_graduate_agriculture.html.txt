Graduate Programs Current: Agriculture (MS, PhD) Agriculture (MS, PhD) The Graduate Program (M.S. and Ph.D.) in Agriculture administered through the Department of Agricultural Sciences offers two different concentrations: (1) Agricultural Systems Management and (2) Agricultural Education. The M.S. and Ph.D. degrees require students to conduct research leading to writing a thesis (M.S.) or dissertation (Ph.D.). There is a non-thesis M.S. option available to pursue. The faculty in the Department of Agriculture Sciences are known for their commitment to teaching and research. Primary research areas cover various aspects of agriculture with emphasis on precision agriculture, agricultural robotics, power machinery, biomass handling and processing, irrigation and drainage, water management, soil and water conservation, natural resources economics, and sensors and emerging technologies. Admission to graduate studies (M.S. or Ph.D. in Agriculture) begins with the submission of an official application to the Clemson University Graduate School via their website. Upon receipt of all admission materials, the Graduate School will forward the applications that meet all the admission requirements to the Department of Agricultural Sciences for review. Applicants must meet all the requirements for M.S. or Ph.D. in Agriculture stipulated by the Department of Agricultural Sciences before official acceptance will be granted. Master of Science in Agriculture (M.S.) The Master of Science in Agriculture (M.S.) is designed as an applied research degree program that will fulfill the needs of the agricultural and natural resource sectors of the South Carolina Economy. The M.S. program will offer both a thesis and non-thesis option. Graduates will contribute significantly to improving the technical and economic competitiveness of agribusiness, advancing economic development and growth, and the educational needs of the state. The program offers two-degree concentrations in (1) Agricultural Systems Management and (2) Agricultural Education. The first option allows a student to focus on the design and maintenance of equipment and processes critical to the long-term sustainability of these industries. The second option provides students the opportunity to combine their previous knowledge of agriculture and natural resource management with educational principles to better serve client needs ranging from educating youth to educating the farm community. The M.S. program provides advanced training and education to students interested in expanding their knowledge and expertise in the promotion and growth of South Carolina’s agricultural economy and/or the protection and efficient management of the state’s valuable environmental and natural resources. Ag Science M.S. Handbook (PDF) Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Agriculture The purpose of the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Agriculture is to develop leaders of professions in agricultural systems and agricultural education. This will be accomplished by preparing graduates for academic and technically demanding agricultural positions in the academic, government and private sectors of the economy. Specifically, this degree is designed to add significant depth to an individual's understanding of pedagogy and scholarship in agricultural and natural resources, as well as technological and policy-based issues. The target audience of the doctoral program will include, but will not be limited to, secondary agricultural educators and cooperative extension agents seeking to pursue post-secondary academic education. Professionals from agricultural industries and governmental agencies are also expected to be potential candidates in the agricultural systems management or the agricultural education concentrations for the Ph.D. program.
