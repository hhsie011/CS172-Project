Close Search / About The University of Tulsa / Presidential Lecture Series / Contributors to the Endowment Contributors to the Endowment PRESIDENTIAL LECTURE Previous Speakers About Darcy O’Brien Contributors to the Endowment Sign Up for Emails Honoring a Life and Legacy The Darcy O’Brien Endowed Chair at The University of Tulsa was established in memory of writer, scholar, educator and critic Darcy O’Brien. A member of the TU Department of English faculty from 1978 until 1996, O’Brien died on March 2, 1998, at the age of 58. The Oxley Foundation of Tulsa provided a generous challenge grant to establish the endowed chair. O’Brien was a close friend of Jack Oxley; so, too, were Robert E. and Roxana Lorton, who graciously served as cochairs of the endowment campaign. We gratefully acknowledge the following friends and colleagues of Darcy O’Brien who contributed to this lasting legacy. Ellen and Steve Adelson Lynn Alexander Dr. and Mrs. H.
