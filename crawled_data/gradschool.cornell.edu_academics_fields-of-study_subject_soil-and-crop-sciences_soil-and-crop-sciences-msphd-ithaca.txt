An air-conditioned, eleven-story research tower and adjoining wings incorporate fully equipped laboratory, teaching, office, and supporting spaces. Growth chambers and greenhouses are on the campus, and there are three main field stations near Ithaca. Some members of the field are staff members at the Robert W. Holley Center for Agriculture and Health or the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research, both of which are on campus. Many of the faculty members have research programs concerning international agricultural and environmental issues in tropical and subtropical regions. A limited number of students can do most or all of their research overseas. Field Crop Science covers a wide spectrum, from field-scale applied projects to cell physiology and biotechnology. Studies seek to improve crop productivity and quality, both nationally and internationally, and to identify physiological factors that could be improved through plant breeding or genetic engineering. Soil Science focuses on the processes and properties of the soil environment. It emphasizes improving the suitability of soil for crop growth while preserving its value as a natural resource by using ecologically sound approaches.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
