If you have studied Latin before coming to Dartmouth, you may want to consider taking the online test, as a way to determine which Dartmouth course is appropriate for you. The online Latin Placement Test is a timed test (45 minutes) consisting of 50 multiple-choice questions. If for some reason you do not have access already, you can request it by emailing the Language Program Director, Prof. Jenny Lynn: jenny.lynn@dartmouth.edu. More about the placement process It is important to remember that the online test is only one of several methods we use to determine your ability in Latin. In particular, the online test cannot determine placements beyond the Latin 3 level, even for students who are obviously qualified to enter the more advanced Latin courses. After you take the online test, you will receive an email advising you what to do next. Depending on your score, you might be encouraged to start with LAT 1 either in Fall or Winter, OR to start with LAT 2 in Winter or Spring, OR to start with Latin 3 in Spring, OR to consult with the Language Placement Director about the possibility of taking either LAT 10 or LAT 15. Please be aware that because both LAT 10 and LAT 15 offer opportunities for review (as appropriate to your level), it is quite possible that you may do well in one of those courses even if you have forgotten some things you once knew about Latin. For some students, a placement into LAT 15 has already been made on the basis of a reported score of 5 on the AP Test or 680 or higher on the SAT II Subject Test. If this applies to you, you will see the official placement already showing on your DartHub (= Banner) record. In this case, you do not need to take the online test, although you are still permitted to do so if you like. Students who have other questions about the placement process are encouraged to contact Professor Lynn: jenny.lynn@dartmouth.edu.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Classics Curriculum Overview Course Offerings by Term Fall 2021 Winter 2022 Spring 2022 Summer 2022 Fall 2022 Winter 2023 Spring 2023 2023-24 Classical Studies Courses Entry points for Classical Studies Literature, Philosophy, Religion Ancient History Classical Archaeology Language Study -- Latin Latin Classes Placement in Latin Language Study -- Ancient Greek Courses in Ancient Greek Placement in Ancient Greek Majors and Minors Classical Studies track Ancient History track Classical Archaeology track Classical Languages and Literature track Culminating Experience Foreign Study NEW Classics FSP in Spring 2022 Greece Foreign Study Program Rome Foreign Study Program Projects & Awards Classics-Related Projects and Awards Student Research Archaeological Fieldwork Reid/Wiencke Funding for Research Senior Honors Projects Awards & Prizes Faculty Media Projects Annual Lecture Programs Faculty Books Inclusivity News & Events People Our graduates Graduating with a Classics Degree Alumni Support Tell Us Your Story Alumni Stories My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
