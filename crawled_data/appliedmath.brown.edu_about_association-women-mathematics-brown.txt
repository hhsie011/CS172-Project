The Association of Women in Mathematics Chapter at the Division of Applied Mathematics was founded in the Fall of 2013. The association's mission seeks to encourage woman to develop their mathematical talent, and to attain their potential in their academic and intellectual pursuits in the mathematical sciences. Founded in 1971, the AWM continues to burgeon, offering an essential forum to the rising number of young women interested in pursuing graduate studies in the mathematical sciences. An important goal of Brown's Chapter of AWM is fulfilled through sponsoring special events and workshops. These events provide an excellent opportunity to gather women from divergent mathematical backgrounds, so that they can offer inspiration and support to one another toward shared academic and career goals. The Brown Chapter of the AWM meets every Monday at 4:45 in Room 118, 170 Hope Street.
