Because of COVID-19, many professional meetings have become virtual. A graduate student who is presenting (as described below) may still apply for a Travel Award to pay for the online registration for professional meetings (in line with the guidelines described on this page). Travel to Professional Meetings Eligibility: The applicant must be formally registered for at least one credit hour at Baylor University during the semester when the presentation is made. Summer requests can be based on fall registration. This program is designed to support presentation of findings of graduate-student research, artistic performance, etc. The program is not intended to support recruitment activities, attendance at meetings without presentation of scholarship, costs of publication, or costs of conducting research. Award: Two awards of up to $400 each are available each year (June 1-May 31 of the following calendar year). Any one award may not exceed $400. However, students may request less than $400, thereby possibly allowing support for more than two meetings in a year. The award is deposited directly into the student's bank account. Apply for professional meeting support Travel to Support Doctoral Research Eligibility: The applicant must be formally registered for at least one credit hour at Baylor University during the semester of travel. Summer requests can be based on fall registration. The student's dissertation proposal must be formally approved by the program at the time of application. Award: The Graduate School will match funds with the student's department, up to $400. A doctoral student is eligible for one such award during her/his doctoral studies at Baylor University.
