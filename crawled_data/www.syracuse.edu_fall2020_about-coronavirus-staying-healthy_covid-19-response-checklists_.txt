That guidance was adopted by the Onondaga County Health Department (OCHD) following New York State’s endorsement of the revised CDC policy. The Syracuse University Public Health Team has reviewed the updated OCHD guidance, and in turn has revised the University’s isolation and quarantine guidelines applicable to members of the campus community for the spring semester. The updated isolation and quarantine guidelines for faculty and staff are effective beginning May 23, 2022. Please review these new guidelines carefully and keep this information handy during the semester. Checklists for Faculty/Staff Link For COVID-Positive Faculty/Staff Working on Campus If you receive a positive test result, notify your supervisor and HR Shared Services by phone at 315.443.4042 that you have received confirmation that you have tested positive. Isolate for five days; treat Day 0 as the day of symptom onset or (if asymptomatic) the day of collection of the first positive specimen. Employees who reside in Onondaga County must complete the county’s Isolation Self Attestation Form and follow all other guidance and reporting instructions on this website. Employees who reside in other counties should contact their local county health department for additional guidance. If asymptomatic or if symptoms are resolving after five days, you may exit isolation. If your symptoms such as a fever continue after five days, you should wait until you are fever free without medication for 24 hours before leaving isolation. Symptoms such as loss of taste and smell continue for weeks, so should not be considered. All those exiting isolation should wear a well-fitting mask while around others for an additional five days. There is no testing requirement to come back to work if asymptomatic or if symptoms are resolving after five days of isolation. Follow all other instructions that may be provided by the University. For COVID-Positive Faculty/Staff Working Remotely If you receive a positive test result, notify your supervisor and HR Shared Services by phone at 315.443.4042 that you have received confirmation that you have tested positive. Isolate for five days; treat Day 0 as the day of symptom onset or (if asymptomatic) the day of collection of the first positive specimen. For example, if your first day of symptoms (or if asymptomatic, the day you provided a sample to be tested) is a Monday (Day 0), the first day of the five-day isolation period will begin on Tuesday (Day 1) and extend through Saturday (Day 5). The individual may exit isolation on Sunday, assuming symptoms (if any) are resolving. Employees who reside in Onondaga County must complete the county’s Isolation Self Attestation Form and follow all other guidance and reporting instructions on this website. Employees who reside in other counties should contact their local county health department for additional guidance. All individuals exiting isolation should wear a well-fitting mask at all times while around others, for an additional five days. As per the CDC guidance, there is no testing requirement to come back to work if asymptomatic or if symptoms are resolving after five days of isolation. For those working remotely, continue to do so as you are able, in coordination with your supervisor. Follow all other instructions that may be provided by the University. For Faculty and Staff Exposed to a COVID-Positive Individual If you are fully vaccinated and boosted, the CDC guidelines state that you are not required to quarantine given exposure to a COVID-positive individual. You should, however, wear a well-fitting mask at all times when around others for a period of 10 days. Any individual not fully vaccinated and boosted, and who is exposed to a COVID-positive individual, is required to quarantine for five days. A person who is considered to be not fully vaccinated and boosted is someone who meets any of the following conditions: Not vaccinated whatsoever Not fully vaccinated (in the process of being vaccinated, but has not received final vaccine dose) Vaccinated and eligible for a booster, but has not yet received a booster dose The timeframe of quarantine should be calculated where Day 0 is the last day of exposure to a COVID-positive individual, and Day 1 of quarantine is the first day post-exposure. For example, if your last exposure to a COVID-positive individual is a Monday (Day 0), the first day of the five-day quarantine period will begin on Tuesday (Day 1) and extend through Saturday (Day 5). The individual may exit quarantine on Sunday, assuming no COVID-like symptoms have developed during the quarantine period. If symptoms do appear, seek testing immediately. Those asymptomatic and exiting quarantine and returning to work should continue to wear a well-fitting mask around others for an additional five days. As a rule, anyone exposed to a COVID-positive individual should get tested five days following exposure and watch for symptoms for a period of 10 days. Checklists for Students Link For Students Exposed to a COVID-Positive Individual If you are fully vaccinated and boosted or have had a positive COVID test in the last 90 days, the CDC guidelines state that you are not required to quarantine given exposure to a COVID-positive individual. You should, however, wear a well-fitting mask at all times when around others for a period of 10 days. Any individual not fully vaccinated and boosted, and who is exposed to a COVID-positive individual, is required to quarantine for five days (with the exception of attending class while wearing a well-fitted mask). The Barnes Center will determine which students are required to quarantine. A person who is considered to be not fully vaccinated and boosted is someone who meets any of the following conditions: Not vaccinated whatsoever Not fully vaccinated (in the process of being vaccinated, but has not received final vaccine dose) Vaccinated and eligible for a booster, but has not yet received a booster dose The timeframe of quarantine should be calculated where Day 0 is the last day of exposure to a COVID-positive individual, and Day 1 of quarantine is the first day post-exposure. For example, if your last exposure to a COVID-positive individual is a Monday (Day 0), the first day of the five-day quarantine period will begin on Tuesday (Day 1) and extend through Saturday (Day 5). The individual may exit quarantine on Sunday, assuming no COVID-like symptoms have developed during the quarantine period. If symptoms do appear, contact the Barnes Center at 315.443.8000 to schedule a test. Those asymptomatic and exiting quarantine should continue to wear a well-fitting mask around others for an additional five days. As a rule, anyone exposed to a COVID-positive individual should get tested five days following exposure and watch for symptoms for a period of 10 days. Support resources for students in quarantine may be found here. For COVID-Positive Students Who Reside Off Campus or in a South Campus Apartment A student will isolate for five days, where Day 0 is the day of a positive test or when symptoms began, and Day 1 is the first full day following a positive test. As per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, the student may resume essential activities on the morning of Day 6, including attending class. Students should not go to places where they are unable to wear a mask, such as gyms, and avoid eating around others for a full 10 days. They can resume essential activities assuming either of the following: The student is asymptomatic, or The student’s prior symptoms are resolved/resolving. The Barnes Center will contact students directly to help them determine if they are cleared to exit isolation. Students who remain symptomatic after Day 5 must continue in isolation until symptoms are resolved/resolving. Any off-campus or South Campus student cleared to exit isolation on the morning of Day 6 must wear a mask around others at all times for an additional five days. All students must complete the Onondaga County Isolation Self Attestation Form. Follow all other instructions that may be provided by the University. For COVID-Positive Students Who Reside In an On-Campus Residence Hall The student will isolate in a University-provided isolation facility for five days, where Day 0 is the day of a positive test or when symptoms began, and Day 1 is the first full day following a positive test. As per CDC guidelines, the student may resume essential activities on the morning of Day 6, including attending class, but they cannot enter residential areas of residence halls. Students should not go to places where they are unable to wear a mask, such as gyms, and avoid eating around others for a full 10 days. They can resume essential activities assuming either of the following: The student is asymptomatic, or The student’s prior symptoms are resolved/resolving. The Barnes Center will contact students directly to help them determine if they are cleared to exit isolation. If the student resides in an on-campus residence hall with a private bedroom, the student is cleared to move back into their assigned residence hall and must wear a mask around others at all times for an additional five days. If the student resides in an on-campus residence hall where there is a shared sleeping space, the student will not be permitted to move back to their residence hall but must continue to reside in their assigned isolation housing for 10 days. However, the student can leave the during the day to resume essential activities, including attending class. They must, however, continue to wear a mask at all times, avoid eating around others and sleep in their designated isolation housing. In both instances, the Barnes Center will contact students directly to help them determine if they are cleared to exit isolation. Any student cleared to exit isolation on the morning of Day 6 must wear a mask around others at all times for an additional five days. All students must complete the Onondaga County Isolation Self Attestation Form. Follow all other instructions that may be provided by the University.
