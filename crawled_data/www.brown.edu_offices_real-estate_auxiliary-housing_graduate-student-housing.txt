Description of Program Brown University has established a program designed to assist graduate and medical students with housing. To be eligible for this program, an applicant must be: A graduate or medical student A matriculated student of Brown University for the term requesting housing To apply for one of these housing units, students must submit the Graduate Student Housing Application. Submission of an application does not guarantee placement in a unit. Applications for this program will be accepted until all available units have been assigned. Priority will be given to first-year graduate students. Applicants will be emailed their housing assignments as their units are assigned. After accepting the assignment, applicants will receive a lease agreement via an e-mail attachment, which must be signed and returned to Auxiliary Housing by a specified deadline. A $500 security deposit is required at this time. If the lease agreement is not returned and the security deposit is not received by the stated deadline date, the applicant will lose the assigned unit, and the top-ranking applicant on the waiting list will be assigned the unit. Students may not rent a multi-bedroom apartment in this program for occupancy by one person. Roommates will be assigned to multi-bedroom units. For this reason, it is very important to name a preferred roommate, who must also meet the program eligibility requirements and who must also apply for the program. Applicants may also state that if they are unsuccessful in obtaining a studio or one-bedroom apartment, they wish to withdraw their application. Brown University reserves the right to add, remove, or change dwelling units included in this program and also to terminate this program at any time subject to its obligations under the lease agreements executed under the program. Brown University does not discriminate on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, age handicap, status as a veteran, national or ethnic origin, or sexual orientation.
