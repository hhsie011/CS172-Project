You've traveled a distance to get to Brown but don't forget to venture out! As the smallest state in the United States, nothing in the state is very far from Brown (though because we in Rhode Island get used to how near everything is, we can say that places as close as a 15 minute drive away are too far). Providence was one of the first cities in the United States to become industrialized, resulting in a sizeable immigrant community. This means that Providence is home to food markets, restaurants, and other vendors that feature international products. International House of Rhode Island Located at 8 Stimson Street (just around the corner from Brown's athletic facilities), the International House of Rhode Island gives aid, services, and friendship to all temporary international residents in Rhode Island, including students. Community Engagement Through programming, advising, and fellowships, the Swearer Center for Public Service (25 George Street) engages the university in collaborations with local partners to strengthen communities and prepare students to lead lives of effective action.
