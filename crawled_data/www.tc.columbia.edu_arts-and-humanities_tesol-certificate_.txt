Students are taught to adapt and apply principles of communicative language teaching to a variety of settings and learner populations. We emphasize sensitivity to teacher and student diversity, which can include factors such as: cultural, religious, linguistic, educational, and socio-economic background; race and ethnicity; and sexual orientation and gender expression. Graduates are prepared to become active, reflective, and collaborative TESOL professionals in local and international contexts. Upon completion, students are awarded 28 Continuing Education Units (CEUs) approved by the International Accreditors for Continuing Education and Training (IACET). Learn more about IACET CEUs here. The Program aligns with, and exceeds the standards recommended by TESOL International Association for short-term certificate programs. It also meets and exceeds the 120-hour instruction standard often required for teaching abroad. Students who complete the program can transfer up to 6 credits toward an M.A. degree in Applied Linguistics or TESOL at Teachers College, Columbia University.
