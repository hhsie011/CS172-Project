The Department of Urban Design and Planning fosters an integrative approach to education and research in planning the physical environment. The academic program includes the social, behavioral, and cultural relationships between people and the form and quality of their built and natural environment; the financial, administrative, political, and participatory dimensions of planning, design, and development; and the informational base for making deliberate decisions to shape urban areas and regions, bringing analysis together with vision. Departmental faculty are active participants in interdisciplinary research units, including the Institute for Hazard Mitigation Planning and Research, the Urban Form Laboratory, the Urban Ecology Research Laboratory, the Runstad Center for Real Estate Studies, and the Northwest Center for Livable Communities.

While housed in the Department of Urban Design and Planning, CEP does not provide a predefined educational path. CEP empowers students to pursue their own educational goals in the company of other self-directed individuals. The CEP core curriculum focuses on theory and practice applied to real-world settings while electives are satisfied by taking upper-level courses all across campus. Students participate in a governance process that supports the major while teaching them how to be effective leaders and doers in the world through practice, personal formation, intentionality, communal learning, and stewardship. CEP students graduate to become urban planners, project managers, educators, entrepreneurs, communication experts, and professionals of all sorts. This program of study leads to the following credential: Bachelor of Arts degree with a major in Community, Environment, and Planning Recommended Preparation Suggested First- and Second-Year College Courses: CEP 200. Admission Requirements Minimum 90 credits completed when student begins the program and at least 80 percent of the general education requirements fulfilled, tracked by CEP's Academic Advisor. Minimum 2.50 GPA with additional emphasis on a written essay and demonstration of relevant extracurricular activities. Admission is once a year, for autumn quarter. Early admission deadline is February 15. Additional application dates vary each year. See CEPâ€™s website for specific dates. Continuation Policy All students must make satisfactory academic progress in the major. Failure to do so results in probation, which can lead to dismissal from the major. For the complete continuation policy, contact the departmental adviser or refer to the department website. Bachelor of Arts degree with a major in Community, Environment, and Planning Credential Overview Community, Environment, and Planning (CEP) is a self-directed, interdisciplinary Bachelor of Arts degree housed in the Department of Urban Design and Planning. CEP empowers students to draw on the tools of planning - collaboration, leadership, intentionality, stewardship, and vision - to pursue their own educational goals in the company of other self-directed students in cohorts limited to 38 students. The CEP core curriculum focuses on theory and practice applied to real-world settings; electives are satisfied by taking courses anywhere on campus. Students also participate in a governance process that supports the major and teaches students how to be effective leaders and doers in the world. Our students graduate to become urban planners, educators, non-profit managers, entrepreneurs, communication experts, and professionals of all sorts, including doctors, lawyers, and engineers. Transfer students are welcomed. CEP: An education fully lived, not passively taken.

Back to Top Additional Information Student Outcomes and Opportunities Learning Objectives and Expected Outcomes: A CEP education is founded on the following: students start where they are; articulate and embrace a vision of how they intend to make a difference in the world; construct a plan (with guidance from faculty and peers) of CEP seminars, cross-disciplinary courses, and field experiences; move deliberately with this plan in the final two years of undergraduate education; through first-hand experience and in the context of the CEP community of learners, become acquainted with effective ways for working constructively together to anticipate and address critical issues facing the complex communities and world we inhabit. A CEP education is fully lived, not passively taken. CEP students actively make their education in community with others. CEP class cohorts range from 25-30 students. This group comprises a community of mutual learning that requires commitment, personal investment, and strong teamwork strategies for two years. Through six interconnected, quarterly seminars students engage the core content of the major: community, environment, and planning. These contemporary academic fields and areas of research include the study of community as subject and practice, exploration of the ecological context of all societal life, and an investigation of the potentials of planning for developing strategies for positive change. CEP students have gone on to careers in a variety of interdisciplinary fields such as community planning and organization, urban development, communications, work in for-profit and nonprofit sectors, public administration, education, community and environmental activism, ecology, and government/community relations.
