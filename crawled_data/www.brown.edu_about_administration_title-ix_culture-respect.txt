Culture of Respect is an initiative of the National Association of Student Affairs Administrators (NASPA) dedicated to ending campus sexual violence by building the capacity of institutions to use evidence-based best practices in their prevention, intervention, and policy work. The Collective is an ambitious two-year program of Culture of Respect that guides cohort institutions through a rigorous process of self-assessment. As a member of The Collective, Brown will enhance and align cross-campus collaboration, assess our programming and intervention efforts, and engage in peer-led learning to further our comprehensive approach to combat sexual violence and gender-based harassment that has been endemic at institutions of higher education nationwide, including Brown.
