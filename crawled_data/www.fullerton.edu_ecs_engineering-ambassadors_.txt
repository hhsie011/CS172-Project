The program was launched in 2009 through the support of the National Science Foundation to help undergraduate students develop professional skills and to inspire the next generation of engineers and computer scientists. Over 30 universities in three different countries have adopted the EAN model. The Engineering Ambassador program was launched at CSUF in 2018 by Dr. Sang June Oh, ECS Associate Dean and Mechanical Engineering professor. The program has developed into a vibrant community of highly skilled students who promote engineering and computer science to K-12 students and support a variety of campus and community events.
