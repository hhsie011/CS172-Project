Now that you are a new graduate student at Texas Tech! The Graduate School at Texas Tech University is proud to welcome you into our select group of scholars! Listed below is information that will help you as you begin your journey with us. Requirement for Submitting Official Documents All documents that were submitted with a student's application are considered unofficial, even if the student uploaded a copy of an official transcript to their application portal. Once admitted, all students are required to submit the following by the twelfth (12th) class day of the term to which they were admitted: Official transcripts from all degree-granting universities or institutions, as well as any institution(s) where post-bachelor credit was received Official test scores (GRE, GMAT, TOEFL, IELTS, Duolingo, etc.) sent directly from the testing agency If the student received a degree or degrees from a foreign university or institution, they are required to submit their official diplomas or degree certificates in addition to their official transcripts How to Submit Official Documents Official documents can be provided in the following ways: Mailed using the below address based on the method of shipment you use. This can be from you or the institution. Electronically directly from the institution if available-see below for options Brought in to our office directly by you. Mailing Official Documents Please use the addresses listed below for whatever method of shipment you chose to send your materials: Physical Mailing Address (Express Mail Only) Texas Tech University Office of Graduate Admissions 2625 Memorial Circle Administration 328 Lubbock, TX 79409-1030 Postal Mailing Address (US Postal Service regular airmail) Texas Tech University Office of Graduate Admissions Box 41030 Lubbock, TX 79409-1030 Sending Electronic Transcripts For institutions using a secure electronic transcript delivery service (such as the National Student Clearinghouse, e-Scrip Safe, or Parchment), please make sure that those are sent to graduate.admissions@ttu.edu rather than your prospective department. Several US institutions offer electronic delivery of official transcripts. If your institution offers such a service, we encourage you to use it, as electronic transcripts typically arrive much sooner than those sent via regular airmail. For schools that use ANSI/ASC X12-formatted electronic transcripts, you should only have to indicate that you wish to send your transcripts to Texas Tech University; these types of transcripts are delivered directly to the TTU Registrar's office and uploaded into your file in our secure digital filing system. Submitting Official Documents in Person If you come in-person to the Graduate School Office to provide your official documents to remove a hold, there will be a sign instructing you to complete a form, clip your original documents to the form, and place both inside a provided envelope. We will notify you within 2 weeks when you can come to pick up your documents. Online Students - Submitting Official Documents If you are a distance student, you may not be able to provide these official documents in person or have official copies sent to our office. If not, you have two options: 1. Send your original transcripts/diplomas (and translations, if needed) to us via EXPRESS MAIL. Express mail delivery is recommended because it allows you to track your package. If you opt to mail your official documents to us and want us to return them to you, you must provide a PRE-PAID return label bought at your expense. You may only ship your official documents to the Graduate School through FedEx, UPS, USPS Priority, or DHL. In addition to the return label and your official documents, you must also include a letter in the packet which states that these are the original documents and ask us to make an exact copy for our files and return the originals to you when we are done. Texas Tech Graduate School WILL NOT be responsible for paying for shipping official documents to and from the student. OR (Second option for International credentials ONLY) 2. Many, but not all, EducationUSA advising centers offer credential verification services. The advising center must provide a Standard or a Comprehensive level of service. If a center close to you offers such a service, you are welcome to use it. You would need to have the original language/translation stamped for the transcript and diploma and have a letter or memo attached to it from EducationUSA to meet our "Official" requirement. Obtaining Official Translations If your transcripts and degree certificates or diplomas are not in English, you are required to submit an official English translation in addition to your documents in the original language. Notary-signed copies are not considered official translations.

FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL STUDENTS All students should be prepared financially to cover any billed expenses. Please note that tuition, fees, living expenses, and insurance costs change from year to year. If you have received an assistantship or a GPTI, the monthly payment will NOT happen right away. You will need to communicate with your department regarding the timing of your monthly income. You will be responsible for payment of your tuition and fees after you register for your classes. We encourage ALL STUDENTS to sign up for the Emergency Payment Plan through Student Business Services once they have registered for classes. This allows you to pay your billed expenses in specified increments, which helps especially if you are waiting for any awarded funding to be applied. Payment of the required amount MUST BE PAID, or you will be dropped from your classes. Visit the Student Business Services website for Payment Plan and Paying Your Bill options. We also recommend you visit the Tuition Estimator on the Student Business Services website prior to each semester before you register for classes so you will be prepared for the possible costs.

Depending on when you withdraw from the university, you may be responsible for a portion or all of your tuition & fee charges. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS RECEIVING I-20s Your I-20 reflects the estimated expenses for your first year ONLY and is based on 18 credit hours (9 hours for each long term). The actual amount of your expenses may be higher or lower than the amount on your I-20. The amount will depend on the specific courses you take and the number of credit hours you register for each term. If you have received an assistantship or a GPTI, the monthly payment will NOT happen right away. You will need to communicate with your department regarding the timing of your monthly income. You will be responsible for payment of your tuition and fees after you register for your classes. It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED you bring enough money with you to cover this cost. If you have received enough funding to cover all of your expenses on the I-20, even though you did not need to provide proof of financial support, the monthly payment from your assistantship or other employment will NOT happen right away.

International Students - Transferring In If you have been studying at another institution in the United States in F-1 status and plan to enroll at Texas Tech University, you will need to complete an F-1 school transfer with the Graduate School Office. After receiving admission to Texas Tech, you will complete the Incoming F-1 Transfer Form with your previous school. The school you are currently attending must release your SEVIS record to Texas Tech. Only then can we issue a transfer I-20 to you. Upon arrival in Lubbock, students must report to the International Student and Scholar Services office at the International Cultural Center. For directions, check the TTU Campus Map. Visit the Make An Appointment page to schedule a check-in with your international counselor. Failure to report to the ISSS Office may result in the termination of your SEVIS record. Students who will travel outside the United States for a short period of time before reporting to Texas Tech should discuss their plans with an International Student Counselor before making arrangements to leave the United States. If you do leave the country, you must re-enter using your Texas Tech I-20. Students who have completed a degree program at another school and have been authorized for Optional Practical Training (OPT) will need to provide a copy of their EAD card showing maintenance of continuous F-1 status. Keep in mind that your OPT employment authorization will end as of the SEVIS transfer release date. Questions about the transfer process should be directed to the following email: graduate.admissions.international@ttu.edu Questions about other matters related to student life (scholarships, housing, orientation, etc.) should be directed to the appropriate Texas Tech office. International Students - Transferring Out Transferring out from Texas Tech University to another university requires that we transfer your SEVIS record to your new institution. In order to do this, our office requires a formal letter of admission/acceptance letter from your new school as proof of your admission. You must also fill out the Graduate School SEVIS Release/Transfer Out Form and upload all the required documents and information.
