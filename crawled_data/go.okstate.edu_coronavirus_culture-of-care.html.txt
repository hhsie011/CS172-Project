We are committed to supporting each other inside and outside of the classroom. This includes doing what's right and taking care of each other when times are hard. Getting vaccinated, combined with wearing masks, is our best way to combat the COVID-19 virus and keep us all enjoying the semester and events we are all looking forward to. Campus COVID plan and guidelines Find your why Yourself. Your family and friends. Your community. Our driving forces may differ, but are equally important. Here’s what knits us together: our love of OSU and our desire for as typical of a semester as possible, engaged and in-person. Together, we've made it this far. Let's keep going. Faculty Spotlight Do you feel like you are helping spread awareness by wearing a mask? “That is part of the reason. We don’t seek to be role models, but we are role models at the end of the day. I teach and I wear a mask and it probably encourages a couple of them to wear a mask. I do it for those around me and I feel like I am part of something bigger than myself. The decisions that I make in my life have ripple effects. It doesn’t mean I don’t wrestle daily with feeling a little frustrated with myself and the whole situation. But I still am able to cultivate kindness, show grace to the people and hopefully set an example that others will follow.” - Dr. Udaya DeSilva, Professor, Department of Animal and Food Sciences Staff Spotlight Why do you wear a mask? “I do it for those around me and I feel like I am part of something bigger than myself. The decisions that I make in my life have ripple effects. It doesn’t mean I don’t wrestle daily with feeling a little frustrated with myself and the whole situation. But I still am able to cultivate kindness, show grace to the people and hopefully set an example that others will follow.” - Ruthie Loffi, Adminstrative Assistant, Leadership and Campus Life Student Spotlight Do you feel that wearing a mask has started to help spread awareness for other students? “I do wear a mask because I don’t want to transmit it to other people who aren’t wearing a mask or aren't vaccinated. Our teachers are enforcing it and a lot of people are more aware of it. That has helped more people wear masks and more people stay safe.” - Cameron Arnold, Freshman, Computer Science Staff Spotlight Do you have anyone in your life that is immunocompromised or has had problems with COVID? “I wear a mask to protect myself, to protect people around me and to be aware. My mom has leukemia and she is not in the states. She is back home in Taiwan. So for me, in the future if I need to go visit her, I want to make sure I am healthy. And also to just share with the rest of the group to let them know it is important to stay healthy and keep things going because it is a challenge.” - Vedda Hsu, Director, University Dining Services COVID-19 Resources University Health Services For health related questions, vaccine scheduling, to find out about COVID-19 testing, and more.
