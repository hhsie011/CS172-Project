We equip the next generation of game creators with the technical skills and instincts required to drive the evolution of gaming. SMU Guildhall utilizes a cohort model, in which each admitted cycle of students will move together through the program in lockstep, with each course being a pre-requisite for the next in the sequence. Students choose a specialization and take focused classes aligned with that area, as well as work collaboratively as a group for cross-disciplinary Team Game Production courses. In addition, students will take courses to support Thesis development (as applicable), professional development, and more. We currently offer two full-time, 2-year game design programs: Master of Interactive Technology (MIT) in Digital Game Development: Consists of a specified specialization-related course sequence, directed individual work in the specialization with a practical Master’s thesis artifact (project-in-lieu-of-thesis), and cross-disciplinary team game productions. Professional Certificate in Digital Game Development: Mirrors the MIT program, minus the thesis. Teamwork & specialized learning: The core of our curriculum The courses we offer annually combine lectures, labs, and studios to prepare students for the video game industry via both independent work and team projects. Students are admitted in cohorts and move through the program together, studying game development, industry trends, leadership, teamwork, professional development, and ethics. Each student takes the following courses: 4 team game production courses 1 professional development course 9-11 specialization-specific course sequence (9 courses for Production, and 11 courses for Art, Level Design, and Software Development) 1 ethics course 4 courses that focus on research to advance each of the specialization specific fields in game development (Master's students only) Sample schedule Specialized Learning SMU Guildhall is the only program that offers specializations in all four cornerstones of video game development: Art, Design, Production (MIT only), and Programming. Students develop their skills and instincts in specialization-specific classes and complete independent work and research to inform their Master’s theses and Directed Focus Studies. They apply these skills to their team game projects. Team Game Projects In team game production courses, students work in cross-disciplinary teams to develop three or more professional-grade 2D and 3D games in the style and pace of the industry. Guildhall games have won many awards, and several have gone on to be further developed and published post-graduation.
