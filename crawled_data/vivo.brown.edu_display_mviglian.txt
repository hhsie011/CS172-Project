I have been actively involved over the years in teaching clinical Obstetrics and Gynecology to Brown Medical students, Women and Infants' OBGYN Residents, Boston University Internal Medicine residents, University of New England Physician Assistant students, Salve Regina Nurse Practitioner students, Memorial Hospital Family Practice residents, and Memorial Hospital MCH Fellows. In addition to clinical practice, I have lectured extensively in the community on topics related to Women's Health. I have been a consultant to the Women's Health Initiative, an NIH-based prospective study on estrogen replacement therapy. I have also been a consultant to the Rhode Island Department of Health Board of Medical Licensure, and a consultant for many years to the Rhode Island Department of Health in their capacity as a Title X Family Planning grantee. I have written numerous Case Reports based on my clinical experiences with patients.
