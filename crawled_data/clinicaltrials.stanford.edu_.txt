Clinical trials are research studies that explore whether a medical strategy, treatment or device is safe and effective for humans. These studies may also show which medical approaches work best for certain illnesses or groups of people. Clinical trials produce information that helps patients and their health-care providers make better health-related decisions. Why Participate? By participating in clinical research, you help accelerate medical science by providing valuable insights into potential treatments and methods of prevention. Participants with an illness or disease participate to help others, but also to possibly receive the newest treatment and to have the additional care and attention from the clinical trial staff. Eligibility Researchers follow clinical trials guidelines when deciding who can participate in a study. These guidelines are called Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria. These criteria are based on factors such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, treatment history, and other medical conditions. Trial coordinators can provide additional information about individual trials. Looking for healthy volunteers Healthy volunteers play a vital role in clinical studies, helping researchers learn how to keep people well. Some studies compare healthy people to those who have a specific disease. In addition to clinical trials that accept healthy participants, there are other clinical studies at Stanford Medicine that also seek healthy participants. Stanford Research Registry The Stanford Research Registry connects people like you, with teams conducting research, to improve health care. If you are eligible for a study, researchers may contact you to see if you would like to learn more. COVID-19 Clinical Studies Explore COVID-19 Clinical Studies. Stanford Medicine researchers and scientists have launched dozens of research projects as part of the global response to COVID-19. By participating in our COVID-19 clinical research, you help accelerate medical science by providing valuable insights into potential treatments and methods of prevention. Stanford Diabetes Research Center The Stanford Diabetes Research Center (SDRC) is looking for participants, including healthy volunteers, to join the various diabetes-related studies being conducted at Stanford. Join the SDRC research registry Project Baseline Project Baseline is a broad effort designed to develop a well-defined reference, or “baseline,” of good health. Its rich data platform will be used to better understand the transition from health to disease and identify additional risk factors for disease.
