While it's impossible to admire all of the blossoms simultaneously, there should be a maximum of plants, trees, and shrubs in flower at the beginning of May: with any luck the last cherry blossoms and white magnolias (both are at their peak right now), plus lilacs, dogwoods, rhododendrons, and perhaps peonies.
