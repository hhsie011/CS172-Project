Professor Merritt Fox and Professor Lawrence Glosten came to Rio de Janeiro, accompanied by Professor Kevin Haeberle, who is a Teaching Assistant at the Program, and a former fellow at the Program. The team of Professors was able to condense the semester-long course they deliver at the Campus in New York, in a week-long intensive course. The students were mostly employees of CVM, as well as some private market specialists (from investiment banks, wealth managers and so on). CVM also invited members of some institutions that work closely with the market, such as ANBIMA (The National Association of Investimenst Banks) and BRAiN (Brazil Investiment and Business). The course focused mainly on four subjects: I - The Institutions and Economics of Securities Markets II - The Regulation of Market Structure III - The Regulation of Liquidity Provision and Related Services IV - The Regulation of Traders (including manipulation, short selling, & trading on nonpublic information) Tags Rio Education CVM Columbia Law School News May 26, 2022 Book Talk: A Slave Between Empires May 25, 2022 Alumni Spotlight: Gonzalo Mena May 24, 2022 Paris Center Stories: Translating Theater and Acting in Paris, Summer 2022 May 18, 2022 Book Talk: Your Sons Are at Your Service May 18, 2022 Academics from Chilean University UAI Visit Columbia to Strengthen Relationship with SEAS Columbia Global CentersAmman / Beijing / Istanbul / Mumbai / Nairobi / Paris / Rio / Santiago / Tunis Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
