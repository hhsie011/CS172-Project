Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) The FAQ documents on the CUIMC COVID Vaccine Information page continue to be updated, so please check the site for the latest versions. Below is the Question of the Day: I experienced body aches, chill, and congestion after getting the COVID vaccine. How long will these symptoms normally last? Reactions after COVID-19 vaccine are well described. The most common reaction is pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site. Some people experience fatigue, muscle or joint pain, headache, chills and less commonly fever. Reactions generally last a short time and will respond to Tylenol or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).Thus, the body aches and chills are consistent with the described reactions. However, congestion is not a reaction to the vaccine. Thank you and hope you continue to stay safe!
