The field of accounting offers challenging and rewarding opportunities in public accounting, tax accounting, industry, government and not-for-profit organizations. Prospective accountants must be prepared to work in an increasingly complex environment. In addition to accounting knowledge, the successful accountant must possess a broad knowledge of business. Other essential skills include the ability to communicate verbally and in writing, work well with and motivate others, organize and manage tasks and other people, and use sound professional judgment. To become licensed as a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) in the state of Florida and most other jurisdictions, students must complete additional educational requirements beyond the bachelor’s degree. It is recommended that students satisfy these requirements by completing the Master of Accounting (MAcc) program. The master’s program provides the best preparation for entrance into the accounting profession. Degree Options Academic Programs Bachelor of Science in Accounting (BS) Combined Bachelor of Science in Accounting/Master of Accounting (BS/MAcc) Pathway Master of Accounting (MAcc) Doctor of Philosophy with a major in Accounting (Ph.D.) Student Opportunities Students are encouraged to enrich their education through the department’s International Accounting with EY program, the college's internship and global exchange programs, and FSU’s international programs. Many networking and leadership opportunities are available through student organizations and department events. Additionally, the college's Student Leadership Council sponsors several networking events and student engagement programs to assist students in the transition from college to careers. Generous scholarships help support students along the way.
