Directed Reading Program - Brown University About the DRP The Directed Reading Program (DRP) pairs undergraduate students with graduate student mentors to pursue an independent reading project throughout the semester. Typically, an undergraduate student follows a textbook or a paper and the graduate student plays the role of a mentor. It is up to each pair to decide how frequently to meet and discuss the content, but once a week is usual. At the end of the semester, each student is encouraged to give a presentation (or write a report) about the project in order to solidify their own understanding and to pass it on to others. The first DRPs took place at the University of Chicago over a decade ago. These programs have had great success and have spread to many other math departments. The DRP at Brown began in Spring 2017. Goals To further interactions between undergraduate and graduate students, strengthening our math community. To provide a fun and low-stress way for both mentee and mentor to learn or further familiarize themselves with topics of interest To give another, less intimidating avenue for interested undergraduate students of varying backgrounds to get more involved in math and even to pursue relatively advanced topics. To give graduate students the opportunity to act as mentors and to gain a different type of teaching experience. Home Apply DRP Library Current Projects Past Projects Contact Us
