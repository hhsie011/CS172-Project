In Student Access, we welcome our students living with these differences, as well as their friends and allies! Our program is specially tailored to meet the students’ needs. In Pathfinders, students will participate in skills-building groups, social events, and Success Coaching, all with their sensory needs in mind. Our skills-building groups include topics such as building and maintaining relationships, talking with professors, and practicing self-care. Furthermore, our social events use specific tools like sensory-friendly games and service dogs to create a social atmosphere comfortable for all students. Finally, our Success Coaches guide students through academic topics and skills-building sessions, and help students grow as collegians and future professionals.
