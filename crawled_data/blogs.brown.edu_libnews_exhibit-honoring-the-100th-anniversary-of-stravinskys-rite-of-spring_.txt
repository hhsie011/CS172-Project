The items displayed are from the Brown University Library’s Bryson Dance Collection. The exhibit is one of a series of events taking place in Rhode Island this spring to mark the FirstWorks presentation of the Joffrey Ballet’s recreation of the original ballet. The Joffrey’s performance will take place on March 19th at the Providence Performing Arts Center. Igor Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring was commissioned for the Ballets Russes in Paris and was designed by Russian artists on a Russian theme, in an attempt to inform Paris of Russia’s interpretation of modernism.
