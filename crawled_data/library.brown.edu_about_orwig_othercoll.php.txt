The primary focus of the American vocal music collection is on popular music of the 19th and 20th centuries. Also of note is the Harris Collection of American Poetry and Plays, which includes more than 17,000 music-related works dating from the 17th century to the present with a particular focus on African-Americana. Other special collections in the John Hay Library contain music as well, notably, the McLellan Lincoln Collection and the Anne S.K. Brown Military Collection, and the John Carter Brown Library also has rare materials related to music in the colonial period in the Americas. Materials in the John Hay and John Carter Brown Libraries do not circulate. The Rockefeller Library Reference Department maintains a small collection of music reference materials, and houses general periodical indexes which contain information on music topics. The Sciences Library holds many of Brown's titles on the subject of acoustics. Additionally, a great deal of music material has been relocated to the Library Collections Annex.
