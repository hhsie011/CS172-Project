The program emphasizes integration across architectural engineering disciplines as well as with the existing civil engineering and construction engineering programs. This program allows students to specialize in a chosen discipline while gaining the knowledge and skills to become leaders in the design and construction of green, energy efficient and more complex buildings. Major Code: 826 Identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics. Apply the engineering design process to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration for public health and safety, and global, cultural, social, environmental, economic, and other factors as appropriate to the discipline. Develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions. Communicate effectively with a range of audiences. Recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts. Recognize the ongoing need to acquire new knowledge, to choose appropriate learning strategies, and to apply this knowledge. Function effectively as a member or leader of a team that establishes goals, plans tasks, meets deadlines, and creates a collaborative and inclusive environment.
