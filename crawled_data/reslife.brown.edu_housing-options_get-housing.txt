Transfer Students Transfer students should complete the New Student Housing Questionnaire online following acceptance of admission. The questionnaire requests information on a student's room type size preferences. Students are also invited to express interest in substance-free, quiet, or single-gender housing. Transfer students will be assigned to available vacant rooms through the campus during the month of July and will be notified of their assignment and room/suitemate information by early-to-mid August. Resumed Undergraduate Students Traditional undergraduates are required to live on-campus for a six (6) semester minimum. However, Resumed Undergraduate Education (RUE) Students are exempted from this requirement. RUE students are welcome to live in residence halls (secured through the on-campus Housing Lottery), but they are eligible to live off campus beginning their 1st semester at Brown. RUE students are required to communicate with the Office of Residential Life on an annual basis about their housing intentions. Students who will be living off campus should complete complete a Non-Resident Intent Form annually.
