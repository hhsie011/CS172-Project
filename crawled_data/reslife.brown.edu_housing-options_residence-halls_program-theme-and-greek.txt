Language and Cultural Houses give students the opportunity to speak a foreign language and to learn about other cultures. Fraternities and Sororities enrich the social atmosphere at Brown and conduct community service. Theme houses change based on student interests, and have included communities such as Harambee, St. Anthony Literary Society, and Tech Houses. Selection Process The selection process varies somewhat between houses. Fraternities and sororities organize a recruitment process which begins in late January. Theme houses hold information sessions for interested students. All Program Houses are actually located within on-campus residence halls, and comprise single and double rooms. Once a student joins a house, specific housing is assigned within the house on the basis of seniority and leadership involvement.
