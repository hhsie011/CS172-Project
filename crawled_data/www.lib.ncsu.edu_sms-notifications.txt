Prefer to receive information via text message (SMS)? The Libraries’ text message service will send you “due soon” and “overdue” notices for textbooks and tech devices such as laptops. This pilot program is available starting in Spring 2022. Subscribe to SMS notifications You can subscribe or edit your subscription in your library account settings. What will I receive reminders about? You'll receive SMS notifications reminding you about items you checked out that are: Textbooks and Reserves (2-hour loans) Devices, such as laptops Media, such as DVDs and games You'll still receive email notifications about these items, too. SMS notifications and email notifications have staggered timing, so you won't receive both at the same time. At this time, SMS notifications are not available for books checked out from the bookstacks, DVDs that aren't on reserve, and other item types not listed above. Reminders about those items will still be sent to you by email. Example notification Reminder: you checked out this item from the Libraries: - Short Stories in Italian It is due back at 4:30PM, August 27 go.ncsu.edu/see-checkouts Received 4:00PM on August 27 What else should I know before signing up? This service from the Libraries is free, but standard text message rates will apply. We won’t provide your phone number to any other services, even within the Libraries. You can opt out anytime by editing your library account settings. Contact us Questions about how this works? Ask Us. This is a pilot project. If you have feedback about this service — for example, if you signed up but aren't receiving text messages — please contact Mia Partlow. Top of page Contact D. H.
