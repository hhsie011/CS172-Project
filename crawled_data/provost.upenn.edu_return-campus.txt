If you have any questions, please contact your Business Administrator or Human Resources Director. Please remember that all individuals coming to campus for any length of time that have not reported their fully vaccinated status must complete the PennOpen Pass (see below), wear face coverings, continue to practice social distancing, and stay home if you are feeling sick. For additional information, please visit Workplace Resources for COVID-19 Control. Penn OpenPass Beginning July 1, use of PennOpen Pass will be required just for employees who have not reported their vaccine status. PennOpen Pass will support testing compliance and daily symptom checking for those individuals, but it will no longer be used to enter campus buildings. Vaccinated individuals should expect to return to pre-pandemic conditions while on campus. Report Vaccination Status All current faculty, staff, and post-doctoral trainees are required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 no later than August 1, 2021. Employees of Pennâ€™s health schools must follow any additional school-specific guidelines. Vaccinated faculty, staff, and post-docs should enter their vaccination information into Workday by July 1. New hires and those vaccinated after July 1 should update their record as soon as possible. Click here for the Self-Service tip sheet on how to enter vaccine information. Effective July 1, individuals who have recorded being fully vaccinated against COVID-19 in their Workday record will be exempt from regular Penn Cares screening testing. Individuals who report their vaccination status after July 1 will be exempt thereafter. We recognize that some individuals will choose not to obtain vaccines for medical and religious reasons, and some may choose not to disclose their vaccine status. Faculty, staff, and post-doctoral trainees who are not fully vaccinated will be required to continue to participate in daily symptom checks on PennOpen Pass and weekly Penn Cares screening testing, as well as to continue to wear masks indoors. Update Work Contact Information in Workday If you will be working on campus more than 50% of your work week, your work contact information must be listed as your campus address. If you work less than 50% of your work week on campus, and your remote work address is outside Philadelphia and was changed to that address as part of the June 1, 2020 Workday change for remote workers, you will not need to make any changes. This change is not a self-service option in Workday. Your department's Business Administrator is the only one able to change your work address in Workday. Please use this form to submit your work location address change request. You will need to include the following information: Name Penn ID Org Number (XXXX) Department Date of Return to Campus On-Campus Work Address HR Analysts: The tip sheet for how to modify an employee's work contact information can be found here. You can also visit the Workday COVID-19 Return to Campus Guide here. This guide was developed to help HR Analysts and individuals paid via Workday identify when a change to work location requires an update to Work Address in Workday. HR Analysts must update all workers' work address back to their campus address on September 1, 2021, in preparation for resumption of on-campus operations on September 7, 2021.
