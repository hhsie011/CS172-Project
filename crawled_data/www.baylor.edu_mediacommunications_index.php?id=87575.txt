The Getterman Scholarship – Baylor’s most impressive scholarship covering tuition, fees, room and board, along with support for study abroad, research and mission/service experiences – was awarded to three academically excellent students who attended the Getterman Scholars event and competed with video essay submissions. The prestigious Baylor Faculty Scholarship – a full-tuition academic scholarship covering up to eight semesters of undergraduate study – was awarded to select students who competed at an Invitation to Excellence event. Additionally, Baylor awarded two new scholarships to two exceptional students – the Baylor Pillar Scholarship and the Baylor Persist Scholarship. The Baylor Pillar Scholarship covered full tuition to Baylor, and the Baylor Persist Scholarship covered full tuition and room and board. Baylor also awarded students with one of five other academic scholarships based on a complete and holistic review of their high school performance. President's Scholarship Provost's Scholarship Deans' Scholarship Founders' Scholarship Independence Scholarship These scholarships ranged from $48,000 to $92,000 divided over eight undergraduate semesters or $12,000 to $23,000 per academic year. Transfer students with a cumulative transfer GPA between 3.0-4.0 are awarded academic scholarships that provide $9,000 to $13,000 per academic year. Test scores were not part of the scholarship review process for students applying for the 2021-2022 academic year due to nationwide testing challenges. Baylor University has extended its test-optional admissions policy for the Fall 2022 and 2023 application cycles for incoming freshman students. 93% of admitted students received an academic scholarship, and the median range of scholarships awarded is $72,000 divided over eight undergraduate semesters or $18,000 per academic year.
