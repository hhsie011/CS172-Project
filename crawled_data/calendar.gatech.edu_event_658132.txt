These sessions provide an opportunity for researchers to receive guidance with their research computing objectives and get help resolving problems and/or improving scientific pipelines. We strongly encourage our users to take advantage of these sessions, and we welcome any questions ranging from the initial phase of getting the research initiated on PACE resources to more specific questions related to harnessing PACE computing. Assistance is also available for XSEDE, a national network of NSF supercomputers that scientists use to interactively share computing resources, data, and expertise.
