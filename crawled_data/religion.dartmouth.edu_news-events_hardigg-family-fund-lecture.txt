The Hardigg Family Fellow meets with students in class to discuss his or her work and also engages with students more informally in conversations outside of class. The Fellow also typically presents a faculty colloquium or public lecture in conjunction with their visit to campus. The Hardigg Family Fund was established in 1993 by James S. Hardigg '44. 2021-2022 Hardigg Lecture Thursday, February 3, 2022 Daniel Boyarin Hermann P. and Sophia Taubman Professor of Talmudic Culture, Departments of Near Eastern Studies and Rhetoric, University of California at Berkeley; Caroline Zelaznik Gruss and Joseph S.

According to the arguments to be advanced in my lecture, it was a very unfortunate idea for Jews to allow this to happen. I shall be briefly surveying these arguments which are developed further in my forthcoming book: The No-State Solution: A Jewish Manifesto (Yale, 2022). 2019-2020 Hardigg Lecture Thursday, January 23, 2020 Michelle C.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Religion Undergraduate Overview Major and Minor Curriculum Course Schedule Dickinson Seminar Focus on Race Non-Western Courses Honors Program Sperry Fellows Program Past Honors Theses Career Information Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Awards and Prizes The Charles Howard Dudley Prize The Dickinson Senior Writing Prize in Religion The Hans Penner Prize The Religion Department Faculty Award The Sperry Writing Prize in Religion Foreign Study Program News & Events Overview Dickinson Distinguished Lecture Forum on Race & Religion Hardigg Family Fund Lecture Past Fellows Orr Lecture on Culture & Religion Past Lectures People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
