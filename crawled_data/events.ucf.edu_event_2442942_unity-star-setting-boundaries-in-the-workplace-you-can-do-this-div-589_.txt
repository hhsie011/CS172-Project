Events at UCF Log In UNITY STAR: Setting Boundaries in the Workplace: You Can Do this! (DIV 589) Edit Add Event To Friday, June 3, 2022 10 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. It is important to have healthy boundaries, especially in the workplace. This can be challenging at best. The concept of setting boundaries may not be a common practice for many people nor something that is often discussed or encouraged. Everything we are experiencing right now is contributing to our stress levels. This session will look at the importance of healthy boundaries in the work setting and strategies that can be adopted. The goal is to equip participants with information on boundary setting so they are empowered to focus on self-care. We can do this!
