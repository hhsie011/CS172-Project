Lenz Foundation for American Buddhism promotes the benefits of Zen Buddhism, meditation, yoga and related Buddhist practices in a manner complementary to our modern American society. They fund a variety of Buddhist and/or Contemplative programs throughout North America, including the Contemplative Studies Initiative at Brown. The Center for Contemplative Mind in Society works to integrate contemplative awareness into contemporary life in order to help create a more just, compassionate, and reflective society. The Mind and Life Institute aims to establish mutually respectful working collaboration and research partnerships between modern science and Buddhism — two of the world's most fruitful traditions for understanding the nature of reality and promoting human well-being. The Santa Barbara Institute is dedicated to interdisciplinary research and education to advance understanding of the nature and potentials of consciousness. Its comprehensive approach integrates the insights and techniques of contemporary science with those of the world’s classic contemplative and philosophical traditions. The Mind/Brain/Behavior Interfaculty Initiative at Harvard is an interdisciplinary community of investigators whose research aims to elucidate the structure, function, evolution, development, and pathology of the nervous system in relation to human behavior and mental life. The MBB community draws broadly from all the schools of the University to bring together scholars - from undergraduates to faculty - with a common commitment both to empirical research and to multidisciplinary dialogue. The Greater Good Science Center is an interdisciplinary research center devoted to the scientific understanding of happy and compassionate individuals, strong social bonds, and altruistic behavior. While serving the traditional tasks of a UC Berkeley research center—fostering groundbreaking scientific discoveries—the GGSC is unique in its commitment to helping people apply scientific research to their lives. The Mindfulness in Education Network was established in 2001 by a group of educators, students of Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh. The founders identify mindfulness as an antidote to the growing stress, conflict and confusion in educational settings as well as an invaluable gift to give students. The purpose of the network is to facilitate communication among all educators, parents, students and others interested in promoting contemplative practice (mindfulness) in educational settings. The Emory University Contemplative Studies initiative combines scientific and humanistic research to assess contemplative practices as preventative healthcare. Two central projects of the initiative are the Emory Encyclopedia of Contemplative Practice, a definitive survey of contemplative practices throughout the world, and the Emory Research Database for Contemplative Practices, which focuses on the health benefits of contemplative practices in relation to clinical depression. The University of Michigan Program in Creativity & Consciousness emphasizes interdisciplinary collaboration and the linking of consciousness to creativity, diversity, and sustainability in order to make an impact on today's educational landscape.
