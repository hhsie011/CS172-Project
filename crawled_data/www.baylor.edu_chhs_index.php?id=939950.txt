For over a half century, the faculty of the Department of Communication Sciences & Disorders has displayed an inextinguishable commitment to Baylor University's vision of excellence. As a result, in each of the past five years, the department has achieved an enviable top tier national ranking in the U.S. News Ranking of America's Best Graduate Schools. The Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders will continue to be a source of widely respected academic and clinical education as the work of its faculty and development of its programs progresses into the new millennium. The department is solidly founded upon an outstanding history during which it has graduated over 1,200 speech-language pathologists who provide treatments to over 60,000 speech, language and hearing disabled children and adults every week in America. On the local level, the department's clinic provides over 10,000 hours of community service each year to disabled children, the elderly, and all ages in between. Testimonials have clearly shown that the lives of children and their families have been significantly changed as a result of the treatment they received at Baylor's clinic. It is clear that the Department of Communication Sciences & Disorders has and will continue to have a significant impact on the global community, the local community, and the individual lives of children, adults, and families. CSD Strategic Plan Health, Human Performance & Recreation The Department of Health, Human Performance & Recreation is focused on diverse aspects of health, activity, recreation, and quality of life. These topics are particularly timely. At no time in our nation's history have we likely devoted such focused attention toward fitness, sport performance, health, and recreation. Among other activity- and health-related fields, graduates from HHPR will find great vocational opportunity in church recreation, outdoor recreation, exercise physiology, sport psychology, athletic training, health education, physical therapy, occupational therapy, medical practice, and nutrition. Human Sciences and Design Mission The Department of Human Sciences and Design at Baylor University prepares students to become professionals in business, education, and service careers that use the family and consumer sciences knowledge base and to assume individual, family and community roles as Christians in an increasingly complex global society. History The Department of Human Sciences and Design has made a huge impact since 1930, when home-economics based classes were first taught at Baylor. HSD Moving Forward The department continues to grow in numbers and productivity, but as growth occurs, needs increase. HSD Moving Forward includes the departments ambitious plans for the future. Occupational Therapy Mission & Goals To prepare practice scholars, educational innovators, and professional leaders who utilize clinically meaningful research in the implementation of best practice to meet the changing demands of the Occupational Therapy profession. The OTD faculty is committed to providing a learner-centered, occupation-based, hybrid program that prepares doctoral-degree-level occupational therapy practitioners with the requisite clinical reasoning skills and professional values to be responsive to the occupational needs of persons, organizations and populations within the communities they serve. This Mission Statement is consistent with that of the University and describes the unique role of the program in preparing graduates to be responsible citizens, educated leaders, dedicated scholars and skilled professionals who meet the workforce and healthcare needs of residents of Texas and beyond. Physical Therapy Mission & Goals The mission of the Baylor University Doctor of Physical Therapy program is to provide an innovative, faith-based education that develops responsible citizens, educated leaders, dedicated scholars and skilled professionals who are sensitive to the needs of a pluralistic society. We are committed to academic excellence, lifelong scholarship, and servant leadership within the profession and our worldwide community. We stand ready with exemplary knowledge and skills to prepare Doctors of Physical Therapy to deliver compassionate, interdisciplinary and patient-centered healthcare wherever they are called to serve. Baylor University will deliver an accredited DPT program that embraces the core values of the profession. Program Goals: Goal 1: Demonstrate a commitment to service and leadership in the institution, the community, and the profession. Goal 2: Enroll a student body that results in graduates who support the demand for physical therapists and rehabilitation services at the local, regional, and national levels. Goal 3: Efficiently develop competent career-focused physical therapists through innovative academic and clinical learning experiences. Faculty Goals: Goal 1: Role model servant leadership and professional responsibility to the institution, the community, and professional organizations. Goal 2: Integrate innovative teaching strategies and technologies that support the program's mission, enhance student learning, and optimize outcomes. Goal 3: The collective faculty demonstrate commitment to excellence in teaching scholarship and clinical practice. Student/Graduate Goals Goal 1: Demonstrate a commitment to evidence-based practice and professional growth through lifelong learning, critical inquiry, and mindful practice. Goal 2: Function in a professional, caring, ethical, and culturally competent manner, with a demonstrated advocacy towards the patient, community, and profession. Department of Public Health Our nationally accredited public health program includes a Bachelor of Science in Public Health (BSPH) degree, a Master of Public Health (MPH) degree with specialization in Community Health, and a joint BSPH/MPH degree. We prepare our students to promote healthy lifestyles and enhance quality of life for individuals and communities. Public health educators work in a variety of exciting work settings that include nonprofit community health organizations, public health agencies, worksite and health promotion programs, schools, university wellness programs, and voluntary health agencies (American Cancer Society, American Heart Association, etc.). The core competencies of the public health profession and those of a health education specialist serve as the framework for our curriculum. To date, 100% of our graduates who have taken the national certification exam have succeeded in becoming a Certified Health Education Specialist (CHES). Our strong practice-based approach, global health opportunities, and low faculty-student ratios provide our students with a quality learning experience that can enhance career development. Our students often tell us they enjoy the opportunities we provide for them to learn as they serve and serve as they learn.
