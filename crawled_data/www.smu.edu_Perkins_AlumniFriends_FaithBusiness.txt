Perkins’ mission to prepare women and men for faithful leadership in Christian ministry extends not only to students and ministry professionals but also to laypersons and the larger community. In support of this, Perkins hosts a number of Faith and Business Luncheons per year as well as an annual Public Life Personal Faith Scholarship Luncheon for critical reflection on the intersection of public life and personal faith. Prominent leaders in the community are asked to share how personal theology informs business practice from their unique perspectives. Details for the next Faith and Business Luncheon will be coming soon. For more information about Faith and Business Luncheons, contact perkinsgiving@smu.edu.
