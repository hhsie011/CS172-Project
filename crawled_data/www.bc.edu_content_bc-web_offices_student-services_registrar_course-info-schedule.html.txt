Syllabi Course Information & Schedule (Authenticated User) Course Information & Schedule (Public Version) In summer 2018 the eSyllabus program was replaced by a new tool called Syllabus Search. Syllabus Search, which is integrated with the Canvas LMS and BC Services, provides instructors more flexibility with designing and sharing their syllabi and provides students easier access, advanced searching, and real-time updates of syllabi. Important: Alumni are requested to contact the course instructor or academic department for copies of old syllabi.
