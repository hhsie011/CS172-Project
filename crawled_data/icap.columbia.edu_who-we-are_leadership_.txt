One of the world’s leading public health experts, Dr. El-Sadr was instrumental in demonstrating that it is possible to effectively scale up HIV prevention, care, and treatment services in resource-limited settings. She and her ICAP colleagues led the world’s first multi-country HIV treatment program—enrolling nearly 14,000 women and children in sub-Saharan Africa and Thailand in HIV treatment at a time when skeptics deemed this to be unfeasible. This achievement formed the basis of one of ICAP’s key guiding principles: quality health care should be available to everyone. Today, more than 2.5 million people around the world have accessed HIV care through ICAP support.
