At Brown, "P" courses must be taken in courses with History Department faculty, with very few exceptions. These exceptions must be discussed with one's concentration advisor. Abroad or at other institutions, the "P" requirement can be fulfilled only in a course offered by a history department. Please bring syllabi to a concentration advisor to verify that the course meets the requirement. General principle: at least 2/3 of a course's content must be dedicated the "premodern" era--however defined by the field--for the course to fulfill the "P" requirement.
