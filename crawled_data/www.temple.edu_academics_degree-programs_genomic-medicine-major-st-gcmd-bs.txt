This 123-credit undergraduate degree will prepare you for research and medical careers focused on genomic medicine, which uses DNA evaluation in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of patients. Graduates of the Genomic Medicine program gain a foundation in the life sciences that emphasizes the medical relevance of genomics, evolutionary biology and informatics. Scientific innovations and technologies allow biologists to collect datasets of unprecedented size and scope. At the center of this advancement is the study of the genome. Information from thousands—and soon to be millions—of genomes reveals the underlying basis of human development and insights into the causes of many diseases. Due to the growing clinical emphasis on genomic medicine in medical colleges, Genomic Medicine students form a solid basis for understanding and working with modern biological data. Genomic Medicine BS graduates can comprehend principles that govern the interaction between and within cells, tissues and organisms; critically evaluate experimental data and be familiar with computational and laboratory procedures; identify the biochemical and biophysical principles that underlie living organisms and diseases; investigate different types of diseases and their genomic basis; understand the levels of organization and evolution of living organisms; and understand the role of genomes and evolution in health, disease and medicine. The Genomic Medicine Major will prepare you to lead growing medical trends in professional research and health science fields. Additionally, because genomic medicine is rooted in the study of disease, evolution, genomics and informatics, graduates are positioned for careers across multiple research areas. Any undergraduate students already pursuing a degree in the College of Science and Technology are encouraged to apply and potentially transfer into the program. Pre-medicine Track Blending psychology and sociology courses with an increased focus on courses required by most medical schools—biochemistry, cell structure and function, and bioinformatics or biostatistics—the Pre-medicine Track prepares Genomic Medicine graduates for entry into medical school and STEM research careers in medicine. The curriculum also includes three courses that are typically recommended or required by most medical schools. Learn more about the Genomic Medicine BS Pre-medicine Track. Classes & Curriculum Classes you may take as part of the Genomic Medicine Major include the following. Genomic Foundations of Medicine Introduction to Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Introduction to Problem Solving and Programming in Python Pathophysiology of Genomic Medicine Learn more about courses in the Genomic Medicine Major program.
