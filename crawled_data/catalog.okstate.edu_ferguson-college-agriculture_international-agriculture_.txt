International Agriculture International Agriculture Overview Courses The Master of International Agriculture Program is a multidisciplinary degree program, preparing students for successful careers in global agriculture. Blending theory, practical knowledge, and hands-on experience, the program prepares students to make significant contributions to the field of international agriculture. There are two degree options within the Master of International Agriculture Program: Master of Agriculture and Master of Science. The Master of Science in International Agriculture program accommodates those students who prefer to take theoretical courses preparing them for research. This program will provide students the theoretical, science and research backgrounds necessary to design, implement, and manage agricultural programs in developed and developing countries. It allows participants to blend theory and practice to improve the lives of people. A Master of Agriculture in International Agriculture prepares candidates for positions in the public and private sectors related to international agricultural development and marketing. Graduates work in international agribusinesses, non-profit organizations, development agencies, government and diplomatic service, education, agricultural extension, agricultural trade associations and commodity groups, and other positions in global agriculture. Admission Requirements A baccalaureate degree in Agriculture or a related field is required for admission. The candidate must meet requirements for acceptance into the Graduate College and be recommended by the departmental graduate committee responsible for the program. Degree Requirements The requirements for this degree are the same as those listed in the Catalog, Graduate College section, under "The Master's Degree." In addition, each candidate approved for study under this program will be assigned an advisor, who will assist the student will developing an advisory committee with whom he or she will develop a plan of study in accordance with guidelines and requirements established in the department responsible for the program. Dr. Karl Rich, Director Master of Agriculture in International Agriculture (MAIA) The Master of Agriculture in International Agriculture (MAIA) is a multidisciplinary degree program that provides students the diverse background necessary to design, implement and manage agricultural programs in developed and developing areas. The program prepares candidates for positions in the public and private sectors related to international agricultural development and marketing. Graduates work in international agribusinesses, non-profit organizations, development agencies, government and diplomatic service, education, agricultural extension, agricultural trade associations and commodity groups and other positions in global agriculture.
