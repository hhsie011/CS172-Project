Faculty from materials science, chemistry, physics, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering, form two interdisciplinary research groups and focus on two-dimensional atomic sheets and zero-dimensional molecular clusters. Outreach and education is critical to the center and it seeks to provide graduate and postgraduate training in research and other professional skills, to guide hands-on instruction in materials science, to support local students and teachers, and to encourage student research at all levels.
