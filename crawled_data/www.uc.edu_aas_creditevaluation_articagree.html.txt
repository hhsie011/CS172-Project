UC has articulation agreements with several colleges across the country (below). Transfer opportunities are not limited to the schools/programs listed here. If your school/program is not on the list, contact the Transfer & Transition Advising Center to review your coursework and discuss transfer opportunities. Each Articulation Agreement* includes both formal agreement language (duration, signatures, etc.) and a student-centered, faculty-driven Transfer Degree Map that includes a semester-by-semester pathway! Explore by institution below to see if your college/university and major has an articulation agreement. *Transfer Degree Map model began in September 2019. Any agreements prior to this time may not include a semester-by-semester pathway. Transfer Degree Maps Transfer Degree Maps are clear paths between select associate degrees at local community colleges and compatible bachelor's degrees at UC. Based on the articulation agreements below, we have mapped out some clear paths between select associate degrees at local community colleges and compatible bachelorâ€™s degrees at UC. Although the idea behind a Transfer Degree Map is that you complete your associate degree at your community college and continue to finish your baccalaureate degree at UC, each guide offers a semester-by-semester course comparison, so you can decide the best time to transfer. We realize, transferring to a new college is a big step. That is why we are here to help. Please contact the Transfer & Transition Advising Center with any questions you may have and we will help you on your way. Accessible versions We are currently working on converting all Transfer Degree Maps to screen reader-friendly versions. In the meantime, if you require assistance, please email advhelp@ucmail.uc.edu.
