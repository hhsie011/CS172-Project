Through service learning, the needs of both the community partner and student are considered equally in the development of projects and service initiatives. In addition, in service learning there is an emphasis on critical reflection in which students are asked to make connections between course content and the service experience. What is the definition of service learning at Texas Tech? Service learning links civic engagement and learning outcomes and opportunities through thoughtfully organized service that meets the needs of the community. This service is a structured activity with an emphasis on reflection, which provides opportunities for students to learn and develop through critical reflection.
