The Master of Science in Health Promotion Management is a collaborative program that combines foundational health promotion courses taught by industry experts with the world-class management courses provided at the Edwin L. Cox School of Business. Our Mission The M.S. in Health Promotion Management (MS HPM) provides a multidisciplinary, evidence-based program for those seeking leadership positions within the Population Health and Health Promotion fields. Our hybrid program merges managerial communication and leadership skills with scientific foundations in epidemiology and behavioral science. Students develop the research skills required to critically evaluate the wellness needs of diverse populations and develop interventions that cultivate a healthy culture. Why a Health Promotion Management Degree at SMU? It is estimated that half of the U.S. population will be obese by 2030. The burden of disease is rising in the United States and many communities and employers are struggling to compete with the increasing costs of healthcare. Addressing these issues is imperative, especially as the healthcare system continues to change, and the number of individuals living with chronic disease continues to climb. Health promotion is an actionable measure that helps Americans live healthier, happier lives. This program prepares students to be the leaders that shape the growth of the health promotion field. Our world-class business and management courses, provided at the Edwin L. Cox School of Business, and foundational health promotion courses create savvy professionals. Our students bring a full spectrum of skills, particularly the ability to work on interdisciplinary teams.
