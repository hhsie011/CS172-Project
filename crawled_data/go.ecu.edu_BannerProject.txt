A project is a temporary, planned undertaking with a definitive beginning and end that follows guidelines and creates a unique product, service or result based upon specific, agreed-upon outcomes. At East Carolina University, projects include but are not limited to: Software development Application modifications Server implementation Network installation/configuration Web development Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software implementations Projects go through a review process governed by Information Technology and Computing Services (ITCS). The process involves an assessment of the feasibility, risk and complexity of the requested project. Requests are then categorized to ensure that complex, enterprise-level IT projects are planned, organized, documented, managed and completed in a timely manner while providing superior service to the university. ITCS prioritizes projects each quarter based on the following schedule: Task Timing 1Q22 Dates 2Q22 Dates 3Q22 Dates 4Q22 Dates Begin new quarter priorities 1st business day of new quarter 1/4/2022 4/1/2022 7/1/2022 10/3/2022 Announce to ITCS and campus stakeholders Monday after prioritization prior to new quarter 12/20/2021 3/21/2022 6/20/2022 9/26/2022 CIO/Direct Reports prioritization meeting 3rd Thursday afternoon of month prior to new quarter 12/16/2021 3/17/2022 6/16/2022 9/22/2022 Technology Planning & Priorities Committee (TPPC) 3rd Wednesday of month prior to new quarter 12/15/2021 3/16/2022 6/15/2022 9/21/2022 Administrative Systems Committee (ASC) 2nd Wednesday morning of month prior to new quarter 12/8/2021 3/9/2022 6/8/2022 9/14/2022 Academic Technology Committee (ATC) 2nd Wednesday afternoon of month prior to new quarter 12/8/2021 3/9/2022 6/8/2022 9/14/2022 Deadline for business cases/matrix to committee chairs from PMO 1st Friday of month prior to new quarter 12/3/2021 3/4/2022 6/3/2022 9/2/2022 Deadline for submission of new projects to consider Monday before 1st Friday of month prior to new quarter 11/29/2021 2/28/2022 5/31/2022 8/29/2022 Related Links ITCS Top 25 Project Dashboard Available To Faculty, Staff Complete the Request There are three REQUIRED information sections of the form.
