Visit Us Brown University is situated in the heart of historic Providence, Rhode Island, approximately one hour south of Boston and three hours north of New York City – both large metropolitan cites accessible by train. However, you need not travel far to find rich culture and diverse activities in Providence. Providence is an ethnically- and culturally rich city, with world famous ethnic cuisine scattered in and about the city, as well as many artistic outlets along with a rich mix of colonial architecture on Benefit Street. Brown Engineering is located at the Engineering Research Center, at 345 Brook Street, Providence (and also at the adjoining Barus and Holley Building, Giancarlo Lab, and Prince Lab.) You can access the main lobby on Brook Street between Waterman and George Streets.
