Our History Clemson University has long understood the importance of examining the social world. Even as far back as 1908 when Clemson was still an agricultural school, sociology courses could be found in the course catalog. Sociology continued to be a regular part of the curriculum until the late 1970s when it became its own degree program. Anthropology was added much more recently in 2013 and Criminal Justice quickly followed suit in 2017. The addition of these new disciplines to the department provided an innovative approach to Clemson’s long tradition of the pursuit of social understanding. Now, the Department of Sociology, Anthropology, and Criminal Justice boasts seven degree programs and thousands of alumni. Mission & Vision Mission Our mission is to be a student-centered learning community engaged in excellent research, teaching, and service. Through the lens of each of our disciplines, we are committed to coming together to provide insights and actions to further fairness and equity through all the institutions, systems, and individuals with which we engage. Vision Our vision is to be a multidisciplinary community of scholars committed to excellence in teaching, research, and engagement through the application of innovative and rigorous theories and methods to elucidate complex social and cultural realities from local to global communities in pursuit of a more just society.
