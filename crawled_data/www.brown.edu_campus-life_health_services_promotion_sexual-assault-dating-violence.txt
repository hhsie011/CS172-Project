Sexual Violence: Key Terms SEXUAL VIOLENCE: A sexual act committed against someone without freely given consent. Sexual, gender-based, interpersonal and relationship violence are often used interchangeably to include behavior motivated by gender & power that occurs without consent. SEXUAL ASSAULT: Any sexual activity that happens without consent, including penetration, sexual touching, or removal of safer sex methods. Power differences, based on identity and role, can contribute to coercion. Consent for one sexual activity does not imply consent for others.
