Kitt, together with fellow Columbia Brian Yorkey ’93CC and Kwei-Armah, created The Visitor, a musical based on Thomas McCarthy’s acclaimed independent film of the same name. The Visitor's storyline has current resonance as our nation struggles with issues of immigration, race, identity, and understanding across differences. As the show's publicity states, “Widowed and living alone, Walter is a college professor whose life has lost a sense of purpose. When he discovers two young undocumented immigrants living in his New York apartment, the drummer Tarek and jewelry maker Zainab, Walter finds himself in the middle of their battle to stay in an America that’s lost its better angels.” During this program, originally produced for Columbia At Home in September, you will watch a video clip of a song from the show, and also show and discuss “Oh, Columbia,” the song Kitt composed in May for the 2020 virtual Commencement. Introduction by Isheeta Ganguly, Columbia Public Health graduate, class of 1998. https://columbiauniversity.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_aWwGBhPtSlWsCNyoEjmLTA Contact Information CAA Global and Diversity Engagement [email protected] Upcoming Events Columbia Alumni Center 622 West 113th Street, Mail Code 4525 · New York, NY 10025 Phone 212-851-7800 Contact Us [email protected] Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
