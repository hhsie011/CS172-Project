Increasing attention focused on ceramics in the 1960s to meet the needs of materials capable of withstanding the extreme environments in nuclear reactors and space-crafts. Today, research in ceramics is vital for advances in electronics and telecommunications, devices for energy conversion, storage and harvesting, catalysts and sensors, vehicle and personnel armor, as well as for ferro/piezo-electric devices, micro-mechanical systems, permanent magnets, automobile engines, and biomedical applications. Much work on various aspects of oxide and non-oxide ceramics in the form of nanoparticles, coatings, and bulk solids for a variety of structural and (multi)functional applications under ambient and extreme environment is being pursued by MSE faculty. Ceramics form the basis of two start-up companies led by MSE faculty, and a number of centers and multi-disciplinary research programs have ceramic materials as their core. The faculty listed below, have identified Ceramics as one of their primary research areas based on material form.
