Skip to main content Biomathematics @Harvard Seminar series and resources for students, faculty, and other researchers across the Harvard schools Home Events Resources People Join The goal of the Biomathematics @Harvard is to bring together researchers across the university and city who use mathematics to understand biological systems relevant to the life and medical sciences. Our signature event is the Biomathematics Seminar Series, which provides a forum for local researchers to discuss their work within the community, as well as a platform for hosting visiting mathematical biologists. We hope to include the researchers from the fields of population genetics, theoretical biophysics, infectious disease epidemiology, systems biology, biomathematics, quantitative physiology and many more. Our events are open to students, staff, faculty, and other members of the research community. For the 2019-2020 academic year, seminars were held Thursday at 430pm at the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics in Harvard Square We thank the office of the Dean of Science for generously supporting this initative. The Biomathematics @Harvard is currently on hiatus. If you are a Harvard-affiliate who would like to take over organization, please contact the previous organizers Kamran Kaveh and Alison Hill.
