At St. John’s, you help make the world a better place. We create opportunities for students to gain inspiration from their individual faith traditions by volunteering, fighting injustice, and serving those in need. Service Our Mission St. Thomas More Church Make a World of Difference Gathering Together The church is the center of the Queens campus and our mission. What happens here nourishes what happens in all of the classrooms and labs, and on all of the campuses and playing fields, preparing our students to go forth in love and service. St. Thomas More Church Your Home on Campus Whether you are a resident or commuter student, Catholic or another faith, make Campus Ministry your home at St. John's. We welcome all students to take part in programs and discussions that deepen their faith while contributing to life in our academic community and beyond. Campus Ministry Answering the Call You have what it takes to be a leader. St. John’s helps you fulfill your potential by combining sound management sense with faith-based values through programs like VITAL (Vincentian Initiative to Advance Leadership) and the Ozanam Scholars Program. See where your talents will take you. Leadership & Development Taking on the Status Quo If you do not like what you see, change it. That is the example St. Vincent de Paul set by fighting poverty and injustice—and that is what you can do through St. John’s many programs devoted to social action. In fact, some of the most meaningful lessons our students learn are through actively helping to create a better world—socially, politically, and economically.
