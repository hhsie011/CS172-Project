Program Information The Program in Russian, East European and Eurasian Studies (link is external), an affiliate of the Princeton Institute for International and Regional Studies (link is external), draws on a core faculty in the humanities, history, and social sciences to support and maintain a diverse undergraduate curriculum. The program offers a certificate of proficiency to undergraduates who combine study of Russia, Eastern Europe, and Eurasia with any other departmental concentration from the humanities and social sciences to the natural sciences and engineering. The program's purpose is to provide undergraduates with expertise in a core language of Eurasia – for most students that would be Russian – and a scholarly grounding in the study of the region. Other languages applicable toward the certificate include Polish, Czech, the languages of Southeastern Europe (Romanian, Bulgarian, and Bosnian-Croatian-Serbian), and Turkish, the last being related to most Central Asian languages as well as some in the Caucasus and in Russia. Russian, East European, and Eurasian Studies offers preparation for government service, international business and finance, law, media, science, teaching, nongovernmental organizations, and other aspects of global affairs. As such, courses from many departments count toward the certificate. The program is compatible with all concentrations. Information and Departmental Plan of Study To be eligible for admission to the Program in Russian, East European, and Eurasian Studies a student must meet the following requirements by the end of his or her sophomore year: Satisfactory completion of the established requirements for admission to one of the cooperating departments or to a department whose plan of study may be combined with this interdepartmental program. Initiation of study of the Russian language or other target language. Students without previous training in Russian are advised to begin their study not later than the first term of the sophomore year and earlier if possible. A student choosing to pursue a Certificate of Proficiency in Russian, East European, and Eurasian Studies must complete the normal requirements in their department as well as the following requirements of the program. The proposed course of study must be approved each term by the director. Program of Study To obtain the certificate students choose one of the two tracks currently offered by the Program, the Russian and Eurasian Studies (RES) track, or the East European Cultures and Societies (EECS). Russian and Eurasian Studies (RES) track The Russian and Eurasian Studies track is offered to undergraduates who combine study of Russia and Eurasia with any departmental concentration: from the humanities and social sciences to the natural sciences and engineering. Course Requirements In addition to the language requirement, the certificate requires students to complete four regular courses in the following disciplines: History: One course on the history of the Russian empire, the Soviet Union, or Eurasia. Literature: One course in the literatures of Russia and/or Eurasia. Social Sciences: One course in the anthropology, sociology, politics and/or economics of Russia and/or Eurasia. Plus 1: One additional course from the three main subject areas or from a list of preapproved specialty courses. Languages Expertise in a core language of Eurasia is central to the program. Applicable languages include Russian and Turkish, students whose primary language is Russian must successfully complete one Russian-language course beyond 207, or otherwise achieve this level of competence. Students in the program whose focus is Turkish must complete the equivalent of the second year in that language. Native speakers and students with previous training in any of the languages of Eurasia can fulfill the language requirement by demonstrating intermediate proficiency on a placement examination.
