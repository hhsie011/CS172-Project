Furthermore, we work with families to meet the full demonstrated financial need for students who satisfy all deadlines and eligibility requirements. More than 75 percent of aid is in the form of gift aid—money that doesn’t need to be repaid. This includes need-based grants and scholarships from all sources. To see your financial aid summary, visit your Financial Aid Summary and Tasks (FAST) page, available in the navigation bar at the top of this page. How Financial Aid Works We use available funds from federal, state and university sources to meet your full USC-determined financial need. Your eligibility is based on two factors: the Cost of Attendance and your Expected Family Contribution, as calculated by USC. Please see the How Aid Works page for more information.
