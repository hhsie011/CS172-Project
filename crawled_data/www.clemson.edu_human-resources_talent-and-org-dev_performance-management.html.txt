The goal is to automate our current process in order to increase efficiency and effectiveness, reduce manual processing and increase collaboration between employees and supervisors throughout the performance management process. OnBase-Performance includes an online planning and evaluation form, automated workflow and electronic storage. OnBase-Performance will be implemented in three phases to correspond with the Budget Center's current performance period group (PDF). Each group will begin using OnBase-Performance at the beginning of their performance period to establish plans for the new performance year.
