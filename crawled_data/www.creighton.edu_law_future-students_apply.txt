Transcripts LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS): A Credential Assembly Service (CAS) report with all official transcripts must be submitted for all post-secondary education. The CAS report must be from the current application year. You may register for these services at LSAC’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS). LSAT Scores The Law School Admission Test (LSAT) is required of all applicants. You can register for the exam and request materials at the LSAC web site. Tests are given at centers throughout the country. You are advised to take the examination the year before you expect to enter law school. Taking the LSAT in June of the year that you want to enroll is permissible to be considered for admission in the fall, however, applicants must have submitted the application through LSAC by the respective deadline. LSAC no longer reports scores older than five years plus the current testing year either to law schools or to candidates. Personal Statement One of the goals of the Admissions Committee when making decisions is to admit a diverse student body that will contribute to a dynamic, interesting learning environment. Although academic background and strength of performance (LSAT and UGPA) are important, they are not the only criteria evaluated in the application process. For this reason, a personal statement, written by you, is required as part of the application. Your personal statement should be about you. It is helpful for the Committee to know what inspired you to go to law school or why you want to become a lawyer. Statements about law in general or law and society are not useful to letting the Committee know you. The statement should illustrate the life experiences and talents that make you unique. You are invited to write about significant obstacles that you have overcome and events in your life that influence your perspective. The personal statement should be no more than two double-spaced, typed pages. Resume Applicants are required to submit a descriptive resume of no more than three typed pages. Please include details about your educational background, honor societies, scholarships, work history, military service, extracurricular activities, public/community service, honors and awards, publications, foreign language proficiencies, and any other significant achievements and involvements. As to work history, include a complete and chronological list of positions (including organization name, dates of employment, and hours worked). Character & Fitness On the application for admission, applicants will find several questions relating to criminal history and academic discipline. If an applicant answers “yes” to any question in the character and fitness section, he must provide an attachment explaining that response and providing full details about his actions and the charges or sanctions against him. For any charges that must be reported, an applicant must include the original charge, indicate the level of felony or misdemeanor, final disposition of case (including level of charge in negotiated plea and sentencing). In addition to a bar examination, there are character, fitness, and other qualifications for admission to the bar in every U.S. jurisdiction. Applicants are encouraged to determine the requirements for any jurisdiction in which they intend to seek admission by contacting the jurisdiction. Addresses for all relevant agencies are available through the National Conference of Bar Examiners. See qualifications specific to Nebraska. Additionally, once you matriculate to law school, you are under a continuing duty to report any violations of Character and Fitness. Letters of Recommendation Letters of recommendation evaluate the applicant’s prospect for success in law school and in the legal profession. The most helpful letters of recommendation are those that address the applicant’s academic background, analytical abilities, communication skills, and strength of character. Each applicant must submit at least two, but no more than three, letters of recommendation. To ensure letters of recommendation are considered during the application review process, submit them directly to LSAC for inclusion in the applicant’s Credential Assembly Service (CAS) report. They should be on file with LSAC when the application is submitted. Please visit LSAC’s CAS to learn more. Supplemental Statements Some students may wish to address deficiencies in their academic history or performance on standardized tests. This should be done in separate addenda, and should not exceed one double-spaced, typed page.
