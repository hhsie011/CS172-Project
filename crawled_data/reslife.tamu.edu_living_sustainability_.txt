One way we have done this is through submitting and receiving Aggie Green Fund grants. The Aggie Green Fund (AGF) began in 2011 and provides funding for sustainable projects on campus not currently being paid for by A&M. It offers two types of grants that students, faculty, and staff can apply for. Since 2011, they have funded over 60 projects with funding amounts totaling over 1.7 million dollars. If you are interested in proposing your own sustainable project to the AGF, visit the Aggie Green Fund website to learn more about how to submit a proposal and the projects that have been done since the fund was created. To the right you will find a list of grants received from the AGF that were submitted by faculty, staff, and students. If you have any questions about a specific grant or would like help with creating your own proposal, please feel free to email sustainability@reslife.tamu.edu.

With over 100 recycling bins in the residence halls, all students have the opportunity to recycle and protect the environment. Funding for the bins come from various projects like the Aggie Green Fund and the Keep America Beautiful campaign, to name a few. In 2013, Residence Life received funding from the Aggie Green Fund to install three-stream recycling bins in the residence halls. These bins enable students to conveniently recycle plastic, aluminum and paper. For a map of recycling bins close to you, please see the attached map. https://utilities.tamu.edu/campus-recycling-locations/ Utilities Because of its direct impact on carbon emissions emitted from generating energy for our residence halls, we work closely with the award-winning Utilities and Energy Services on a regular basis to address any concerns about inefficiencies. By addressing these issues early, we increase the effectiveness of the residence halls’ systems and maintain a high living standard for students living in the residence halls. Water Bottle Filling Stations In 2015, Residence Life installed 74 water bottle filling stations throughout the residence halls, thanks to a grant from the Aggie Green Fund. This project reduces the amount of waste generated by encouraging residence to use refillable water bottles while also providing clean, fresh water to our students. Construction Projects Texas A&M strives to renovate and expand its buildings and infrastructure, which means LOTS of construction! Residence Life creates strategies to ensure we minimize wasted material from construction projects, saving resources in the process. Don’t Dump, Donate Have you ever started preparing to move out of the residence halls in the spring and discovered you acquired more stuff than you remembered? Instead of throwing away goods and contributing to the landfill, donate your material to the Don’t Dump, Donate program! TAMU ResLife partners with Goodwill during move out to give students that opportunity. Locations include parking lot 32 by Haas Hall, beside the south side parking garage, the White Creek Activity Center, and near the Activity Center at the Gardens Apartments. Drop-off times will be May 2-12 at 8:30am-4:30pm everyday (weekends included). Accepted items include electronics, small appliances (not including microwaves or TVs), clothing, towels and rugs, shoes, and other household items. If you have nonperishable food, you can also donate it to The 12th Can program at the Commons Front Desk, Hullabaloo and at the Goodwill trucks. Office Certification The Sustainability Office offers to evaluate your office’s sustainability levels. The qualifications for this certification range from easy tasks to more in-depth responsibilities. For more information, please check out the Sustainable Office Certification program.
