We do this by reviewing IP language in proposals and awards, crafting IP management and commercialization plans (if required), finding collaborative industry partners and writing or requesting letters of support. We don’t execute NDAs or MTAs for Clemson University We can connect researchers to the University resources within the Division of Research Office of Sponsored Programs who can assist wit executing these documents.
