The Pre-Veterinary Medicine option couples the strong biological sciences background of the Biology major with core animal anatomy and physiology laboratories and animal-focused science electives. Dedicated professional advisors work with Pre-Veterinary Medicine option students to integrate animal handling and other essential professional experiences during their time at OSU. Option Code: 584 Options in the Biology major require 15 or fewer additional credits (one term) beyond the basic Biology major, and most students can complete the additional Pre-Veterinary Medicine option course work in four years. Completion of the Pre-Veterinary Medicine option requires a 3.0 cumulative GPA in major and option course work. Courses used to satisfy the Pre-Veterinary Medicine option requirements also satisfy the Physics\Computer Science and Quantitative Applications, Organismal Biology, Physiology, Writing Intensive Course and Experiential Learning or Integrative Biology Elective requirements in the Biology major. Several courses may also be used to satisfy areas of the Baccalaureate Core. Students may not pursue either the Pre-Veterinary Medicine, Pre-Dentistry, Pre-Medicine or Physiology and Behavior options within the Biology major—no dual combinations of these options are permitted. Students interested in private practice should also consider taking BA 260 or BA 315. For further information, see MyDegrees or the Integrative Biology website.
