Speaker Giovanni Bazoli is the president emeritus of Intesa Sanpaolo, president of the Giorgio Cini Foundation, and emeritus professor of law, Università Cattolica di Milano. His restructuring of the Banco Ambrosiano after the troubled 1980’s brought him onto the world stage and led to the institution's ranking among the top banking groups in Europe. Bloomberg News describes him as "a law professor turned dealmaker who transformed an institution wracked by scandal into Italy’s most valuable lender through a series of acquisitions; ...a behind-the-scenes financier known for discipline, not drama." He has urged a "complete rethinking of the market economy" in this "critical moment for democracy," and said that "the problem is not globalization itself, but how it was handled or mishandled." The author of several books, Bazoli was also instrumental in the establishment of the Gallerie d'Italia, a modern and contemporary museum in Milan.
