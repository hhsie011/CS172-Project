There are five councils of the UWB GFO whom are responsible for representing the will of the faculty. The Executive Council (EC) advises the Chancellor and Vice Chancellors on all academic matters. The EC is advised by the work of the UWB GFO councils on Academic Standards & Curriculum (CCASC); Promotion and Tenure (CCPT), Planning & Budget (CCPB), Assessment & Learning (CCAL).

GFO will partner with UWB administration to implement the Unit Adjustment over the next 1-2 months. This Unit Adjustment is intended to reduce faculty salary compression by increasing faculty salaries that are calculated to be below a target level. UWB faculty engaged with the GFO, Elected Faculty Councils, and colleagues on the application to include completing a Unit Adjustment Survey. The full application, faculty feedback, and survey results are linked below and are housed in the GFO Policy and Reference Documents page.

GFO leadership developed the priority items in charge letters collaboratively with committee chairs, through individual discussions as well as a public discussion in the Oct. 26 Executive Council meeting. Taken together, these charge letters describe the work the GFO plans to do in the 2021-22 academic year. We welcome any questions or comments on these charge letters, directed to GFO Chair Jason Narnjo (jnaranjo@uw.edu) or to the chair of the relevant GFO committee.
