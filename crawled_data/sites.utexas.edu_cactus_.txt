For over a century, we have documented not only the history of the University but also the college experience. We show how the campus has grown from its original 40 acres when it consisted of one building, eight teachers, two departments and 221 students to a campus of over 350 acres, 50,000 students and more than 20,000 faculty and staff. With our photography, we try to document a campus that is not only the largest in the country but one that is as diverse as it is beautiful. With more than 775 organizations on campus, including more than 50 sororities and fraternities, students have the opportunity to find a place where he or she can feel at home. We are the timekeeper of traditions: Bevo, Torchlight Parades, Hex Rallies, Big 12 Championships and the lighting of the Tower. They are all part of what makes UT so unique, and they are all highlighted each year in the Cactus yearbook. Tweet Proudly powered by WordPress Social Widgets powered by AB-WebLog.com.
