You are considered an international student if you hold, or will need to obtain, a nonimmigrant visa. Academic Records All applicants for graduate study at Temple must have completed a postsecondary education program. To accelerate the admissions decision process, international applicants can submit a photocopy of transcripts to the department or program for which they are applying. If admitted, you must provide an official copy of academic records, including transcripts and the diploma or certificate you have earned, to the department or program to which you are applying. Submit an official copy that has been validated and sealed in an envelope by the academic institution where the postsecondary program was completed. You may also request that official postsecondary academic records be forwarded by the academic institution to the Temple department/program, or enlist the services of a credential evaluation organization approved by Temple University, as identified on the NACES website, and request that the evaluation be sent to the department/program. If academic records are not issued in English, official copies of native language records must be accompanied by a literal translation prepared by an appropriate university or government official. If you are uncertain about which academic records must be submitted to apply for graduate study, visit the World Education Services (WES) website and locate your home country. The requirements for Temple University are the same as those specified by WES. Note that a WES evaluation is not required. Temple University reserves the right to verify the authenticity of academic records, letters of reference and test scores.
