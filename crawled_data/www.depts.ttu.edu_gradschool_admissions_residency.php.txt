Texas Tech University Directory Raiderlink A-Z Index Graduate School Menu Search TTU Graduate School Admissions Residency Information Domestic Applicants Domestic applicants complete the core residency questions as part of the admission application. Your residency status is determined at that time. However, it is possible that your situation may have changed since your application was submitted. You may wish to be considered for residency reclassification. To be considered for residency reclassification, please submit the Residency Questionnaire to graduate.admissions@ttu.edu, in person in Administration Building Room 328, or by mail. Please note that you may be asked to provide additional documentation before your residency determination can be made. International Applicants International applicants complete the core residency questions as part of the admissions application; however, there are few visa categories eligible to establish a domicile for residency for tuition purposes. You may view a list of visas eligibleto establish a domicile for residency for tuition purposes. If your visa category allows you to establish a domicile for residency for tuition purposes, please submit the Residency Questionnaire to graduate.admissions@ttu.edu, in person in Administration Building Room 328, or by mail. Requests for reclassification must be submitted by the tenth class day (the second class day for summer terms) of the semester for the term for which you are trying to establish residency. This is because your residency status must be updated by the twelfth class day (the fourth class day for summer terms) in order for the change to take effect for that term, and we must have time to review each set of questions. Questionnaires received after that date will still be reviewed, but any updates to your residency status will not take effect until the following term.
