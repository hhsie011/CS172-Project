NEW PRINT CIRCULATION POLICY For the magazine to remain responsible stewards of natural and financial resources, we’ve made changes to our circulation policy for the print edition. For the September issue, contactable alumni and donors will receive the print edition, unless they have opted out of receiving print mailings. UWAA members and UW donors will continue to receive print issues quarterly. Alumni may still opt-in to receive the print edition. If you love our storytelling, please consider supporting UW Magazine by joining the UW Alumni Association.
