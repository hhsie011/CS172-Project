The University of Cincinnati Department of Housekeeping understands that our student, staff and faculty’s expectations for cleaning have changed due to the recent health concerns of the pandemic. That’s why we strive to deliver an even cleaner environment for the UC community with the implementation of top-notch cleaning chemicals in a rigorous cleaning and disinfecting program. We use Microban 24 sanitizing spray and Microban multi-purpose cleaner which kills 99.9% of bacteria and continues working through-out the day to provide long lasting protection for surfaces in your spaces. The 24 hour residual continues to work even after multiple touches. FM Housekeeping provides routine cleaning and custodial care to more than 100 UC buildings. Each building has staff assigned to perform specific service routines, on a scheduled basis including, but not limited to, the Baseline Services described below. Our commitment to you is to deliver a safe, reliable space with added confidence of industry-leading hygiene practices created to keep you safe. If you have any questions feel free to visit our Facilities Management website for further detail or call Work Control at 558.2500. Joyce M.
