Welcome to TUCRS The University of Tulsa's Center for Reservoir Studies (TUCRS) was initiated in 1999 by Professor Mohan Kelkar to conduct research on reservoir description and optimization at The University of Tulsa. The primary emphasis of this research is to apply new technology to oil and gas fields to improve the performance of these fields. The technologies include integration of different types of data for improving reservoir description and optimization of single-well performance by integrating reservoir properties with system analysis. The research is jointly funded by the oil industry and government agencies.
