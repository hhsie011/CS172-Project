The awards recognize instructors in small- and large-class categories who receive the highest scores on three Course Instructor Opinion Survey (CIOS) items — respect and concern for students, enthusiasm for the course, and ability to stimulate interest — and have at least a 70% response rate. The 40 most highly rated instructors to receive Honor Roll designations go on to receive the Annual CIOS Award next calendar year. The Ivan Allen College was second only to the College of Engineering in the number of instructors honored this semester. “These recognitions once again showcase the hard work, innovation, and passion of our faculty to engage with students in meaningful, impactful ways,” said Shatakshee Dhongde, associate dean for academic affairs. “We could not be more proud of each and every one of these recipients.” The Spring 2022 Ivan Allen College Spring CIOS Honor Roll Recipients are: Small Classes: Bianca Batti — ENGL 1102 Whitney Buser — ECON 4370 Seung‐Eun Chang — KOR 2002 Kelley Fong — HTS 2016 Lionel Gall — FREN 1001 Andrea Jonsson — FREN 4200 Bo Kyoung Kim — KOR 1002 Kathrin Koppe — GRMN 1002 Sophie Landrieux Kartochian — FREN 2001 Chao Li — CHIN 1001 Eliza Markley — INTA 3221 Kyoko Masuda — JAPN 3001 Aya McDaniel — JAPN 1002 Lee Oh — KOR 1001 Melissa Pilkington — SPAN 2002 Sonia Serafin — FREN 1001 Chad Slieper — PUBP 4843 Satomi Suzuki Chenoweth — JAPN 1001 Samba Sy — FREN 1002 Amanda Weiss,— ML 2500 Hongchen Wu — LING 2100 Large Classes: Dylan Brewer — ECON 2106 Aselia Urmanbetova — ECON 2105 Contact For More Information Michael Pearson michael.pearson@iac.gatech.edu Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Tumblr YouTube Flickr Instagram Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts Savant Building 631 Cherry Street NW, 1st Floor Atlanta, GA 30332 Phone: 404.894.2601 Fax: 404.894.8573 Map and Directions Website Feedback College Resources Contact Us / Find Us Faculty / Staff Resources IT Support Make a Gift Tours & Information Sessions EU General Data Protection Regulation Privacy Notice Ivan Allen College Schools School of Economics School of History and Sociology Sam Nunn School of International Affairs School of Literature, Media, and Communication School of Modern Languages School of Public Policy Georgia Tech Resources Campus Offices Visitor Parking News Center Campus Calendar Georgia Institute of Technology North Avenue Atlanta, GA 30332 +1 404.894.2000 Campus Map Directory Employment Emergency Information Legal & Privacy Information Human Trafficking Notice Title IX/Sexual Misconduct Hazing Public Disclosures Accessibility Accountability Accreditation ©2022 Georgia Institute of Technology
