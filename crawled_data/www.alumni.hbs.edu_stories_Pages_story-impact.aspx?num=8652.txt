For the past two years, HBS faculty have been examining the economic impact of the pandemic and its long-term effects, and the role fiscal support plays in spurring a recovery. They have also discovered that despite hardships, managers have become more resilient and flexible due in part because they have more readily embraced innovation. Meanwhile, many HBS alumni, in addition to helping their own organizations manage through the pandemic, have been leading initiatives to assist businesses and individuals that have been disproportionally impacted, especially women and minority communities, move past the crisis and flourish. Annual alumni giving to the HBS Fund fuels the School’s efforts to educate leaders who are equipped to navigate the challenges facing business and society today, such as those posed by the pandemic, as well as those that will arise in the future.
