The event will be hosted by the Department of Computer Science and the National Security Collaboration Center at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA). ACM is the world’s largest educational and scientific computing society. ACM WiSec is the leading ACM and SIGSAC conference dedicated to all aspects of security and privacy in wireless and mobile networks and their applications, mobile software platforms, Internet of Things, cyber-physical systems, usable security and privacy, biometrics, and cryptography. ACM WiSec is a very competitive, high-quality conference, and is very-well attended by industry, government, and academia to share information, network, explore ideas, and learn about emerging trends and today’s hottest and most provocative cybersecurity topics. This event is a great opportunity for like-minded colleagues, researchers, students, and industry to attend and learn about the current advances in the security and privacy field. This year’s event will take place at the beautiful River Walk in San Antonio, Texas where attendees will be able to stroll along lush riverside paths lined with tall trees, restaurants, shops and museums, and soak in the history of other historic monuments in San Antonio such as The Alamo. We are looking forward to welcoming everyone in San Antonio in 2022! Make sure to book your hotel stay at the Hyatt Regency San Antonio Riverwalk Hotel conference hotel. The Hyatt Regency San Antonio Riverwalk Hotel is at the center of the conference activity, and will allow you to network easily with other conference attendees. Also, it’s a quick trip to get to the program and functions, and just as quick to nip back to your room for a break. Note that the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) has a contractual obligation to fill a guaranteed block of rooms at the Hyatt Regency San Antonio Riverwalk Hotel. Significant financial penalties will be assessed should ACM WiSec 2022 fall short of the expected number of guest rooms. By staying at the conference hotel, you will enjoy the convenience of residing at the conference venue and provide valued assistance in support of ACM’s financial obligations. WiSec 2022 will be an in person event as was originally advertised. We will be at the luxurious Hyatt Regency San Antonio Riverwalk Hotel, in the heart of San Antonio from May 16 to May 19, 2022. The registration web page is now up. We recognize that some attendees (esp. authors) may still be unable to travel due to COVID-19 related restrictions or regulations in their home countries. We will provide a virtual option for such authors to present in these very special cases. ACM WiSec 2022 live streams.
