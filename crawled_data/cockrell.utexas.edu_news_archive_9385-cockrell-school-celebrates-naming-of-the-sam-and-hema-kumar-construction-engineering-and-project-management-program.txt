The Kumar CEPM program is named in honor of alumnus Sam Kumar and his wife, Hema, for their transformative gift to the program. Held on the fifth floor of Ernest Cockrell Jr. Hall, where the program is located, the in-person celebration included remarks from Cockrell School Interim Dean Roger T. Bonnecaze, Department of Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering Chair Bob Gilbert, Department of Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering Professor and CEPM Area Coordinator Carlos Caldas and Sam Kumar. Interlinking technical engineering and business management skills, the Kumar CEPM program equips students with a comprehensive education and prepares them to make an immediate impact in their careers. The program boasts many renowned research partnerships — including with the Construction Industry Institute, the Texas Department of Transportation, the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the National Science Foundation — that strengthen the program’s status as a globally recognized leader in construction engineering teaching and research. Upon completion of the program, graduates leave with the ability to change and improve the capital projects industry. The Kumar’s endowment will provide critical support for students, researchers and faculty, expanding the program’s reach and impact. “We are tremendously grateful for Sam and Hema’s investment in our CEPM program,” Gilbert said. “This gift will allow us to continue to recruit the best and brightest students and award-winning faculty. Sam and Hema have given us something priceless, which is the support to keep growing as leaders in engineering education, research and service. It’s an honor to receive this gift, and we look forward to seeing the impact it has for years to come.” Sam Kumar, who immigrated to the United States from India, earned his master’s degree from the construction engineering project management program in 1992 before commencing a successful career in the civil engineering industry. In 2000, Kumar founded Journeyman Group, now one of the most well-respected real estate development and construction firms in Texas. “Supporting the Kumar CEPM program and giving back to the community is important to my family,” Kumar said. “My hope is that this gift inspires future engineers who have immigrated to the United States, empowering them to use their time and their talents to change the world.” Photos: Sasha Haagensen Privacy Policy | Web Accessibility Stay up to date with Cockrell School news!
