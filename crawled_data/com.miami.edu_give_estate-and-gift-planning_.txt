When you make a planned gift to the School, you not only make a significant difference in its future and create your legacy, but you also become a member of the University’s prestigious Heritage Society. Our website is designed to introduce alumni, friends, faculty and staff to planned giving – one of the most powerful philanthropic tools available to the University’s benefactors. Making a gift to the School of Communication through a bequest or other planned giving vehicle ensures that the University can continue to carry out its mission of teaching, research and public service well into the future. What is Estate and Gift Planning? Estate and gift planning helps you maximize the personal benefits of your charitable giving and allows you to make gifts you might have thought impossible. Through advantageous tax treatment under both state and federal law, planned giving can be a way to make a gift and also enjoy the benefits of these laws. Establishing a planned gift within your own financial and estate plans requires careful thought, consideration and consultation with your own attorney, accountant or financial advisor. Our staff is available to work with you and your advisor(s) in confidence and with no obligation to help you explore the best possible way to make a planned gift. There are a number of planned giving vehicles you can use to make a gift to the School of Communication, depending on your particular goals. For example, you can: Make a bequest in a Will or Trust Gift a Life Insurance Policy Gift Retirement Assets Create a Retained Life Estate Create a Charitable Lead Trust Create a Charitable Remainder Trust Create a Charitable Gift Annuity Gift Real Estate, Tangible or Intangible Property To find out more about how you can leave a legacy at the University of Miami School of Communication, visit the Office of Estate and Gift Planning or contact: Kyle Paige, J.D.
