Goal The HSC Office of Diversity and Inclusion's goal is to enhance partnership across the schools on the Health Sciences Campus as we continue to promote an environment of inclusiveness through the understanding and celebration of the many differences in perspectives, thoughts, experiences, belief systems, and cultures of our students, faculty, and staff. With this goal in mind, it is our intention to provide support toward our efforts of excellence in education, community outreach, and research. Vision Our vision is to be a national model for health equity and inclusive innovation through excellence in education, research, patient care, and service. Mission Our mission is to provide evidence-based resources, advocacy, and support for faculty, staff, students, and administrators to enhance diversity and an inclusive environment in which to learn, work, and invest. Pillars Provide consultation to the University of Louisville community with the goal of developing best practices for equitable policies in our practices, procedures, and systems. Partner with university departments and organizations to ensure their policies and practices are more equitable, inclusive, and anti-racist. Use the practices of our division to model and support a culture of inclusion and belonging for the university community where historically oppressed community members are attracted, retained, and thrive. Provide education and training for internal and external campus stakeholders. Promote community engagement by creating mutually beneficial avenues for university stakeholders to engage with the broader city of Louisville community. The HSC Office of Diversity and Inclusion places a major emphasis on increasing the number of students from racial/ethnic groups designated as underrepresented into the health professions system. Emphasis is also given to recruiting, retaining and promoting a diverse workforce here at the Health Sciences Center for our schools of dentistry, medicine, nursing, and public health. The University of Louisville strives to foster and sustain an environment of inclusiveness that empowers us all to achieve our highest potential without fear of prejudice or bias.
