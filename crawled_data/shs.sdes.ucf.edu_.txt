The Health Center is located on the Main Campus, and satellite clinics are located at the Rosen, Health Sciences, and Downtown campuses. Our services are designed with students’ needs in mind. Students’ primary care consultation and evaluation by our health providers are covered by the Health Fee, included in their tuition. Additional services/materials are either billed to insurance or you can take advantage of our low self-pay prices. If you require a service we do not offer or prefer to see an in-network provider, our Referrals department can assist in getting you where you need to go.
