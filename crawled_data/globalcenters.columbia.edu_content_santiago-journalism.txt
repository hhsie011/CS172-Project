Under that partnership, the Center kicked off 2021 by hosting a dynamic, interactive workshop in Spanish to prepare journalists in Chile to review, understand and properly investigate and report company finances, using Netflix’s financial results as an example. Workshop author and presenter, finance journalist Sara Silver (JRN, BUS’01) reviewed the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow, as well as US financial disclosure laws, short selling, and active versus passive investing. In other "The Future of Journalism" events, Columbia University School of Journalism Professor Daniel Alarcón and Crónica Estéreo Editor Francisco Aravena (JN'03) reviewed all that goes into planning, producing and airing podcasts; Andie Tucher, the director of Columbia University's Communications Ph.D. Program, presented the webinar “Fake News: History and Evolution;” and Bruce Shapiro, Executive Director of the Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma, and Ari Goldman, who teaches the course “The Journalism of Death and Dying,” delivered the heartfelt webinar “Documenting Death: Obituaries During the Time of Coronavirus.” Related News April 14, 2022 Quality Journalism Webinar Series In this series, we addressed the development of journalism amid political, social, and technological developments in the world.
