The Multiple Sclerosis Center at Rhode Island Hospital offers comprehensive and multidisciplinary care to our patients, as well as cutting edge research. Our Fellows are an important part of the team at the Center. Our service offers an established MS clinic to patients for diagnosis and care that affords Fellows the opportunity to follow our patients, be a part of clinical research and clinical trials and learn from our faculty. Fellowship Director: Syed Rizvi Goal The goal of the Multiple Sclerosis Fellowship is to train fellows from diagnostic consultation to long-term multidisciplinary care including the latest clinical trials and therapies. Program Overview The Clinical Fellowship program is designed to give Fellows a thorough experience in all aspects of the care of MS patients.In addition to direct patient care within the MS Center, Fellows are required to participate in new and ongoing clinical research. The training regimen begins with the differential diagnosis of MS and related disorders. This is followed with the classifications of Multiple Sclerosis and determination of the differing treatments. Education in how best to interpret MRI's and other imaging modalities along with ongoing sympotomatic management are components of the training experience. A critical aspect of Fellowship training is for Fellows to follow affiliated faculty in order to gain experience in the fields of neuro-opthalmology, neuro-radiology, rheumatology, and neuro-rehabilitation. Once completed, our Fellows are experienced and ready to meet the challenges presented by Multiple Sclerosis. Length of Training 1 Year Prerequisites Successful completion of an ACGME or AOA-accredited Neurology residency. Training schedule Most training takes place at Rhode Island Hospital. The monthly schedule includes 24 blocks per month in the MS Clinic continuously over the 12 months as follows: 4 blocks per month in specialty clinic (to include neuro-ophthalmology, rheumatology, neuro-radiology and neuro-rehabilitation) 8 blocks per month of dedicated research time continuously over the 12 months 4 blocks per month of administrative/didactic time continuously over the 12 months 4 weeks vacation Conferences Neurology Grand Rounds: Wednesdays at 8:00am; Weekly Neuroradiology Conference: Wednesdays at 12:00 Noon; Weekly Fellows are required to give scheduled talks at the Noon Conferences for neurology residents and medical students in such subjects as diagnosis, management and current clinical trials in the field of Multiple Sclerosis. Attendance at national conferences is expected. These conferences include: The American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting The Consortium of MS Centers (CMSC) How to Apply Please provide: Letter of interest CV 3 letters of recommendation, one of which should be a letter from your current Program Director Requests for information and applications should be sent to: Syed Rizvi, MD, Program Director Clinical Multiple Sclerosis Fellowship Rhode Island Hospital 593 Eddy Street, APC 5th floor Providence, RI 02903 phone: (401) 444-3799 fax: (401) 444-2838 email: [email protected] Core Faculty Syed Rizvi, MD is the Director of the Rhode Island Hospital Multiple Sclerosis Center and an Associate Professor of Neurology, Clinician Educator at The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University.
