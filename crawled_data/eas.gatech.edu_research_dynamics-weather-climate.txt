Paleoclimate research at Georgia Tech is focused on reconstructing and understanding abrupt climate change and the long-term behavior of the tropical climate system. Research on marine systems includes both the coastal zone and open ocean problems including ocean modeling, sea-level rise, biogeochemical cycling, remote sensing and paleoceanography. Our students are trained with a variety of observational, theoretical, computational, and data science approaches to explore underlying dynamics and to conduct cutting-edge research towards improved understanding and predictions.
