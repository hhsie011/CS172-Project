Educational Foundations, Leadership and Aviation Overview Courses Undergraduate Programs Graduate Programs Certificates Minors Faculty Chad Depperschmidt, EdD—Associate Professor and Interim School Head Kathy Curry, EdD—Associate Professor and Associate School Head The School of Educational Foundations, Leadership, and Aviation (SEFLA) offers degrees, options or certificates in the following areas: aviation and space; school administration; educational psychology; educational technology; school library media, online teaching; higher education; college student development; research, evaluation, measurement and statistics; and social foundations. These programs conduct scholarly inquiry and educate professionals in areas foundational to thought and practice in a wide variety of professional roles associated with business and educational and industry settings. Consistent with the goals of OSU's Professional Education Council's Core Concepts and Goals Statement, the faculty strives to demonstrate and perpetuate teaching that is based on theory and research-driven educational practices. We provide specialized training at the undergraduate and graduate levels yet permit flexibility to enable students to meet individualized goals. General information about undergraduate degrees is offered under the "University Academic Regulations" section of the Catalog. General information about graduate degrees may be found in the "Master's Degree," “Certificates,” "Doctor of Education," or "Doctor of Philosophy" areas of the "Graduate College" section of the Catalog. Financial support is available for research assistantships and for qualified graduate students to assume teaching responsibilities under faculty supervision. Selections for assistantships are made in the spring semester for the following academic year. Interested individuals are encouraged to apply through the SEFLA website. OSU NASA STEM Education Projects. Susan Stansberry, Professor of Educational Technology is the Principal investigator for the OSU NASA Education Program, NASA STEM Pathway Activities--Consortium for Education (NSPACE). OSU is the lead institution in activities supporting NASA’s goal to improve STEM instruction; increase youth and public engagement in STEM; enhance the STEM experience of undergraduate students; better serve historically underrepresented groups in STEM fields; and design education for a needed STEM workforce. The NSPACE project leverages the skills and expertise of a group of innovative partners, including 13 institutions within the Texas A&M University System, Langston University, OSU’s Center for Sovereign Nations, Northern Oklahoma College, the Oklahoma 4-H Foundation, and the Technology for Learning Consortium. NSPACE supports STEM activities at Johnson and other Space Centers for K-12 students, educators, and community college and undergraduate students. NSPACE offers a broad and varied portfolio of opportunities to involve students and educators in hands-on experiences and research applications on Earth, in the air above Earth, and in the microgravity environment of space. Activities are "as only NASA can" and are designed to support NASA Education's goals of strengthening the Nation's future workforce, attracting and retaining students in STEM disciplines, and engaging Americans in NASA's mission. NSPACE's portfolio of 15 STEM Engagement activities (https://education.okstate.edu/departments-programs/educational-foundations-leadership-aviation/nasa.html) are available to students of all ages, but primarily at the university level. In the first two years of our five-year cooperative agreement, we have reached over 337,000 students and over 82,000 educators in 51 states and territories. Bringing International Space Station (ISS) downlinks into classrooms; facilitating high school students' design, prototyping, and manufacturing of hard and soft goods sent to the ISS; challenging college students to design and create spacesuit informatics using AR or to compete in an engineering design challenge; providing internships for students; and facilitating the Year of Education on the ISS are just a few of the activities this project supports.

Admission to HESA graduate programs is competitive and based on multiple considerations. HESA website Social Foundations Guoping Zhao, PhD—Professor and Program Coordinator Social foundations of education is an interdisciplinary study of schooling and other forms of education. Ever since it began during the 1930s at Teachers College of Columbia University, social foundations has brought together scholars who situate education in historical, philosophical, economic and social contexts. Using the tools of the humanities and the social sciences, social foundations scholars ask perennial questions, such as: What is the purpose of schooling in a democracy? What knowledge and values should be taught and to whose benefit? How are issues of race, ethnicity, social class, gender and ability manifested in schools? Drawing from history, philosophy, sociology, anthropology, international studies and other disciplines to teach their courses, faculty in the social foundations program area ask that educators reflect critically on the social and cultural dynamics in educational settings and how policy and practices might be improved. Students from other human service professions and other disciplines are invited to make similar use of the content of these courses for their professional practice. SCFD website Programs/Options Degrees Degrees offered through SEFLA programs include Bachelor of Science (BS), Master of Science (MS), Education Specialist (EdS), Doctor of Education (EdD) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD).

Social Foundations (SCFD) Guoping Zhao, PhD—Professor and Program Coordinator Social foundations of education is an interdisciplinary study of schooling and other forms of education. Ever since it began during the 1930s at Teachers College of Columbia University, social foundations has brought together scholars who situate education in historical, philosophical, economic and social contexts. Using the tools of the humanities and the social sciences, social foundations scholars ask perennial questions, such as: What is the purpose of schooling in a democracy? What knowledge and values should be taught and to whose benefit? How are issues of race, ethnicity, social class, gender and ability manifested in schools? Drawing from history, philosophy, sociology, anthropology, international studies and other disciplines to teach their courses, faculty in the social foundations program area ask that educators reflect critically on the social and cultural dynamics in educational settings and how policy and practices might be improved. Students from other human service professions and other disciplines are invited to make similar use of the content of these courses for their professional practice. MA in Social Foundations of Education The MA in Social Foundations of Education is designed for those who are interested in increasing their knowledge base in history, philosophy, sociology, and anthropology of education and their research skills and critical and creative thinking skills. The degree will enhance current practitioners' and leaders' marketability and their capacity to earn professional development credits and pay raises. It will also prepare those who wish to continue on to earn a Ph.D. or another terminal degree in education and related fields. The curriculum is geared toward providing students with a strong foundation in theory and research, bridging together community service and outreach. To be considered for admission to the MA program, applicants are expected to have an earned bachelor's degree with minimum GPA averages of 3.00 on a 4.00 scale. Rolling admission until July 1 for Fall admission and December 1 for Spring admission.
