It aims to engage students, scholars, and the general public through lectures, conferences, colloquia, and other events on campus. Board members represent a wide variety of schools and departments across the university, in the humanities, the social sciences, and the arts, including the Watson Institute and the Brown Arts Initiative. Established in 2016, the center is housed at the Cogut Institute for the Humanities and is supported by the French Embassy in Washington, DC and a generous gift from Pierre Sorel '92 and Mary Ann Sorel '92. Each year the French Embassy invites applications for major research projects relating to France. The Embassy is especially interested in initiatives that promote connections with research teams and universities in France. If you are interested in submitting a proposal, please contact the center's director or a member of the governing board.
