How do high-tech industries cope with the accelerating pace of technological, economic, and legal change? Does poor health in childhood lead to lower education? What are the effects of war and military occupation on the quality of life of populations? What are economic and racial disparities in the health care of older Americans? How do social structures and patterns of inequality influence the life chances of African adolescents? These are just a few of the questions that faculty and students in Brown's Sociology Department investigate. Faculty and students both work within the department and are linked to a variety of research centers at Brown—such as: Commerce, Organizations and Entrepreneurship (COE, formerly PPSO) The Center for Environmental Studies Ethnic Studies Graduate Program in Development (GPD) Population Studies & Training Center (PSTC) Sheridan Center for Teaching & Learning Social Science Research Lab (SSRL) Spatial Structures in the Social Sciences (S4) The Taubman Center for Public Policy Urban Studies The Watson Institute for International Studies In addition to considerable work in the United States and Europe, we do research in Africa, Central and South America, the Middle East, India, China, and the former Soviet Republics. The research and teaching of Brown sociology faculty is guided by the systematic and scientific investigation of human behavior and social life. Sociology connects. Sociology clarifies. Sociology empowers students to engage effectively with the world around them. We invite you to join us.
