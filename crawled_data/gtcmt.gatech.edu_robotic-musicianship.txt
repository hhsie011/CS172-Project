In our research, we combine computational modeling approaches for perception, interaction, and improvisation, with novel approaches for generating acoustic responses in physical and visual manners. The motivation for this work is based on the hypothesis that real-time collaboration between human and robotic players can capitalize on the combination of their unique strengths to produce new and compelling music. Our goal is to combine human qualities, such as musical expression and emotions, with robotic traits, such as powerful processing, the ability to perform sophisticated mathematical transformations, robust long-term memory, and the capacity to play accurately without practice. Robotic Musicianship Projects FOREST FOREST is the performative outcome of an NSF-funded project that enhances trust between humans and robots through sound. Skywalker This project aims to let amputees play musical instruments using a prosthetic hand. Shimon Shimon is an improvising robotic marimba player designed to create musical interactions with humans. Robotic Drumming Prosthesis The prosthesis attaches to amputees, allowing this technology to be embedded into humans, using two drumsticks. Robotic Drumming Third Arm This project explores how a shared control paradigm can influence and potentially enhance performance. Shimi This smartphone-enabled robotic musical companion can respond to and enhance your musical experiences. Questions?
