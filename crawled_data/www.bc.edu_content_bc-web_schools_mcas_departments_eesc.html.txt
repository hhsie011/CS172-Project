Our faculty integrate a strong commitment to education and outreach with an active, cutting-edge research program that addresses a broad array of topics in the Earth and Environmental Sciences spanning climate and environmental change, tectonics and dynamics of Earth’s interior, and the science of water throughout the Earth. Our undergraduate major programs and our graduate programs prepare students for careers in the geosciences and related fields. In 2020, we will welcome our first cohort of PhD students, adding to the longstanding tradition of our M.S. program. Research opportunities are available for students to work with our faculty studying the Earth’s complex evolving systems and the interrelations among the lithosphere, the hydrosphere, the cryosphere, the atmosphere, and the biosphere including the role of human society. Our students learn to be scientifically literate citizens of planet Earth, well prepared to address the challenges and opportunities of maintaining a habitable planet for future generations.
