You have a Title IV credit balance if your federal financial aid exceeds your charges for tuition, fees, university housing and meal plans for a term. What Do the Authorizations Say? 1. I authorize Baylor University to use any Title IV fund credit balance to pay any current miscellaneous charges that I incur, such as, but not limited to, parking, health insurance, and late fees. 2. If all current year institutional charges are paid, I further authorize any Title IV fund credit balance to pay any minor outstanding university charges from prior years, not to exceed $200. If a student says “Yes” to this question, federal funds can be used to pay for other charges like lost library books, parking permits, health center fees, etc. If a student says “No,” the university will send a refund by direct deposit (or check if direct deposit account is not set up) for the Title IV credit balance. A student who says “No” and has a parking fee on their account could have a hold for not making this payment out of pocket. What is Title IV Aid? Most types of federal student aid and loans are from Title IV of the Higher Education Act, and are included in this authorization. Funds include Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, Federal Academic Competitiveness Grants, National SMART Grants, Federal Direct Stafford and PLUS Loans, and Federal Perkins Loans. How Do I Complete the Authorizations? If you have been awarded Title IV financial aid and you have not previously completed the Title IV Credit Authorization, you should complete the authorization process via your BearWeb account by following this path: Student Financial Services > Student Account > Title IV Authorizations. What If I Don’t Grant the Authorizations? If you do not grant authorization, your federal financial aid and loans cannot be used to pay for charges other than tuition, fees, university housing and meal plans, and any excess aid will be refunded to you. This may negatively affect any financial plan you have in place. What If I Change My Mind? These authorizations are voluntary and will remain in effect for the duration of your Baylor University education. If you wish to rescind the authorization you may do so at any time by notifying the Student Accounts Office in writing at baylor.edu/sfs/contactus. What If I Have Questions? If you have any questions about these authorizations or about Title IV funds you have received, please contact the Student Accounts Office at baylor.edu/sfs/contactus, or by phone at 254-710-2311.
