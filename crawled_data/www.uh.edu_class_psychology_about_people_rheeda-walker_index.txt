Biographical Summary Rheeda Walker, Ph.D. is a licensed clinical psychologist whose program of research emphasizes two understudied areas—suicide science and African American adult mental health. Communities throughout the United States are chronically underserved, in part due to social and cultural barriers. This is perhaps especially true of mental health initiatives. All of Walker’s scholarly work has focused on suicide, and it correlates toward the primary goal of developing culturally-relevant models of mental health and well-being.
