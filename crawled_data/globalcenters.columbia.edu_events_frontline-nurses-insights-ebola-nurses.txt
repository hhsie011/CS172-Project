For the past two years, Columbia faculty on a project sponsored by the Women Creating Change initiative of the Center for the Study of Social Difference have been working to understand how nurses on the frontlines of Ebola succeeded in ending that outbreak, using the methods of oral history to elicit nurses' stories and analyze their significance for health care policymakers going forward. At this event, you will hear the voices of the Ebola nurses, understand their insights, and consider the implications for all of us today in the battle against COVID-19.
