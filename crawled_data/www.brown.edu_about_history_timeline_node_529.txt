Their actions were spurred by a 1991 announcement that four varsity sports, including volleyball and gymnastics, would have their funding cut. When the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear its appeal in 1997, Brown settled, restoring funding to women’s gymnastics and volleyball and elevating women’s lightweight crew, water polo and equestrian teams to varsity status.
