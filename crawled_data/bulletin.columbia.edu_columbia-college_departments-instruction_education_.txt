We offer three tracks in Education: Educational Studies, Urban Teaching-Elementary/Childhood Education, and Urban Teaching-Secondary/Adolescent Education. In these tracks, students develop a critical lens for looking at the issues facing public schooling and consider ways to promote fair and inclusive policies and practices for all children in our public system. The program is open to all undergraduates at Columbia (BC, SEAS, GS, CC) who are interested in becoming certified teachers, working with young people in human service agencies, or preparing for careers related to education. Educational Studies Major: This major is an interdisciplinary program for students who wish to understand, critically analyze, and conduct research on the role of education in society. Students who pursue the major in Educational Studies learn to evaluate educational policy, practice, and research through a critical, equity-oriented lens. Our graduates are prepared to act creatively for peace, justice, and sustainability in a range of local and global educational contexts. Currently, the major in Education Studies is open to Barnard College students only. Education Studies Minor/Special Concentration: This track prepares students to pursue graduate studies or positions in public policy, sociology, history, youth studies, philosophy, psychology, and other areas where K-12 education is frequently a focus of coursework and scholarship. Students learn to think deeply and knowledgeably about the manner in which schools socialize as well as educate citizens, and examine how the interests of different stakeholders are privileged or neglected. The courses are linked by a focus on educational inequality and youth studies. This track does not lead to certification. All three tracks are minors (BC) or special concentrations (CC, GS, SEAS) and are intended to complement a major's disciplinary specialization and methodological training. In addition to the requirements of the minor/special concentration, students must complete a major. Urban Teaching Minors/Special Concentrations: Our goal is to prepare students to become skilled and reflective teachers who can effectively respond to the learning needs of diverse learners, and create supportive and intellectually stimulating classroom communities. Students learn to create innovative curriculum; gain experience observing, tutoring, and teaching a diverse range of children and young people; develop confidence in their role as teachers who can promote fair and inclusive school practices; and graduate with certification to teach in New York. (Note: we are part of an interstate agreement for reciprocal certification with many other states.) This program is registered by the New York State Department of Education and accredited by the Association for Advancing Quality in Educator Preparation (AAQEP). These tracks prepare students to obtain a teaching position as a certified teacher upon graduation and/or to pursue graduate studies in education, public policy, sociology, youth studies, and other related fields. Student Learning Outcomes Knowledge of Self: Students investigate how educational experiences in and out of school affect their vision for teaching and learning, use that knowledge to reflect upon and critique their practice, and set goals for continuing growth as equitable, multicultural educators. Knowledge of Students: Students understand the importance of getting to know the children and youth in their classrooms; develop specific strategies that aid in understanding students’ needs, capacities, interests, funds of knowledge, and social identities; and construct learning experiences that are responsive and relevant to their students. Knowledge of Content: Students develop knowledge and skills to critique the social, political, cultural, and historical forces that construct traditional content knowledge and design academic content that is dynamic, inquiry-based, and encompasses multiple literacies, and cultural perspectives. Knowledge of Pedagogy: Students experience, practice, evaluate, and reflect on a range of constructivist, inclusive, critical, collaborative, and authentic methods for engaging students in learning and in assessing learning outcomes Knowledge of Context: Students investigate the complex ways in which social, political, cultural, and historical forces shape school contexts, including students’ opportunities in schools, teacher empowerment, effective leadership, roles of parents and the community, and patterns of similarity and difference across schools. The Education Program is accredited by Teacher Education Accreditation Council (TEAC) to recommend students who complete the program for Initial Certification in either Childhood Education (Grades 1-6) or Adolescent Education (Grades 7-12). Graduates of the program are also eligible for membership in the Interstate Certification Agreement, a reciprocal certification among forty-one states. We provide ongoing support to those who teach in the New York City area through our New Teacher Network. To apply to the Urban Teaching tracks, please visit our website. Students are encouraged to apply for admission by March of the sophomore year but no later than the first Tuesday in September of the junior year. Those who plan to study abroad during junior year should apply by the spring of the freshman year, but no later than the first Tuesday in September of the sophomore year and take the Inclusive Approaches and Multicultural Pedagogy courses in the fall and spring of sophomore year. Admission criteria include good academic standing; evidence of commitment to the field of education; interest in issues of social justice issues as they affect education, particularly in urban schools; and capacity for growth as an intellectually resourceful and reflective teacher.

This seminar serves as the capstone course for students pursuing the Education Studies minor/special concentration or the Urban Studies major/concentration with an Urban Education Specialization. The Seminar in Urban Education explores the historical, political and socio-cultural dynamics of urban education in the U.S. context. Over time, a range of social actors have intervened in the “problem” of urban education, attempting to reshape and reform urban schools. Others have disputed this “problem” focused approach, arguing that policy makers, teachers, and researchers should start from the strengths and capacities located in urban communities. Despite decades of wide ranging reform efforts, however, many urban schools still fail to provide their students with an adequate, equitable education. Seminar in Urban Education investigates this paradox by pursuing three central course questions: 1) How have various social actors tried to achieve equity in urban schools over time? 2) What are the range and variation of assets and challenges found in urban schools? and 3) Considering this history and context, what would effective reform in a global city like NYC look like? Students will engage these questions not only through course readings and seminar discussions, but through a 40-hour field placement in a New York City public school classroom, extra-curricular program, or other education based site.

This seminar will engage prospective teachers in developing effective strategies for teaching at the elementary school level in ways that draw upon five specific domains of knowledge: knowledge of self, content, pedagogy, context and students. Students will be introduced to a variety of teaching approaches and develop ways to adapt them to teach various subjects to students in urban public school settings, understanding the intellectual, social and emotional needs of elementary school students. Students will learn to write lesson plans, develop assessments and practice teaching in “microteaching” sessions taught to peers. We will explore state standards, approaches to classroom management, and Universal Design for Learning as we develop approaches to create caring, democratic learning communities.

What does it mean to be an excellent teacher? The Seminar in Secondary Multicultural Pedagogy will engage this question as you work to develop methods for teaching your subject(s) in ways that draw upon five specific domains of knowledge: knowledge of self, content, pedagogical methods, context, and students. You will be introduced to a variety of multicultural teaching approaches and develop ways to adapt them to your particular subject area and to the intellectual, social, and emotional needs of adolescent learners. Throughout the course, we will consider how to effectively differentiate instruction for and support ELL students and students with special needs. Seminar sessions will include discussions, presentations of lessons, group activities, and problem-solving issues teachers encounter in the classroom. We will explore culturally responsive approaches to: learning; learning standards; instruction and assessment; creating caring, democratic learning communities; selecting curriculum content, and engaging all students in learning. Assignments will ask you to reflect on the teaching/learning process in general, and on the particulars of teaching your academic discipline. We will accomplish this through lesson planning, practice teaching two mini-lessons, observing your peers teaching and offering feedback, and exploring stances and strategies for multicultural pedagogy in your content area.

Critical literacy is an approach to teaching and learning that focuses on developing students’ abilities to read, analyze, understand, question, and critique hidden perspectives and socially-constructed power relations embedded in what it means to be literate in a content area.

Globalization and mass migration are reconfiguring the modern world and reshaping the contours of nation-states. New technologies that facilitate the movement of information, goods and people across borders have made it easier for people to remain culturally, politically, economically and socially connected to the places from which they migrated. This seminar focuses on the experiences of the youngest members of these global migration patterns—children and youth—and asks: What do these global flows mean for educating young people to be members of the multiple communities to which they belong? This seminar will explore the following questions: What is globalization and why is it leading to new patterns of migration? How do children and youth experience ruptures and continuities across contexts of migration? How do language policies affect young people’s capacity to be educated in a new land? What does it mean to forge a sense of belonging and citizenship in a “globalized” world, and how does this challenge our models of national citizenship? How are the processes by which young people are incorporated into their new country entwined with structures of race, class, and gender? Drawing on fiction, autobiography, and anthropological and sociological research this class will explore these questions from a variety of disciplinary perspectives Spring 2022: EDUC BC3040 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment EDUC 3040 001/00446 T 12:10pm - 2:00pm 203 Diana Center Thea Abu El-Haj 4.00 14/16 EDUC BC3042 Gender, Sexuality, and Schooling . 4 points. Broadly, this course explores the relationship between gender, sexuality, and schooling across national contexts. We begin by considering theoretical perspectives, exploring the ways in which gender and sexuality have been studied and understood in the interdisciplinary field of education. Next, we consider the ways in which the subjective experience of gender and sexuality in schools is often overlooked or inadequately theorized. Exploring the ways that race, class, citizenship, religion and other categories of identity intersect with gender and sexuality, we give primacy to the contention that subjectivity is historically complex, and does not adhere to the analytically distinct identity categories we might try to impose on it.

This seminar serves as the capstone course for students pursuing the Education Studies minor/special concentration or the Urban Studies major/concentration with an Urban Education Specialization. The Seminar in Urban Education explores the historical, political and socio-cultural dynamics of urban education in the U.S. context. Over time, a range of social actors have intervened in the “problem” of urban education, attempting to reshape and reform urban schools. Others have disputed this “problem” focused approach, arguing that policy makers, teachers, and researchers should start from the strengths and capacities located in urban communities. Despite decades of wide ranging reform efforts, however, many urban schools still fail to provide their students with an adequate, equitable education. Seminar in Urban Education investigates this paradox by pursuing three central course questions: 1) How have various social actors tried to achieve equity in urban schools over time? 2) What are the range and variation of assets and challenges found in urban schools? and 3) Considering this history and context, what would effective reform in a global city like NYC look like? Students will engage these questions not only through course readings and seminar discussions, but through a 40-hour field placement in a New York City public school classroom, extra-curricular program, or other education based site.

Many people don’t think of themselves as having attended segregated schools. And yet, most of us went to schools attended primarily by people who looked very much like us. In fact, schools have become more segregated over the past 30 years, even as the country becomes increasingly multiracial. In this class, we will use public schools as an example to examine the role race plays in shaping urban spaces and institutions. We will begin by unpacking the concept of racialization, or the process by which a person, place, phenomenon, or characteristic becomes associated with a certain race. Then, we will explore the following questions: What are the connections between city schools and their local contexts? What does it mean to be a “neighborhood school”? How do changes in neighborhoods change schools? We will use ethnographies, narrative non-fiction, and educational research to explore these questions from a variety of perspectives. You will apply what you have learned to your own experiences and to current debates over urban policies and public schools. This course will extend your understanding of key anthropological and sociological perspectives on urban inequality in the United States, as well as introduce you to critical theory.

The rise in political polarization and social inequality over the past few decades has challenged the ideals that public schools were founded on nearly two centuries ago. In the past few years, we have witnessed a surge in homophobic, racist, misogynist, and xenophobic rhetoric in our society and our schools. At the same time, teachers in classrooms across this country have been engaged in the difficult work of challenging oppression and injustice in their schools, communities, and nation. These teachers know that the future of our democracy is at stake. Using a historical and sociological framework, this course examines the past and present conditions that have led to political polarization, escalating inequality, and persistent injustice. It seeks to examine the lineage of racism, sexism, nativism, and imperialism on our nation and its schools and to consider the extent to which these challenges are uniquely American or part of a more global phenomenon. It offers an introduction to the deep current of American social, political, and economic culture that many argue has produced the challenges that our nation faces today: personal and political gain marred by intolerance, derived from wealth, and rooted in the history of segregation, sexism, and exploitation. Instead of seeing these challenges as separate entities, the course acknowledges the intersectional nature of power and politics. Students will consider how these conditions affect their roles as educators and the lives of the youth and families in their schools and communities. They will leave the course with a deeper appreciation and understanding of the historical and sociological antecedents that have contributed to polarization, inequity, and injustice around the globe.
