The Subscription Service, with an annual fee, provides law firms and other organizations with quick and easy access to the Law Library, as well as discounted rates and access to materials from other on-campus libraries. The Document Delivery Service is a pay-as-you-go program for firms, nonprofits, and individuals not affiliated with Columbia University.
