Academic advising supports the University's mission of preparing students for learning beyond the confines of the academy. Academic Advisors assist students in interpreting University policies and procedures. They also help students navigate the academic and organizational paths of the institution.

Depending on a student's major, this may be a faculty advisor or a staff advisor. All Pre-Business students are assigned to professional staff advisors in the Academic Advising Center. Students are encouraged to meet with their Advisor when they have questions or need assistance. An appointment for this meeting should be made by accessing your Advisor's calendar in CU Navigate. Advisors meet with students one-on-one to address questions, concerns, and circumstances of each individual. All students must meet with their assigned Advisor at least once prior to registration for the next semester. Graphic Communications students are advised by the Graphic Communications Department. Economics B.A. students are advised by the Department of Economics. Once students have completed the Pre-Business program, all other majors are advised by their respective departments. Accounting Economics B.S. Finance Management Marketing Non-Pre-Business students who are interested in changing their academic program to a business degree should follow these instructions.
