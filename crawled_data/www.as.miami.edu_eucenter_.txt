The Miami-Florida EU Center is one of the ten universities in the United States awarded by the European Commission as Centers of Excellence. In addition, the University of Miami is also a recipient of a Jean Monnet Chair “ad personam” awarded to Professor Joaquín Roy. By providing relevant programs and academic activities, the Center educates university students about the European Union and its institutions. Special lectures and academic conferences throughout the year include students, faculty, and visiting scholars. The Miami Center has a unique focus on triangular transatlantic relations between Europe, the United States and Latin America. Given Miami’s strategic location as a gateway to Latin America, this concentration is relevant to the academic scholarship generated by the Center and Jean Monnet Chair.
