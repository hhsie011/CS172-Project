Over the past two decades, biomedical knowledge has grown exponentially, giving us utterly new insights into how life works. Leading the Biomedical Revolution in Precision Health Our unrivaled atmosphere of interdisciplinary exploration and collaboration has produced many of the innovations that sparked a biomedical revolution: MRIs, gene splicing, and stem cell medicine were all born on the Stanford Medicine campus.
