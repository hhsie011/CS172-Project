The project kicked-off with a stakeholder workshop in Istanbul to discuss current problems and solutions regarding health literacy and health care access issues among refugees. The project team then conducted a qualitative photovoice study with young refugees and local youth in Istanbul, in addition to in-depth interviews with health workers and policymakers to assess the current trends and gender-specific needs for digital tools including mobile apps to access health information and services among refugees. In this online photo exhibition and panel, the findings of the photovoice study will be shared with the aim of raising awareness on using digital health technologies for health promotion in forced migration settings.
