Consisting of reprints of photographs from the collection of the North Carolina Museum of History in Raleigh, Look Again highlights the evolution of the photographic process from the end of the 19th century through the 20th century and features several daguerreotypes, ambrotypes, tintypes, and glass-plate negatives for patrons to view and read about. Coinciding with Look Again: Discovering Historical Photos traveling exhibit, a number of historic photographs from Joyner Library’s collection are on display as well. Curated by Patrick Cash, Joyner Library’s Assistant University Archivist, and Larry Houston, Joyner Library’s Conservator, these photographs feature some of the oldest and rarest images found in Joyner Library’s Special Collections. Images from the East Carolina Manuscript Collection feature examples of the earliest photographic processes developed during the 19th century. Included in these is a rare photograph from Eadweard Muybridge’s 1878 series “Horse in Motion.” Wednesday, June 1 at 9:00am to 8:00pm More dates through July 24, 2022 Thursday, June 2 at 9:00am to 8:00pm Friday, June 3 at 9:00am to 8:00pm Saturday, June 4 at 9:00am to 8:00pm Sunday, June 5 at 9:00am to 8:00pm Monday, June 6 at 9:00am to 8:00pm Tuesday, June 7 at 9:00am to 8:00pm Wednesday, June 8 at 9:00am to 8:00pm Thursday, June 9 at 9:00am to 8:00pm Friday, June 10 at 9:00am to 8:00pm Saturday, June 11 at 9:00am to 8:00pm Joyner Library, Janice Hardison Faulkner Gallery Greenville, NC 27858-4353 Event Type Exhibition Departments Joyner Library Target Audience Students, Faculty, Staff, Public, Alumni, Pre-college Hashtag ##photographs Contact Name Charlotte Daniels Contact Phone Number 2523280287 Contact Email fitzdanielsc16@ecu.edu Subscribe Google Calendar iCal Outlook Individuals requesting accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) should contact the ADA Coordinator at least 48 hours prior to the event at (252) 737-1018 / ada-coordinator@ecu.edu.
