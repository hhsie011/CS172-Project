Administered by the Department of Microbiology under the School of Life Sciences. The undergraduate BS degree in BioHealth Sciences (BHS) is designed for students seeking an interdisciplinary background in the life sciences, public health, and social sciences. The major consists of a comprehensive core with a strong biological and physical science foundation combined with a variety of health and social science courses. The BHS degree is designed to prepare students to enter a variety of careers requiring a bachelor’s degree, such as health care administration, human services and various technical positions, and to further the advancement of those already in health-related careers. Students may elect to complete one transcript-visible option in Pre-Clinical Laboratory Science, Pre-Dentistry, Pre-Medicine/Pre-Podiatry, Pre-Optometry, Pre-Pharmacy, Pre-Physical Therapy, or Pre-Physician Assistant. An option is not required for degree completion, but these are designed to provide students with excellent training for a variety of professional programs. Options for the BHS major require additional credits beyond the stand-alone BHS major requirements, and completion of specific courses not currently offered through Ecampus. These courses must be taken either in person at an OSU campus or via transfer credits. Most full-time students can complete the BHS degree requirements plus the additional course work related to degree options in four years. Major Code: 606 Apply scientific knowledge from multiple fields to critically analyze health-related problems. Communicate science and health concepts, data, and analytical arguments clearly, professionally, and concisely; both verbally and in writing. Practice flexible professional skills needed for careers in health sciences professional fields. Recognize, evaluate, and respond appropriately to the needs of a diverse demographic population. Students majoring in BioHealth Sciences cannot seek a dual or double major in Biochemistry & Biophysics, Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Biology, Microbiology or Zoology.
