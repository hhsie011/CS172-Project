The University is proud to have many undergraduate and graduate students who served or are serving in our country’s armed forces. Veterans enhance our community through the experiences they bring to campus and their commitment to education. SMU refrains from providing commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on securing enrollments or federal financial aid (including Tuition Assistance funds) to any persons or entities engaged in any student recruiting, admission activities, or making decisions regarding the award of student financial assistance. Our goal is your goal – finding success at SMU. Through a collaboration of offices across campus, this website contains information from applying to the University through graduation specifically tailored to students using VA education benefits.
