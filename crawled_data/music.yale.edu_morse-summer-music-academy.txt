Over the course of four weeks, students are taught and mentored by a team of music educators from the New Haven Public Schools and Teaching Artists from the Yale School of Music. This program offers opportunities for growth in musicianship, technique, and personal achievement. During a typical Morse Summer Music Academy season, family and friends are invited to attend concerts featuring Morse Academy students. Performances take place weekly in Morse Recital Hall and in such nearby locations as Yale Cross Campus, Beinecke Plaza, the Yale University Art Gallery, and the New Haven Free Public Library. The Morse Academy concludes with a final concert in Morse Recital Hall. Morse Academy students participate in: large ensembles seminar instruction sectional rehearsals private coachings chamber music pop-up chamber music concerts across New Haven a field trip to the Norfolk Chamber Music Festival/Yale Summer School of Music Special Thanks The Morse Summer Music Academy is made possible through a generous endowment established by Enid and Lester Morse (Yale College ’51) and is offered free of charge to students in the New Haven Public Schools. The friendships formed with the teaching artists and other students gave our child a sense of belonging.
