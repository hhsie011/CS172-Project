Population served Counseling Center Phone 206.543.1240 Address 401 Schmitz Hall Hours M, W, Th, F: 8 a.m. – 5 p.m. T: 9:30 a.m. – 5 p.m. Follow us Instagram Facebook Featured services We currently provide care through several different platforms: For students in crisis or outside of Washington State, use our 24/7 multilingual support services mySSP to be connected with a counselor for individual counseling or crisis support. Get virtual drop-in support from a counselor during the academic quarter via Let’s Talk. Psychiatric care is available by referral from Hall Health or UW Medicine and cannot be directly scheduled. You can start by making an appointment with a general practitioner at Hall Health (206.685.1011) or UW Medicine (206.520.5000) for medication evaluation. If you are interested in an one-time appointment or short-term counseling with a therapist, schedule the appointment via our Student Portal. For students in the state of Washington, services are provided via secure video platform or via in-person meetings. If you’re located outside of Washington, use mySSP to connect with a therapist for individual counseling and crisis support. There is no out-of-pocket cost associated with receiving individual counseling for current UW students who pay the Services & Activities Fee. However, because our services are short-term in nature and with limited resources, we may refer you to ongoing therapy services. Meet our staff Learn more about Counseling Center staff. Career support Students can utilize PathwayU to help explore their career goals. We offer brief psychologically and culturally-informed individual career counseling to currently registered UW Seattle matriculated students. During your visit, you and your counselor will explore a range of subjects that will help you gain greater self-awareness or clarity about your academic and career goals. As a result, you’ll be better able to decide on potential majors and careers. Some of the areas your counselor may discuss with you include: Cultural/family beliefs and values that have impacted your education and career prospects Family expectations of what you should study or which careers you should consider Your preferences for geographical location, preferred work environments, family needs, etc. Your interests, motives, skills and values Frequently asked questions What should I do if I don’t have a private space for my video or phone visit? If you do not live alone, it can be challenging to find a private, secure place for video or phone communication with your counselor. Here are some suggestions: Talk in your parked car or the parked car of a friend or relative. Use a yard, patio or other outdoor area. Call from a bathroom or walk-in closet. If you are working outside your residence, use a private room at your place of work if one is available. If you live in a shelter, hotel or other group or temporary housing and do not have a private room, consider asking a staff member or volunteer to help you identify a private space for the session. If you live with people who are supportive and understanding, consider asking them to stay in another room or go for a walk so you can have privacy during the session. If you have a private room but are concerned that other people could overhear you, it may help to: If you can, wear headphones with a built-in microphone so others cannot hear what the counselor says. You can hold the microphone close to your mouth to avoid having to speak very loudly. Put a towel or blanket along the bottom of the door to add soundproofing. Play “white noise” or other background sounds near the door of the room. You can use a white noise machine or an app that has white noise or nature sounds. If accessing a private, secure place to talk with a counselor remotely is a challenge, please let us know when you schedule your appointment. We can help you identify a more private space for your first secure video visit. We can also explore whether other options might be available for you.
