We strive to place every freshman and many transfer students in one of our honors or community programs providing students with the support and company of other students, mentors, faculty and staff. Honors and Small Learning Communities Our efforts speak for themselves. Over the last ten years, we have doubled the number of natural sciences graduates due, in part, to student success through small academic communities. Participating in academic community programs results in higher GPAs, faster graduation rates, and success in future careers. Student Organizations We also host an abundant student life program allowing students to join and lead organizations suited to their specific career and societal interests. College of Natural Sciences students enjoy the resources and networking of a large science college with the freedom to explore their own interests - or develop new ones. Discover your community.
