In the first five years after launching the Pathways to Diversity and Inclusion action plan, Brown made significant progress toward the goals outlined in the plan — goals for ensuring that all students, scholars and staff can thrive in accordance with Brown’s mission of advancing knowledge, discovery and free inquiry. Brown’s progress is reflected in the measures established in the DIAP for tracking success — specifically an increase in faculty and graduate students from historically underrepresented groups, as well as in the breadth of opportunities for students, faculty and staff to receive education and training on diversity, equity and inclusion. Highlights of activities and initiatives that represent just a sampling of this progress can be found below in each of the six priority areas. People The DIAP recognizes that the foundation of Brown is its people, and so the plan focuses first on the composition of our community and ensuring that all community members can thrive.

Visit Page Open details for Knowledge Accountability To ensure progress for Brown’s diversity and inclusion initiatives, the DIAP established systems of responsibility and accountability. Visit Page Open details for Accountability While we celebrate the progress made, Brown also recognizes that we have much more work to do. There are many more opportunities to make our community more inclusive, to center equity by transforming policies and processes at all levels, and to increase support for individuals from groups that have been traditionally barred from access to higher education. In DIAP Phase II, Brown recognizes that we must continue to call on all members of our community to create a successful, inclusive, academic community.
