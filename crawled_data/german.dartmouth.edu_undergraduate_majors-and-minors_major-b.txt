Prerequisites Two courses at the intermediate level (German 10.00, German 10.01, German 10.03, German 10.06, or permission of the Chair.) Major-level courses Six courses from the Department of German Studies numbered above German 13. German 42-47, which are in translation, require additional work in German, and normally only one such 40s course may count towards a major. Four courses beyond the introductory level that are taught in other departments or programs such as Art History, Comparative Literature, Film Studies, Geography, Government, History, Jewish Studies, Music, Philosophy, or Religion. In principle, any relevant course in the Dartmouth curriculum that is approved by the Department of German Studies may qualify for this major.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of German Studies Undergraduate Overview Why Study German?
