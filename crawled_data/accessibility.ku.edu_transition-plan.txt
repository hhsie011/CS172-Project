However, KU aspires to do more than comply with the letter of accessibility laws. Our goal is to endorse a campus climate that will sustain attention to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in the spirit in which it was designed and provide the KU campus community a climate of inclusiveness. To help achieve this goal, KU has developed a transition plan to begin transforming its facilities to provide even greater accessibility for students, faculty, staff, and visitors with disabilities. Plan Governance The current transition plan was created in 2013 and updated in June 2017, by the Architectural Accessibility and Inclusion Committee which includes several members with various disabilities and representatives of organizations that advocate for the rights of people with disabilities. Addition and Prioritization of Items New items are typically added to the transition plan in one of two ways: A person alerts the ADA RCEA Office or Facilities Planning and Development of an area on campus that could be improved for accessibility. A newly built environment is added to the KU campus. The Architectural Accessibility and Inclusion Committee votes to prioritize items on the transition plan. Current Plan The current plan for academic facilities, created in 2013 and updated in June of 2017, is illustrated in the table below. The Department of Student Housing maintains a separate transition plan (PDF) for student housing facilities. If you have comments, questions, or recommendations for additions to the plan, please contact our office by email at accessibility@Ku.edu or by phone at 785-864-4946.

Smith Hall redesignated from priority number one to priority two. AAIC designated the repair of Elevators B/C in Haworth Hall as the top priority for future projects. The Committee based its decision upon the large number of students, staff, faculty served by the building and the elevators necessity for full access to the Hawk Route.4 AAIC also factored into this decision, the possibility of relocation of orientation services from Smith Hall until the elevator installation occurs.

Dole Institute Click to expand Project Number: N/A Project Topic: Widen sidewalk and add site lighting Completion: N/A Comments: Dole Institute staff has reported numerous complaints about the sidewalk width when multiple wheelchair users visit for events and a lack of adequate lighting from the accessible parking spaces to the building. Engel Road to Jayhawk Boulevard Click to expand Project Number: Lz_u/9716 Project Topic: Accessible Route from Engel Road to Jayhawk Boulevard Completion: N/A Comments: Estimated cost includes new 5' walk along full route and curb ramps at each driveway. No regrading, landscaping, utilities, etc. are included. The future progress of this project is dependent on support from the City of Lawrence. Military Science Click to expand Project Number: 046/5874 Project Topic: Add Elevator Completion: N/A Comments: AAIC review determined further assessment needed for proper evaluation of building. Initial assessment is that vertical integration may not be possible and would not meet State and Federal Standards. Concern raised that installation of elevator would likely only serve Levels 1 and 2. The basement level has constraints that limit the accessibility improvements that are possible such that an elevator extending down to this level would serve little purpose. AAIC determined the following steps are necessary: 1) Complete a detailed assessment of building to identify accessibility and compliance elements; 2) Final determination from leaders on feasibility of relocation and demo of current building; 3) Relocate Military Science public programs and events to other accessible buildings. Murphy Hall Click to expand Project Number: N/A Project Topic: Accessible Seating Numbers in Crafton-Preyer Theater Completion: N/A Comments: 11 accessible spaces are required when counting total amount of seating in the theater. When counting seating on only the Orchestra level, 6 accessible spaces would be required. Theatre currently has 5 accessible spaces. Future plan for Theatre includes possibility of decreasing the number of seats on the Orchestra level and removing the balcony seating entirely. Will reassess seating requirements as part of that project. North & East Housing Bldgs to Jayhawk Boulevard Click to expand Project Number: Lz_u/9717 Project Topic: Accessible Route from North and East to Jayhawk Boulevard Completion: N/A Comments: Due to changes in elevation from eastern-most scholarship halls, this work would be prohibitively expensive and would require construction of ramp runs of unacceptable length along with potentially an elevator tower building. AAIC voted to remove from Transition Plan on 7/25/2017 and to conduct a formal assessment. Robinson Center Click to expand Project Number: N/A Project Topic: Provide Additional Pool Lift Completion: N/A Comments: The movable lift can serve both pools. AAIC voted to remove from the Transition Plan on 7/25/2017 and to conduct a formal assessment. Robinson Center & Price Computing Center Click to expand Project Number: N/A Project Topic: Add Accessible Path from Robinson Center to Price Computing Center Completion: N/A Comments: This would extend the sidewalk that currently runs between the tennis and volleyball courts to complete the accessible path. Doing so would take the sidewalk through a heavily used activity field. AAIC voted to remove from Transition Plan on 7/25/2017 and to conduct a formal assessment.
