Texas Tech University Directory Raiderlink A-Z Index School of Law Menu Search TTU School of Law Student Support Student Support & Wellness Texas Tech University School of Law is committed to assisting students throughout their time at Texas Tech Law. The Office for Student Life has several programs internally, as well as resources for external programs, to assist with a variety of student support needs. Student Wellness Law school is a rigorous professional degree program, and Texas Tech Law has introduced a number of programs alongside Texas Tech campus services for students struggling with mental health, substance abuse, or emotional concerns, such as serious medical illness, death in the family, or threats of violence. During the 2016–2017 academic year, students created the Student Wellness Advisory Committee (SWAC), which strives to bring the student body awareness about mental health, physical health, substance abuse issues, and other wellness topics. Currently, SWAC operates as an arm of the Student Bar Association, hosting monthly wellness breakfasts & speaker events. Academic & Wellness Administrator Meetings A standing group of lead administrators meet regularly to provide support for law students experiencing a variety of academic and wellness challenges. Students, faculty, and staff can refer issues directly to these administrators, who include Associate Dean Sofia Chapman, Associate Dean Wendy-Adele Humphrey, and Director Chelsea Baldwin. Texas Lawyers Assistance Program (TLAP) The State Bar of Texas created the Texas Lawyers Assistance Program (TLAP) to help both attorneys and law students stay healthy and happy. Visit TLAP's student page for more information and stress management techniques.
