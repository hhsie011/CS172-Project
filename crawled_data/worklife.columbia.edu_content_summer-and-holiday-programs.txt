The winter months are the best time to explore and plan summer activities for school-age children. Some programs begin registration as early as February, but there are opportunities worth exploring throughout New York City that may have available spaces through the later spring months. We are unable to provide individual consultations on holiday or summer programs, but would point you to the American Camp Association (ACA) as one starting point. The ACA holds camp fairs in Manhattan each winter.
