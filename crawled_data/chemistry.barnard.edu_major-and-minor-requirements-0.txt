Chemistry (Gen. Chem. completed in your first year) Chemistry (Gen. Chem. completed in your sophomore year) Biochemistry (Gen. Chem. completed in your first year) Biochemistry (Gen. Chem. completed in your sophomore year) Pre-Health/MCAT Information Program Planning Guide: Plan out your individual program using the guides the department provides. Chemistry Biochemistry Minor Requirements: Courses required for the Chemistry minor are: CHEM BC2001 General Chemistry I CHEM BC3328 Organic Chemistry Lab CHEM BC3230 Organic Chemistry I CHEM BC3231 Organic Chemistry II CHEM BC3333 Modern Techniques of Organic Chemistry Lab CHEM BC3338 Quantitative and Instrumental Techniques Lab and ONE of the following: CHEM BC3232 Chemistry IV CHEM BC3242 Quantitative Analysis CHEM BC3252 Thermodynamics and Kinetics CHEM BC3271 Inorganic Chemistry CHEM BC3282 Biological Chemistry There is no minor in Biochemistry. Note: No more than two overlapping courses can count towards a student’s major and minor. Students majoring in a science that has a Chemistry requirement can still complete a minor in Chemistry, but an additional course may be required. For example, if your major requires General Chemistry I (with lab), Organic I, and Organic I lab, you would have to take a second 3000-level course in addition to the other minor requirements for a total of eight courses. The additional course could be one of the lecture options listed above (Chem IV, Quant, Thermo, Inorganic or Biochem) or another 3000-level Chemistry lecture or lab course (e.g., Quantum, Advanced Organic, Methods and Applications in Physical Chemistry, Advanced Inorganic, Current Topics in Biochemistry). For approval of 3000-level courses outside of the Barnard Chemistry Department, please contact the Assistant Chair. Students who completed General Chemistry I and II at another institution (Columbia or elsewhere) can complete the minor by taking any one of the following courses on the list EXCEPT CHEM BC3232, which is not an acceptable course for students who have already had a two semester sequence of introductory chemistry. Major and minor declaration requests are submitted via the Slate platform.
