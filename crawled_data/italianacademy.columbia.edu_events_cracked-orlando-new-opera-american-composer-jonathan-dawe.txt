Dawe, the youngest composer commissioned by James Levine for the Boston Symphony Orchestra, has composed a new dramatic work combining sounds of the Italian Baroque with compositional workings based on fractal geometry. The libretto is by Terry Marks-Tarlow. The cast will include celebrated countertenor Anthony Roth Costanzo (“A star in the making,” Opera News), Mary Elizabeth Mackenzie (“Extraordinary agility,” New York Times), Hai-Ting Chinn (“Lovely clear sexy soprano,” Opera Today) and Karim Sulayman (“Clean, clear sound and earnest intensity,” Houston Chronicle). The Second Instrumental Unit (“Polished and tightly unified,” New York Times) under the direction of Jeffrey Milarsky (“Excellent,” New York Times) offers virtuosic support with recorders, piccolo trumpet, saxophone, strings, theorbo, and drums. In addition the cutting-edge modern-Baroque hybrid dance ensemble Company XIV provides newly commissioned choreography by the group’s director Austin McCormick. James Levine has said “Dawe’s contemporary take on early music is extraordinary.” Upcoming Events The Italian Academy for Advanced Studies, Columbia University1161 Amsterdam Avenue · New York, NY 10027 Phone (212) 854-2306 Contact Us [email protected] Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
