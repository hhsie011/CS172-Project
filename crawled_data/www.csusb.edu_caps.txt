This is achieved through mental health counseling, advocacy, and outreach and consultation in a safe, supportive and culturally-informed environment. Location CAPS is located in the Health Center Building, north of the The Meeting Center and East of the SMSU Expansion Site. Entrance to Counseling and Psychological Services is on the West side – facing the SMSU Expansion Site and north of the main Health Center entrance. On the campus map our building is identified as HC (Health Center). Who Uses Counseling and Psychological Services?

Cost Counseling and Psychological Services is funded by the student health fee paid at the time of enrollment to CSUSB. No other fees apply. Confidentiality and Privacy All contacts with Counseling and Psychological Services are confidential, except in situations where legal or ethical considerations require notification of a family member or others. Notice of Privacy Practices. Counseling and Psychological Services does not release any information regarding whether a student has used the service nor matters discussed in counseling. Except under certain specific circumstances, no parent, dean, faculty member, or other student can gain access to information about a client without express written permission. Exceptions: A student who has used CAPS services may give authorization to release records or to disclose information to anyone the student chooses. However, a request to exchange confidential information must first be completed and signed. If the counselor believes that there is danger to self or others, safety considerations will prevail, and the counselor will notify appropriate family members or other authority. Such disclosure is for the purpose of providing the necessary care and protection of the student. In very rare circumstances, the court may order the release of confidential information. Unlicensed counselors work under the supervision of a licensed counselor who has access to counseling records in order to perform supervision responsibilities. In addition, a student may grant permission for a counselor to audiotape or videotape a session for the counselor to review with his/her supervisor. Counselors are mandated reporters of suspected elder or child abuse and must notify the appropriate agencies. Upcoming Events There are no scheduled upcoming events at this time.
