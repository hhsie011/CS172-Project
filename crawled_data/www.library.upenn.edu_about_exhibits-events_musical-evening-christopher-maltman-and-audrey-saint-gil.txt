The British operatic baritone Christopher Maltman and the French pianist and conductor Audrey Saint-Gil pair up for a special recital, one which gives equal time to works by women composers. The first half of the concert will feature songs by Fanny and Felix Mendelssohn and Clara and Robert Schumann, while the second half highlights less well-known songs by Nadia Boulanger and Poldowski (Régine Wiernawski), followed by folksong arrangements by Benjamin Britten. The recital concludes with humorous ditties by the British comedy duo Flanders & Swann. A pop-up exhibit of related music from the Penn Libraries will be on display in the Henry Charles Lea Library prior to and following the recital.
