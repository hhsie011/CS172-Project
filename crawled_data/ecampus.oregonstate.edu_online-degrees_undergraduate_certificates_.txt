Anyone enrolled in an Oregon State bachelor's degree program can enroll in any Ecampus online undergraduate certificate. You may also pursue some of OSU's undergraduate certificates as a first-year, transfer or postbaccalaureate student. Program prerequisites Some certificate programs may have prerequisites that you will need to meet prior to enrolling in certificate courses. We recommend that you review and evaluate this in advance. In some instances, you may apply to your program of interest, then complete prerequisites once you are admitted and before you begin taking certificate courses. Check your program’s curriculum requirements for more information on prerequisites. Foreign language requirement If you are pursuing an undergraduate certificate and do not meet the foreign language admission requirement, you may still be admitted but will need to satisfy this requirement during the duration of your program. If you are a first year or transfer student, this requirement includes two years of the same foreign language in high school, or two quarters/semesters of the same college level language. Pathway to a bachelor’s degree The credits you earn toward a certificate may later be applied to an Oregon State bachelor’s degree. OSU Ecampus delivers dozens of bachelor’s programs online.
