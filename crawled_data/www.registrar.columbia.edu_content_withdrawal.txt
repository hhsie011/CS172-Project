Withdrawing from the university differs from dropping one or several classes within a given semester, because as long as a student retains at least one class, he or she is still considered to be registered for that semester. A withdrawal is done in consultation with the deans or advisors in your school. A statement will be added to your transcript indicating that you have withdrawn from the University. Depending on the date of withdrawal, you may be entitled to some pro-rated refund of tuition. In most cases, ancillary fees will remain on your account, in addition to a $75 withdrawal fee. View Refund Rates for Withdrawals Consider Tuition Refund Insurance Offered by A.W.G. Dewar, Inc., this elective insurance plan provides coverage for tuition, room and board should a student suffer a serious illness or accident and withdraw from classes before the semester is completed. Further details about the plan and contact information are available on its website. It is important to consult with your school to be informed of how the withdrawal will affect your standing, degree pursuit, privileges, and conditions for return. Summer Term Withdrawals Summer terms have very abbreviated withdrawal schedules based on the individual sub-terms. Professional Studies withdrawal schedules are also based on individual sub-terms. The Professional Studies Summer Bulletin is helpful when considering a summer withdrawal from the Summer Session. Students in other schools or programs should contact their school's deans or student affairs office for more information on summer term withdrawals. See also Registration & Enrollment. Financial aid applied to the student account may also be adjusted as a result of withdrawal; see the University Financial Aid pages on Withdrawal for Undergraduates and Withdrawal for Graduate Students.
