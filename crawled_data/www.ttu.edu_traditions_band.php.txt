Directory Raiderlink A-Z Index TEXAS TECH UNIVERSITY Menu Search TTU History & Traditions Goin' Band from Raiderland The Goin' Band from Raiderland - is one of the largest spirit raisers on campus and among the finest bands in the country. The original band in 1925, numbering only 21 members, was dressed in matador uniforms. In recent years, the band's 400 members have returned to variations on that original look. The Goin' Band performs at home and away football games, parades and at other special events. Following home games, devoted fans stick around to join the band in their traditional march out of Jones SBC Stadium, through the engineering key, around the circle, by the Administration Building and ending at the band parking lot behind the Music Building. The band was the 1998 recipient of the prestigious Sudler Trophy as the nation's top marching band.
