Students interested in graduate study in mathematics, or in the importance of mathematics in the sciences, should pursue the B.S. For others, such as those who also wish to pursue study in a non-quantitative area or who are preparing to teach mathematics at the pre-collegiate level, the B.A. will be more appropriate. Please direct any questions about the major in Mathematics to the Assistant Chair for Undergraduate Programs. Open All Close All B.A. in Math The Bachelor of Arts program in Mathematics is designed to provide a solid foundation in the main areas of mathematics and mathematical applications. Course work is offered in preparation for careers in the actuarial profession, applied areas of government and industry, and education. Students who succeed in the program make excellent candidates for law school and other professional schools. The Mathematics major requires completion of at least 33 credits, depending upon the student's preparation in Calculus prior to entering Boston College. Preparation (if necessary) MATH 1102 Calculus I (Math and Science Majors), or its equivalent (e.g., four or higher on the Calculus AP exam) MATH 1103 Calculus II (Math and Science Majors), or MATH 1105 Calculus II-AP (Math and Science Majors), or an equivalent (e.g., five on the Calculus BC AP exam). Required Courses MATH 2202 Multivariable Calculus or MATH 2203 Multivariable Calculus (Honors) MATH 2210 Linear Algebra or MATH 2211 Linear Algebra (Honors) MATH 2216 Introduction to Abstract Mathematics MATH 3310 Introduction to Abstract Algebra MATH 3320 Introduction to Analysis Required Course Substitution Notes With the approval of the Assistant Chair for Undergraduate Programs, advanced students may omit required courses, substituting three credits in MATH courses numbered 4400 or higher for each. Required Elective Courses Eighteen (18) elective credits in MATH courses numbered 3312, 3322, or 4400 and above. GPA Requirement A grade point average of at least 1.67 must be achieved in the MATH courses which make up your major. If you have a question about getting started in the major (for 99% of our students, this will be somewhere in the Calculus sequence MATH 1102 - MATH 1105 - MATH 2202/3), please visit the Mathematics major advisement pages of our Advisement Website. Planning Most B.A. candidates will begin their program with a Calculus course. The earlier you complete the required Calculus courses, the easier your scheduling becomes. Programs for Those Beginning With Calculus for Math and Science These are the usual scheduling grids we see among our majors who started right away in first semester of freshman year in a Calculus course designed for Math and Science majors: About 20% begin by taking MATH 1102 Calculus I in their first semester. Many of these students have had little or no Calculus before entering BC, while some have taken a semester or more of Calculus but do not feel prepared to enter Calculus II right away. Several of these students may actually begin a major other than mathematics (the usual suspects: Chemistry, Computer Science B.S. Program, Geology-Geophysics, Geophysics, and Physics). For these students, the major requirements can be satisfied as follows: Class Fall Spring Freshman MATH 1102 MATH 1103 Sophomore MATH 2202/3 MATH 2210/1 MATH 2216 Junior MATH 3320 or MATH 3310 MATH elective MATH 3310 or MATH 3320 MATH elective Senior MATH elective MATH elective MATH elective MATH elective About 45% begin with MATH 1105 Calculus II-AP in their first semester. If you are prepared to enter MATH 1105 right away in the Fall of your freshman year (e.g., you got at least a four on the Calculus AB Advanced Placement Exam), then your major requirements can easily be satisfied as follows: Class Fall Spring Freshman MATH 1105 MATH 2202 Sophomore MATH 2210 MATH 2216 Junior MATH 3320 or MATH 3310 MATH elective MATH 3310 or MATH 3320 MATH elective Senior MATH elective MATH elective MATH elective MATH elective Almost 35% begin with MT 2202 in their first semester. If you are prepared to enter MT 2202 in the Fall of your freshman year (e.g., you got a five on the Calculus BC Advanced Placement Exam), then your requirements are reduced to: Class Fall Spring Freshman MATH 2202/3 MATH 2210/1 Sophomore MATH 2216 MATH 3320 or MATH 3310 Junior MATH 3310 or MATH 3320 MATH elective MATH elective MATH elective Senior MATH elective MATH elective MATH elective MATH elective All of the proposed schedules above are conservative. None requires more than two courses in any semester, none proposes any acceleration during the first two years, and none proposes completing more than a minimal program. But some students will be eager to learn more mathematics sooner; some may plan on taking an extra mathematics elective or two while at BC; and some may have specific preferences for courses which match career goals. Please see the closing sections of this page for comments about these situations. What If You Don't Start with a Math and Science Calculus Course? About 15% of our eventual B.A. candidates do not take one of the required Calculus courses for Math and Science Majors in their first semester. Many of these students probably elected majors which required them to take other Calculus courses. One example would include: A student who completes one of MATH 1100 or MATH 1101 in the first semester (example: a Biology major) can transition to and complete a mathematics major by moving into MATH 1103 in the second semester: Class Fall Spring Freshman MATH 1103 Sophomore MATH 2202/3 MATH 2210/1 or MATH 2216 Junior MATH 3310 or MATH 3320 MATH elective MATH 3310 or MATH 3320 MATH elective Senior MATH elective MATH elective MATH elective MATH elective Almost every student who joins the B.A. program after the first semester will require an individualized recommendation for arranging his or her program of study, and he or she should consult the Mathematics Assistant Chair for Undergraduates as soon as possible. Variations in Scheduling There are reasons why the schedules proposed above will have to be modified for some students. The typical variations we see, together with proposed modifications, include these: Junior Year Abroad (worst case, assuming you don't take any mathematics courses while abroadâ€”although most of our majors who go abroad take at least one mathematics course while they're away from BC): Class Fall Spring Freshman MATH 1105 MATH 2202 Sophomore MATH 2210 MATH 2216 MATH 3310 or MATH 3320 MATH elective Junior Semester Abroad MATH 3310 or MATH 3320 MATH elective Senior MATH elective MATH elective MATH elective MATH elective LSOE Student (LSOE students are required to student-teach for one semester, usually in the Fall semester of senior year): Class Fall Spring Freshman MATH 1105 MATH 2202/3 Sophomore MATH 2210/1 MATH 2216 MATH elective Junior MATH 3310 or MATH 3320 MATH elective MATH elective MATH 3310 or MATH 3320 MATH elective Senior Student Teaching MATH elective MATH elective Late Change to Mathematics (worst case: a student who took MATH 1100-MATH 1101 in first year): Class Fall Spring Freshman Sophomore MATH 1105 or MATH 2202/3 or MATH 2210/1 MATH 2210/1 or MATH 2202/3 MATH 2216 Junior MATH 3310 or MATH 3320 MATH elective MATH 3310 or MATH 3320 MATH elective Senior MATH elective MATH elective MATH elective MATH elective Nevertheless, no matter what variations might affect your situation, we strongly urge that you adhere to these basic recommendations in working out a scheduling of courses for the major: Complete MATH 2202/3 as early as you can; Complete at least one of MATH 2210/1 or MATH 2216 no later than first semester of sophomore year, and complete both no later than the end of sophomore year (MATH 2210/1 is usually completed before MATH 2216, but there may be situations in which this need not be the case); Complete at least one of MATH 3310 or MATH 3320 in first semester of junior year; and complete both no later than the end of junior year (these courses are independent and can be taken in either order); Complete at least one elective course no later than first semester of junior year; and at least two elective courses no later than the end of junior year. If you have a question about getting started in the major (for 99% of our students, this will be somewhere in the Calculus sequence MATH 1102 - MATH 1105 - MATH 2202) please visit the Mathematics major advisement website. Descriptions of all courses for math majors can be found on our Course description page. We also have other pages targeted towards helping you plan your math program and/or make room in your schedule if you're thinking about going abroad.
