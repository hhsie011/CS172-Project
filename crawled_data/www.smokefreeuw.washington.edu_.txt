Secondhand smoke exposure contributes to 41,000 deaths among non-smoking adults each year. The University of Washington maintains a no-smoking or vaping policy to provide a safe and healthy environment for faculty, staff, students, and visitors at all three UW campuses. Smoke and vape in designated areas only The Seattle campus is smoke- and vape-free, with the exception of 28 designated smoking areas. UW Bothell has eight designated smoking areas, and UW Tacoma has five. Signage clearly identifies designated smoking areas, and urns are available at each site for disposal of cigarette butts. EH&S determines where designated areas are located around the Seattle campus. Click to view a map of the designated smoking areas: UW Seattle campus UW Bothell campus UW Tacoma campus EH&S receives complaints related to smoking and vaping outside of designated areas. Due to the population density of the campus, any smoking outside of designated smoking areas increases the risk of secondhand smoke exposure. Please smoke only in designated areas. Quitting smoking is the best thing you can do for your health The health risks of cigarette smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke include cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and cancer, among others. Although evidence related to the harm of e-cigarette use is inconclusive, users may be exposed to cancer-causing toxins and chemicals. Research shows that nicotine, an ingredient in both e-cigarettes and combustible cigarettes, harms brain development in young adults. Resources to quit smoking The best way to reduce your risk of developing smoking-related illnesses is to quit. Getting support to help you quit is the best way to be successful. Even with support, you may make a number of attempts before you quit for good.
