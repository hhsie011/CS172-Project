Students/ Paths to Success/ Guide to Practice Areas/ Real Estate Law Real Estate Law Stately manor houses and ancient castles, suburban homes, downtown skyscrapers, shopping malls, oil and gas leases, farms, and ranches — real estate law comprises all these things. In the past, land was the foundation of wealth in both England and America; today, real property is still one of the most important capital assets in the American economy. Most, if not all, real property law is state-specific, as real estate — unlike other forms of wealth — is neither a movable nor a liquid asset. As a real estate lawyer, you will represent landowners, developers, landlords, tenants, lenders, oil and gas producers, environmental groups, and other players in this exciting field of law.
