To the Dartmouth community, I write today to express my deep disappointment and concern that a Texas federal court has ruled the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy (DACA) unlawful. Regardless of whether the decision is appealed or stayed, the uncertainty it introduces into the lives of the "Dreamers" in our community and across the country compels me to reiterate Dartmouth's support for federal legislation that provides Dreamers with a clear path to citizenship. Dartmouth officials will continue direct communication with members of Congress to reiterate our strong support for Dreamers and for any legislation that would ensure that those who were brought to this country as children and had obtained legal status under DACA can continue to pursue their studies freely and without fear. To advance this effort, Dartmouth joined 18 universities in July 2018 when the group filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case brought by seven states challenging the legality of DACA, which was the case decided yesterday in Texas. The discontinuation of DACA, we contended in the brief, would deter young people from pursuing higher education and preclude the remarkable students enrolled at our schools from deriving the full benefit of time on our campuses. Once again, I extend my sincerest thanks to all of the students, faculty, and staff across campus, as well as our peers across higher education, who stand with Dartmouth on this important issue and who are supporting students during what, for some, is a deeply troubling and difficult time. Should you have questions concerning DACA, or our commitment to support members of our community affected by potential changes, please visit the DACA web page maintained by our Office of Visa and Immigration Services at https://www.dartmouth.edu/~ovis/daca.html.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Latin American, Latino & Caribbean Studies Undergraduate Major Overview Minor Honors and Independent Study Courses Courses in Latin American and Caribbean Studies Alumni Alumni Stories Resources Graduates Foreign Study Overview Casa Cuba FAQs Fellowships César Chávez Fellowship César Chávez Fellowship Past Recipients Guarini Dean's Postdoctoral Fellowship News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
