Within this framework we examine ecological dynamics in the New England region resulting from natural disturbances, environmental change, and human impacts. Emphasis is on processes including: Pattern and process in dynamic forest ecosystems Climatic change and variability Invasive forest insects the modern land-use regime interacting global change drivers An interdisciplinary group of PI scientists, post-doctoral fellows, and graduate students from many parts of Harvard and other institutions use four complementary approaches to long-term study: long-term measurements of current structure and function large, long-term experiments historical studies of past conditions and dynamics prospective modeling Long-term studies span a broad range of spatial and temporal scales and seek to: develop societally relevant scientific data and information train a diverse next generation of researchers, beginning with K-12 and undergraduate students develop databases with broad relevance to fundamental ecological issues broaden public impacts by engaging the arts and humanities, conservation and policy Learn more by exploring abstracts from our annual LTER symposium.
