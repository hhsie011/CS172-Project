The Computer Science Minor is for undergraduate students who anticipate that computer science will have a prominent role to play in their academic and professional career. It is designed for students in all majors to supplement their primary studies. Computer science is applicable to almost any major and career choice; from Communication, Psychology, and Law to Architecture, Music, and Engineering. The theoretical foundations of information and computation provide students with the appropriate skills for academic and professional careers. Completion of a CS minor, with a well-selected set of classes, can serve as good preparation for further study in CS through our 2-semester Master of Engineering (M.Eng.) program or our 4-semester Master of Science program. The CS Minor is designed for students in all undergraduate schools and colleges. Offered by: The Department of Computer Science Administered by: The Department of Computer Science; 5th Floor Rhodes Hall Contact Person: Nicole Roy or Ryan Marchenese, 5th floor Rhodes Halll, ugrad@cs.cornell.edu Eligibility: All Cornell undergraduate students except: Computer Science Majors and Information Science, Systems, and Technology (ISST) Majors. Educational Objectives: This minor is for students who anticipate that computer science will have a prominent role to play in their academic and professional career. To Apply for a Computer Science Minor Once you have completed all of the courses for the minor, or are in your final semester of study and finishing up the minor, you are eligible to have your minor requirements certified by the Department of Computer Science. Download the form Application to Certify Completion of a Minor. This is a fillable PDF form.
