Please attach proof of your positive result to your email. Do not call. The Team will be in touch with you as soon as they can. If you have previously tested positive for COVID and have received an official 90-day exemption from participation in asymptomatic testing from Global and Community Health, you do not have to do a test upon arrival back on campus.You should resume testing at the conclusion of your 90-day exemption period As of March 15, 2022, individuals are eligible to receive COVID boosters 5 months after their initial COVID vaccines, and should do so within 30 days of that 5 month mark. This timeline is regardless of a recent COVID diagnosis, as a review of scientific evidence indicates there is no reason to delay receiving a booster despite a recent COVID infection. Students must upload proof of booster to MyUHS. Employees must upload proof of booster to VacStatus.
