You’ll take a full range of liberal arts courses, from the arts and humanities to the social and physical sciences. In fact, half of your classes will be in non-engineering subjects, so you can deepen your understanding of the world—and prepare to make a difference in it. On This Page Options Declare a Major Honors Program Transfer Credits Academic Standing Request Info Visit Apply Options Engineering Sciences Major Dartmouth AB candidates who major in engineering sciences learn to synthesize concepts from many fields as well as specialize in a chosen area. They also can join multidisciplinary research teams and collaborate with faculty and graduate students. Learn More Engineering Sciences Major—Modified Students can create a cross-disciplinary modified engineering major by taking six courses in engineering sciences and four courses in the modifying area plus the necessary prerequisites and culminating experience. Learn More Biomedical Engineering Sciences Major The biomedical engineering sciences major is offered to students interested in medical school. Faculty from Thayer School and Geisel School of Medicine jointly advise the research projects. Learn More Engineering Physics Major Students who love both engineering and physics can pursue an engineering physics major offered jointly by the Department of Engineering Sciences and the Department of Physics and Astronomy. Learn More Another Major Modified w/ Engineering Sciences Any Dartmouth major can be modified with engineering sciences (with the necessary approvals). Learn More Another Major Modified w/ Human-Centered Design Any Dartmouth major can be modified with the minor in human-centered design (with the necessary approvals). Learn More Declare a Major Meet with your engineering faculty advisor to develop a plan of study prior to declaring your engineering major. Use the Dartworks system to plan and submit your declaration. Select the correct major: • Engineering = ENGS • Engineering Physics with Engineering as the culminating = ENPH • Biomedical Engineering = EBIO • Modified majors = Modified A Do NOT put any distributive courses on your planner that don't pertain directly to your major. • As an example, the standard major should only have ENGS 21 through your Culminating Experience listed on the planner. • Please list both your culminating in the notes, as well as the name of the engineering faculty advisor you consulted to develop this plan. • If you put any distributive courses on your planner that don't pertain directly to your major, your major declaration will be denied. To make changes to an approved plan, please refer to the Dartworks Student User Guide. If you have aditional questions, contact Jenna Wheeler, located in MacLean 103. Honors Program AB students who have an overall grade point average of 3.0 with a 3.33 grade point average in the major are eligible for the Honors Program in engineering sciences. Learn more Transfer Credits No more than two transfer courses may be used for credit in the major. Academic Standing Satisfactory completion of the major requires a grade point average of 2.0 in the courses suitable for satisfying the major. 15 Thayer Drive, Hanover, NH 03755 +1 (603) 646-2230 Undergraduate Graduate Research Entrepreneurship Community About ThayerExpress Faculty Offices Visit Apply Give Facebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn YouTube Flickr © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • A-Z Index • Privacy • Feedback
