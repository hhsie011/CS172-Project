This amendment granted all women in the United States the right to vote. This digital exhibition looks at how Tennessee played its part in the suffrage movement. Note the roses used in this exhibit. Roses were used as codes for those for and against women's suffrage. People that were for suffrage would wear a yellow rose. People that opposed suffrage would wear a red rose.
