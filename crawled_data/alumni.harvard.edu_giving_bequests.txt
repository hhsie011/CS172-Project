Many of the most powerful gifts with an enduring impact have been bequests, including the University's first, from John Harvard in 1638. There are many reasons to make a bequest. A bequest allows you to honor a loved one, while providing critical support to the University through a president's fund, or another fund underwriting research and teaching. Giving by bequest costs nothing now, yet it may give you a great deal of satisfaction to know that your future gift will live on.
