Researchers develop new materials for energy production and storage while advancing the sophisticated tools necessary to characterize the functionality of these materials. Additionally, the Institute develops core competency in solar energy, alternative fuels, and carbon mitigation. The ESI works closely with the School of Engineering and provides abundant and flexible laboratory space for many exciting and unique projects. Interdisciplinary research in the ESI involves the departments of Chemistry, Geology & Geophysics, Chemical & Environmental Engineering, Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science, and Applied Physics. _________________________________________ _________________________________________ Faculty Advisory Committee: Gary Brudvig, Director (Chemistry) Charles Ahn (Applied Physics & Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science) Victor Batista (Chemistry) Alessandro Gomez (Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science) Peijun Guo (Chemical and Environmental Engineering) Shu Hu (Chemical and Environmental Engineering) Jaehong Kim (Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science) Mengxia Liu (Electrical Engineering) Owen Miller (Applied Physics Vidvuds Ozolins (Applied Physics) Diana Qiu (Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science) Udo Schwarz (Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science & Chemical and Environmental Engineering) Eduardo da Silva Neto (Physics) Leandros Tassiulas (Electrical Engineering) Hailiang Wang (Chemistry) Faculty Victor Batista Ivan Bozovic Gary Brudvig Jeeyoung Cha Robert Crabtree Eduardo da Silva Neto Adrian Gozar Peijun Guo Shu Hu Steven Konezny Owen Miller Vidvuds Ozolins Diana Qiu Hailiang Wang Affiliated Faculty Jay Ague David Bercovici Director Gary Brudvig Director, Yale Energy Sciences Institute; Benjamin Silliman Professor of Chemistry; Professor of Molecular Biophysics & Biochemistry Learn More Sherry Gray Senior Administrative Assistant 203.737.3828 Institute Address Energy Sciences Institute 810 West Campus Drive West Haven, CT 06516 Fax 203.737.3257 News Atomic shape shifting provides clues for next gen electronics A superstar enzyme is ready for its close-up Next generation lab space boosts energy exploration at Yale’s West Campus Gozar elected fellow by the American Physical Society Diana Qiu wins Packard fellowship for study of excitons Recent Publications Electron Injection Dynamics in High-Potential Porphyrin Photoanodes Revealing Surface States in In-Doped SnTe Nanoplates with Low Bulk Mobility Metallic glass nanostructures of tunable shape and composition Equipment & Facilities Learn more about the institute’s equipment and facilities.
