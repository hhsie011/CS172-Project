While our Emergency Service is open and operating 24/7, to maintain excellence in patient safety, we may need to change to diversion status at any time. When we are in active "Diverting" status, we are only able to accommodate life-threatening emergencies and must advise all other patients to seek care elsewhere until we can revert to "Accepting Patient" status. If you have questions or concerns, please call us before you come to ensure that we can offer you the high standards of service that you have come to expect. We appreciate your patience and understanding. Ryan Hospital Emergencies 215-746-8911 Appointments 215-746-8387 What to Expect for Your Visit...
