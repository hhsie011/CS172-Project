At HEPG plenary sessions, regulators, policy-makers, and industry leaders test ideas, hear comprehensive analysis of challenges, and address the consequences of different approaches to address them. "The Harvard Electricity Policy Group in my view has played an extraordinary role in a hugely complex public policy issue which requires real intellectual effort, and people in the industry and in the regulatory establishment recognize that."
