Mobile device users: The software that you are requesting to download is subject to U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Once installed, this software will remain on your smart device unless you take steps to remove it. An export license from the Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security (DOC BIS) may be required to export or re-export the software, or your smart device with the software installed, outside of the United States. You may not, without a license or License Exception authorized under part 746 of the EAR, export or re-export the software to a country that is embargoed by the United States or otherwise made subject to controls as both are described at part 746 of the EAR. The University of Kansas recommends that you take steps to remove the software from your device immediately following your consultation. Upon request, IT consultants will do their best to guide you through the process if they have experience with your make and model of device. However, it is ultimately your responsibility to ensure that the software is removed before the device is taken or sent abroad, or given to a person who will take it abroad, to prohibited countries without prior authorization from the DOC BIS.
