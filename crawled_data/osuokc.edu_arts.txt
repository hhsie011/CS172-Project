It is our responsibility to teach our students to analyze, investigate, communicate, advocate, and engage. What starts in our classrooms ripples around the world! The vision of the Liberal Arts area at OSU-OKC is to help put the “U” in OSU-OKC. We want to ensure that every student at our institution has an opportunity to engage in the subject matter that ALL college graduates and learned people have studied for ions: art, communication, culture, English, government, history, philosophy, psychology, service, and sociology. These disciplines and courses are not only the touchstones of the American college experience, but increasingly, expertise in these subject areas is highly desired across many sectors of the economy. If students apply themselves in these areas, success will follow. Our division is the student’s gateway to higher education, whether planning to earn a technical program associate degree or transfer to a four-year college to complete a baccalaureate degree. Many courses offered by the division are required of students attending any Oklahoma public higher education institution and can be transferred for degree credit; other courses offered provide students with useful and interesting electives to round out a college education. Students can determine whether specific courses will transfer for degree credit, or as an elective, by consulting the academic catalog of the four-year institution to which they are transferring. Liberal Arts has two exciting technical programs: Public Service and Technical Spanish. Studies in the Public Service program prepare students for stimulating careers in government, social or community leadership, and non-profit management. According to the US Department of Labor, the employment outlook for social and community service managers is strong and has grown 21% faster than other sectors of the economy. Studies in Technical Spanish and Interpreting and Translation program prepare students for stimulating careers in converting one language into another. Interpreters and translators work across all sectors of the economy as employees or private contractors. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, Projected growth in this field is robust and is expected to grow 46% by 2022, much faster than the rest of the economy.
