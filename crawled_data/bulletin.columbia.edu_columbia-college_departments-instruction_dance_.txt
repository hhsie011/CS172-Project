The major builds upon studio courses, the Department's productions at Miller Theater, New York Live Arts, and other venues, as well as a rich array of dance studies courses, allowing students' creative work to develop in dialogue with critical inquiry into the history, culture, theory and forms of western and non-western performance, typically enhanced by study in other disciplines. Students work with accomplished artists whose work enriches contemporary American dance; they also study with outstanding research scholars. Making, thinking about, and writing about art are an essential part of the liberal arts education. For this reason, the Department of Dance offers technique courses for students of all levels of expertise, while opening its other courses to majors and non-majors alike, who may also audition for its productions. The Department partners with cultural institutions in New York City to connect students with the professional world. Student Learning Outcomes for the Major and Minor Student Learning Outcomes for the Major and Concentration Students graduating with a major in Dance should be able to attain the following outcomes: Apply critical thinking, reading, and writing skills to dance-related texts and choreography. Develop the knowledge and research skills to explore the dance past in writing, orally, and in performance. Present interpretations of dance-related texts orally, in writing, and in performance. Apply library, archival, and internet research skills to dance scholarship and choreography. Demonstrate improved efficiency and expressivity in dance technique. Demonstrate growing technical understanding and fluency in dance technique. Create original dances, dance/theater works or dance-based, mixed media works.

BC: Fulfillment of General Education Requirement: The Visual and Performing Arts (ART). A range of dance genres, from the traditional to the innovative, co-exist as representations of "Indianness" in India, and beyond. Identities onstage and in films, morph as colonial, national, and global contexts change. This course zooms from micro to macro views of twentieth century staged dances as culturally inflected discourse. We review how Indian classical dance aligns with the oldest of performance texts, and with lively discourses (rasa as a performance aesthetic, Orientalism, nationalism, global recirculations) through the ages, not only in India but also in Europe, Britain and America. Throughout the course, we ask:- How is culture embodied? How do historical texts configure dance today? How might they affect our thinking on mind-body, practice-theory, and traditional-contemporary divides? How does bodily patterning influence the ways that we experience our surroundings and vice versa? Can cultural imaginaries instigate action? How is gender is performed? What are dance discourses?
