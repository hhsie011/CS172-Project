Home / Visit / Class Visits custom css-js - global Class Visits We encourage prospective students to sit in on a class to see life inside the classroom for Tulane students, and we've compiled a list of available classes to observe. Before visiting, please consult the academic calendar for campus holidays and review these guidelines. Class Visit Guidelines Due to limited space, families may not attend class with the prospective student. Families may wait for their student in the Office of Admission, the Lavin-Bernick Center for University Life, or any other public space on campus. Students must arrive at least five minutes early to the class and introduce themselves as a visiting prospective student to the professor. Unless told otherwise by the professor, students must stay for the duration of the class. Visiting students should silence cell phones and be an active listener or participant in the class.
