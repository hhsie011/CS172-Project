Students who have a passion for music and who have already developed basic skills in areas including performance, music history, composition, or ethnography, should consider a major in music.

MUSI UN2030 Jewish Music of New York. 3 points. Prerequisites: Music Humanities (Columbia University) or An Introduction to Music (Barnard). With the arrival of the first Jewish immigrants in New York in the mid-1600s until today, Jewish music in the City has oscillated between preserving traditions and introducing innovative ideas. This course explores the variety of ways people have used music to describe, inscribe, symbolize, and editorialize their Jewish experience. Along these lines, it draws upon genres of art music, popular music, and non-Western traditions, as well as practices that synthesize various styles and genres, from hazzanut to hiphop. Diverse musical experiences will serve as a window to address wider questions of identity, memory, and dislocation. We will also experience the Jewish soundscape of New York’s dynamic and eclectic music culture by visiting various venues and meeting key players in today’s music scene, and thus engage in the ongoing dialogues that define Jewishness in New York. A basic familiarity with Judaism and Jewish culture is helpful for this course, but it is by no means required. You do not need to know Jewish history to take this class, nor do you need to be able to read music. Translations from Hebrew and Yiddish will be provided, and musical analysis will be well explained.

Focusing on the contributions of Indigenous, Latinx, Asian, and African American musicians and musical traditions in addition to European American musicians and musical traditions, in genres as various as country music, hip hop, jazz, reggaeton, and rock, students will enlarge their sense of the multiracial and crosscultural makeup of the music that constitutes “American popular music.” MUSI UN3425 Music, Sound and the Law. 3.00 points. This course is a historical overview of the relationship between music and the law in which students will employ both critical listening skills and critical thinking to understand how sound came to be understood as property, how the law impacts creativity, identity and labor, and how music has been used as a tool for enforcing and challenging legislative and political processes. We will discuss the origins of copyright law in the Enlightenment, how music has been used as a tool of colonization through formation of archives, examples of Native American conceptions of cultural property and modes of repatriation, the birth of the music industry and its segregationist history, how the law impacts creativity through the study of sampling, infringement and extension of rights, the ways in which musicians and listeners subvert legal strictures, how music can influence policy as protest or as propaganda, musical bans, noise ordinances, the relationship between music and the First Amendment, alternatives to copyright law in the digital age, music piracy, and the recent changes in the music industry to focus on data gathering as the primary model for music distribution. Music is our point of departure, and students will learn ways in which sonic practices shaped and challenged legislative paradigms. Our focus is on American musics such as Native American music, blues, country, jazz, rhythm and blues, rock and roll, experimental music, hip hop, pop, as well as some European classical music, “world” music, and EDM. Students will read and analyze legal primary sources such as the Music Modernization Act, as well as landmark court cases, critical legal literature, and musicological texts. Students will learn debate skills, acquire practical knowledge of the law through concepts such as fair use, the public domain and mechanical and performance rights, and develop listening skills to understand legal concepts such as infringement. This course is open to students of all majors and will be of particular interest to musicians, students with plans to pursue a law degree in IP or technology law, as well as those interested in working in the music industry. There are no prerequisites and no previous knowledge of music, music theory, or the law is necessary.

This course explores diverse approaches to analyzing jazz and improvisation. Students will engage with analytical methods stemming from both scholars and improvisers, learn to apply traditional analytical approaches, examine critical issues underlying them, and develop new applications of heretofore underexamined ones. We will focus alternatively on harmony, solos, interaction, cognition, rhythm, and pedagogy, among other issues, and the survey will afford students insight into the priorities, methodologies, outcomes, and shortcomings of each of them. Additionally, the course covers theoretical texts produced by improvising musicians, as well as instances where improvisers engage with preexisting theoretical texts. Finally, we will also examine intersections between identity—encompassing issues such as race, ethnicity, gender, and class among others—and music theory. We will investigate characterizations of music theory, composition, and improvisation in terms of identity and suggest ways that we might incorporate the diverse range of theorists and analysts in our course into larger intellectual and musical histories.

Prerequisites: The instructor's permission. As music moves into the 21st century, we find ourselves surrounded by an ever-evolving landscape of technological capability. The world of music, and the music industry itself, is changing rapidly, and with that change comes the opening – and closing – of doorways of possibility. What does this shift mean for today’s practicing artist or composer? With big label recording studios signing and nurturing fewer and fewer artists, it seems certain that, today, musicians who want to record and distribute their music need to be able to do much of the recording and production work on their own. But where does one go to learn how to do this – to learn not only the “how to” part of music production, but the historical underpinnings and the development of the music production industry as well? How does one develop a comprehensive framework within which they can place their own artistic efforts? How does one learn to understand what they hear, re-create what they like and develop their own style? This class, “Recorded Sound,” aims to be the answer. It’s goal is to teach artists how to listen critically to music from across history and genres in order to identify the production techniques that they hear, and reproduce those elements using modern technology so they can be incorporated into the artist’s own musical works.

This foundational course in sound will begin by exploring how listening happens as well the tools necessary capture and present that listening. Through hands-on experimentation and demonstration, this seminar will examine both the technical and semiotic use of sound as a material within creative practice. Fundamental studio techniques will be explored including soldering for building cables, microphones, and loudspeakers. We will also explore the building blocks of analog and digital processes for the creation of sound, including microphones (types, patterns, and placement), basic synthesis, and techniques for recording, mixing, editing, and mastering. Through creative projects that implement these skills we will learn by doing. We will study theories of sound and listening that determine or are determined by technology, from the physical and social dimensions of the sounds we use to create, language (sound as a symbol or object), acoustics (sound in space), acousmatics (sound without a visual reference), and psycho-acoustics (sound as cognitive process). This class assumes no prior knowledge or technical skill. Some reading will be assigned and we will look and listen to a lot of work, students are encouraged to participate actively in discussions.

This class is for instrumentalists who wish to deepen their understanding of the theory, history and practice of jazz improvisation. The history of jazz will be used as a prism through which to view approaches to improvisation, from the cadences of the early Blues through the abstractions of Free Jazz and beyond. The student will be exposed to the theory and vocabularies of various jazz idioms, which they will also learn to place in their social and historical contexts.

In this seminar we will explore examples of electronic music composition and practice as propositions that centered situated perspective and dialogic world-making in the creative space as a means of resistance. We will look at historical and contemporary figures that animated alternative identity articulations, proposed distributed power dynamics, and challenged environmental bifurcations from the grounded and speculative province of music making. We will engage feminist methodologies in our approach, as they uphold the supposition that practice is praxis and scholarship, and support collective learning techniques. Readings in critical theory, musicology, and media studies will support our research as well as practice-based projects. With this seminar we will ask how electronic music functioned(s) as place or form of identity formation and challenge to normative expression. Can electronic music work as an experience that resists patriarchal and/or colonial structures or disciplines? What strategies have been taken that reset or rescript techno-masculinist spaces, tools and practices? And how can we create an analysis method that makes these qualities legible? No in-depth experience with either computers or electronic music is required, though music and sound will be the principle focus of our inquiry.

This course is a topical (not comprehensive) survey of musical-poetic manifestations from Latin America, the Caribbean and their diasporas that emerged during the 1960s and the 1970s. The course revisits this time period by exploring the contributions of myriad countries among which Puerto Rico, Brazil, Nicaragua, Cuba, Québec, Haiti, Chile, Argentina, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Martinique/Guadeloupe, and the United States (with a strong emphasis on New York). It analyzes objects and experiences engaged in contesting colonialism, settler colonialism, imperialism, patriarchy, racism, capitalism and Eurocentrism highlighting as well the limits (and limitations) of these radical discourses. Using a decolonial/postcolonial lens and an ethnomusicological approach, the course pays careful attention to the politics of these musics, their historical context and aesthetics, and the social imaginary of those who made them possible Spring 2022: MUSI GU4407 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment MUSI 4407 001/13024 W 12:10pm - 2:00pm 701c Dodge Building Mario Cancel-Bigay 3.00 11/15 MUSI 4407 AU1/18571 W 12:10pm - 2:00pm 701c Dodge Building Mario Cancel-Bigay 3.00 4/3 MUSI GU4425 Sounding Islam. 3 points. The objective of this course is to explore the relationship between sound, music and Islam and, in doing so, to focus on a philosophy of listening (sama‘) which is deeply embedded in the experiential. The course aims to analyze how sound and music directly or indirectly associated with Islam are produced, circulated, and listened to by a wide variety of audiences in local and transnational settings; to explore the ways in which multiple sonic dimensions of Islam have affected the public sphere in different historical moments and contexts (particular in relation to ideas about nationalism, secularism and modernity); and to examine the effect of these sonic dimensions on Muslim and non-Muslim listeners in a local and a transnational perspective.

Prerequisites: The instructor's permission. As music moves into the 21st century, we find ourselves surrounded by an ever-evolving landscape of technological capability. The world of music, and the music industry itself, is changing rapidly, and with that change comes the opening – and closing – of doorways of possibility. What does this shift mean for today’s practicing artist or composer? With big label recording studios signing and nurturing fewer and fewer artists, it seems certain that, today, musicians who want to record and distribute their music need to be able to do much of the recording and production work on their own. But where does one go to learn how to do this – to learn not only the “how to” part of music production, but the historical underpinnings and the development of the music production industry as well? How does one develop a comprehensive framework within which they can place their own artistic efforts? How does one learn to understand what they hear, re-create what they like and develop their own style? This class, “Recorded Sound,” aims to be the answer. It’s goal is to teach artists how to listen critically to music from across history and genres in order to identify the production techniques that they hear, and reproduce those elements using modern technology so they can be incorporated into the artist’s own musical works.
