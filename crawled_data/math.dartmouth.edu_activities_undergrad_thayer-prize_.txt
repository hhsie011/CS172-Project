The exam consists of Mathematics Olympiad style problems. Originality and creativity are heavily weighed. The Thayer Mathematical Prizes are financed by the income from a fund, originally in the form of a $1000 bond, the gift of General Sylvanus Thayer of the class of 1807, of Braintree, Massachusetts. The gift was received on July 4, 1869. According to the deed of gift, in terms slightly modified by General Thayer on October 11, 1871, the principal was “to constitute a perpetual prize fund for superior proficiency in the higher branches of Mathematics.” Recent Thayer Exams (for practice) 2021 2020 2015 Recent Thayer Prize winners 2022 First Place Matthew Coleman ’25 Second Place Jessica Jiang ’25 2021 First Place Hoang Nguyen ’24 Second Place Dylan Fridman ’24 2020 First Place Finn Hulse ’23, Sicong (George) Shan ’23 Second Place Brandon Chen ’23 2019 First Place Raymond Chen ’22 Second Place Eric H.
