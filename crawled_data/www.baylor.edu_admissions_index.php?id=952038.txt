If I am applying to Baylor Early Decision, can I apply to another school Early Action? 6. When will I receive a decision on my application? 7. If I am admitted Early Decision, when will I be notified about my financial aid package? 8. Does Baylor meet full financial need for ED candidates? Early Decision FAQ's 1. What is the difference between Early Decision and Early Action? Early Decision is a binding agreement which requires you to withdraw all other college applications and attend Baylor if admitted, provided you are offered sufficient financial assistance. Early Action, on the other hand, is a non-binding program. If admitted in Early Action, you are not obligated to withdraw all other applications, and can still choose which school you wish to attend. While the Early Action deadline and notification dates are earlier than Regular Decision, you still have until May 3 to decide whether or not you wish to attend Baylor. 2. Who should apply Early Decision? Choose Early Decision if Baylor is your number one choice, and you are committed to attending if admitted. Early Decision is ideal for students who are confident that Baylor is the right academic, social, and financial fit for them and their family. Early Decision is binding. If admitted, students are expected to enroll and immediately withdraw all other college applications. 3. Who should apply Early Action? Students who identify Baylor as one of their top college choices prior to November 1 should consider applying Early Action. If admitted, students still have until May 1 to commit. 4. How do I apply as an Early Decision candidate? In order to submit an Early Decision application, students should check the box on the application indicating that they are applying under a binding Early Decision plan and submit the signed Early Decision Agreement Form with the application. 5. If I am applying to Baylor Early Decision, can I apply to another school Early Action? Yes. Students may apply to only one Early Decision program, but this does not prohibit you from applying to another school under a non-binding admission plan. If you are admitted to Baylor under the Early Decision plan, you must withdraw all other applications, pay your non-refundable $500 enrollment deposit, and attend Baylor. 6. When will I receive a decision on my application? Students who apply Early Decision 1 by the November 1 deadline will be notified of their admission by December 15. Students who apply Early Decision 2 by the February 1 deadline will be notified of their admission by March 1. Students who apply Early Action by the November 1 deadline will be notified of their admission by January 15. Students who apply Regular Decision by the February 1 deadline will receive a decision by April 10. While Early Decision candidates may file non-binding applications to other colleges, if they are admitted under Early Decision they must immediately withdraw all other applications and enroll at Baylor.

If applying under Early Decision 1, the priority deadline for filing the CSS Profile and the FAFSA is November 1. If admitted, students can expect to receive their financial aid package in January. If applying under Early Decision 2, the priority deadline for filing the CSS Profile and FAFSA is February 1. If admitted, students can expect to receive their financial aid package in March. 8. Does Baylor meet full financial need for ED candidates? Baylor seeks to provide the best possible financial aid package for each student. At this time, Baylor does not have the ability to guarantee that full need will be met for applicants.
