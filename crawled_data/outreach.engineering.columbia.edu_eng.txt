Students gain practical research experience, collaborate with research faculty, staff, and students, practice new skills, and take part in multi-level mentorship. Virtual program components include experience in working on genuine engineering research projects, research skills and college prep workshops, science communications workshops, and additional supplemental seminars and opportunities. Students are provided with a stipend to support them over the summer. We encourage all rising seniors (current 11th graders) with an interest in engineering and research to apply. Note: As of now, we plan for ENG to offer in-person programming but will default to a virtual hybrid model as necessary due to COVID-19. Admitted students must follow Columbia University's public health protocols, which include vaccination against COVID-19, masking, and distancing where appropriate. Expand all Collapse all Get Involved Columbia Students & Faculty The ENG program is a great opportunity for members of the Columbia Engineering community to connect with high school students. Undergraduate summer researchers can be involved in college preparation workshops Graduate students can serve as mentors for ENG students Postdocs can teach research skills seminars and contribute to career planning workshops Faculty host ENG students in their labs If you would like to participate next summer, please email fill out this form: https://seas.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6th34Wq5iss5P94 Past ENG Cohorts In 2020, ENG transitioned to an online format due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our students focused on doing computational research with their labs and mentors. In addition, the program included daily research skills and science communications workshops, which culminated in multiple projects. These results are displayed on each of the students' personal websites. To learn more about the 2020 ENG cohort and their projects, click here! Dr. Kristen Myers (Myers Soft Tissues Lab, Department of Mechanical Engineering) talks about being a mentor in the summer program along with two high school student researchers.
