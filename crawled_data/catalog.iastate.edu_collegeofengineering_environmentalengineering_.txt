Students in the environmental engineering bachelor’s degree program will complete a curriculum covering the engineering and science knowledge necessary to design and implement effective, affordable solutions for environmental challenges involving water, air, and land. The environmental engineering curriculum equips students with a broad education that includes technical skills in analysis and design and professional practices such as communication, teamwork, leadership, and ethics. Graduates will have a strong foundation necessary to solve complex current and future infrastructure challenges within the diverse areas of environmental engineering. Graduates of this program will be prepared to work in environmental engineering positions within the private and public (e.g., federal, military, state and community) sectors that deal with pollution and contamination in all aspects of the built and natural environment. Examples of this work include analyzing and designing systems for water supply and distribution, collecting and processing waste, controlling air quality, recycling residuals, and protecting public health. Students interested in a more general education in civil engineering should consider the B.S. in civil engineering with environmental emphasis. Student Learning Outcomes: Graduates of the Environmental Engineering curriculum should have, at the time of graduation: an ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics an ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences an ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions an ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies. Program Educational Objectives: Three to five years after graduation, graduates of the environmental engineering program will have: Pursued successful careers and expertise in environmental engineering or a related profession. Collaborated effectively on multi-disciplinary teams to address the needs of society and the environment. Pursued lifelong learning, professional development, and licensure as appropriate for their career goals. The faculty encourages the students to develop their professional skills by participating in cooperative education, internships, or progressive summer engineering employment and study abroad programs. Qualified juniors and seniors interested in graduate studies may apply to the Graduate College to pursue concurrently the bachelor degree and either a master of science in Civil Engineering or a master of business administration in the College of Business Administration. These students would have an opportunity to graduate in five years with both degrees.
