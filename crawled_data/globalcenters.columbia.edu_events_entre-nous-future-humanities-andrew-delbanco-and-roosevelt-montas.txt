What to do with the hotly-contested idea of the (hard to define) canon? In the midst of an American identity crisis, are the liberal arts struggling to articulate their method, content, and goals? Should students still read the canon? How might it be taught? Should we work to expand its limits, or should we be abolishing it entirely? Join Columbia University Professors Andrew Delbanco and Roosevelt Montás, author of the recently published Rescuing Socrates (Princeton University Press, 2022), as they consider the challenges the humanities face, the ways they need to change, and what they offer in the contemporary age. The Entre Nous series is co-organized by Columbia Global Centers | Paris, the Institute for Ideas and Imagination, and The American Library in Paris.

Delbanco is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a member of the American Philosophical Association, and President of the Teagle Foundation and the Library of America. He was awarded a National Humanities Medal by Barack Obama in 2012. Roosevelt Montás is senior lecturer at Columbia University's Center for American Studies.
