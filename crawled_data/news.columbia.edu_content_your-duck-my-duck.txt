The six stories compel us to confront disturbing truths about ourselves— as lovers, parents, and children, and as citizens on a violent, terrifying planet. In her world, the forces of money, sex, and power cannot be escaped, and the force of history, whether confronted or denied, cannot be evaded. 212-854-5573 [email protected] Genre Fiction Topic Arts Contact Us [email protected] Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
