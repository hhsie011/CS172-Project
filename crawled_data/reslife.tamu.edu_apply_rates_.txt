Residents may live in traditional-style, suite-style, or apartment-style housing. In addition, students can choose from single gender housing (students live in rooms, floors, buildings, or apartments/suites with students of the same gender) and mixed gender housing (students live in rooms with students of the same gender, but next door to students of a different gender). In addition to the building make up, we’ve included some other amenities or aspects of the community to consider on the tables below. Lastly, please be aware that rates are subject to change. Check out the Rates and Amenities At-A-Glance tables below for either the apartments or residence halls.
