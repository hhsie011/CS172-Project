What is Sustainability? right arrow down arrow Sustainability can be described as each of us doing our part to build the kind of world—economically, environmentally and socially—that we want to live in, and one that we want our children and grandchildren to inherit. It means becoming aware of all interconnections—visible and invisible—in which our day-to-day choices affect the intricate balance of social, economic and ecological systems. “Humanity has the ability to make development sustainable—to ensure that it meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs.” - Our Common Future, World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987 Sustainability at UC right arrow down arrow UC's Office of Sustainability was created in 2010 and reports to the PACES Steering Committee. UC hired a part-time Sustainability Coordinator in 2008, and the position became full-time in 2009.
