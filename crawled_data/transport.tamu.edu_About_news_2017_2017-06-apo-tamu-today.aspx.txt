The APO is a designation for parking organizations that recognizes best practices in responsible parking management and operations, customer service, professional development, safety and security. “We are so pleased to be designated an Accredited Parking Organization with Distinction by IPI. This designation is a direct reflection of the Transportation Services Department and all that it is becoming, which is a premier transportation services provider for the Texas A&M community and in the nation,” said Associate Vice President Peter Lange of Transportation Services. “The men and woman of this department are committed day in and day out to providing the best service to our customers and I am confident they will continue to lead this organization to future successes,” he said. Cain Garage To earn accreditation, an organization must demonstrate its commitment to ongoing evaluation and improvement through the implementation of parking industry best practices. Applicant organizations work with third-party reviewers to organize and present evidence of accomplishment of over 250 criteria in 14 categories. APO with Distinction is earned by meeting an additional set of criteria from exemplary practices in the industry. In addition to Texas A&M Transportation Services receiving the designation, the organization was awarded “Premier Facility” status for the newest parking facility on campus, Cain Garage, and for two parking lots. “It’s a rigorous process and organizations that achieve accreditation have a right to be very proud,” explained Shawn Conrad, executive director of the International Parking Institute that sets standards for accreditation. “Parking at an accredited facility assures the public that the parking organization adheres to a strict code of ethics and meets national and internationally endorsed standards for professionalism, accountability, responsibility and performance,” Conrad said.
