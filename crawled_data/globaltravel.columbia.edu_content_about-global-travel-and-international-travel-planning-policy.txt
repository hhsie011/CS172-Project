We can assist with pre-departure preparations, including overseeing the requirements of the university's International Travel Planning Policy* and working closely with the university's 24/7 emergency assistance provider, International SOS. In support of the mission and core values of Columbia University, we monitor worldwide news, travel alerts, and International SOS Global Risk Ratings to assemble and disseminate safety resources to those on official Columbia Travel. We provide support for Columbia travelers and various international travel issues, such as providing services in times of crisis or emergency. In urgent situations, this includes making recommendations for traveler evacuation from a specific location(s) or halting travel to a specific location for a period of time. The International Travel Planning Policy (ITPP)* This policy establishes a set of guidelines and requirements for planning international travel and covers international Columbia Travel, which includes Columbia-Led Travel and Columbia-Facilitated and/or Recognized Travel, as defined below. It does not cover Non-Columbia Travel. Travelers should fulfill pre-departure travel requirements aligned with the highest-risk location included in their itinerary. "Location" could refer to country, city, or region. From time to time, the University may issue guidance, requirements, and restrictions regarding travel to specific designations in addition to what is specified here**. Global Travel hosted the International Travel Planning Forum in April 2022. Please find the recording of the Forum here. *For a PDF version of the International Travel Planning Policy, please click here. **For Spring and Summer 2022 International Travel Restrictions, please click here.
