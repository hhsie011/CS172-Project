He is the director of the Texas A&M Institute for Genome Sciences and Society. He received his BS in zoology (1983) and PhD in genetics (1989), under the mentorship of Dr. James Womack, from Texas A&M University. Following an NIH-funded Postdoctoral Fellowship at Case Western Reserve University in Dr. Terry Magnuson's laboratory, he became an assistant professor in the Department of Cell Biology at Vanderbilt University in 1996. In 2000 he moved to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where he was promoted to professor in the Department of Genetics. In 2008 he moved to North Carolina State University as professor and head of the Department of Genetics. Threadgill joined the faculty at the Texas A&M University Health Science Center in July 2013. Research Interests Our laboratory uses the mouse as an experimental genetic model to investigate factors that contribute to inter-individual differences in health and disease. Ourcurrent research activities include the identification and functional characterization of alleles contributing to cancer susceptibility, the function of theErbbgenefamily in development and disease, and the role of genetic variation in response to environmental stimuli. To support these investigations, we also aredeveloping new genetic tools to support mammalian systems genetic approaches to phenotypes with complex genetic and environmental etiologies. Specific areas of current research activity include: Cancer genetics We are focusing on colorectal, breast and kidney cancer to identify environmental factors and genetic polymorphisms contributing to differentialsusceptibility to the development and progression of cancer. We are also developing approaches to exploit these factors to prevent or delay cancer as well asto identify new therapies. Epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr) We are using mouse models with genetically engineered or spontaneous mutations to elucidate the biological roleofEgfrand other member of theErbbgene family in vivo. These studies have lead to new insights into the role of these genes in neuronal survival andbehavior, obesity, cancer and cardiovascular disease. We are currently performing mechanistic studies to identify how theErbbgenes contribute to normaland abnormal phenotypes. Genetics of environmental response Just as individuals differ in their genetic constitution and disease susceptibility, they also differ in their responses toexogenous stimuli. We are using mouse models to investigate responses to environmental factors like the enteric flora of the gastrointestinal tract, diet andtoxicants like dioxin, trichloroethylene, and arsenic. The goal of these studies is to identify how individual responses to environmental factors leads to differential diseasesusceptibilities and methods to prevent disease in exposed individuals. Systems genetics resources We are participating in a large international effort to develop and exploit a new mouse genetic resources that will support theintegration of genetics into systems biological analyses at the whole animal level. These efforts are based upon the Collaborative Cross, which is a uniquerecombinant inbred population of mice that have randomly assorted the genetic polymorphisms present in the eight founder inbred strains. A major focus of our work is the development and use of cell-based platforms for in vitro genetic studies.
