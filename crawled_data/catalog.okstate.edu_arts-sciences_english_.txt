Minors Faculty The Department of English prides itself on the diversity of its course offerings and on its small lecture and discussion classes. The department offers a full range of courses in seven areas: literature, creative writing, screen studies, linguistics, teaching English as a second language, rhetoric and writing studies. The number of students in any English class rarely exceeds 30; and in first-year composition the enrollment limit is 19. The maximum number of students in a graduate-level class is 12. An undergraduate English major may select from five options: the traditional literature-based option emphasizes literary appreciation and analysis and allows ample opportunity for discussion, independent thinking and writing. English majors can also add a teaching certificate to this option by completing the required education courses as electives. The creative writing option includes fiction writing, poetry writing and creative nonfiction, with emphasis on interactive workshop classes in which students hone their skills. The third option, screen studies, focuses on the study of the history, theory and aesthetics of cinema, television and new media. And the fourth option, rhetoric and writing studies, is for majors who seek careers in which their writing skills will be applied to the task of generating and exchanging ideas in professional settings. The fifth option is a pre-law track for students planning to go into the legal professions. Many English majors pursue careers directly related to their major, such as those in teaching, editing or publishing, or they may decide to go to graduate school in order to teach in a college or university. Other students find that an English major is excellent preparation for law school or for careers in the ministry, government, business, counseling, social work or library science. The Department of English actively participates in the University Honors Program. Students who qualify for Honors are eligible to enroll in restricted courses and to write a Senior Honors Thesis. The department offers Honors courses at all levels, including an Honors seminar on a different topic each year. A Bachelor of Arts in English requires 45 hours of lower- and upper-division English courses. An English minor requires 18 hours of English, at least nine of which must be upper-division (These hours do not include Freshman Composition.). The department also offers minors in Creative Writing, Linguistics, Professional Writing, and Screen Studies. Undergraduate students majoring in English or in another discipline may also wish to earn a Certificate in TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages).

Master’s students may choose among four programs: Master of Arts in English; Master of Arts in professional writing; and Master of Arts in teaching English as a second language (TESL); and the Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing. In consultation with their advisory committees, both master's and doctoral students have considerable flexibility in designing a degree that meets their own interests and professional goals. Students may take courses in creative writing, screen studies, professional writing, composition and rhetoric, TESL, linguistics, literary theory, and all periods of British and American literature. The diversity of choices and the flexibility of the program prepare students to meet the demands of a changing academic marketplace. Admission Requirements Students seeking admission to the graduate program in English must be accepted by the Graduate College and by the departmental admission committee. In addition to the application and transcripts required by the Graduate College, students must submit to the Department of English graduate coordinator a statement of purpose; letters of recommendation; and a writing sample or the Graduate Record Examination general and subject area scores. Non-native speakers of English must submit scores on all subtests of the TOEFL iBT or IELTS. For fall admission, the early decision deadline is January 15; the final deadline is March 1. The deadline for spring admission is October 15. Prerequisites are listed under each degree below. Teaching Opportunities Depending on their levels of experience and areas of emphasis, graduate teaching assistants may tutor in the Writing Center, serve as discussion leaders for selected large lecture classes, or teach their own sections of freshman composition, composition for international students, technical writing, creative writing, screen studies or literature. All teaching assistants are required to take an appropriate pedagogy course during their first year of teaching. The Master of Arts Degree The MA in English allows students to develop expertise in a variety of areas: literature written in English, creative writing, literary theory and criticism, screen studies, composition and rhetoric, professional writing, linguistics and TESL. In consultation with their advisory committees, students devise an individualized curriculum that reflects their own intellectual interests and prepares them to enter a doctoral program or to teach at the college level. The degree programs in TESL and professional writing prepare teachers for the bilingual classroom and professional writers for industry. Prerequisites include a baccalaureate degree with an English major, or at least 24 hours in English (excluding freshman composition). Successful applicants usually have a minimum grade-point average of 3.00 on a 4.00 scale, particularly in English courses. The MA in English consists of 30 credit hours, including six hours of thesis. In addition to these hours, students must demonstrate reading knowledge of a foreign language, pass the MA qualifying examination, and pass an oral defense of the thesis. The thesis is a work of original research prepared with the guidance of the student's advisory committee. Creative writing students may present as their theses original works in poetry or prose fiction. The programs in professional writing and TESL have separate degree requirements described below. Professional Writing The MA option in professional writing consists of 30 credit hours (with thesis) or 33 credit hours (without thesis). In addition to these hours, students must fulfill the foreign language requirement and pass the MA qualifying examination in technical writing. Prerequisites are the same as those above. TESL The MA option in teaching English as a second language is designed to provide students with the skills necessary to teach English to non-native speakers in a variety of situations, e.g., teaching English as a foreign language in an overseas school, college or university; teaching English as a second language to international students studying in intensive English programs in the U.S.; or teaching English to bilingual and bicultural students in American public school systems and adult education programs. Prerequisites are the same as those above except that the major may be either in English or in a field related to second language acquisition or teaching. In addition, applicants to the TESL program must have six hours in a foreign language with a grade of "B" or better, or must complete this requirement prior to taking the qualifying examination. The TESL program consists of 30 credit hours (thesis option) or 34 credit hours (non-thesis option). In addition to these hours, students must pass the MA qualifying examinations in TESL. TESL is especially relevant to the public school classroom as a result of recent legislation concerning bilingual education. Teachers in English and other areas of expertise will find this program especially useful. The Oklahoma State Board of Education recently approved an "optional certification" for English as a Second Language. Already certified teachers can obtain this certification upon passing the required standardized examination. Several of the courses offered for the TESL option can prepare students for this examination, although the MA/TESL option degree does not confer certification. Certificate in TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) The Certificate in TESOL is a program designed to provide students with the skills important for teaching English to non-native speakers in a variety of situations, including teaching English to bilingual/bicultural, English Language Learner (ELL) and Limited English Proficient (LEP) students in public school systems and adult education programs, teaching English as a Second Language to international students studying in English programs in the U.S., and teaching English as a Foreign Language in an overseas school, college or university. The program consists of 12 credit hours, with three required courses and one elective course chosen from a group of courses offered by the Department of English. Admission to the Certificate Program in TESOL requires a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree from an accredited institution of higher learning, a 3.0 GPA, two letters of recommendation, and, for non-native English speakers, appropriate scores on either the TOEFL iBT or IELTS. The Master of Fine Arts Degree The MFA in Creative Writing allows students to focus on developing their abilities as poets and/or fiction writers, through a course of study emphasizing creative writing workshops, literature seminars, and electives in either of those areas or other areas in language and culture. In consultation with their advisory committees, students devise an individualized curriculum that reflects their own artistic and intellectual interests and prepares them to publish their artistic writing, enter a PhD program or teach at the college level. The MFA in Creative Writing consists of 42 credit hours, including 12 hours of thesis. In addition to these hours, students must present their creative work at a public reading following the completion of their thesis. Prerequisites include a baccalaureate degree with an English major, or at least 12 hours in English (excluding freshman composition) and writing sample of high quality. Successful applicants usually have a minimum grade-point average of 3.00 on a 4.00 scale, particularly in English courses. The Doctor of Philosophy Degree The Department of English grants one doctoral degree, the PhD in English. Students may, however, emphasize in their courses, their exams, and their dissertations a variety of areas: all periods of British and American literature, Native American literature and language, creative writing, literary theory and criticism, screen studies, rhetoric and professional writing, linguistics and TESL. They may also choose an interdisciplinary emphasis. In consultation with their advisory committees, students devise an individualized curriculum that reflects their own intellectual interests and professional goals. Prerequisites include a master's degree in English or a field related to the student's area of emphasis. Successful applicants usually have a minimum grade-point average of 3.50 on a 4.00 scale in their master's degrees. All PhD students are admitted provisionally and must take the first-year examination during their second semester of enrollment. The PhD degree consists of 60 credit hours beyond the master's degree. Fifteen to 20 of these hours are devoted to the dissertation. In addition to these hours, students must take a first-year examination; demonstrate reading knowledge of two foreign languages or mastery of one language; pass the PhD qualifying examination in two areas; and pass an oral defense of the dissertation. The dissertation is a work of original research prepared under the direction of the dissertation committee.
