While you're here, you will have the chance to meet people from around the world and across the United States. We also care about creating a supportive environment that enables you to connect with others who share your culture, language, and faith. Here are some parts of the network that will connect you during your time at Syracuse University. The Syracuse Area Middle East Dialogue Group was formed over 20 years ago by seven representatives of each of three communities: Palestinians, Jews, and concerned “others.” Over those two decades, the Dialogue Group has worked locally, nationally and internationally to promote a peaceful solution to the conflict in the Middle East. Hendricks Chapel, "a place for all people," is the religious, spiritual, ethical, and cultural heart of Syracuse University. It connects people of all faiths and no faith through active engagement, mutual dialogue, reflective spirituality, responsible leadership and a rigorous commitment to social justice. The Office of Student Life supports 300 recognized student organizations, including the Chabad House, Hellil Jewish Student Union, Muslim Student Association and the Turkish Student Association. Recognized student organizations are integral to the educational process at Syracuse University. The Office of Multicultural Affairs supports and promotes the academic achievement, multicultural competence, social development, civic engagement, and retention of students of historically underrepresented racial/ethnic groups at Syracuse University. The Division of Student Affairs supports the student experience through a comprehensive set of programs designed to enhance learning, maximize responsible community engagement and promote the health and wellness of all students.
