Although we select students based on their academic talents and preparation, we desire to fill a class full of various talents and backgrounds, and seek to understand how students will contribute to the greater BC community. We review each application with a level of thoroughness and thoughtfulness that reflects the time and effort you have invested in Boston College. In making admission decisions, we consider grades, standardized test scores, what you do outside of school, teachers’ and others’ appraisals, and how you express yourself through writing. There is no specific formula to gain admission - our goal is to enroll a class filled with various types of scholars, learning styles, talents, and personalities.
