Learn more about the course offerings » *Please note: Besides the University Core Courses, which all Seton Hall University students are required to take, each school or college also has its own requirements. In some cases, as in the College of Arts and Sciences, these requirements are referred to as that college's "core." However, these requirements are specific to each school or college and are distinct from the University Core requirements. The Core Every Seton Hall student is required to take three classes - known as the Core - that creatively connect Catholic thought with the natural sciences, literature, history, music and other fields. A Core Education Seton Hall University presents students with a unique study of the major world texts and Catholic intellectual traditions as they relate to the "great questions of life".
