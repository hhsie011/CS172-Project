There are accumulating data that support the value of COVID-19 booster dosing. Studies indicate that the protective immune response achieved after booster doses is superior when compared to after the primary vaccination schedule, including in a small study that examined this against the omicron variant. In addition, recent findings indicate that booster doses were associated with a substantial decrease in deaths when compared to individuals who had only received the primary vaccination doses. In view of these findings, Columbia University would like to assist you in finding appointments with the following resources as noted below. Columbia Primary Care If you are a Columbia Primary Care patient, make an appointment with a nurse for your booster by calling 844-387-2273 (844-387-CARE). If you would like to become a Columbia Primary Care patient, please schedule a visit to address a health care concern or for preventive care.
