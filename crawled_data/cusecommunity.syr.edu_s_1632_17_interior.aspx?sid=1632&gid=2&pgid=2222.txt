The office (formerly known as the Office of Program Development) hosts a number of events throughout the year, most notably Coming Back Together (CBT) reunions. An on-campus CBT event, held every three years, brings Black and Latino alumni back to Syracuse to celebrate their accomplishments and discover how SU has grown and changed over the years. It also introduces current students to successful alumni, enabling them to make connections and get advice on making the most of their time after graduation. In addition, “traveling” CBT reunions are held off campus, both in the U.S. and in locations around the world. Previous international CBT reunions have been aboard a Caribbean cruise and in South Africa. Regardless of their location, CBT events give alumni opportunities to catch up, reminisce, and share their vision for how they can keep the University moving forward. The work of the Office of Multicultural Advancement also benefits students in important ways. By bringing them together with alumni mentors and raising funds for the Our Time Has Come Scholarship program, the office opens the doors of opportunity to underrrepresented students pursuing their undergraduate or graduate degrees.
