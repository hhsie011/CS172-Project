1:30 PM Monday, June 28 12:00 - 1:30 pm New York The aim of this webinar is to deepen our understanding on the question of sexuality through the temporalities of national politics, and how anti-LGBTQ laws are expanding or contracting in response to political tendencies, and sociopolitical and economic motivations. Other topics include the geopolitical divides that produce and contest contemporary queer phobias, the international movement for LGBTQ+ civil rights, and the multilayered challenges confronting queer communities that enable reductionist politics. Themes that will inform this discussion include: Queer temporality in the queer politics of the postcolonial world How gender and sexuality are constituted in and by global politics Global governorship concerning LGBTQ+ rights Intersectionality and queerness Sa’ed Atshan, Associate Professor of Peace and Conflict Studies, Swarthmore College and author of Queer Palestine and the Empire of Critique Evren Savci, Assistant Professor of Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, Yale University Mark Gevisser, South African author of The Pink Line: Journeys Across the World’s Queer Frontiers Moderated by Tareq Baconi, Palestinian Author, Hamas Contained: The Rise and Pacification of Palestinian Resistance Upcoming Events Columbia Global CentersAmman / Beijing / Istanbul / Mumbai / Nairobi / Paris / Rio / Santiago / Tunis Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
