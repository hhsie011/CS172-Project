Through guided coursework, advising and hands-on experience working with community partners, students in ESP are able to contextualize abstract theories, challenge assumptions and develop skills that prepare them for lives of effective action. Students who complete the program receive an academic transcript notation as Engaged Scholars. If you are a current Engaged Scholar, click here for more program information. New applications are no longer being accepted for ESP, but interested students are welcome to declare the new Engaged Scholarship Certificate. Structure Engaged Scholars complete four requirements: 1. Engaged Courses 2. ESP Practicum 3. ESP Seminar 4. ESP Capstone Advising and mentoring is critical to the Engaged Scholars Program, from course selection to practicum development. As a general rule, academic departments and programs provide advising through faculty advisors for course selection and capstone development. ESP staff primarily advise on practicum development, and also provide ongoing advising about program requirements. Student participation in the program is tracked by ESP staff and concentration advisors in ASK. We encourage ESP students to continually update their concentration course plan in ASK to include engaged courses. Additionally, the ESP Canvas site, available to ESP students and viewable by advisors and ESP staff, provides more information about program requirements and is a platform for submitting program requirements, including practicum work plans and reflections. More information about Program Requirements. ESP Requirements Eligibility The Engaged Scholars Program accepted applications from students in participating concentrations through Summer 2020 but is not enrolling additional students. The new undergraduate Engaged Scholarship Certificate (ESC) builds on the strengths and core elements of the ESP and is accessible to students in any concentration. Students will be able to submit ESC declarations in ASK beginning in August 2021. All students already participating in the ESP will be supported through to graduation.
