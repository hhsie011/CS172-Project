Tyler GAID majors join a tight-knit network of students, teachers and alumni that embraces the power of design to open minds, move hearts, shape environments and heal communities. Tyler's faculty help students find their unique voice and wield it to solve complex social challenges that impact us all, from poster campaigns that spotlight the effects of climate change to apps that address the problem of physical exercise for individuals who are visually impaired. Students are pushed to experiment and create original, research-driven concepts across all platforms, including illustration, typography, packaging, web sites, social media, virtual reality and real-life spaces. Students at Tyler get the best of both worlds: an intimate community with small classes and personal mentorship; and access to the facilities, academic experts and resources of Temple, a leading public research university based in Philadelphia, with its dynamic arts and culture scene and opportunities for professional advancement. Portfolio Review for Admission into the GAID Major Because of the demand for a limited number of spaces in the Graphic and Interactive Design Major, all BFA students who are not yet declared majors in Graphic and Interactive Design will have to apply for the Sophomore Portfolio Review in GAID in order to get into the major, regardless of when that student started at Tyler or when they took Graphic Design (GAD 2001) and Computers for Design (GAD 2021). The review process is required for any Tyler student seeking to enter the major. Because the GAID program follows a strict fall/spring sequence, students may only begin as GAID majors in the fall semester. Students must complete the program in sequence as the capstone courses are offered only in the spring. Admitted students must begin taking required courses in the major at the junior (3xxx) level in the academic year immediately following official admission to the major or their admission to the major will be forfeited. It is strongly recommended that potential applicants for admission to the GAID major attend one of the official sophomore advising meetings with the GAID Program Head where the application process will be explained. The process will also be explained by the instructors in each section of GAD 2001. Laptop Requirement for GAID Majors The Graphic and Interactive Design Department at Tyler School of Art and Architecture is committed to excellence in design and the full integration of technologies within our discipline to best educate and prepare our students to become leaders in this field. A thorough understanding of the changing nature of design and the integral role that technology plays in it is essential for all our students to be active participants in this ever-changing environment. For full device and software requirements and recommendations, please see the Graphic & Interactive Design Laptop Requirements. Degree Requirements The Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Graphic and Interactive Design may be conferred upon a student by recommendation of the faculty and upon the satisfactory completion of a minimum of 126 semester hours of credit with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.00. All Graphic and Interactive Design majors must complete the BFA curriculum and General Education requirements. The required Junior/Senior courses must be completed with a C- or better to fulfill major requirements. Requirements for B.F.A. in Graphic & Interactive Design Sophomore Requirements Course List Code Title Credit Hours GAD 2001 Graphic Design 3 GAD 2021 Computers for Design 3 Note: A minimum final grade of C- in GAD 2001 and in GAD 2021 along with the approved portfolio review is required to be accepted to the major. Graphic and Interactive Design majors who plan to study abroad should do so in the second semester of their sophomore year if they plan to graduate in four years. These students should see the Area Head for advising prior to leaving. GAID Protocol for Portfolio Reviews There will be two portfolio review cycles in Graphic & Interactive Design (GAID) each academic year: the end of the Fall semester (December) and the end of the Spring semester (May). The portfolio reviews will take place in the week after final studio course reviews. Specific dates for the reviews will be announced at the beginning of each semester in the GAD 2001 classes. They will also be posted on Canvas and in the GAID suite. All full-time GAID faculty will serve on the GAID Portfolio Review Admissions Committee. Applicants must have completed all Tyler Foundations courses (or had approved transfer courses as noted by the Tyler Admissions Office) and the 2 prerequisites for the major: GAD 2001 and GAD 2021 with a C-minus or better. Application and Notification The complete policy and application process is detailed on the Graphic and Interactive Design web site: https://tyler.temple.edu/programs/graphic-interactive-design. Application forms will be available for eligible students on Canvas. Students who have completed or who are currently enrolled in the two prerequisites for the GAID major (GAD 2001 and GAD 2021) and intend to submit an application for the Portfolio Review will be able to obtain an application form, portfolio template and detailed application instructions on Canvas by mid-semester. Students who fail to submit all of the required materials for the Portfolio Review will be disqualified, but may re-apply at the next review cycle as a first-time submitter. Late submissions will not be reviewed. Applicants to the GAID major will receive one of the following decisions from the committee after the review is completed: (i) accepted, (ii) not accepted, or (iii) revise and submit. Students who receive a "(iii) revise and submit" evaluation should re-apply in the next portfolio review cycle. Students who pass the portfolio review for admission to the GAID major will be informed via TUmail. Within 2 weeks of receiving this e-mail, admitted students must reply to the acceptance e-mail to confirm that they definitively want to major in GAID. Students who do not confirm by that deadline will forfeit their admission to the major and will need to re-apply in the next GAID portfolio review cycle as a second-time submitter. Students are limited to no more than two applications to the major.
