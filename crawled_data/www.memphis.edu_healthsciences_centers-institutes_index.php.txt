Every project or partner we engage with aims to increase the understanding of both the processes and benefits of applying science to human activity. This is achieved through applied research/projects, education and increasing access and opportunity. The Center completes practical science projects to answer applied questions and challenges posed by our partners. While our main role is completing applied sport science research with our Memphis Tigers Athletics coaches and trainers, we also partner with teams, schools and corporate partners to solve their applied human performance challenges. Center for Nutraceutical and Dietary Supplement Research The Center for Nutraceutical and Dietary Supplement Research (CNDSR) investigates botanical agents, dietary ingredients and finished dietary supplements in terms of safety and efficacy, through the use of cell culture experiments, animal studies and human clinical trials. A particular strength of the Center is the ability for scientists to perform both safety and efficacy experiments using raw materials, isolated ingredients and finished dietary supplements. This includes pharmacokinetic evaluations of new and existing ingredients, in addition to assay development using technology such as HPLC, GC/MS, LC/MS and other platforms. Studies can be performed using both animal models and human subjects, as well as cell culture. Healthy Eating Institute The Healthy Eating Institute (HEI) is a College of Health Sciences and Campus Recreation initiative. The mission of the HEI is to educate the community on optimal nutrient intake to support health and performance, and to provide nutrient-dense meal options to promote healthy living. A secondary focus is to utilize the institute programs to further promote education and nutrition-related research efforts within the College of Health Sciences.
