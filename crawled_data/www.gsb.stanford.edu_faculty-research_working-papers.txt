Before World War I, when the UK dominated global bond markets, the UK’s government debt was not always fully backed by its future surpluses. As predicted by theories of safe asset… Bargaining and International Reference Pricing in the Pharmaceutical Industry Pierre Dubois, Ashvin Gandhi, Shoshana Vasserman April2022 The United States spends twice as much per person on pharmaceuticals as European countries, in large part because prices are much higher in the US. This fact has led policymakers to consider legislation for price controls. This… Internationalizing Like China Christopher Clayton, Amanda Dos Santos, Matteo Maggiori, Jesse Schreger April2022 We empirically characterize how China is internationalizing the Renminbi by selectively opening up its domestic bond market and propose a dynamic reputation model to explain China’s internationalization strategy. While previously… The Rest of the World’s Dollar-Weighted Return on U.S. Treasurys Arvind Krishnamurthy, Hanno Lustig, Zhengyang Jiang April2022 Since 1980, foreign investors have timed their purchases and sales of U.S. Treasurys to yield particularly low returns. Their annual dollar-weighted returns, measured by IRRs, are around 3% lower than a buy-and-hold strategy over… Voluntary Disclosure and Personalized Pricing S. Nageeb Ali, Greg Lewis, Shoshana Vasserman April2022 Firms have ever increasing access to consumer data, which they use to personalize their advertising and to price discriminate. This raises privacy concerns. Policymakers have argued in response that consumers should be given… Measuring U.S. Fiscal Capacity using Discounted Cash Flow Analysis Zhengyang Jiang, Hanno Lustig, Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh, Mindy Z. Xiaolan March252022 We use discounted cash flow analysis to measure a country’s fiscal capacity. Crucially, the discount rate applied to projected cash flows includes a GDP risk premium. We apply our valuation method to the CBO’s projections for the… Corporate Financial Disclosures and the Market for Innovation Jinhwan Kim, Kristen Valentine March242022 We examine the spillover effect of public firm innovation disclosures on the patent trading market. Relative to equity markets, the patent market is decentralized and rife with information frictions, yet it serves as an important… Beyond Incomplete Spanning: Convenience Yields and Exchange Rate Disconnect Zhengyang Jiang, Arvind Krishnamurthy, Hanno Lustig March2022 We introduce convenience yields on dollar bonds into an incomplete-markets equilibrium model of exchange rates and interest rates. The convenience yield enters as a stochastic wedge in the Euler equation for exchange rate… Transparency on the Path to Net-Zero Stephen D. Comello, Julia Reichelstein, Stefan J.

Evidence from a Field Experiment Jung Ho Choi, Joseph Pacelli, Kristina M.

We embed a field experiment in… Adaptive Sequential Experiments with Unknown Information Arrival Processes Yonatan Gur, Ahmadreza Momeni 2022 Sequential experiments are deployed in a variety of practices, including for optimizing product recommendations and pricing in online platforms. Such experiments are often characterized by an exploration-exploitation tradeoff that… Cross-Border Knowledge Transfer and Performance in Emerging Economic Regions: the Case of Japanese International Joint Ventures in China Takehiko Isobe, Shige Makino, David Bruce Montgomery 2022 As emerging economic regions (EERs) play a significant role in global economies, managers of multinationals have become increasingly aware of the importance of relevant international expansion in these regions. Facing potential… Financial Resources Impact the Relationship between Meaning and Happiness Rhia Catapano, Jordi Quoidbach, Cassie Mogilner, Jennifer Aaker 2022 Do financial resources relate to how important meaning is for one’s happiness?
