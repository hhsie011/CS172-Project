These changes in brain function produce emotional dampening, the reduced perception of emotionally meaningful environmental cues such as facial expressions. Emotional dampening could lead to increased psychosocial stress, further elevations in blood pressure and a higher risk for cardiovascular disease.

College of Behavioral, Social & Health Sciences C, 276 Design and Synthesis of Advanced Nanomaterials to Address the Global Challenges of the 21st Century This Creative Inquiry is focused on the design and synthesis of nanomaterials for applications that are of significant interest towards addressing the grand challenges of the 21st century. Specifically, this CI research is addressing challenges associated with Catalysis and Drug Delivery. Catalysis is responsible for 90% of the chemicals and materials produced today. This equivocates to roughly 30% of the global GDP. We are looking to redefine the way nanomaterials are used for catalysis.

(2014). Document 524: Draft Final Design Report. College of Engineering, Computing & Applied Sciences F,F, 69 Cyber Bullying This project examines a variety of aversive interpersonal behaviors, most notably cyberbullying, hazing, and school shootings. People engage in a variety of aversive interpersonal behaviors. Some of these behaviors are more mundane, such as guilt-induction. Others, such as those that constitute the focus of this team, are more insidious in nature, and have potentially fatal consequences. One of the interesting things about these behaviors is that, as seemingly disparate as they appear, there is actually quite a bit of overlap between them. For example, our research suggests an overlap between bullying and hazing. Additionally, one of the key predictors of perpetrating a school shooting is a long-term history of rejection, manifested most often through a history of bullying. One focus of our team with all of these behaviors is not only understanding antecedents and consequences but also prevention and intervention strategies.

College of Behavioral, Social & Health Sciences C, 957 Investigations into Primate Personality This Creative Inquiry project is centered around analysis of data that were collected on zoo-living monkeys. Behavioral experiments, in which golden lion tamarin monkeys were exposed to novel foods and objects, were conducted on 10 family groups in 4 different zoos. Students will examine whether the response to novelty differs in males and females. They also will explore the question of personality in golden lion tamarins. Students will computerize data from video recordings of the experiments, organize and analyze the data, and delve into relevant literature to inform themselves on the topics at hand. They will create posters and present oral presentations on the results.

College of Behavioral, Social & Health Sciences C, 1579 Disposable Point-of Care Home Testing Platform for Metabolic Disease Nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH) is a rare, pediatric metabolic disease caused by mutations resulting in the deficiency of the enzyme complex that breaks down the amino acid glycine. The resulting abnormally high levels of glycine in the body leads to severe medical issues starting in infancy, including uncontrollable seizures and problems with breathing. There are currently no tools available to monitor levels of glycine in patients while at home, which is necessary for drug and diet-mediated regulation of glycine levels in the body and preventing seizures. The objective of this CI is to develop a low-cost, disposable, stand-alone point-of-care diagnostic and monitoring system to enable caregivers of NKH patients to monitor glycine levels at home, adjust the patient’s drug treatment schedule, and improve the patient’s quality of life as well as clinical outcomes.

Team LeadersKatie Hildebrand Erwin Center for Brand Comm College of Business D, 1629 DeepGreen: Modeling and Boosting Energy Efficiency on Liquid Immersion HPC Systems This project aims to comprehensively understand the opportunities enabled by liquid immersion cooling, and explore its full potential to boost energy efficiency for high performance computing (HPC) under various thermal and power constraints. Improving energy efficiency, i.e., the ratio of performance to total power consumption, is crucial to sustain performance growth and realize exascale computing within 20 MW of power. HPC systems consume tremendous amounts of power for not only computing but also cooling to keep compute components within their thermal limits. In this project, we investigate liquid immersion HPC systems to optimize overall energy efficiency. we propose to develop machine learning models and system software to understand and optimize energy efficiency and reliability for workloads running on liquid immersion HPC systems. Our experimental platform is a Submer SmartPodX immersion cooling system.

College of Engineering, Computing & Applied Sciences F,F, 561 Relationship Between Toxoplasma Infection and Immune Responses in Cancer Development Toxoplasmosis is a highly prevalent infectious disease among the human population with approximately one third of the people on the earth carry such infections. The causing agent Toxoplasma gondii widely spreads in the environment. The primary infections generally do not cause severe symptoms in healthy people owing to competent immunity; however, they can transit into latent infection and form cysts within the host’s brain by penetrating the blood-brain barrier or muscle tissue. When the host experiences compromised immunity, such as cancer development, the cyst can be reactivated to cause severe or even lethal situations. Moreover, a recent study has revealed that the infection of Toxoplasma can trigger a similar signaling pathway shared with cancer development. So far, many epidemiological studies have shown that the human population with cancer have a higher Toxoplasma infection percentage than the healthy control group. These findings suggest a positive correlation between Toxoplasma infection with cancer occurrence, and the cancer patients are more vulnerable to primary toxoplasmosis than healthy individuals. It is obvious that the immune system plays a critical role in the parasite infection and tumor development; however, the information about the immune regulation in Toxoplasma infection on tumor development is very limited. In this project, students will have the opportunity to investigate the relationship between Toxoplasma infection and the immune system on cancer development using in vitro assays.

College of Science G,O,O,G,G, 115 Orthopaedic Retrieval Program (CU- REPRO) Medical implant devices have been used widely for more than 50 years, and it is estimated that 8 - 10 % of Americans (20-25 million people) currently have such a device. Orthopaedic implants are medical devices made of biomaterials used to treat musculoskeletal disorders inside the human body with an intended lifespan spanning years. Although implant devices have produced great benefits, it must be recognized that implants sometimes must be removed or replaced. Bioengineers contribute to their continual state of development to increase their performance and extend their useful lifespan. This cross-disciplinary project applies fundamental concepts in bioengineering, materials science, and biological sciences to investigate orthopaedic implants after they have functioned in patients. Long-term data on the behavior of implant devices and host response are essential inputs to the development process, yet there are few systematic programs for the retrieval and analysis of implants in the USA. Independent and international data banks do exist however. The contributions to implant design provided by retrieval and analysis will benefit patients through improvements in implant performance. We can consider implants to be defined as having a minimum lifespan of 3 months, as penetrating living tissue, as having a physiologic interaction and as being retrievable. A number of barriers exist to the establishment of an implant retrieval program. Major impediments are the costs associated with such a program and fear of litigation affecting manufacturers, hospitals, physicians, and investigators. The long term goal of this Creative Inquiry project is to establish and develop a viable Clemson University Implant Retrieval Program and pursue hypothesis-driven research related to orthopaedic implants. The aim of this program is to provide a working repository for retrieved orthopaedic implants, and to develop the tools and techniques for the systematic evaluation of implant designs, materials, surfaces and function.

In a series of experiments we will investigate the accuracy of perceptual judgments pertaining to a variety of affordance behaviors, such stepping over, jumping over, passing through, whether or not an object is reachable, whether or not a short incline is stand-on-able, etc. Team LeadersChristopher Pagano Psychology Balagopal Raveendranath Psychology Hannah Solini Psychology Kathryn Lucaites Psychology Accomplishments publications presentations grants Day, B., Ebrahimi, E., Hartman, L., Pagano, C., Robb, A., & Babu, S.

College of Engineering, Computing & Applied Sciences F, 645 Bamboo Reinforced Concrete This project was initially started following the 2010 Haiti Earthquake. Many concrete and masonry buildings collapsed during the 2010 Haiti Earthquake resulting in serious devastation and many casualties. One of the major cause of widespread building collapses was the lack of reinforcement (steel bars) in the buildings. Steel rebars are very expensive in Haiti. This project seeks to use bamboo as a replacement for steel to reinforce concrete and masonry structures.

Existing programs addressing type 2 diabetes – prevention and treatment – will be researched and critiqued. An intervention specific for the population that we will work with will be created and implemented following a thorough literature review and hypothesis(es) generated which will facilitate development of an effective intervention for a local population. Students will be trained in anthropometrics and assessment measures such as finger sticks & glucometer use, physical assessments that are diabetes related such as skin changes, foot and eye changes. They will also learn how to assess HgA1C, breath and urine changes with uncontrolled diabetes in order to more effectively relate to and treat their clients. Blood pressure will also be monitored as cardiovascular changes occur with uncontrolled diabetes. Students will plan and develop an educational intervention and/or plan a media campaign and learn/practice assessments Fall semester along with conducting a pilot assessment.

College of Science G, 1617 Engineering Nanobiomaterials for Delivery of Cancer Therapy Advances in cancer research together with advances in biomaterials and nanotechnology, have enabled the development of micro- nano-scaled drug delivery systems for cancer treatment. The goals of delivery systems for cancer treatment are (1) delivering cancer therapeutics efficiently to the tumor site, (2) enhancing uptake of therapeutics by tumor cells, and (3) minimizing non-specific uptake of therapeutics by healthy cells. The design of effective delivery systems for cancer therapies will require optimization of micro- or nano-based delivery systems, cell-specific targeting, and mechanisms for effective drug release. Targeted delivery may be enhanced by both active and passive targeting mechanism. Targeting moieties that bind to overexpressed receptors on malignant cells can be conjugated to particles to increase cell-specific uptake, thus enhancing the efficacy of treatment. Additionally, environmentally responsive polymers can be used to achieve efficient and/or controlled release of therapeutics under physiologic conditions. The goal of this CI is to develop innovative drug delivery systems to advance cancer treatment.

Team LeadersYiqiang Han Mechanical Engineering College of Engineering, Computing & Applied Sciences F, 263 Projects for Sustainable Development in Recovering and Developing Communities Spring 2022 The Sustainable Designs CI project brings together students from a variety of majors in engineering and science to explore sustainable options for fueling our world and restoring our natural resources and ecosystems- options that are particularly suited for developing communities and those that are recovering from natural disasters. In past semesters, solar water heaters and solar water distillation systems have been explored. More recently, the team has focused on two projects: 1) the biological production of hydrogen gas (H2) for use as a biofuel from waste agricultural products; and 2) the restoration of oyster reefs for reducing sediment loss in wetlands and improving ecosystem function. The biological production of hydrogen gas using waste agricultural products is one way to produce biofuels in a sustainable manner. In this CI, students learned the lab-scale techniques (media preparation, inoculation and incubation) for the anaerobic bacterium Thermotoga neapolitana that is capable of converting sucrose, fructose and glucose contained in cull fruits to H2 gas, acetic acid, and CO2. The team will investigate options for optimizing the rate of H2 production.Globally, 85% of the world's oyster reefs have been destroyed or harvested. The CI team will investigate means to restore oyster reefs in the ACE basin in South Carolina, through the use of structures to provide suitable surface area for spat attachment. The team will collaborate with SC-DNR personnel to design and install structures near Fenwick Island, SC in the ACE Basin.

College of Behavioral, Social & Health Sciences C, 1036 Metabolism in the Human Parasite Entamoeba Histolytica Entamoeba histolytica is a human pathogen that causes dysentery in ~90 million people each year. This disease is spread through ingestion of contaminated water or food, primarily in developing countries in areas that lack adequate sanitation and/or are overcrowded. Entamoeba is found in the environment as a resistant cyst that is shed by an infected person. Ingested cysts will survive the harsh stomach environment to become the motile amoeba form in the small intestine. These amoebas then move to large intestine to colonize and new cysts can form to be shed to the environment to allow the infection process to continue. Entamoeba infection can be treated; however, only ~10% of those infected develop symptomatic disease. Thus, there may be between 500 million and 1 billion people who are asymptomatic carriers of the disease who may not be receiving treatment, leading to Entamoeba’s persistence in the environment. Our research investigates how Entamoeba grows and thrives in the human body. Entamoeba colonizes the large intestine, which is a nutrient-poor environment since most of the nutrients from the food we eat has already been absorbed in the small intestine. We are examining what other nutrients Entamoeba can use for growth and how it interacts with the large intestine and the bacteria present there. This research is expected to help us understand how colonization in the large intestine occurs and helps this disease persist.

Team LeadersLesley Ross Psychology Paige Rodeghero School of Computing Christine Phillips Psychology College of Behavioral, Social & Health Sciences C,F,C, 1891 Modeling Solid-Liquid Interface Properties in High-Entropy Alloys for Additive Manufacturing Processes Advanced designs in many applications require the development of materials with improved properties to cope with the increasingly harsh environments that such applications pose. Advanced manufacturing processes, such as additive manufacturing (AM), can deliver parts with complex geometries, minimal waste material, and limited post-processing. However, AM microstructures can vary considerably from those produced by traditional metallurgy. It is essential to characterize and control the microstructure and properties of AM parts such that they may be qualified for use in critical applications. Furthermore, the combination of these advanced processing techniques with novel compositions, such as high-entropy alloys, can potentially generate invaluable knowledge to grow optimized materials. We will use atomistic modeling tools to analyze the solid-liquid interface properties that control the solidification process and dictate the morphology of the microstructure. We will combine molecular dynamics with Monte Carlo methods to sample the correct composition in the solid, liquid and interphase. We will compute the interphase stiffness relying on the capillary fluctuation method and the kinetic coefficient for different compositions and undercoolings.

The levels of burnout are alarming and may adversely impact professional development, jeopardize patient safety and place undue strain on the physical and mental health of student nurses. Even before the COVID-19 outbreak, many already faced symptoms related to burnout syndrome as well as stress, anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and even suicidality. Now this global pandemic crisis is presenting even greater academic and personal hardships that are very likely to exacerbate existing levels of burnout syndrome and related mental health problems.

College of Science G,G, 880 Microbes All Around Us Microbes are all around us. They are in the air we breathe, the water we drink, the soil we walk on, the food we eat; they are even in and on us. Although this fact is generally acknowledged, we don’t always have a great appreciation for the roles these microbes play in our health. Antimicrobial resistance for pathogens is clearly becoming a bigger and bigger problem, but there is also the potential for some classically non-pathogenic organisms to cause issues. This Creative Inquiry project will focus on investigating a variety of bacteria with various impacts on humans. We will use hypotheses generated by the student investigators’ natural curiosity or recent news stories as the driving force behind our experiments. This CI has investigated topics such as microbial contamination of lab coats during General Microbiology teaching labs and the potential for magazines in physician's waiting rooms to serve as sources of infection. We have also investigated the antimicrobial activity of various novel compounds with collaborators in the Department of Chemistry.

College of Science G,G, 1581 Building an Academic Dashboard/Case Study of Black Students in Engineering Many students don’t realize that there are multiple degree paths to most careers, especially in engineering. As part of an NSF-funded project, students on this Creative Inquiry team will help design and develop a prototype “Academic Dashboard” to help put students in the driver’s seat of their education. The dashboard will include information about major choice and activities to develop and track adaptive decision-making skills. The project will focus on two main tasks: 1) designing the dashboard structure, and 2) modeling academic pathways in engineering. The purpose of modeling academic pathways using longitudinal data is to identify indicators of “overpersistence” and alternative strategic pathways. This information will be incorporated into the dashboard to help students make informed decisions about their path forward.

Warm season annuals can complement perennial cool-season systems and extend production during this critical summer months. High level of nitrogen fertilization are usually required to maximize summer annual grasses production, but summer annual legumes have the potential to provide high forage quality and fix atmospheric N that will reduce fertilizer cost. In recent years, stored forage in the form of baleage has become more popular in the southeast. Legumes-grasses might present some challenges for a proper ensiling process due to the commonly lower sugar concentration in the resultant forage. Thus, evaluating the impact of the ensiling process of this forage mixes is warranted in order to generate producer’s adoption of these forage sources.Although alfalfa has been grown in the Southeastern USA since the late 1800’s, it has not attained the status in this region as in other parts of the nation mainly due to problems with alfalfa weevil and an abundant supply of inexpensive nitrogen fertilizer that reduced the need for leguminous crops to boost soil fertility. However, the cost of fertilizers has risen and modern well-adapted and pest-resistant alfalfa varieties are available in the market. Information about productivity and management of alfalfa, generated locally, is needed in order to demonstrate, educate, and ultimately re-introduce and advance the utilization of alfalfa as part of diverse forage systems and crop rotations for livestock farms in the Southeast USA. The goals of this project are to evaluate: 1. How summer annual grasses alone or in mixtures with annual legumes affects yield and nutritional value of fresh and ensiled forage. 2. The impact of growing new alfalfa varieties on plant persistency, forage yield and quality.

Team LeadersWinifred Newman School of Architecture Timothy Sutherland School of Architecture College of Architecture, Arts & Humanities B,B, 1895 Soft Matter and Complex Fluids This creative inquiry will enhance students’ ability of computational thinking by offering computational research projects on soft matter and complex fluids. Soft matter represents soft materials that are easily deformed by thermal fluctuations and small external forces, while complex fluids refer to multi-component soft materials that can flow but display non-Newtonian rheology. Gels, liquid crystals, polymers, colloids, emulsions, foams, lipid membranes, cell suspensions, and many biological systems fit this description. Soft matter and complex fluids are ubiquitous in nature and play an important role in many industrial and biological applications, from soft construction materials, food processing industries, to biomimetic soft materials and artificial tissues.

However, ES cell research has been hampered due to the ethical concerns of the use of human embryos. Recently, scientists have developed a novel way to convert somatic cells into ES-like cells through forced expression of four transcription factors key to the ES cell pluripotency maintenance. These cells are called induced pluripotent stem cells (IPS). The initial method used for IPS induction is based on retrovirus due to its high transfection efficiency. However, the potential dangers of retrovirus induced insertional mutagenesis and transformation pose great concerns for the applications of theses IPS cells in human. Therefore a great deal of research efforts have been put in the search of alternative delivery systems to create safer IPS cells, such as protein, mRNA, plasmid, and non-integrating viral system. My laboratory has been working with a non-viral episomal vector based on the sequence of mammalian scaffold/matrix attachment region (S/mar), which are sequences in the DNA of eukaryotic chromosomes where the nuclear matrix attaches. S/mar sequences function as architectural DNA components that organize the genome of eukaryotes into functional units within the cell nucleus. Plasmids incorporated with the S/mar sequence can be maintained as replicative episomal units within mammalian nuclei. We plan to clone the four transcription factors into this vector for IPS induction. This episomal vector system will not only reduce or eliminate the potentials of insertional mutagenesis, but also solve the problems of gradual loss from transfected cells encountered by regular plasmids due to the episomal replicative capacity of this plasmid.

College of Science G, 26 Insects of the Clemson Experimental Forest Because of their amazing diversity, there are multiple ways to study the fauna of insects and their relatives. Students will investigate insects in the Clemson University Experimental Forest. Explorations for particular groups may be according to their taxonomic relationships (e.g., ants, spiders, flies, etc.), habitats (e.g., soil, foliage, water, etc.), behavior (e.g., nocturnal or diurnal activity, attraction to different baits, phototropism, etc.), or other characteristics. Students in this Creative Inquiry will ask one or more questions about some aspect of the fauna of insects and their relatives, provide testable hypotheses to answer that/those question(s), and design one or more field and laboratory experiments to test the hypotheses. Students may explore their questions independently or in teams over one to four semesters for 1 or 2 credits each semester. Results and conclusions about them will be reported by the students in professional venues.

College of Agriculture, Forestry & Life Sciences A,A, 1735 Using Sports Science to Increase Interest in STEM Among K-12 Athletes Outreach programs are an often used tool to “fix the leaking pipeline” by promoting interest in STEM in K-12 students. However, these programs predominately target students who already have an exposure to and interest in STEM. The goal of this CI is to develop and deliver a sports science outreach program to increase the size of the pool, by exposing the 56.6% of youth who participate in sports to STEM in way that’s relatable their athletic interests. Initially, we plan to focus on three sports: football, volleyball, and soccer (men and women’s).

In many small island developing states, this type of digital data does not exist. This group will research what it would take to develop a digital data set for primary roads on the island of Dominica. Over several trips, significant amounts of geolocated video has been obtained. This, along with the linear road mapping currently available will provide the starting point for this development.

College of Engineering, Computing & Applied Sciences F,F,F, 1775 Microbial Transfer in Hospitals : Empirical Research Study of Contact Transfer via Nursing Personnel Healthcare associated infections are deadly and costly in our medical practice. They negatively impact patient outcomes, while increasing length of patient stay and widespread antibiotic exposure, all of which in turn can increase chance for opportunistic infections, medical errors, deterioration and muscle wasting. Reducing bioburden by altering surface materials has been shown to significantly decrease HAIs. Current options for this are limited solely to copper bed linens. This research study is designed to identify and quantify contamination and spore transfer that occurs in daily nursing practice. This study will provide a basis for the development of new materials, fabrics, and linens in the form of copper and silver scrubs. Team LeadersKelliann Koehler Research/Electron Micro Facil Olin Mefford Materials Science and Engineering O,F, 1851 Design Justice in Architecture This research focuses on architecture and space within marginalized communities. It will question rules implemented and institutionalized by entities in power. Namely, sections of architectural history in which practices followed such directives without questioning the effects those actions had in our culture and society will be analyzed. Students will use architecture and urban design as lenses to highlight the truthful consequences of government sponsored displacement, exclusion, segregation, racial inequality, social injustice, redlining, as well as policies that have fortified racial discrimination. The research will provide students with sources to develop projects and initiatives through design to combat these injustices with an emphasis on the notions of city, architectural pedagogy, and architectural practice.

College of Science G, 378 Designing Medical Technology for the Developing World Developing countries face healthcare challenges every day, whether it is lack of supplies or a shortage of healthcare professionals. Medical devices and equipment that are considered standard in hospitals in the United States can be hard to find and very expensive in developing countries, such as Tanzania. Tanzania has recently made significant advances with the quality of their healthcare; however, there are still many hurdles that need to be overcome. The goal of this Creative Inquiry team is to design and develop medical instrumentation and monitors that are robust, user-friendly, and low-cost for developing countries. The students on this team will be expected to work on electronics and instrument design. These types of projects not only have the ability to improve the lives of young infants and families, but they can also impact the medical field in developing nations worldwide. In addition to doing design, students are expected to learn about Tanzania as a whole. Students will learn about Tanzanian culture, government and healthcare structure as well as some basic conversational Swahili.

Since all these factors play a role (and their roles are not always completely understood), the direct measurement is often desired for novel alloy types including high entropy alloys. We will look at surface deformation mechanisms, sliding contact and common test techniques used in this field. For Spring 2022, the materials systems we will be focusing will include additively manufactured CoCr or high entropy alloys.

College of Agriculture, Forestry & Life Sciences A,O,A,A, 1585 Micro-Heart Tissue Pumps and Pipes Heart disease is the #1 cause of death in the world every year, and finding new therapies to treat heart disease is very slow and very expensive. Fortunately, researchers are able to grow small pieces of heart tissue in the lab to test new therapies as quickly, cheaply, and safely as possible. Unfortunately, these heart cells in a dish do not behave the same as heart cells in our body because they are no longer subjected to the same mechanical environment of a beating heart under pressure. In this creative inquiry, we are developing new culture chambers for growing heart cells in mechanically-realistic conditions in order to improve future therapy screens. Students will work in teams to (1) build miniature pump and pipe chambers, (2) grow heart-like tissues within these chambers, and (3) test the effects of different therapies on these functional tissues under disease-like conditions.

Team LeadersStephen Kaeppler Physics and Astronomy College of Science G, 1383 Controlled Environment Agriculture: Innovation of Distributing Food to Urban Environments and Food Deserts The project will provide an atmosphere for the design and evaluation of a moderate sized controlled environment container to yield animal protein, vegetables to supplement fresh food in an urban environment. Urban areas, also called food deserts, have limitations to fresh food and previous research has proven that, if available, people would welcome the choice of fresh food to prepare in their household. People are also reassured that the products being produced are fresh and free from harmful chemicals. Transportation is limited for these people so getting to a grocery store is somewhat restricted, so the idea of bringing a food production unit to the area is widely accepted. Presently these portable controlled environment units are available and expensive, however economics performed usually show limited to no revenue. The CI will investigate what is needed for the unit to produce food but on a more economical scale. This would also benefit school systems by providing fresh food to supplement the cafeteria needs for fresh food and at the same time becomes an effective teaching tool that can be positive reinforcement for understanding science, math and economics topics in an enjoyable and dynamic atmosphere. Team LeadersLance Beecher Cooperative Extension Services O, 1384 Unraveling the Mystery of the Rare Rocky Shoals Spider Lily Rocky Shoals Spider Lilies are an important part of South Carolina’s natural heritage and probably existed along most Piedmont streams prior to hydropower development of shoals and sedimentation of creeks and streams due to agricultural practices. The watershed for Stevens Creek is forested and mostly undeveloped allowing us a glimpse of what plant, fish, and even mussel populations may have looked like prior to European influence. There is a population of Rocky Shoals Spider Lilies that runs approximately 150 yards along Steven Creek on the Naturaland Trust Property.As a part of this CI, students will research and characterize the Stevens creek run where the Rocky Shoals Spider Lily occurs and at least two additional sites where historic populations existed to determine why the Rocky Shoals Spider Lily has such a robust population along this stretch of stream. Students will collect water quality data using the SC adopt a stream protocol and characterize the sites. They will additionally put out game cameras as one hypothesis is that deer herbivory is impacting Rocky Shoals Spider Lilies. Students will also work to propagate Rocky Shoals Spider Lilies in greenhouses at Clemson so that we will have a population we can attempt to introduce to other suitable stream stretches. By using the SC adopt a stream protocol, students will be adding to a database of stream health for the state and they will be able to compare Stevens Creek to other SC streams to determine what is different about Stevens creek that allows the Rocky Shoals Spider Lily to persist.

Team LeadersKathleen Valentine School of Nursing College of Behavioral, Social & Health Sciences C, 1870 Fish Ecomorphology Phenotypic plasticity can give rise to intra-specific phenotypic variation, which can lead to unique phenotypes between or within populations. Phenotypic plasticity provides an excellent opportunity for ecologists to study habitat induced phenotypic divergence as well as phenotypic disparity of ecologically different species. Body shape has been shown to be an excellent surrogate for the ecology of fish species and is known to be strongly influenced by water velocity. However, studies of intra-specific body shape divergence among habitat types have focused geographic separated habitats such as lakes and rivers. Only one study has been done looking at body shape differences between lotic and lentic habitats within a stream. By examining the variation in body shape, it may be possible to understand how some individuals are able to take advantage of different flow regimes and habitats. The objective of this study is to test for intra-specific body shape differences between high and low flow micro-habitats within streams. In this study we address three hypotheses: 1) individual fish occupying high water velocity habitats will have significantly different body shape from fishes in low water velocity habitats. 2) individual fish occupying high water velocity habitats will have more fusiform body shapes and deeper caudal peduncles fishes in low water velocity habitats. 3) All fish species will show similar responses to water velocity.

After completing their research goals, participants communicate their results by designing outdoor learning experiences for these students that incorporate their research findings and align with the science curriculum standards for that specific grade level. Some examples of typical projects include constructing a nature trail in a woodland adjacent to a local elementary school; introducing K-12 students to an activity known as 'geocaching' in which students use GPS units to locate buried 'treasure' that others have left behind; and designing classroom activities based on topographic maps and aerial photographs of environmentally important sites.

College of Engineering, Computing & Applied Sciences F, 1818 Determining a Rotational Grazing System for Horses Pasture is a common and efficient way to improve horses’ voluntary exercise and nutrient intake and to decrease behavioral and health problems (Bott et al., 2013). However, if pastures are not managed appropriately, horse health and pasture composition can both be at risk. Rotational grazing has been known to provide numerous animal and forage production, environmental and financial benefits (Henning et al., 200; Undersander et al., 2002). While limited, research on horse grazing systems has demonstrated the benefits of rotational grazing, but has not determined a specific rotational grazing protocol, particularly in the Southeast of the United States (Webb et al., 2009; Webb et al., 2011; Burk et al., 2011). Therefore, the objective of this research proposal is to determine the effects of two different time periods of rotational grazing has on horse health, grazing behavior and pasture condition in the Piedmont area of South Carolina. The two-year study will graze horses rotationally in a 2x2 Latin Square with pasture size and time as variables. The effect of grazing system on horse health will be measured weekly via body weight and body condition score. Forage preference and grazing behavior will be measured using GPS tracking devices. Pasture health will be measured via vegetative cover, composition and yield, or herbage mass. It is hypothesized that a shorter grazing period will show increased horse health, grazing behavior and pasture condition; longer grazing periods are expected to mirror continual grazing and yield minimal benefits to horse and pasture.

In bioengineering, the opportunity to collaborate with clinicians in the design of biomedical devices is challenging, and with COVID, these opportunities are both more in demand and more challenging than ever. But they are critically needed. Clinicians continue to be an essential contributor to the design process, in that they are both the users of biomedical devices, and often the first point of contact for problems that occur in their use. Typically, students explore design related issues, and recruit clinicians to support their work. In this new CI, clinical collaborators that have critical COVID-related needs will work with students to create the next generation of biomedical devices during this pandemic and beyond. This CI will be open to all undergraduates, and projects will be multi-semester, to support the development of long-term innovations to address COVID challenges.

Team LeadersWilliam Martin General Engineering College of Engineering, Computing & Applied Sciences F, 489 Exploring Peptoid Proteins: Making and Structurally Characterizing Peptidomimetic Structures Natural peptides and proteins are critically important in biology and medicine as well as increasingly in biotechnology and the chemical industry. Chemical structures mimicking the properties of natural peptides and proteins have been developed over the past three decades, with enormous potential for transformative impact in many fields. One handicap of these peptide-mimetic systems, however, is the lack of a broad scope of knowledge comparable to that available for natural proteins and peptides. Databases such as the Protein Data Bank contain structures for ~150,000 natural proteins, collected over the past ~50 years. These rich data sources enable whole fields of research, such as bioinformatics and protein engineering, that rely on having abundant data. Design of peptide mimics and hybrid peptide-peptidomimetic systems, therefore, relies on rational planning and design. This project involves both a structural component--synthesizing peptoids and other peptide mimics to study their structures and test predictions for novel secondary structures; as well as biomedical component--e.g., using the proven strategy of replacing proline residues in peptides with peptoid residues, as well as incorporating other peptidomimetic residues such as PEGylated amino acids into peptides of medical interest.

College of Science G, 479 Comparative Vertebrate Musculoskeletal Biomechanics Research in my lab examines the patterns and processes of functional evolution in vertebrates. To understand the factors that have contributed to evolutionary transitions in function, we test the functional consequences of variation in biological design, primarily through experimental studies of vertebrate musculoskeletal biomechanics. We have extended these studies to include selection experiments on functional performance, allowing us to evaluate the impact of functional tradeoffs on structural diversification. Our three primary study systems have been examinations of (1) the load bearing capacity of vertebrate limb bones (and fish fins) during terrestrial and aquatic locomotion; (2) the functional performance of waterfall climbing gobiid fishes in a variety of behaviors, including climbing, predator escape, and feeding; and (3) the effects of differences in body structure on the swimming performance of turtles and tadpoles. These systems have allowed a diverse range of comparative studies that have provided insight into broader issues in the diversity and evolution of vertebrate functional design. Studies of these systems are complemented by investigations of other systems as new questions and opportunities emerge.

Based on a step challenge, and developed by Clemson Extension, participants who sign up gain access to a private Facebook group and receive a two-to three-minute video each week about a diet or exercise topic and flier with nutrition, exercise and health tips. There have been four WalkSC cohorts and initial data is very encouraging that the program is having a positive impact on participants’ movement habits and health outcomes.This creative inquiry project willexamine the current data sets and future data sets with the goal of developinga smart phone application to facilitate and improve the WalkSC experience.CI students will conduct literaturereviews regarding the benefits of Step programs for health; Gamification ofhealth habits and Use of Smart Phone Technologies to improve human behaviorsand habits.The cross-disciplinary team willdevelop an APP to use on smart phones that leads participants through theWalkSC experience. This APP will be piloted with upcoming WalkSC groups anddata from these pilot groups will be compared with past WalkSC groups andfuture control WalkSC groups that do not utilize the new APP. Data will becollected and analyzed to determine the effectiveness of the APP to increaseadherence to the WalkSC program. Participant digital surveys will be conductedto gain insight into creating a final version of the WalkSC APP.The final goal will be to publishand consider the future use of the WalkSC APP for promotion, income generationfor the WalkSC program and development of future iterations of WalkSC typeinitiatives for Clemson Extension Health Program.

College of Engineering, Computing & Applied Sciences F, 1852 Rising to the COVID-19 Challenge with Buoyant And Magnetic (BAM) Assays Sensitive, Rapid, On-Site Testing in Saliva This is a continuation of the COVID-19 Challenge which we started in June. Our team received first prize in the pitch competition (out of 86 teams). Rapid, accurate, and highly accessible COVID-19 diagnostics are critical for managing the pandemic and even in helping eliminate it. Since many people may have high viral loads before/without symptoms, inexpensive, rapid, on-site testing for the virus is key. We hope to develop the first test that meet the WHO's criteria for testing in resource-constrained settings: Affordable, Sensitive, Specific, User-friendly, Rapid and robust, Equipment-free and Deliverable to end-users (ASSURED). Resource constrained settings include developing world locations as well as businesses, schools/universities, and homes in the US. Our approach combines two separation technologies: antibody-functionalized buoyant microbeads capture SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid proteins in saliva and rise to the surface separating and concentrating the protein; next antibody-labelled magnetic microbeads attach to the nucleocaptured proteins on the buoyant microbeads forming a buoyant and magnetic (BAM) sandwich complex. The concentration of nucleocapsid proteins in saliva can be quantified by counting the number of BAM complexes, which can be completely separated from non-magnetic buoyant microballoons using a magnet and from non-buoyant magnetic microbeads by removing the magnet and observing floating behavior. The team will work on simulating reaction kinetics, measuring buoyancy and magnetic separation in simple simulated saliva systems (often at home during the pandemic), optimizing reaction and video capture conditions, and writing up results for publication as well as pitch competitions.Finally, while we are focusing on COVID-19 detection, the underlying technology could be used as a platform for multiple other diseases.

The students will learn basic radar principles and operation, to include the radar range equation, basic radar waveforms, and basic signal processing techniques. The students will create a project plan, to include a schedule, a bill of materials, and a test plan. They will build a working radar using an open-source design and test both analog and digital operation. Once the radar is operating correctly, the students will execute their test plan, measuring detected object range, velocity and a synthetic aperture radar imaging mode. The students will document their experience in a presentation to peers and faculty. Team LeadersJoseph Chapa General Engineering College of Engineering, Computing & Applied Sciences F, 1898 Population genetic structure of glyphosate resistant and sensitive North Carolina Amaranthus palmeri and the association of genetic variations to resistance phenotype. Amaranthus palmeri is one of the most pervasive and destructive weeds known to impact US agriculture. An Infestation of this weed can decrease field crop yield by 50% or more. While the plant’s prolific reproductive capacity, growth, and ability to outcompete neighboring plants under a wide range of environmental conditions gives it an ecological edge, the plant’s rapid evolution of resistance to multiple herbicides, including glyphosate (Round-up®), has further undermined strategies for mitigating spread and economic impacts. Glyphosate resistance in A. palmeri is achieved by amplification of a 399-kb extrachromosomal circular DNA called the EPSPS replicon. The replicon contains the gene encoding 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS), the enzyme targeted by glyphosate. When amplified, the replicon produces increased EPSPS transcription and protein activity. This project aims to investigate the origin and spread of glyphosate resistance in North Carolina A. palmeri and to identify genetic variations that may underly fitness, adaptation, and phenotypic variation related to glyphosate resistance. Analyses include variant calling including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertion and deletions (indels) and copy number variation (CNV), genetic relatedness and population structure analyses (e.g. Phylogenetic tree analysis and principal component analysis), and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to assess the association of genetic variations with glyphosate sensitive (GS) and resistant (GR) phenotypes. It is anticipated that findings from this project will contribute to our understanding of the evolution and mechanism of glyphosate resistance in Amaranthus and will improve the theory and practice of weed resistance management. Team LeadersAmy Lawton-Rauh Provost & VP for Ac Aff O, 1755 Deconvolving the Southern South American Dust Production Pathways Glacial action in South America over the past ~1 million years created a tremendous amount of dust (airborne rock power). This South American dust influenced Earth's global climate over this time period, but our understanding of HOW Earth's atmosphere and hydrosphere were effected is hampered by a limited understanding of when and where deposits of glacial dust came from. In this project, students will use detrital mineral geochronologic methods to determine the bedrock sources of large dust deposits throughout South America. Team LeadersMary Fidler Environmental Engineering and Earth Sciences Alexander Pullen Environmental Engineering and Earth Sciences College of Engineering, Computing & Applied Sciences F,F, 1764 New Ideas of Making Driverless Vehicles Better Driverless vehicles use advanced in-vehicle and transportation infrastructure sensors and electronic controllers, wired and wireless communication (vehicle-to-everything (V2X)), human-machine interfaces, data management infrastructure and advanced analytics tools to enable the safe and secure longitudinal and lateral movements of driverless vehicles. A substantially improved surface transportation system, in terms of both safety and efficiency, is the result. This course will provide students with a comprehensive overview of concepts and hands-on experience related to new ideas to make driverless vehicles and their surrounding environments much safer, more secure and more efficient than what is envisioned today.

College of Engineering, Computing & Applied Sciences F, 1540 Using Magnetic Nanoparticles to Prevent Restenosis Aging, smoking, diet, and genetic factors cause the build up of plaque in the arteries that provide nutrients to the heart, which is a major cause of heart attacks. To solve this problem, stents are commonly used to open the artery back up. In some cases, when a stent is inserted, it injures the walls of the blood vessel causing it to swell and block the blood vessel back up. In recent years, medicated stents have been used to deliver medication that reduces that swelling by reducing the growth and spreading of the cells that cause the problem. In doing that, they also stop the healing process of the injury site, which causes delayed effects like blood clots that block the artery. We designed a magnetic nanoparticle coated with heparin. Heparin is a drug that is naturally found in the body. It is known to stop the swelling in the wall of the blood vessel and accelerate the healing process. We have tested these nanoparticles on cells and mice to show that they are not toxic. We have started to test their effect on the cell growth and spreading to show that they are effective as a treatment option. We plan to deliver that nanoparticles to the stent using a magnetic field similar to the ones used in MRI imaging. This project would advance the treatment of blocked arteries without causing new problems. In doing so, we would eliminate the need for multiple surgeries to treat the complications. This helps save patients from complications associated with stent implantation and help patients live healthier lives. Team LeadersNardine Ghobrial Bioengineering Delphine Dean Bioengineering College of Engineering, Computing & Applied Sciences F,F, 1847 Media Forensic Hub CU Media Forensics Hub (https://www.clemson.edu/centers-institutes/watt/hub/) is part of the Watt Family Innovation Center. By “Media Forensics” we mean the development and application of state-of-the-art techniques to broaden and deepen our understanding of all media types, while working to increase the capacity of our students and community to apply them. The “Hub” accomplishes this by spanning multiple disciplines and approaches, from history and case studies, to AI and machine learning, to experiments in the lab and the field. We connect widely-spaced entities with a common interest from across disciplines, centers, institutions, and perspectives. In Fall of 2021, the Hub is offering two sections of Creative Inquiry that approach this mission in different ways. Track 1 is more practical – applying cutting-edge techniques to important current problems. Track 2 is more academic – trying to deepen our scientific understanding of inauthenticity. We are looking for interested students to join both these projects. Please express interest in an email to indicated contact, include a CV and a short paragraph about why you are interested in this project. ---- Track 1. “How to Catch a Troll: Investigating Political Disinformation” Open-Source Investigations and Media Forensics In this CI, we will introduce the students to forensic techniques that can be used to investigate the origins of and connections between media artifacts and producers. Students will use those techniques with increasing levels of expertise to analyze media artifacts from conversations around international and national security affairs that we jointly identify as interesting and important. Industry standard software will be employed to achieve deep insights regarding disinformation networks. As a team, students will publicly report on their findings, in a regular update to the Hub website, to be disseminated to the CU Hub community and media partners to deepen how the public interprets these media artifacts. The students in the first section of this CI (2020-2021) produced several reports, available here. Their work also appeared several times in the local and regional press. Several students from this first group have gone on to paid internships or full-time positions in this field. Section 2. Phishing for Trolls, Bots, and Hackers: The Generalized Analysis of Online Inauthenticity In this CI, we will explore what we know about what strategies inauthentic online actors like trolls, fake news outlets, and phishers use in various contexts and what countermeasures are effective, in order to work toward a general theory of online inauthenticity. Students in this CI will design and implement original, interdisciplinary research projects examining unanswered questions about the nature of inauthentic online actors. From these original research projects we will derive broad implications for our scientific understanding of inauthenticity. Students in the first section of this CI (Spring 2021) designed and ran behavioral experiments, surveys, and observational investigations of what characteristics makes inauthentic actors effective across domains, including social media and email phishing. They summarized the state of the literature for some particular aspect of effectiveness, derived hypotheses, wrote pre-registration plans for each analysis and are implementing those plans throughout the rest of the Spring. These analyses will result in research reports that are appropriate for publication in peer-reviewed scholarly journal. Team LeadersPatrick Warren John E.

College of Engineering, Computing & Applied Sciences F, 1834 Transgene Containment and Removal in Important Perennial Grasses Turfgrass and switchgrass are among the most important perennial grasses significantly impacting agriculture production, agriculture economy, sustainable energy and environment. Like in many row crops, genetic engineering of both switchgrass and turfgrasses using transgenic technologies offers the opportunity to incorporate many economic and agronomic benefits that are difficult or impossible to achieve through traditional breeding techniques. However, the risk of transgene escape and the unforeseen environmental consequence by the use of transgenic technology in perennial grasses require development of strategies for transgene containment. We propose to develop and evaluate an integrated approach that combines a dual site-specific recombination system and total sterility induction mechanisms for transgene containment and removal in switchgrass and turfgrass, producing transgenic products self-contained for desirable transgene, but free of undesirable foreign DNAs. Team LeadersHong Luo Genetics and Biochemistry College of Science G, 742 Imaginative Ligands and Unique Metal Complexes: A Marriage of Organic and Inorganic Chemistry Organic chemists often are puzzled by metals, and inorganic chemists are often puzzled by organic chemistry, but there are great opportunities in uniting the ability of organic chemists to generate complex 3D molecules with the unique reactivities and properties of metals. This project combines the expertise of an organic chemist and an inorganic chemist to design, synthesize, and examine the metal-coordination properties of ligands for commonly studied metal ions such as iron and copper, as well as more exotic metal ions such as lanthanides uranium, and plutonium (note: undergraduate students will not be working with uranium and plutonium!). This project uses synthetically versatile new approaches in organic synthesis to generate ligands with applications in biological, catalytic, and nuclear applications. Once made, a variety of techniques are used to examine the metal coordination abilities of these ligands, including electrochemistry, stability constant determinations, and DNA damage and cellular assays.

College of Science G,G, 556 Biology of Lipids and Lipid Droplets in Trypanosomes We are investigating how the lethal blood parasite Trypanosoma brucei acquires and stores lipids from its host. Lipids can be used as a source of energy, key building blocks for cell membranes, anchors of cell surface proteins, and signaling molecules. In its hosts, T. brucei must use a combination of fatty acid uptake and synthesis to survive. We are interested in the following research questions: How does the parasite sense environmental sources? How does it take up fatty acids from its hosts? How does it "decide" where those fatty acids go int he cell? What role do these processes play in pathogenesis and immune evasion? We use a variety of genetic, molecular, biochemical, and cell biological approaches to address these questions in our lab.

College of Agriculture, Forestry & Life Sciences A, 1810 Development of a Zebrafish Model of Parkinson's Disease to Analyze Novel Treatment Methods Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that causes balance and coordination problems that eventually lead to death and affects nearly 10 million people worldwide. As of today, there is no definitive test to diagnose and track the progression of PD This increases the need for a reliable biomarker to diagnose, track, and ultimately, treat the disease. PD has been linked to lysosomal storage disease characteristics. A potential biomarker has been discovered in a lysosomal storage disease, GM1 Gangliosidosis. This biomarker connects lysosomal enzyme upregulation to impaired autophagy. Between the connection with PD and LSDs, it is hypothesized that a similar biomarker can be found in PD. There are many PD cellular models that are used in disease research. These models typically are not all inclusive of the disease, but model a specific aspect of the disease, such as degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, the aggregation of a-synuclein, and accumulation lewy bodies. This project will explore potential biomarkers of PD and if one or more aspect of the disease is directly related to enzyme upregulation. Team members in this creative inquiry will research different cellular models of Parkinson’s Disease in order to determine potential biomarkers that can help diagnose and track the disease.

Poster Presentation College of Engineering, Computing & Applied Sciences F,F, 741 Marine Conservation and Genetics Over-fishing, pollution, and habitat destruction are among the major issues affecting marine life and habitats. Marine ornamental crustaceans, i.e., wild caught species sought by aquarium hobbyists due to their aesthetic value (e.g., bright coloration) and/or ability to control/eliminate aquarium pests, are particularly impacted by over-fishing and habitat destruction and do require immediate attention. The ornamental fishery, a well-established multi-million dollar industry, often operates unnoticed due to their niche market, the frequency of product export, and the diminutive size of the target organisms. Little attention has been paid to them and they have been managed based on little to no life history information. The marine aquarium trade relies predominantly on wild caught species with > 90% taken from coral reefs and associated habitats. The industry has increased dramatically in recent years with a distinct focus on crustaceans (and other invertebrates) that provide “ecosystem services” for aquaria (control of aquarium pests). As these organisms are harvested for the services they can provide in an aquarium, those services are potentially lost from the ecosystem. Immediately after corals, crustaceans represent the most heavily traded ornamental marine invertebrate worldwide. Basic life history information critical to manage any fishery with the goal of sustainability is largely absent. Furthermore, the mislabeling of the species traded in the industry is rampant. The development of a genetic (COI and/or 16S) barcode for this economically and ecologically important group of shrimps is warranted for achieving the goal of fishery sustainability. This Creative Inquiry project aims at generating basic life history information about the most intensively traded species in the western Atlantic (e.g., shrimps from the genera Thor, Lysmata and Periclimenes, and crabs from the species complex Mithrax-Mithraculus). Furthermore, this project will setup the basis for the development of a genetic barcode for the most heavily harvested ornamental crustaceans.

If not repaired, a DSB can result in genome instability and potentially, cancer. DSBs are caused by exposure to chemicals, radiation, oxidative reactive species generated during normal metabolism and damaged replication forks. The repair of DSBs often involves the homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair pathway. The heart of HR is the RAD51 and DMC1 recombinase. These enzymes catalyze the search for homology between the damaged DNA and the sister chromatid. The activity of the recombinases is modulated by a number of accessory proteins. We utilize a combination of molecular biological and biochemical techniques to determine the role these accessory proteins have in the modulation of RAD51 and DMC1 recombinase activity. The results of our studies will provide insight into the mechanistic underpinnings of HR and genome maintenance.

Current surgical strategies to repair and restore function to the IVDs have limitations. Regenerative medicine-based approaches for IVD repair and regeneration using stem cells and scaffolds hold significant promise; however, an ideal scaffold that mimics the complex micro-architecture, biochemistry and mechanical properties of the entire IVD has yet to be developed. Previously, our CI has created a composite scaffold derived from cow tail IVDs that have had all the cow cells removed. The scaffolds have demonstrated similar physio-chemical properties compared to human IVDs and they support stem cell viability in vitro. Thus, the continued focus of the CI is to develop approaches to efficiently repopulate the scaffold with stem cells and to assess tissue regeneration on the IVD scaffold.

Teamwork and Team Composition in High Risk, High Stress Environments How do we turn teams of experts into expert teams, especially when they are teams working in stressful and demanding environments such as the military, healthcare, or outer space? We are currently investigating this question in the DIGITAL (Deriving Innovative & riGorous scIence for Teaming And Leading) Research Lab, as teams today face new challenges which may require different interventions and strategies than what seems to work in traditional teams. This CI team will involve conducting lab and field research with military teams, spaceflight crews, and healthcare professionals to answer this question and expand our current knowledge of teamwork and leadership in culturally diverse, physically distributed, dynamic, and adaptive work environments.

College of Engineering, Computing & Applied Sciences F, 789 Generation and Characterization of Radiation for Biomedical Applications In recent years there has been a strong growth in the number of medical devices that use different types of radiation for treatment and imaging applications. There is also a growing interest in different fields ( e.g. medicine, biology, space research, electronics) to understand and utilize the effects of different forms of radiation. The effectiveness of radiation technology depends on the understanding of the interaction with the materials in question ranging from surfaces of solids to biological soft tissues. The present research project lies on the borderline of physics and biology. The elementary physical processes of the interaction are well known, but their expressions in biological samples depend on the complex response of the system and its environment. Students in this project will explore different techniques to generate, detect, and characterize electromagnetic radiation, their uses in specialized medical devices, and their applications in research.

Team LeadersNicole Martinez Environmental Engineering and Earth Sciences College of Engineering, Computing & Applied Sciences F, 791 Lab-on-a-Chip and Microfluidics to Identify the Cause of Disease in Clinical Diagnostics We investigate the use of electric fields to identify and separate different strains of Candida cells. This is very important in the context of healthcare diagnostics since Candida is the causative pathogen of candidiasis, a medical condition affecting 46,000 patients yearly in the US with a mortality rate up to 44%. Identifying the strain causing this condition is crucial since front line antibiotics are not necessarily effective on all strains. For example, front line antibiotics commonly used for Candida albicans, the most likely cause of candidiasis, are not effective to eradicate C. glabrata, an emerging pathogen. The technology we are developing is a microfluidic chipset that utilizes a phenomenon known as Dielectrophoresis to selectively trap and detect different strains of Candida. This is uncharted territory and we are generating excellent results in several fronts.

With the advent of low-cost 3D-printing, this paradigm has started to change towards patient centered design, where devices are customized to the anatomy of the specific patient they will used to treat. The goal of this CI is to explore these concepts of patient centered design and create a platform for the rapid design and production of customized jointed splints used in the treatment and rehabilitation of finger and hand injuries. Team LeadersTyler Harvey Bioengineering College of Engineering, Computing & Applied Sciences F, 792 Origami for Carbon-based Multifunctional Materials Carbonaceous materials such as glassy carbon and metal carbides are widely used as electrodes in many applications including sensors, batteries, and capacitors. The focus of this CI is to derive these materials from renewable resources and elucidate ways to control their structure at multiple length scales, from the nano to the centimeter scale, to tailor their mechanical and electrical performance. The aim is at deriving multifunctional architectures such as structural batteries, sensors and batteries. To this end, we emphasize the use of origami techniques to create complex architectures in pure or doped paper, which we then carbonize at very high temperatures without the presence of oxygen. In this way we can derive complex, porous, lightweight architectures of carbonaceous materials. This is a powerful concept since we can create 3D architectures of engineering value from flat paper films.

College of Engineering, Computing & Applied Sciences F, 799 The DEN (Design and Entrepreneurship Network) This CI allows student teams to be mentored by leaders in device design, development, marketing, patenting and small business development to forward student-led technology and ideas. Initially, this CI will focus on mentoring technologies that are being generated by other CI groups, as well as from other Capstone Design programs, but other “independent” teams and technical areas will be sought after the CI structure is established. Teams can include undergraduates and graduates, and preference is given to groups that have already formed around a topic or technology of interest. Mentors and guest speakers from industry, patent law, marketing and start-up businesses will work with student teams to take technology beyond the university development level. The format will be very student driven, with small student teams presenting each week on some aspect of their technology development and business plans. These presentations will be the focal point for discussions, mentoring and advice.

College of Engineering, Computing & Applied Sciences F,O, 1798 Software Engineering Bots for Newcomers Onboarding to Open Source Projects Onboarding refers to the process of teaching newcomers (new workers) the knowledge and skills needed to succeed in their positions. It serves as a way to integrate new workers into the environment both so they can understand how to succeed in their position but also integrate with their coworkers so they can work effectively as a team. It is during this period that programmers become familiar with a new project, its source code, and its team. While it is considered a necessity, it is also very costly and error-prone. Open-source software (OSS) projects leverage the coordinated effort from globally distributed stakeholders who build high-quality software. To remain sustainable and to evolve, several projects rely on the onboarding and retention of newcomers. However, attracting newcomers and engaging them are not easy tasks. Previous work shows that the barriers posed during the joining process may lead newcomers to give up on contributing. Joining an OSS project is a complex, multi-stage process, and this complexity could push newcomers away from the project.We propose to create a conversational bot that could help newcomers with finding open source projects that they can contribute to and guide them throughout the process. Newcomers face difficulties when onboarding to new projects.

Rev. 2014, 114, 11060−11082) They are related to Ionic Liquids, and while both have advantages over conventional solvents in having much lower vapor pressure tunable solvation properties DESs are generally less expensive to produce and have much lower toxicity than either Ionic Liquids or conventional solvents. Weak intermolecular attractions between the components of the DES mixture are important for their unique properties and in all currently available DESs these attractions are based on either ionic interactions, hydrogen bonding, or both. Our research is focused on an interaction similar to hydrogen bonding, called halogen bonding (Crystal Growth & Design 2001, 1, 165-175), and we have recently reported the first example of a halogen-bonding-based DES (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2021, 60, 22983 – 22989). This CI project will involve a survey of halogen bonded materials for DES properties and when found, testing and characterization of their structure (liquid and crystalline) and thermal properties. Current technology in Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs) often relies on halogen bondined materials and our project will also explore whether our new DESs will lead to enhanced performance of DSSCs.

Understanding molecular mechanisms underlying plant response to various stresses will facilitate development of molecular strategies in genetically engineering crop species with enhanced performance under adverse environmental conditions. In this proposed study, we use molecular genetics and genomics approaches to dissect molecular mechanisms determining plant salt stress response, and will develop molecular strategies using agricultural biotechnology approach to modify candidate genes in transgenic plants producing new cultivars with enhanced salt tolerance. This will lead to genetic improvement of important crop species with enhanced performance under adverse environmental conditions contributing to increasing agricultural productivity.

College of Behavioral, Social & Health Sciences C, 840 Insect Viruses and Physiology Insects provide excellent opportunities to perform basic and applied biological experiments at the molecular, physiological and organismal scales. They serve as model organisms for developmental and cellular biology, and are important vectors for human and agricultural pathogens. As a result, working with insects can expose students to numerous hard and soft skills useful in a range of life-sciences fields, from medical to agricultural biology, evolutionary and ecological to developmental and immunological. In this project, students will develop and work on projects examining the evolutionary physiology of an insect virus by looking at host-specific patterns, mechanistic basis of pathology, and molecular evolution, of different members of a virus gene family. To do this, students may participate in DNA barcoding of host insects, isolation of novel gene family members, and use of recombinant viruses and transgenic Drosophila melanogaster in organismal and cell culture bioassays. Techniques commonly used include fluorescent microscopy, immunological approaches, PCR and sequencing, and more. Students are required to participate in communicating data in weekly group meetings, as well as on-campus, state, regional, and national meetings.

College of Science G, 1792 Smart and Healthy Buildings Buildings are generally considered as static objects with limited capability to adapt to varying environmental and operational conditions. One important aspect is the flow of users, which can vary significantly during a typical day. This project consists of developing and testing the technology necessary to identify and quantify the flow of users in a building, and even track the location of each user in real time. It is anticipated that once users can be tracked, the building operating conditions, such as HVAC conditions and lighting, can be altered to create the necessary conditions for optimal comfort. Several technologies are under development including the analysis of signal strength of mobile devices from wireless access points. The students involved in this CI project will work with industrial partners to test various technologies in several buildings on campus, including the Watt Family Innovation Center.

College of Engineering, Computing & Applied Sciences F, 1745 Narratives of Incarceration: Upstate Critical Thinking Initiative Mass incarceration and recidivism rates continue to grow in the U.S. This is a subject that U.S. citizens rarely think about but it directly affects them – 95% of prisoners are released and over 70% commit another crime within seven years that lands them right back in the prison they left – which directly affects public safety. Education is the only known method of reducing recidivism. However, prisons mostly punish rather than rehabilitate. The aim of this project is to research and create a critical thinking initiative that keeps possible societal reintegration and penal abolition in its sight. The program would focus on ways to evolve reading and writing (narratives, academic papers) skills as a means of empathetic rehabilitation and create artifacts that serve as portfolios for the incarcerated students.

College of Agriculture, Forestry & Life Sciences A, 1048 The Phoenix Challenge The Phoenix Challenge Creative Inquiry gives students the chance to create packaging for several products during all stages of the development to final execution, while competing with peers from other schools. This project serves as the structure in which students prepare for The Phoenix Challenge Competition, a competition held between more than dozen universities across North America. Educators from the different universities come together to choose a design brief posing a new problem within the field and students spend a year creating a product that meets the guidelines. Past examples include designing, prototyping and printing packaging for snack foods, golf products, hotel toiletries and coffee. Each year the team creates packaging solutions for several products that will be used and distributed by a small business. This has posed an additional learning experience as the team meets expectations and deadlines from a customer and works in collaboration with industry professionals outside of Clemson. Students are fully self-directed in the process—they conduct background and market research, come up with the design, organize prepress and layout, print and perform finishing details, all while communicating with the company. All products are produced by the students enrolled in the CI within the GC labs on donated equipment with donated materials. The initial quantity of the products are small and are intended to allow the small business to use the packaging while waiting for a true production run with a commercial printing company. In past years, the quantities produced by the students were was sufficient because it was for an event such as Springfest, the Tigers-4-Tigers run and the Greenville Zoo Kids Day Out Event.

College of Engineering, Computing & Applied Sciences F, 1068 Meiotic Homologous Recombination Our laboratory studies the mechanism behind the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by homologous recombination during meiosis. We use both human and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to study meiotic recombination. The introduction of DNA double-strand breaks during meiosis is carefully controlled. If not repaired, a DSB can result in genome instability and potentially, cancer. DSBs are caused by exposure to chemicals, radiation, oxidative reactive species generated during normal metabolism and damaged replication forks. The repair of DSBs often involves the homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair pathway. The heart of HR is the RAD51 and DMC1 recombinase. These enzymes catalyze the search for homology between the damaged DNA and the sister chromatid. The activity of the recombinases is modulated by a number of accessory proteins. We utilize a combination of molecular biological and biochemical techniques to determine the role these accessory proteins have in the modulation of RAD51 and DMC1 recombinase activity. The results of our studies will provide insight into the mechanistic underpinnings of HR and genome maintenance.

Team LeadersFeng Luo School of Computing Jianhua Tong Materials Science and Engineering College of Engineering, Computing & Applied Sciences F,F, 2039 ClemsonX Humanity appears to be on the verge of a dramatic new era of exploration and development in outer space. Driven by multiple innovative agile companies operating on a remarkable design timeline; technologies to explore and develop a sustainable human presence in space are rapidly emerging. In December 2019, Elon Musk unveiled Starship Mark I, and less than 18 months later after several successful prototype flights, an orbital vehicle may be flown as soon as August 2021. Companies such as Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada Corporation, RocketLab, Relativity Space, and others are driving innovations in the space industry at an unprecedented rate of development. Increasingly, what was once a science fiction dream of expanding humanity throughout the solar system appears to be within the realm of scientific fact. This creative inquiry seeks to imbue a similar level of enthusiastic agile innovation amongst its participants. Formulated along the lines of the 1975 summer NASA workshop with Gerald O'Neill that led to designs for space colonies, this creative inquiry will form student teams to propose design solutions for future space exploration initiatives. The selection of exploration and development initiatives will be determined by the participating students, but once selected, design teams will be expected to develop practical engineering solutions to their projects. Want to design a space elevator for the moon? An Earth-Mars cycler spacecraft? The first colony on Mars? An exploration probe to Triton? The first space colony? The first asteroid mining mission? All of these are possible projects for teams within the creative inquiry. As part of the creative inquiry, students will be engaged in the current developments of the aerospace industry and will be expected to develop a YouTube channel which will include a mixture of commentary on current events in space exploration and discussions of future visions, including those developed by the students themselves. The purpose of this platform is to engage a broader community of interest in space exploration, to promote scientific education about space exploration to the general public, and to promote the ideas of the students in the CI, as well as the CI and Clemson University. The CI design projects will emulate the rapid, agile progress using approaches demonstrated by SpaceX and other innovative space company startups.

College of Agriculture, Forestry & Life Sciences A,C, 1072 Coupling Green Roofs, Rainwater Cisterns, and Urban Agriculture This project is exploring the possible synergy between utilizing green roofs, rainwater cisterns, and roof top agriculture. Green roofs have many benefits, but their impact on reducing stormwater runoff quantity from larger design storms is limited. Including a cistern can be a way to improve this, a cistern by itself is not a reasonable approach if there is no use for the stored water. Urban agriculture is the link that we will use to couple these two BMPs as the stored water can be used to irrigate the plants in the green roof, which expands the types of plants which can be grown to crops which can be harvested and produce a source of revenue as well as a source of locally produced food.

Antibiotics were once considered as the “magic bullets” for treating infectious diseases, but the balance of victory has shifted in favor of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (commonly known as “superbugs”) due to the over-reliance on antibiotics by human beings in the past decades. Antibiotic resistance is a problem described by the World Health Organization as "one of the biggest threats to global health, food security and development today." Novel antibiotics are in need! As a partner of the Small World Initiative (SWI) – crowdsourcing antibiotic discovery, we invite everyone interested in tackling the challenge to join this creative inquiry team. During the semesters, students will collect soil samples, search for antibiotic-producing bacteria, characterize the antimicrobial activities, and contribute the findings to a database shared by a network of student researchers from over 300 other institutions worldwide. This research opportunity will provide students with a hands-on learning experience and is open to students from all backgrounds and disciplines. Students will also have the chance to develop their own creative projects to raise awareness about the antibiotic crisis and participate in the annual Do Something About Antibiotics Challenge™ in November.

Malnutrition and high calorie linked chronic diseases are the result of unhealthy food systems. A sensible and quick approach to combat nutritional challenges would be to increase dietary diversity through vegetables that can provide a range of essential nutrients. This proposed Creative Inquiry project provides an introduction to vegetable production, value addition, and nutrition. Students are expected to develop a home garden model to provide year-round nutritious vegetables (especially micronutrients and vegetable proteins) to a small family.

College of Science G, 1549 The Role of Acetate Metabolism in Fungal Pathogenesis Invasive fungal infections cause nearly one and a half million deaths annually, accounting for nearly 50% of all AIDS-related deaths. Cryptococcus neoformans, an invasive opportunistic pathogen of the central nervous system, is the most frequent cause of fungal meningitis. Exposure to C. neoformans is common, as it is an environmental fungus found in the soil that can enter the lungs through inhalation and disseminate to the central nervous system in susceptible individuals. An increased rate of infection occurs in individuals with impaired cell-mediated immunity, particularly those with AIDS and recipients of immunosuppressive therapy. The widespread availability of antiretroviral therapy in developed countries has helped improve the immune systems of many HIV patients to decrease their susceptibility to infection. However, cryptococcal meningitis is still a major problem in resource-limited regions of the world such as sub-Saharan Africa where HIV prevalence is high and access to healthcare is limited. The CDC estimates the yearly burden of cryptococcal meningitis to be nearly one million cases with more than 190,000 deaths. Despite the global significance of cryptococcal meningitis, current treatments are inadequate as the gold standard therapy is based on half century old drugs that have a wide range of liabilities and shortcomings. Metabolic adaptability and flexibility are important attributes for fungal pathogens to successfully infect and cause disease. Although carbon metabolism is critical for virulence in C. neoformans, very little is known about which carbon sources are utilized during infection. Our long-term goal is to provide a better understanding of how Cryptococcus can adapt its metabolism to survive in the changing environments encountered during infection. Developing a more in-depth understanding of the metabolism and physiology of this pathogen during infection may facilitate identification of suitable targets for new antifungal therapies.

The paste to print is a composite of biopolymers and oxide nanoparticles. Once printed, these biopolymer composite architectures are heat treated to high temperatures to yield tungsten carbide. The electrical properties of these architected carbide shapes are then measured under mechanical load. The goal is to elucidate the relation between processing, the microstructure of the material, and the electrical and mechanical performance of the structure. Understanding such relation will enable the fabrication of electrically-conductive structures with optimized properties towards achieving structural batteries, fuel cells and capacitors.

(Accessible Recreational Creations to Highlight Educational Reach) Design Works Design targeted solutions with the ARCHER (Accessible Recreational Creations to Highlight Educational Reach) Design Works Creative Inquiry! Archery has been integrated into the physical education curriculum in K-12 schools across the state of South Carolina. However, students with disabilities can’t always participate fully. Through the ARCHER creative inquiry, Clemson students can design and develop engineering solutions to help these students experience the excitement that comes with hitting the bullseye. Clemson students will be paired with a K-12 student with a disability and will spend the semesters enrolled getting to know the K-12 student, learning about the PE archery program and current adaptive sports techniques, and designing and developing a prototype device to assist the K-12 student in archery competition.

This Creative Inquiry will provide opportunities for project students to use, facilitate and research a mixed-reality simulator supporting the instruction of pre-service special education and general education teachers. Participants will learn a variety of evidence based practices to support the behavior needs and academic growth of students in classrooms. Using the simulator, these instructional techniques can be personalized, practiced and retried in a realistic, non-threatening environment without risking harm to "real" students. In addition, this Creative Inquiry Project will support a research study evaluating the effectiveness of simulations in teacher education as well as the participant's views of the simulator.

Grey water contamination from some of the residential areas merges with the Alumn Stream and flows directly into the ocean causing a buildup harmful bacteria. Significant levels of the E. Coli bacteria have been found in the water entering the bay from the Soufriere River. The bacteria has degraded the coral reefs in close proximity and there are concerns for the public swimming area nearby. This project will research sustainable methods for filtering water using mushroom root growth, or mycelium.

The Center, located in the Commonwealth of Dominica, West Indies, was created in 1989 by a gift to Clemson from the late conservationist and philanthropist John D. Archbold.It was his vision that international students and researchers work with Dominican citizens to address pressing land use concerns. The Archbold Tropical Research and Education Center enables us to study the entire spectrum of ecological, economic, and social factors that influence human relationships with tropical ecosystems. For many years, researchers have traveled to Dominica and stayed at the property collecting specimens, cataloging them, and preserving them at the station.Since Hurricane Maria, the Clemson owned property in Dominica has been badly damaged and continues to sustain water and wind damage to buildings. Most of the current structures are uninhabitable and the university awaits a settlement with the insurance company. For this reason, we would like to seek support to digitally archive the works of many researchers before they are lost to degrading environmental conditions.

After Hurricane Maria, they also spearheaded the development of a tool lending center which has been quite beneficial in rebuilding much of the public space of the Soufriere community. Now, the group will turn it's focus toward helping the small island town plan for future development to include fishing, farming, tourism, diving, among others. The small coastal town has a wealth of natural elements including Sulphur Springs, oceanside hot springs, coral reefs, diving sites, mountains, trails, etc. We will work with the community to inventory the current resources as well as plan for future development and resilient development. The community was devastated after Tropical Storm Erika in 2015 and again by Hurricane Maria in 2017. While development is important, resilient and sustainable development is even more so.

"Controlling DNA topoisomerase functions has been envisioned for developing new anticancer and antibacterial agents. A number of small molecules have been tested for their ability as poisons of DNA topoisomerase functions. The therapeutic interest in the development of small molecules as inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase lies in their ability to act as DNA cleavage complex stabilizing agents and to recognize ATP binding site. The emergence of resistance to anti-bacterials has necessitated the search of novel molecules that could help tackle these issues. Small molecules that are both DNA binders and non-binders will be discovered to poison the functions of DNA topoisomerases". Team members will learn about the target enzyme and work towards investigating small molecules that can inhibit it.

Development involves the coordination of complex pathways, and variation during developmental processes can produce both human anomalies as well as evolved diversity. We focus on cichlid fishes of the East African rift lakes, which have undergone an extraordinary adaptive radiation to produce an incredible range of phenotypic diversity. This includes an unparalleled range of craniofacial morphologies, which correlates with their feeding mechanism (e.g. algae scraping or suction feeding). We seek to understand how this facial variation is produced using a range of shape analyses, experimental embryology, and genetics.

College of Science G,G,G, 1238 Thinking Outside the Box: A Cross-disciplinary Approach to Understanding Team Creativity Have you ever wondered how the teams of people who work on shows like SNL, South Park, and The Daily Show with Trevor Noah are able to come up with such creative content in such a short amount of time? What stands in the way of creativity in teams like these and what can we do to help teams reach their creative potential? Come to think of it, what even is creativity? As a research initiative of the Developing and Improving Globally Integrated Teamwork and Leadership (DIGITAL) Lab, we are interested in exploring these topics by specifically looking at what goes on during team meetings that helps or hinders creative processes and outcomes.

Due to the damage caused by Hurricane Maria in 2017, the school has been displaced and operating only half day programs to be able to support all of the children in the community in a small temporary space. This Creative Inquiry team will support a significant outreach program with the school and the community. Project components will include a school/community garden (with economic programming for children to sell excess goods to local businesses), a chicken coop, sports fields (basketball/soccer), and a STEM learning garden. The mission of our team is to plan different projects throughout the year to help the Soufriere Primary school and implement the projects on our trips to Dominica. Our goal is to help with the learning experience for the local community. This semester, our focus is specifically working towards the development of a garden so that the students not only have access to food, but can also gain agricultural skills.

College of Engineering, Computing & Applied Sciences F, 1250 Science and Pseudoscience in Popular Media The combination of access to information and the decline in science education and critical thinking ability have given rise to a fear of science and mistrust of scientists. Because of the lack of understanding of science, charlatans like Dr. Oz are able to exploit the public’s fears for their own financial gain. A few examples of what this exploitation has led to: cancer patients refusing chemo therapy treatments in favor of questionable “natural” therapies; a subset of people have tried to “cure” their autistic children by giving them bleach enemas; and an increase in the production and marketing of dietary supplements promising to cure everything from obesity to cancer. Because of ignorance, people can be the victims of scams and in the case of fad diets and supplements, can be harmed. In addition to the decline of science education, critical thinking, and difficulty identifying reliable sources of information, public attitude towards science and scientists is negative. Scientists are harassed on a regular basis and are accused of being paid to do the bidding of large companies like Monsanto. Additionally, these celebrities and charlatans mislead the public by saying science is wrong and that they are the only ones that are trustworthy. This leads to fearmongering and a belief in conspiracy theories. The proposed project seeks to help students and the general public tell the difference between science and pseudoscience and be able to evaluate claims seen in popular media, correct misconceptions about science, and to help students develop critical thinking skills through presenting their findings to a general audience. The CI will help students explain science to a general audience and show people that science is relevant to their lives, approachable, and nothing to be afraid of.

Mobile elements, discovered by Barbara McClintock, are also often referred to as jumping genes or transposable elements.They are abundant in many genomes --e.g. more than 50% of the human genome is comprised of mobile elements. Transposable elements are associated with certain genetic disorders not only through insertion but also via recombination between elements. As part of this project, we will investigate different aspects of mobile element biology and how genomes evolve with respect to transposable elements. This Creative Inquiry has computational including programming as well as some wet-bench aspects. Furthermore, we will explore new approaches on how to visualize genomes with regard to mobile elements. This includes the developments of tangibles for data interaction.

A practical means of involving the local population in collecting and transporting accumulated litter to central collection points and establishing incentives for participation is a potential solution. An important component of such an approach is thought to be the development of a practical process to enable single individuals to compact litter into small, manageable units, for which they could be compensated on a piece by piece basis, somewhat like collecting deposits on discarded beverage containers in some communities. Accordingly, the following effort is proposed: Develop a means of compacting litter into dense units that can be transported easily to central collection facilities by personal conveyances such as bicycles, motorcycles, push carts, bicycle rickshaws, and bullock carts Apparatus employed should be amenable to local fabrication from readily available materials, including recycled automobile and bicycle parts, scrap metal, and the like, using modest welding, blacksmithing, and fabrication methods commonly found in undeveloped regions. Any method or materials used to bind compacted litter into stable units should be derived from litter components.

Some students complete first semester calculus in high school and start their post-secondary studies ahead of the game, or at least not behind. Others complete calculus in high school, but nonetheless, place into courses below calculus at the start of college. Still others do not attempt calculus in high school. In South Carolina, there is a significant racial and socioeconomic disparity between engineering students who place below calculus and those who enter college calculus-ready. In this project, we analyze qualitative focus-group and interview data from first-year engineering students around the state to understand both academic and non-academic factors that affected their initial mathematics placement in college.

College of Engineering, Computing & Applied Sciences F,F, 1309 FishShapes: Exploring the Evolution of Body Form Diversity Across Fishes. Students will join a team of scientists from across the US that are working to investigate body shape evolution across teleost fishes. Teleosts account for 96% of all fish species, nearly half of extant vertebrate diversity, and exhibit a spectacular variety of body forms, including lineages that range from deep-bodied (e.g. moonfish, spadefish), elongate (e.g. eels, needlefish), laterally compressed (e.g. ribbonfish) to globular (e.g. pufferfish), plus the uniquely shaped seahorses, flatfishes and ocean sunfishes. The purpose of this research is to tease-apart the major interacting factors influencing the evolution of body form at the macroevolutionary scale, across teleost fishes, and to identify trends in shape diversity over their evolutionary history. As members of the ‘FishShapes’ team students will spend at least 2 semesters conducting research: collecting data and working together to develop and test a hypothesis concerning the evolution of body shape across fishes. The ultimate goal is to write and publish a scientific paper. This project is ideally suited to students who have no prior research experience, as we will cover everything from how to develop hypotheses through to giving scientific presentations.

Medical devices and equipment that are considered standard in hospitals in the United States can be hard to find and very expensive in developing countries, such as Tanzania. In addition there is a shortage of trained biomedical engineers. Therefore, the goal of this Creative Inquiry team is to design and develop medical instrumentation and monitors that are robust, user-friendly, and low-cost for Tanzania in collaboration with engineering students and faculty at Arusha Technical College in Tanzania. The students on this team will be expected to work on electronics and instrument design. They are expected to do needs finding to find the issues facing biomedical engineers in rural SC and in Tanzania. The students will collaborate weekly with students from Arusha Technical College through message boards. In addition, the Clemson and ATC student teams will have joint videoconferenced update meetings once a month with faculty and staff from both institutions. In addition to doing design, Clemson students are expected to learn about Tanzania. Students will learn about Tanzanian culture, government and healthcare structure. In addition, students will learn some basic conversational Swahili.

The ultimate goal of this technology, called “cell printing” is to print organs that can be used as replacements for diseased or damaged organs. While this goal is still far in the future, cell printing currently has several applications, including rapid drug testing, bioprinting of skin grafts for promoting wound healing, and bioprinting of bone and cartilage. One problem inhibiting further development of bioprinting concerns the control over droplet formation for existing printheads. Ideally one would like to have control over the drop diameter and number of cells per drop in a fixed printhead. However, any given printhead typically is capable of forming a narrow range of drop diameters. It is possible that, for viscoelastic fluids, there is a greater possibility to control the characteristics of drops than is the case for fluids that have little or no elasticity. This idea is the focus of this project.

Literature has shown positive improvements in patients with spinal cord injuries, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, and many other disabilities when partaking in hippotherapy. This information will be used to create saddles for effective use in hippotherapy. Adaptive saddles will be created to provide assistance to those of specific disabilities whom normally cannot ride without assistance or minimal intervention. The saddle will be suited with pressure sensor feedback in order to obtain rider patterns within the saddle. Further modifications to gather rider actions while mounted on the horse can also be explored.

College of Engineering, Computing & Applied Sciences F,F,A, 1330 Designing With Docs In bioengineering, the opportunity to collaborate with clinicians in the design of biomedical devices is considered the highlight of any design experience, but usually these design experiences are limited to senior year, if at all. Clinicians are an essential contributor to the design process, in that they are both the users of biomedical devices, and often the first point of contact for problems that occur in their use. Typically, students explore design related issues, and recruit clinicians to support their work. In this new CI, clinical collaborators that have the support of their clinical innovation departments will work with students to create the next generation of biomedical devices. This CI will be open to all undergraduates, and projects will be multi-semester, to support the development of long-term innovations in healthcare.

Team LeadersYiqiang Han Mechanical Engineering College of Engineering, Computing & Applied Sciences F, 1335 Autonomous Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAV) Electric-powered Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) technologies are around the corner and ready to be applied to commercial applications, such as unmanned delivery, emergency response, survey and patrolling, etc. Autonomous control of an Unmanned Air Vehicle for a package delivery mission is specifically considered in this project. Students will have to carry out their unique design that achieve a balance between size and payload, while still capable of autonomous navigation without external interference (100% edge computing). The current project involves using state of the art development tools such as NVIDIA Jetson TX2 GPU board, ROS robotics simulation environment, PX4 autopilot platform. The objective of this project is to design, simulate and test a UAV to perform package delivery mission solely based on vision navigation and autonomous control algorithms. Students will also gain insight of the vehicle autonomy through hands-on programming and testing practices that can be applied to other interdisciplinary projects such as self-driving car researches. Students are expected to meet weekly to report progress and plan for next steps. Students should expect to enroll in the CI project for 2-4 semesters.Estimated length of the proposed project is 4-6 semesters. Multi-semester commitment is expected from the enrolled students.

College of Engineering, Computing & Applied Sciences F, 1753 Determining the Impact of Polymers on Blood Health to Improve Translation of Polymeric Nanotechnology Although a vaccine and several treatments exist for Hepatitis B, chronic cases remain a public health concern. Chronicity is due in part to large numbers of non-infectious particles, produced alongside the virus, which exhaust the immune response. In this project, we will focus on treating Hepatitis B by using targeted polymer amphiphiles to assembly around virus particles and removing them from the body. We will also study the effect of flowing fluid on directed self-assembly, in order to mimic blood flow conditions in the human body. Self-assembly of nanoparticles is an area of intense focus in nanomedicine, but relatively little attention has been given to either directing self-assembly around a free-floating target and the effect of flow on nanoparticle formation. As a result, these areas potentially hold broad interest for nanotechnology. Team LeadersJessica Larsen Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering College of Engineering, Computing & Applied Sciences F, 1443 Autonomous Vehicles and Users with Disabilities Persons with certain motor or cognitive disabilities like paralysis of the extremities or autism may face significant obstacles to gainful employment and social inclusion due to difficulties in operating conventional motor vehicles. Proponents of fully autonomous or “self-driving” vehicles argue that the emergence of this technology may address this issue. Advocates for disabled persons are concerned, however, that the needs of persons with disabilities are not being adequately considered in the design of this technology. As a result, it is argued, self-driving technologies are being developed that will ultimately prove inaccessible to persons with a range of disabilities, ultimately undermining the potential mobility benefits of the technology. There is, therefore, a critical need to determine a model of interaction that will support efficient use of this technology by persons with disabilities. The proposed research is being initiated to determine the needs, preferences, and concerns of persons with motor, cognitive and other disabilities in interacting with self-driving vehicles, a model of interaction incorporating context-specific methodologies and the development of tools to support accessible interaction.

In the 2020-2021 school year we will be working on two funded films. One of the films is titled WORDMAN and is the life story of famed communicator and literary giant Kenneth Burke. This film was first developed and sponsored by Professor David Blakesley. During the course we will have a Zoom presentation from a Hollywood studio film professional where an overview of the studio system environment will be discussed and all of your questions will be answered. It will be an excellent insight on how an actual film studio works and how a student can best prepare themselves to work in the industry by learning skills and learning production techniques. These same techniques will be the underpinnings of the CI itself.The other film's working title WALT'S WALTZ and is a story of mental health and how as a community we need to be better prepared and focused on helping people with their mental health issues. A principal subject of the film is a Clemson grad and former Clemson lecturer Walt Rooks who lost his fight with depression by suicide. This film if being financially supported by a 501c3 tax exempt organization based in Greenville and led by Clemson alumnus Susan Rooks, Walt's mother and project founder. Both of these films will be filmed with a cinematic quality camera and lens and edited to the same standards you will find by major motion picture studios. The members of the CI, along with Open Studio Club member at Clemson are both being produced for the documentary film festival market and commercial broadcasting opportunities such as PBS and HBO. We will also work on the business of the film and how to package and market the film for distribution and sales.The course is being led by a Hollywood studio industry professional who has worked on post-production special effects on dozens of feature films and television shows and Free and Open Source film production software engineering. Copy and paste the link below to see a picture of our cinema camera:http://clemsonos.org/cion.jpgEveryone in the CI will get plenty of time with the camera, as well....testing and actual production.

Modern medical attempts to deliver drugs into the brain have involved disruption of the barrier, exploitation of different routes of administration, and attachment of ligands on nanoparticle surfaces that are specific to cellular receptors at the blood-brain barrier. These methods have had limited success in translation to clinical applications. The modulation of nanoparticle shape has been shown to have a large impact on nanoparticle transport, thermodynamic stability, and cellular internalization. However, the effect of different nanoparticle shapes on brain uptake has not been extensively explored. Team members in the Modulating Nanoparticle Shape to Enhance Blood-Brain Barrier Delivery creative inquiry will engage in the creation of polymer-based nanoparticles of various shapes to improve blood-brain barrier delivery. CI students will have the opportunity to work in an interdisciplinary research environment, using engineering, biology, and nanotechnology related concepts towards solving a major medical problem.

College of Engineering, Computing & Applied Sciences F, 1344 Image-Guided Drug Delivery To the Brain Advances in nanotechnology have led to the development of nanoparticles that can deliver therapeutics into specific cells for the treatment of many cancers, including gliomas. Clinical translation of these therapies to patients has been limited due to inefficient efficacy in vivo. Image-guided drug delivery may help overcome barriers to translation providing quantitative analysis of biodistribution and pharmacokinetics through real-time visual monitoring of the therapeutic within the body,. Computed tomography (CT) is a desirable imaging method for brain disease diagnosis, as it can provide information on the location of bones, muscles, fat, and organs. However, CT can require long-term exposure to radiative contrast agents in order to obtain high quality image information. The high doses required are not currently approved by the FDA. Because of this, we are proposing the creation of a nanoparticle system capable of delivering FDA approved contrast agents directly to the site of interest, limiting toxicity associated with whole body exposure and off-targeting. Due to their small size, nanoparticles have the ability to load a high concentration of drug while simultaneously being targeted to specific areas of the brain, which would provide a dramatic improvement to current CT capabilities.

How do different sugars and sugar substitutes in soft drinks impact the oral microbiome? Dental cavities are a major health problem worldwide. To better understand what causes tooth decay, we need to examine the microbes living on our teeth. This community of microbes are known as the oral microbiome. The bacteria that live on our teeth form a biofilm commonly known as dental plaque. The microbes in the tooth biofilm survive by feeding on sugars and starches consumed in our diets. After feeding on these sugars many of the waste products expelled by bacteria are acidic, causing tooth enamel erosion, and eventually, tooth decay. The goal of our research will be to compare how different soda types influence the oral microbiota. Students involved in this CI will conduct genomic and microbiological research on the oral microbiome. Student’s will complete DNA/RNA extractions of plaque biofilms, complete PCR amplifications, prepare samples for DNA/RNA sequencing, and will learn how to use Next Generation DNA sequencing technology.

Variation in salinity has long been recognized as a factor controlling estuarine fish distributions, through its effect on behavior and physiological processes. Despite this, the ecological consequences of habitat-specific residency patterns on foraging and growth of freshwater, estuarine, and marine fish species is still not well understood. As estuaries serve as essential habitats for many recreationally and commercially important fishes, a more complete understanding of how habitat-specific estuarine conditions affect growth and survival of fishes is needed to provide managers with better information for habitat-specific management actions (e.g., protection, restoration efforts). This CI aims to explore relationships between habitat-specific residency patterns, foraging, and growth in estuarine fish populations. Students will work on team-based projects that require critical thinking, data collection, quantitative analyses, and presentation and publication of results. Students will gain essential knowledge and skills for processing samples in the lab including otolith aging, diet analysis, stable isotope analysis, preparation of gonadal tissues for histological analysis, and identification of estuarine fish and invertebrates.

They serve as model organisms for developmental and cellular biology, and are important vectors for human and agricultural pathogens. As a result, working with insects can expose students to numerous hard and soft skills useful in a range of life-sciences fields, from medical to agricultural biology, evolutionary and ecological to developmental and immunological. In this project, students will examine patterns, mechanisms, and function associated with bioelectricity in insects, including relationship to regeneration, immunity, and pathology. Techniques used include tissue culture, fluorescence microscopy, standard virological techniques (such as plaque assays), and more. Students are required to participate in communicating data in weekly group meetings, and then via on-campus, state, regional, and national meetings.

This proposed research project aims to create a joint modeling and optimization framework to model the stormwater quantity and to determine optimal types and location of GI practices. We investigate (i) how to estimate runoff reduction effectiveness as a function of location, type, and size of GI practices; (ii) how to create a stochastic optimization framework that adaptively integrates the estimated runoff reduction to help decision-making to reduce flooding impacts; and (iii) validate and test the proposed framework and solutions.

Sullivan Center (JFSC) while assisting with the development and evaluation of lifestyle medicine projects. The JFSC is an academic, clinical learning facility that operates on Clemson's campus, and has many satellite locations throughout the upstate. Additionally, the JFSC operates a mobile health clinic statewide to transform SC's rural and under served populations. The JFSC addresses root causes of disease by whole person clinical interventions, recognizing the spectrum of genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors, supporting individual, family and community vitality. Students will be responsible for collecting data from patients directly, including vital signs like height, weight and blood pressure, during the patient visits. Program evaluation will be performed at various levels, from patient to population. Students may be responsible for analyzing data on single patients or analyzing larger data sets to ensure efficiency in case management services, depending on the student’s interests and current programs running at JFSC. Past research projects that students have assisted with include lifestyle medicine individual case studies, quality assurance, quality control and quality assessment measures for Best Chance Network patient’s lab results, and cohort studies on a population enrolled in FirstLine Therapy for 12 months or more. Team LeadersCaitlin Moore Clinical Ed/Pract&Med Surv Pro College of Behavioral, Social & Health Sciences C, 1404 Stream Fish Mercury Dynamics in Managed Forests Southeastern forests contain large pools of mercury in the terrestrial leaf litter and understory vegetation. The majority of the mercury in southeaster forests is from atmospheric deposition, meaning that even remote forests far from industrial activities may have elevated levels of mercury stored in the soil, leaf litter, and living plant biomass. Common forest management practices intended to reduce fuel loads (e.g., controlled burning, mechanical thinning) may also release mercury from soils, leaf litter, and living plant biomass into downstream aquatic environments. Mercury bioaccumulation in aquatic ecosystems, particularly in fish at the top of aquatic food chains, has been well documented in a variety of systems. However, we know very little about how fish and invertebrate mercury burdens are affected by fuel reduction practices. For example, does the amount and type of mercury (methyl versus inorganic) released into downstream aquatic systems differ between controlled burns and thinning? Additionally, how do nutrients, which are also released during forest management activities, affect stream food webs and, subsequently, mercury bioaccumulation? Students in this project will participate in collection of fish and invertebrates from forest streams in the Clemson Experimental Forest and the Santee Experimental Forest (part of the Francis Marion National Forest near Charleston, SC). Students will learn techniques for backpack electrofishing, invertebrate collections, diet analysis, and age and growth techniques using otoliths and scales. Students will also be encouraged to develop specific research questions and to develop hypotheses that could be tested with real-world data collecting during the course of this project.

College of Agriculture, Forestry & Life Sciences A,A,A,A,A, 1411 Biophysics of Parasitic Kinetoplastid Motility Motility is critical to the life cycle and pathogenicity of many parasites. While targeting motility has been successful in the treatment of multiple bacterial diseases, the motility and motile structures of eukaryotic pathogens remain understudied and under exploited as a treatment targets. A bending wave that primarily propagates from the tip to the base of their flagella drives the motility of pathogenic kinetoplastids, which are eukaryotic parasites that cause multiple neglected tropical diseases. This is unlike nearly all other eukaryotes, which beat from the base to the tip. For a variety of experimental and theoretical reasons, it is likely that unique biophysical mechanisms innate to axonemal dyneins, the molecular motors that drive flagellar motility, dictates tip-to-base motility. The broad goal of this Creative Inquiry is to identify the mechanism of tip-to-base motility of kinetoplastid flagella using Trypanosoma brucei as a model. Specifically, we will biophysically and biochemically characterize axonemal dynein that we purify from trypanosome flagella, and to identify trypanosome axonemal dynein regulation mechanisms that could yield tip-to-base motility. We will also take genetic approaches to understanding the effects of motors on cell motility. This interdisciplinary project will take molecular biological (RNAi, cloning, protein tagging), biochemical (ion exchange chromatography, in vitro reconstitutions, ATPase assays), and biophysical (ultrafast dual-trap optical tweezers, total internal reflectance fluorescence microscopy) experimental approaches. The expected outcome will a quantitative framework from which to develop pan-kinetoplastid drugs that target parasite motility. Successful completion of the project will ultimately lead to a greater understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of pathogenic parasite motility and could lead to novel treatments for African sleeping sickness, Chagas disease, and leishmaniasis.

It is comprised of 100 billion individual neurons with about 80% of the brain mass in the cerebral cortex, which is the site of human cognition. There are massive efforts underway to understand how the brain works. What is memory, attention, perception, thought, language self-awareness, consciousness, etc.? To even begin to answer these questions, much fundamental science must be done. In this creative inquiry, we intend to build and study simple neuronal circuits, in vitro. We will use a combined optical tweezer and microelectrode array system to manipulate simple neuronal circuits, to electrically excite the circuits, and to probe the response of these circuits. We will build and study simple model logic gates out of rat or mouse neurons.

College of Science G,G,G, 1419 Multiplexing Using Spectral Imaging and Combinatorics (MuSIC) There are hundreds if not thousands of specialized cell types within the human body. Knowing the relative abundance of these cell types is important for understanding physiology and disease. Current technologies can only look at a handful at a time, and only expensive technologies can look at dozens. The expensive technologies also are destructive, meaning they have to kill the cells to know what type it was. This project uses a novel technology developed in our lab called MuSIC to make high-dimensional cell type profiling fast, affordable and non-destructive. This will push the boundaries of our single-cell understanding of physiology and disease, as well as increase the potential of personalized medicine through accessibility to such technologies.

In the Southeast, a majority of small farms utilize small ruminants to produce specialty products and manage the land. They have a smaller carbon footprint and can produce meat and milk on forage-based systems. This project will examine ways to enhance small ruminant production systems in SC and learn about the benefits of producing meat and milk in grass-based systems. Team LeadersSusan Duckett Animal and Veterinary Sciences College of Agriculture, Forestry & Life Sciences A, 2042 Multiplexing using Spectral Imaging and Combinatorics (MuSIC) for Genetic and Genetic Interaction Screens A genetic screen is the process by which every gene in an organism is disrupted to determine what role it plays in a particular phenotype. A genetic interaction screen is similar, except it asks that question for every possible two-way combination of genes. Genetic screens on human cells at genome scale, around 30,000 genes, is routine now with CRISPR technologies. However, this is only on a cell population level, looking at bulk effects in millions of cells, not on a single cell level, which is the fundamental unit of most phenotypes. Genetic interaction screens are severely limited due to the sheer number of combinations possible. This project explores the use our recently developed MuSIC technology to enable single-cell genetic screens at high-throughput, and genetic interaction screens on scales far greater than currently possible.

Colonization is highly reliant on the metabolic environment provided by the gut microbiota, the indigenous microbes living in the gastrointestinal tract. This project will focus on how short chain fatty acids produced by the gut microbiota impact C. difficile growth. Students will grow C. difficile under different metabolic conditions, then measure growth and toxin production. Techniques include anaerobic cultivation, preparation of in vitro bacterial growth assays, molecular assays such as PCR, and cell culture assays to detect toxin activity. Students will also be expected to participate in weekly group meetings to discuss study results and relevant literature related to the project. We expect to present results at a local, regional, or national meeting at the conclusion of the student’s CI project. These results are expected to characterize how certain microbial metabolites contribute to C. difficile susceptibility, thus increasing our knowledge to combat C. difficile infection. Team LeadersAnna Seekatz Biological Sciences College of Science G, 235 Nutrient Sensing in Protozoan Parasites The Morris lab is focused on resolving the mechanisms that protozoan parasites use to sense and metabolize the important sugar glucose during infection of their human host. Through these studies, parasite-specific components of the sugar sensing and uptake pathway have been identified and, in an on-going collaborative effort, small molecule inhibitors of the pathways with anti-parasitic activity have been developed. While the team has historically focused on the African trypanosome, more recent work on the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum and the brain eating amoeba Naegleria fowleri suggests that exploiting the sugar metabolism pathways of these single-celled invaders may also prove useful in the development of new therapeutics.

College of Science G, 1439 Advancement of Assisted Reproductive Technologies for Cattle and Other Species Assisted reproductive technologies (ART) are utilized for both humans and cattle; however, ART has been and will continue to be used to save species from extinction. Most advances used in ART currently used in all mammalian species were developed at least partially using cattle as a model. Assisted reproductive technologies commonly used in bovine reproduction are artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer. This project will focus on methods to increase bovine fertility and examine the putative microRNA markers associated with early pregnancy and early pregnancy loss in pregnancies produced by in vitro fertilization or embryo transfer. The team will meet weekly to coordinate and plan activities for the week which would include estrous synchronization of cattle, estrous detection, embryo transfer, blood collection and processing, ultrasonography, ELISA, RNA isolation, qRT-PCR, and cell culture.

The aim of the conference is to open a space for Clemson University and the local community where we can extend and deepen our understanding of recent debates on race, racialization, and being an embodied agent of a minority group. This conference will bring together academics who work on race and embodiment to share their studies and discuss different approaches to these issues. In my teaching I explore the issues of philosophy of racism and racial embodiment focusing on questions: What role does embodiment play in the experience of racism and/or racial harm? How do various social policies benefit or burden people classified as being a given race? Does racism harm the racist as well as the victim?

Team LeadersStephen Peairs Forestry and Environmental Conservation College of Agriculture, Forestry & Life Sciences A, 1506 Substance Abuse and Cognition Substance Use Disorder (SUD) is a chronic, complex condition that is among the most prevalent of mental health disorders. To evaluate effective treatment approaches, it is important to first assess risk factors for relapse and barrier to recovery. While potential individual risk factors have been identified, there is currently no research aimed at systematically investigating how these factors together establish an individual’s risk for relapse. Thus, the purpose of this investigation is to identify specific risk factors for relapse and barriers to addiction recovery in individuals who are hospitalized at Greenville Memorial Hospital due to complications from SUD. This research is a randomized control trial that will examine how neurocognitive, health, and personal risk factors as well and social, financial, and situational barriers influence recovery. Additionally, this project will evaluate which barriers a recovery coaching intervention can overcomes and what risk factors recovery coaching can mitigate. Students will be involved in working with patients at Greenville Memorial Hospital to collecting all survey data, cognitive assessments, and neuroimaging measures.

The goal of using OER is to decrease the cost of education. For example, when OER is used in a class, students may be able to purchase an older version of the textbook, or they may be able to avoid purchasing the textbook altogether. Classes that use OER give students access to the class materials on the first day of class. Studies have shown that student learning and grades are higher when this is possible. In this Creative Inquiry, students will work with Primary Team Leader, Dr. Rachel Getman, who is an Associate Professor in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, to increase the use of OER in the Clemson University College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences.

Bannister Teaching and Learning College of Education E, 1516 The Mary Bruce Project: Women and the Golden Age of Tropical Medicine The turn of the last century was marked by a golden era in tropical medicine. British doctors and researchers working in the British Colonies in Africa and the tropics made major discoveries, including elucidating the infectious agents that cause malaria, sleeping sickness, and schistosomiasis. However, the stories of women and their contributions to the history of tropical medicine are largely untold.Sir David Bruce was a Scottish doctor working for the British Army in colonial Africa and the tropics. One of his major discoveries was working out that sleeping sickness was transmitted by the tsetse fly. In Bruce's papers, there are illustrations of the trypanosomes drawn by Bruce's wife, Mary Bruce, who was working alongside Sir David in the field. In a number of Bruce's papers, Mary Bruce is even listed as an author! Our starting hypothesis is that Mary Bruce contributed in significant ways to the scientific research of her husband David Bruce. This project seeks to answer the following questions: What was Mary Bruce's role in Sir David Bruce's many discoveries? What is Mary Bruce's own story?With the aim of telling Mary Bruce's story (and the stories of those like her), this project has two goals: (1) To expand the online presence of information about women in the golden age of tropical medicine via Wikipedia entries, a publicly accessible Mary Bruce Project blog, and generation of a dedicated online archive; (2) To generate and submit for publication at years' end at least one popular science article arising from our research.

Team LeadersDavid Feliciano Biological Sciences College of Science G, 1519 Affordable Automation for the Entertainment Industry For most touring theatre productions, the locations of production elements are marked by hand using a tedious measuring and checking system. The objective of this project is to develop an affordable new tool for the entertainment industry called the PlotBot, a programmable robot that will accurately mark the locations of production elements such as scenery, overhead or rigging based elements, seating and the parameters of the space in which they are to be installed. The PlotBot will utilize a CAD-based interface and the user would input the configuration of the stage space, then overlay the ground plan plot for stage elements. With this information, the PlotBot would physically plot the points on the deck, similar to how a laser cutter or CNC router work. There are robots that serve similar functions that could be adapted to house this technology but are cost prohibitive for much of the industry. This four semester project will be completed in three main phases: (1) Planning and Design, (2) Fabrication, and (3) Testing and Improvement. During the third phase, we plan to allow tours to use the PlotBot and provide feedback as tours provide a controlled laboratory for testing and improvement. Near the end of the project, we will present the prototype at the USITT conference. In addition, we will also publish on the development and design of the PlotBot, the educational experience of a diverse student team, and additional applications of the PlotBot (e.g., tradeshows, construction, real estate, sporting events, street festivals, etc. Team LeadersMatthew Leckenbusch Performing Arts Bradley J Putman Dean of Engineering & Science Shannon Robert Performing Arts College of Architecture, Arts & Humanities B,F,B, 1521 Deer-Coyote Interactions White-tailed deer are an important game species and coyotes may be impacting their populations in South Carolina.

Team LeadersMegan Novak Forestry and Environmental Conservation Russell Kyle Barrett Forestry and Environmental Conservation College of Agriculture, Forestry & Life Sciences A,A, 1903 Physiological Phenotyping of Cotton Leaf Shape Isolines to Collect Data for Cotton Breeding In recent years, frequent hurricanes have brought in high winds and cloudy days causing significant boll loss in cotton in South Carolina. These conditions are also augmenting the frequency and intensity of biotic stresses affecting cotton canopy development and productivity. Four major leaf shape alleles exist in cotton: normal, sub-okra/Sea-Island, okra, and super-okra. These leaf shapes are a multiple allelic series of a single incompletely dominant genetic locus. After the shape has been determined, it normally does not vary through the remaining growth and development of the leaf. Leaf shape plays important roles in canopy development and photosynthesis and is associated with production advantages such as boll rot resistance, earliness, flowering rate, chemical spray penetration, lint trash, and yield. Understanding the differences in physiological mechanisms that lead to variation in plant performance among different cotton leaf shapes would help open new avenues for developing cultivars with ideal leaf shape, which would enhance sustainable and profitable production. The specific objectives of this project are to: (1) evaluate six leaf shape isolines of cotton based on physiological traits related with yield and performance (photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, transpiration, chlorophyll fluorescence, chlorophyll index, leaf temperature, leaf area, time to maturity, flower number, water use efficiency, and lint yield), (2) elucidate differences in physiological mechanisms that lead to variation in plant performance among different leaf shape isolines, and (3) identify the leaf shape ideotype with superior physiological mechanisms towards developing cotton varieties with improved productivity. In this study, the cotton plants will be grown in a greenhouse. The results from this study will help fine-tune the leaf shape approach for better agronomic performance and will compliment cotton breeding programs for variety development. The NC State cotton breeder, Dr. Vasu Kuraparthy, who developed the novel leaf shape approach, is a collaborator on this project.

Team LeadersStephen Kaeppler Physics and Astronomy Alvaro Guerra Physics and Astronomy Gerald Lehmacher Physics and Astronomy College of Science G,G,G, 1918 Black Bass Reservoir Ecology Black Bass populations in reservoirs support important recreational fisheries across North America. However, many North American reservoirs are now over 50 years old. Fish habitat quality in reservoirs tends to decline with reservoir age due to sedimentation and decomposition of natural structures submerged during reservoir filling. A common management approach to compensate for declining fish habitat quality is to install natural (i.e., trees, rock piles, stump clusters) or artificial (i.e., man made) structures in older reservoirs. Such installations have become common across North America and there is evidence that installed habitats can attract and hold fish while increasing angler catch rates. In recent years the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources has been engaged in a large-scale habitat enhancement project on Lake Hartwell aimed at improving habitat for native sportfish, including Largemouth Bass. However, non-native Alabama Bass are also present in Lake Hartwell. For SCDNR to successfully enhance native fish habitat more information is required on habitat use and selection for native and non-native fish in Lake Hartwell. This Creative Inquiry project will work closely with SCDNR and Clemson University faculty and graduate students to use acoustic telemetry to quantify habitat use and movement patterns in native Largemouth Bass and non-native Alabama Bass (also known as Spotted Bass) in Lake Hartwell. The goal of this project is to identify locations and installed habitat types that be preferentially selected by Largemouth Bass and show little benefit to Alabama Bass. Students working on this project will assist with overall project objectives and will also develop an independent project that investigates hypothesis-driven questions regarding fish habitat use in reservoirs.

Team LeadersHassan Raza Electrical and Computer Engineering College of Engineering, Computing & Applied Sciences F, 1927 Bioleaching of arsenic-contaminated soils by Aspergillus niger Arsenic is a trace metalloid that is ubiquitous in almost every environment. Increasing concentrations of arsenic in soil and water is a problem the world is currently facing with the multiple arsenic inputs by anthropogenic sources such as mining, milling, agricultural use, and coal ash. In 1993 the World Health Organization provisional guideline for arsenic was reduced from 50 micrograms per liter to 10 micrograms per liter. Since then, arsenic concentrations above acceptable standards were detected in many countries, such as the United States of America, China, France, and Germany.It is a natural process by which biological processes and the anatomy and physiology of plants reduce the arsenic concentration in soil and water. Plants need a necessary supply of nutrients, including arsenic, to grow and immobilize the arsenic through the biological processes mentioned. Certain species of plants have a higher tolerance to an excessive collection of arsenic in the soil. They could make an efficient, low-cost solution to reducing arsenic concentrations to below provisional guidelines. Team LeadersZachary Gilstrap Environmental Engineering and Earth Sciences Tom O.

In February of 2020, two Clemson students visited the Fort Hill Slave and Convict Cemetery and found it in a state of disrepair. They worked with faculty and staff to clean up the site and install a memorial. Further research led to the team to learn that there was a larger African American burial site on the west side of Woodland Cemetery. Using ground penetrating radar, 667 unmarked graves, believed to be those of African American enslaved persons, sharecroppers, convicted laborers, and wage workers, were recovered in the cemetery. Clemson Trustees established a trustee task force and Legacy Council in late summer 2020 to develop a preservation and memorialization plan for the burial ground, including a memorial. Students will complete genealogy research, conduct archival research, conduct and create historical tours, create social media posts, assist with developing memorial design, participate in dramatic performances, record oral history, proctor surveys, and write biographical narratives.

C.C.A.R.E. connects students with one another to share their lived experiences in a place that is intended to be safe and open for vulnerable conversations. This creative inquiry team will research topics related to the lived experiences of college students, including social media and self-perception, and work overload and procrastination. This interactive lab will feature related discussions and content production on college students and the college lifestyle. Our lab will also integrate related interpersonal activities, mindfulness, and play. Team LeadersDanielle McFarquhar Honors Programs Sarah Winslow Honors Programs O,O, 2024 Fish ecology and morphometrics Water flow influences many aspects of fishes’ ecology from timing of reproduction to evolution of body shape. One successful avenue for quantifying the ecological response to instream flows is larval fish research. Fish species often require specific flow conditions to spawn. By quantifying the timing and magnitude of spawning intensity (larval fish abundance) we can determine the flow conditions necessary for fish reproduction. Yet, no research on the relationship between flow and fish reproduction has been done in South Carolina. Ecomorphology is another excellent avenue of research for studying flow influence on fishes’ ecology and evolution. Body shape is an excellent surrogate for the ecology of fish species and is known to be strongly influenced by water velocity. However, studies of intra-specific body shape divergence among habitat types have focused geographic separated habitats such as lakes and rivers. Only one study has been done looking at body shape differences between lotic and lentic habitats within a stream. By examining the variation in body shape, it may be possible to understand how some individuals are able to take advantage of different flow regimes and habitats. The objective of this study is to test for intra-specific body shape differences between high and low flow micro-habitats within streams. In this study we address three hypotheses: 1) individual fish occupying high water velocity habitats will have significantly different body shape from fishes in low water velocity habitats. 2) individual fish occupying high water velocity habitats will have more fusiform body shapes and deeper caudal peduncles fishes in low water velocity habitats. 3) All fish species will show similar responses to water velocity. 4) identifying the timing, duration, and magnitude of stream flow driving spawning intensity. Team LeadersLuke Bower Forestry and Environmental Conservation College of Agriculture, Forestry & Life Sciences A, 1967 Multiscale modeling analysis of the Lithium metal/electrolyte interface properties in solid-state batteries The goal of this project is to develop a multiscale modeling methodology to understand the interface properties between electrode and electrolyte in solid-state batteries. Solid-state batteries are promising energy storage devices with superior energy density and safer features compared to traditional Li-ion batteries. Li metal is the main candidate for the anode and we will focus on oxide materials as potential electrolytes. We will analyze the atomic structure of the solid-solid heterophase interface to fundamentally understand the role of misfit dislocations, generating due to the lattice mismatch between the different materials, on the nucleation and growth of voids and dendrites, which eventually lead to the failure of the component. Such fundamental understanding will help design principles to improve materials properties and broadly deploy solid-state batteries for the benefit of the entire society. Molecular dynamics simulations will be used to predict the structure of the interface and the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of carriers and defects. This knowledge will inform Monte Carlo methods to compute transport properties and nucleation rates for voids and Li dendrites. Using artificial intelligence methods (mainly machine learning) we will correlate these outputs to the oxide electrolyte properties to select the oxide material that optimize the battery response.

Team LeadersKylie King Bioengineering Congyue Peng Delphine Dean Bioengineering Austin Smothers Bioengineering College of Engineering, Computing & Applied Sciences F,O,F,F, 1974 The Gig Work and Occupational Health Psychology (GW-OHP) Project The goal of this CI team is to conduct research addressing issues in the field of occupational health psychology (OHP). Our lab will focus on OHP areas such as nonstandard work arrangements (e.g., gig work), economic stress (e.g., job insecurity, underemployment), and substance use (primarily opioid use). This CI team will be working on at least two projects studying gig workers to follow up and extend our lab’s previously published paper (Watson, Kistler, Graham, & Sinclair, 2021). One project will focus on capturing gig workers’ job demands (e.g., underemployment, emotional labor) and job resources (e.g., autonomy, support). As suggested by Watson et al. (2021), we expect that gig workers are not a homogenous group as they have diverse work experiences reflected in their job demands and job resources. Our CI team will empirically test these propositions using survey data representing the different gig worker profiles and consider other job demands and resources not included in our original propositions. The second project will extend our previous research by collecting mixed methods data to examine mechanisms gig workers engage in to improve their work experiences (e.g., job crafting) and outcomes of gig work. We will also explore OHP outcomes such as worker health and well-being, stress, burnout, engagement, and substance use. Our team will give particular attention to opioid use given the heavily documented opioid crisis and its expected overlap with economic stress and gig work. The mixed methods data collection will promote a deeper understanding of gig work including potential moderating factors of these outcomes (e.g., volition, economic dependency) so that we can better inform the how, when, and why of gig workers’ experiences.

This CI is going to explore the effectiveness of the different types of packaging designs for peaches that are used in today’s marketplace. The ultimate goal is to develop a new package for peaches that may be better suited to modern consumers than the traditional peach packaging methods. Semester 1 will focus on studying the various ways that peaches are packaged: in bags, in bulk (open display in produce markets), multi-packs, and create an environment that can be used to test alternative designs within CUshop. How peaches are handled and delivered to the consumers’ home and cars will also be researched. Finally, students will design a few prototypes of future peach package designs. Students will present their baseline findings when the study is completed at the end of the first semester. The second semester will consist of conducting a shopper research project of the current state of peaches, improving the alternative package designs, and finally testing and comparing to see if the alternative package designs were more useful and appealing to modern consumers. A presentation of the entire project work will be delivered at the end of the second semester.

Team LeadersHassan Raza Electrical and Computer Engineering College of Engineering, Computing & Applied Sciences F, 1986 Human Factors of Clean Eating Globally (SPECTRA) Eating utensils are instruments in restaurants, homes, schools etc. as an everyday part of our lives. These seemingly simple instruments can introduce dangerous microbes like Ebola or enterovirus if not properly processed. The design of each instrument is based on human factors; how people interact with it, cost, usability, function, etc. The design, human factors, cleaning process, and cleaning supplies can vary across countries. This Creative Inquiry will use human factor studies to analyze eating instruments such as forks, knives, chopsticks, etc for use and reprocessing for global countries. Students will develop skillsets and research proficiencies that can be used across disciplines to apply human factor studies, device reprocessing techniques, global research, and device development. Through the lens of future engineers and scientists, the project aims to address questions such as: How does human factors effect an instrument design? How do you collect human factors data? Why is reprocessing significant? How does effective reprocessing affect global countries? How do you conduct global health research? How to develop a device that can be used globally with limited supplies and resources?

Team LeadersMing Yang Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering College of Engineering, Computing & Applied Sciences F, 1995 Cancer Biology and Development This Creative Inquiry project investigates the cellular events that occur in breast cancer and the common events in mammary gland development. Specifically, we are focused on what directs a healthy cell to become a cancer cell. Research suggests the early developmental pathways in the mammary gland are reactivated in some types of breast cancers. In order to understand these developmental signals, we are evaluating mammary gland gene expression in human breast cancers and using the pre-pubertal swine as the non-tumorigenic model.Global collaborative collections of human tumor samples with matched normals are available in databases for research analysis, however this approach requires tools capable of analyzing extremely large data sets. We will utilize a bioinformatics approach to investigate our research-based questions. The field of bioinformatics is the intersection of biology, statistics, and computer science. We will build networks to indicate similar gene expression patterns comparing our swine samples to the human database. In addition to breast cancer, we will investigate other diseases including but not limited to colon, pancreas, prostate, and uterine cancer. We will use open source software for the analysis of genes and intersecting networks. Visual graphics will be created in order to illustrate gene expression patterns between the human cancers and swine mammary models. In addition, we will utilize laser microdissection techniques to collect specified areas of interest for RNA extraction and analyses, and conduct immunohistochemical procedures for artificial intelligence studies. Team LeadersHeather Dunn Bioengineering College of Engineering, Computing & Applied Sciences F, 2065 Computer Fabrication and User Interfaces This Creative Inquiry centers on the use of computer control fabrication and computer graphics in manufacturing for apparel. Specifically, stitching (e.g. embroidery) to precisely control the stiffness properties of stretch fabrics. The result is a textile capable of changing strength/stretch in magnitude/direction across its surface. The current research has seen proof of concept in algorithms to produce stitch plans from simple designs, but needs improvement in design control and calibrating mechanical properties of the output. The next steps include: 1) sketch based design input that translates user design to fabrication designs through image understanding; and 2) developing prototypes of the given technology along with mechanical stiffness testing to measure effect from stitch plans to physical artifacts. The goal in both of these thrusts is to develop more advanced, and user-driven (real-world) prototypes.

In this Creative Inquiry project, we will utilize the Clemson University Tiger Timbers (CUTT) sawmill and associated drying kilns to explore ways to sustainably produce lumber and other wood products. As part of this project we will evaluate the mechanics and feasibility of producing wood pellets from sawmill by-products such as sawdust. We will further investigate the use of a gasifier to burn wood pellets for energy generation and test the feasibility of using a gasifier to run wood shop equipment. We currently own a pellet maker and a gasifier, both of which will need electrical and mechanical updating and testing. We will also explore, design, and implement the use of solar power to operate our drying kilns. Students will also learn how to operate a small-scale sawmill and produce the lumber needed to build support structures for the use of solar panels. As part of this project, students will also learn about data collection techniques to assess time consumption, productivity, and cost of small-scale sawmilling and wood drying operations. The long-term goal of this project is to create a self-sufficient and sustainable small-scale sawmilling and wood processing operation that can operate in an off-grid setting. Students will be given the opportunity to present the results from their Creative Inquiry project at different meetings and conference. Efforts will be made to secure funding to allow students to travel to out-of-state meetings to present their findings. Students will also be able to write and publish detailed reports about their project in various outlets ranging from scientific journals to extension magazines. Team LeadersPatrick Hiesl Forestry and Environmental Conservation College of Agriculture, Forestry & Life Sciences A, 2056 Validating Models of Attention in Older Adults According to prominent theories, where our gaze and ensuing visual attention are drawn depends on a blending of four aspects of the to-be-viewed object: 1. how much it stands out from things around it (salience), 2. how much effort it takes for the perceiver to bring the object into view, 3. The perceiver’s preconceived expectancy for an object to appear based on past experience, and 4. the positive or negative consequences of detecting or missing the object (value). This study uses an eyetracker to investigate how age-related changes might modify the process of attention capture that is driven by these four features over a set of driving simulator tasks. An older driver sample will be recruited from the Clemson area community and younger drivers will be recruited through the Clemson Psychology Department’s SONA system so comparisons can be made between how they distribute their visual attention. Findings will inform on if and how age-related cognitive and sensory declines and experience gained over years might alter how drivers’ attention is directed during the driving task.

The existing strategy does have drawbacks, and the Creative Inquiry project will investigate alternative strategies that could be implemented by Tupperware. One alternative strategy is to investigate the feasibility of using low-cost molds (not as durable as current molds) for some products and have enough of them made so that each manufacturing can manufacture the production volumes for their region in a just-in-time model versus the current model of producing their expected demand, storing it, and then shipping the high cost injection mold to another facility to repeat the process.

Team LeadersJiayun Shen Civil Engineering Marian Kennedy Materials Science and Engineering College of Engineering, Computing & Applied Sciences F,F, 2032 AI in Biomedicine: Machine Learning Models for Prediction and Annotation of Novel Disease Genes In the human genome, most genes actually do not encode proteins; they are noncoding RNA genes. The largest class of noncoding genes is known as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are transcripts greater in length than 200 nucleotides, but with no protein-coding capacity. While some lncRNAs have been demonstrated to be key regulators of gene expression and 3D genome organization, most lncRNAs are still uncharacterized. Thus, we have been developing new machine learning and data mining approaches for the functional annotation of human lncRNAs, as well as circular RNAs (circRNAs), by leveraging the vast amount of genetic and genomic data ("biological big data"). Our recent studies demonstrate that genomic data mining can give insights into RNA functions and provide valuable information for experimental studies of candidate lncRNAs. This CI project will focus on the identification and functional analysis of novel candidate lncRNAs (or circRNAs) associated with human diseases, including autism, intellectual disability and cancer.

Team LeadersMatthew H Koski Biological Sciences Anita Cisternas Fuentes Biological Sciences College of Science G,G, 2050 Sex-Specific Computational Disease Modeling Computational disease models that can conduct drug screens, aid in diagnosis, and make treatment recommendations are the future of precision medicine. Unfortunately, these algorithm-driven models are biased based on the data that feed them. Female data are often underrepresented in the literature, so there is a concern that the accuracy of these models for women will reflect that. There are a multitude of diseases in which the presentation and prognosis of a disease can vary greatly due to sex, including cardiovascular, pulmonary, endocrine, gastrointestinal, and autoimmune diseases, as well as several types of cancer. Our lab has already made strides to include sex-specific modeling into a signaling network model of cardiac fibroblasts. The goal of this creative inquiry is to conduct a literature review which (1) catalogs existing sex-specific computational disease models, (2) identifies areas where there is a need for more sex-specific disease models, (3) for areas where there is a need, determine if existing publicly available sex disaggregated data sets could be leveraged to create new models. Findings from this literature review will then be used by the team to create their own sex-specific disease models.

Team LeadersMatthew H Koski Biological Sciences Jacob Heiling Biological Sciences College of Science G,G, 2114 Fundamental Role of Temperature, Including Entropic Effects, in the Modeling of Dislocation-Mediated Plastic Deformation Permanent deformation (plasticity) is mainly accommodated in metallic systems by the movement of linear defects denoted as dislocations. Such dislocations are elastic singularities that interact with local stress fields coming from internal sources (such as other dislocations or defects) and external solicitations. Therefore, predicting dislocation evolution relates to the knowledge of the materials deformation pathways. As such, state-of-the-art plasticity models at the mesoscale solve for the evolution of a dislocation ensemble responding upon external loading. These models, termed as dislocation dynamics (DD) methods, have been very successful reproducing physical trends and computing parameters for larger scale models at large strain rates, where the deformation is mechanically overdriven. However, these models are not actually dynamical, just drive the system to the closest elastic energy minimum, and hence, they cannot reproduce thermally activated processes dominating a large range of strain rates. Moreover, systems evolve in a free energy landscape, with energetic and entropic components, although current DD models systematically neglect entropic contributions.This proposal intends to overcome these critical limitations adding missing thermal effects in current mesoscale DD models, including also entropic contributions in the description of the free energy landscape. These developments will significantly impact the field of dislocation-mediated plasticity, potentially modifying the predicted deformation pathways (to better match experimental observations), hardening and embrittlement processes in diverse applications. Team LeadersEnrique Martinez Saez Mechanical Engineering College of Engineering, Computing & Applied Sciences F, 2076 Using Whiptail Lizards to Understand the Integration of Environmental and Host Genetic Effects on Host-Associated Microbiota Animals, including humans, harbor large numbers of different microbes on and in their bodies – so called host-associated microbiota. Recently, scientists have begun to realize that host-associated microbiota are important determinants of host health. Microbes in an animal’s gut, for instance, impact digestion and can even help to determine whether the animal is lean or obese. Meanwhile, microbes on an animal’s skin can influence everything from wound healing to susceptibility to cutaneous disease. Despite the importance of host-associated microbiota to host health, there is a surprising amount of variation in the microbiota on one host relative to another. How do these differences emerge? More specifically, are these differences a result of nature (i.e., host genetics) or nurture (i.e., host environment)? Because most animals are genetically unique, it can be hard to determine whether inter-individual differences in host-associated microbiota are a result of host genetics, environment or both. In humans, the nature/nurture dichotomy is sometimes studied using twins. But even with twins, there are only two genetically identical individuals that can be compared. In whiptail lizards, however, there are entire populations of genetically identical clones. What’s more, these clones are closely related to other, sexually reproducing whiptail lizard species where each individual lizard is genetically unique. By comparing inter-individual variation in host-associated microbiota across different environments in clonal lizard populations versus sexually reproducing lizard populations, it will be possible to assess the relative importance of both host genetics and environment on host-associated microbiota. Team LeadersSharon Bewick Biological Sciences Daniel Malagon Biological Sciences College of Science G,G, 2078 Viruses in peach pollen: A sticky situation Peaches and other fruit trees can be infected by damaging viruses. In the Southeast, the major viruses of peach are Prunus necrotic ringspot virus and prune dwarf virus. They are both transmitted from tree to tree through infected pollen. The goal of this project is to understand various aspects of this pathosystem. For example, how do bees and other pollinators affect transmission of these viruses? How are wild stone fruit trees (like wild cherry or cherry laurel) involved- do they serve as sources of virus inoculum near peach orchards? This research may involve field and greenhouse work, as well as molecular lab research. Team LeadersElizabeth Cieniewicz Plant and Environmental Sciences College of Agriculture, Forestry & Life Sciences A, 2092 Start With One: Designing and Prototyping Technologies for Persons with Disabilities Google's "Start with One, Invent for Many" process is one where a small team of designers is joined by a person with a disability or older adult (referred to as a co-designer) to design an impactful technology intended to make a meaningful difference on the life of this disabled or elderly co-designer. In this creative inquiry, students will learn about accessibility and will use Google's "Start with One" process to explore the design of technologies to support the needs of persons with disabilities and older adults. Students will design technologies that may focus on personal mobility, health, wellness, or other topics using a user-centered design framework intended to guide the research process.

Students perform field and lab research and will interact with researchers, extension specialists, stakeholders, and other students. Through this project, we expect these students will (i) increase their knowledge of global agricultural challenges, (ii) realize the value of extension programs and stakeholder-driven research, (iii) gain experience in problem identification, (iv) acquire technical, professional and leadership skills, and use them in their future careers, and (v) improve their perception of careers in food and agricultural sciences Team LeadersJuan Carlos Melgar Jimenez Plant and Environmental Sciences Vidya Suseela Plant and Environmental Sciences Ksenija Gasic Plant and Environmental Sciences Guido Schnabel Plant and Environmental Sciences Dara Park Plant and Environmental Sciences Sarah White Plant and Environmental Sciences Sruthi Kutty Plant and Environmental Sciences College of Agriculture, Forestry & Life Sciences A,A,A,A,A,A,A, 2098 Immediate Responses of Bats to Prescribed Fire This project is focused on determining whether bats are attracted to sites they have received a prescribed fire or whether they avoid them. If they are attracted or avoid these sites, is it because of a change in their insect prey base or a change in the forest structure? To answer these questions, the students will work with a graduate student to place bat detectors in areas before and after they are burned and in control sites. They will also place insect traps in these same sites and measure the vegetation structure. Students will have an opportunity to learn about prescribed fire, bat behavior, identify bats from their echolocation calls, count insects, measure vegetation, and analyze the data. Data collection will occur on the Clemson Experimental Forest and the Sumter National Forest near Mountain Rest, SC. Team LeadersShari Rodriguez Forestry and Environmental Conservation Susan C Loeb Forestry and Environmental Conservation College of Agriculture, Forestry & Life Sciences A,A, 2102 Immune responses profiling through antibody detection and immunosequencing Exogenous pathogens or nucleic acids that codes for a functional molecule can elicit innate and adaptive immune responses. The adaptive immune response is specific to each stimulus and usually starts after 6-8 days after infection or administration. The adaptive immune response involves two types of white blood cells: T cells and B cells. This project explores the feasibility of profiling immune response through measuring total antibody, neutralizing antibody, and T-cell receptor profiling. Direct measurement of total antibody and neutralizing antibody reflects the overall antibody mediated defense mechanism. T-cell receptor profiling will provide a snapshot of the T-cell immune repertoire. For a given pathogen and new medical intervention, immune response profiling will provide critical information on how the body immune system reacts to foreign pathogens or therapeutic methods. This will allow rapid design of the antibody therapy and cell therapy in response to extant and emerging pathogens.

It will focus on understanding the factors that go into the appearance of fentanyl in other illegal drugs by applying basic economic and industrial engineering principles. By building an appropriate model of the fentanyl supply chain, the project will seek to understand the effectiveness of supply-side interventions (e.g., disrupting the flow of fentanyl into an area) and demand-side interventions (e.g., decreasing demand for illegal drugs). Data will be collected about fentanyl and opioid use during the pandemic and our models will be validated by understanding the impact of the pandemic on the fentanyl supply chain. Team LeadersThomas Sharkey Industrial Engineering College of Engineering, Computing & Applied Sciences F, 2107 Decision-Support Platforms for Robotic-Assisted Surgery Clinical training is essential to enhancing access to robotic-assisted surgery. The purpose of this study is to use artificial intelligence techniques to comprehend, quantify, and develop a decision-support platform for improving training efficacy. This goal will be accomplished in three stages: (a) integrating multiple wearable sensors to track learning outcomes; (b) developing machine-learning-based recommendation systems for training tasks; (c) analyzing performance improvement. Students will collaborate with human-factor engineers, data scientists, and clinicians to develop a platform to support surgical outcomes in South Carolina. Team LeadersQi Luo Industrial Engineering Jackie Cha Industrial Engineering College of Engineering, Computing & Applied Sciences F,F, 2118 Trogossitidae (Bark-gnawing Beetles) of South Carolina Members of the beetle family Trogossitidae (Bark-gnawing Beetles) are generally predacious on wood-boring beetles, including economically important bark beetles (Scolytinae). One invasive species, the Cadelle (Tenebroides mauritanicus) is an economically important pest of stored grain. Members of the family are poorly known in South Carolina. About 20 species are known or suspected to be in the state, but a firm species list, how to tell them apart, and where and when they are found throughout the state are all unknown. The presence of undescribed species or new invasive species is also unknown. Working with historical specimens (some nearly 100 years old) and newly collected specimens from a recent state-wide bark beetle survey, team members will curate and identify all South Carolina trogossitids in the Clemson University Arthropod Museum, approximately 1000 specimens. An illustrated key to identification will be made. For each species a state-wide specimen-level map will be produced and habitus photographs using high-resolution focus-stacking equipment will be taken. The final product would represent the most comprehensive view of trogossitids in eastern North America. Team LeadersMichael Ferro Plant and Environmental Sciences Michael Caterino Plant and Environmental Sciences College of Agriculture, Forestry & Life Sciences A,A, 2110 Design, Development, and Validation of Molecular Techniques for Infectious Disease Diagnostic Testing Sensitive detection and identification of pathogens is critical for effective patient treatment and pandemic prevention. Early identification requires quick testing for a pathogen of interest in a multitude of potential high-risk sites. This project will focus on the development of panels that will be suited for clinical diagnostics of common viruses. Panel screening of common circulating viruses with similar symptom onsets can be rapidly adopted for surveillance purposes. In addition, we will further develop point of care diagnostics for the viruses to address the issues on health care disparity and inequalities. This will benefit rural places where health care and lab facilities are unavailable. With the ready to implement and easy to apply test kit and devices, we will ensure the underprivileged areas are covered for pathogen surveillance and ultimately to prevent future outbreak.

Team LeadersClaire Textor Psychology Jeremy Lopez Rui Zhang Beau Schelble School of Computing College of Behavioral, Social & Health Sciences C,O,O,F, 2117 The YORKTOWN Project: Civic Engagement through Creative Inquiry This civic engagement project will address a "local" problem involving the Charleston-based Patriots Point Naval & Maritime Museum, which is one of the state's most popular tourist attractions, the centerpiece of which is the USS YORKTOWN.Commissioned on April 15, 1943, the USS YORKTOWN was the tenth aircraft carrier to serve in the United States Navy. The historic ship saw action in WWII, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. The YORKTOWN was decommissioned in 1970 is now part of the museum. One of the museum's goals is to educate current and future generations about America's history, and one of the ways it does this is through oral history interviews. These interviews have become especially important to the ship's story since many of the war-time sailors have since passed away. Currently, the videos can range from 30 minutes to 75 minutes in duration, which is problematic according to research that suggests long duration videos rarely get much attention. The Patriot Point Museum's leadership wants to reduce the duration of these videos, thereby making them more accessible and engaging. However, there is a problem: the museum lacks the capacity to undertake this project efficiently. We believe that a Creative Inquiry project can solve this problem and thereby serve the museum and honor the history of the YORKTOWN and its sailors. Furthermore, students in this project will also benefit from this project rooted in civic participation, which is important for personal growth and identity formation1 as they engage in a purpose beyond the pursuit of individual gain.Depending on the interest and protocol of the Patriot's Point Museum, we may extend this two-semester project by one or two additional semesters. During this time, we would explore how to promote the museum via social media and possibly create standards-based online activities. Team LeadersRyan Visser Education and Human Development Melinda Spearman Teaching and Learning College of Education E,E, 2129 Development of sensors for detection of pollutants in natural resources from developing countries Students will participate in interdisciplinary teams to work on various aspects of developing a grassroots environmental surveillance program for and with vulnerable communities. Students will be introduced to a water pollution problem a specific community faces and will have the opportunity to engage with scholars and community members to develop contextual proficiency and empathy for underserved communities. Projects can involve different research approaches depending on the disciplinary makeup of the team. For example, this CI may entail STEM components, such as developing electrochemical sensors for monitoring pesticide residues in water, using data analytics to process sensors’ output, risk modeling, and developing mobile apps and other user interfaces to communicate water quality results. Projects can also have an education and social focus, including creating educational material for the use of sensors for water quality monitoring, workshops, interviews, and surveys to identify critical user needs and assets, etc. Team LeadersDavid Bahamon Pinzon Environmental Engineering and Earth Sciences Kelli McCourt Diana Vanegas Gamboa Environmental Engineering and Earth Sciences College of Engineering, Computing & Applied Sciences F,O,F, 2156 VR for Research Purpose: In this CI project, students will explore developing and using virtual reality for conducting human-centered computing research.

Team LeadersDan Li Industrial Engineering College of Engineering, Computing & Applied Sciences F, 2162 Multi-catalysis: Accelerated synthesis of valuable chiral molecules Access of valuable chiral molecules such as various therapeutic drugs, materials, and synthetic building blocks has been achieved through multiple-step chemical transformations. However, there is a need to improve the synthetic efficiency of these multiple-step processes since they often require isolation after each step and overall time to produce the final target is lengthy. To address these challenges, this project aims to develop a new multi-catalytic method that will enable the rapid synthesis of chiral molecules from simple building blocks. Through this work, one will learn how to make organic molecules and design catalysts.
