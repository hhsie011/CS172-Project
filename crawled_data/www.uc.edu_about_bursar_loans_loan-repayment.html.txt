This period begins immediately after the borrower graduates or ceases to be enrolled as at least a half-time student. Billing for Loan Repayment Loan Repayment begins when the student graduates or ceases to be a half-time student and any eligible grace period ends. Specific details will be found in the promissory note. The total amount of the loan received under the program, plus accrued interest, and other related costs must be repaid. You will be billed for your Perkins, Health Professions, Nursing, Nurse Faculty, and Institutional loans by Heartland Campus Solutions ECSI (ECSI). You will not be billed for these loans on your university bill. If a borrower cannot repay their loan once they enter repayment, there may be other options available to them. For more information on repayment options, please visit ECSI's understanding loan benefits, repayment options, and forgiveness benefits web page. To receive a cancellation, forbearance or deferment borrowers must submit the proper form to ECSI. Failure to Repay a Loan A Default is when a borrower fails to make a scheduled payment when due or to submit proper documentation of deferment, cancellation, or forbearance. When this occurs the university may declare their loan to be in default and accelerate the loan. Loan Rehabilitation may be available to defaulted loan borrowers. Eligible borrowers must request rehabilitation. Loan rehabilitation is achieved by making 9 consecutive, on-time monthly payments on a defaulted loan. After successfully completing 9 consecutive payments, the borrower will again be eligible for all remaining benefits from the original promissory note. The default will be removed from the borrower's credit bureau report.
