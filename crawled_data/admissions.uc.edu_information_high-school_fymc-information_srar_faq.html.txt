The Self-Reported Academic Record (SRAR) is a tool that allows applicants to self-report their courses, grades, senior schedule, test scores (if applicable), and other academic information. Who is encouraged to complete the SRAR and where can it be accessed? First-year students attending high school in the US are highly encouraged to complete the SRAR and will gain access to their UC SRAR link via their Applicant Status page upon submission of their application. What items are needed to complete the SRAR? You should have an unofficial copy of your high school transcript to use as a reference while you create your SRAR. All courses and grades must be entered exactly as listed on the transcript. If I am applying for the fall 2021 semester and I submit my SRAR, do you also need my high school transcript? For the fall 2021 semester, applicants are required to submit an official high school transcript as part of their complete application file. The SRAR is optional but highly encouraged for fall 2021 but will not replace an official high school transcript. What if I am unable to submit the SRAR? Contact the UC Office of Admission at admissions@uc.edu or 513-556-1100.
