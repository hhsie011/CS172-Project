Due to the federal sources and reporting standards, these costs are a historical snapshot based on the 2019-20 academic year. In most cases, this will not reflect your actual costs. Rather, it is intended to give you a sense of the overall costs of attending Georgia Tech during that timeframe and how total costs are calculated.
