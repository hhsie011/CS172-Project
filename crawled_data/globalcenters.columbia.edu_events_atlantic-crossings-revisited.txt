Inspired by the seminal work of Daniel T. Rodgers, Atlantic Crossings: Social Policy in a Progressive Age (2000), the event will leverage the unique relationship between Columbia University and partner institutions in Paris to explore contemporary examples of how urban and social policies have traversed the Atlantic in both directions to shape our increasingly connected regions. We will hold three panels: (1) Urban policy traditions and quests for innovation, (2) Contemporary governance strategies to foster inclusive growth, and (3) Discretionary expertise and reformulations from below. Each panelist will prepare a short presentation about their work, followed by a moderated group discussion. The format will be intimate and informal, meant to encourage genuine discussion and meaningful collaboration. This event aims to start a series of workshops to strengthen the links between scholars, policymakers, and elected officials on either side of the Atlantic which will help ensure policy solutions can be properly situated historically, translated, adapted, and implemented for the good of all.
