About The Academic Consortium for the 21st Century (AC21) was established on June 24, 2002 at the International Forum hosted by Nagoya University, Japan, as an international network comprised of educational, research and industrial organizations throughout the world. Consisting of 15 institutions, the AC21 seeks to promote the cooperation in education and research bridging between different societies in the world to share wisdom and knowledge on different cultures necessary for co-existence beyond national and regional boundaries. The AC21 Special Project Fund was created in order to bring together members of AC21 Universities, encouraging and introducing new research opportunities, exchange, and networking for academics. Read More about Previously Funded Proposals Read more Purpose Special Project Fund was created in order to promote the development of research and educational exchange between AC21 members by providing seed funding for a variety of collaborative research projects and activities. Although research collaboration between AC21 members is important, this fund is not intended to support particular or individual research projects. It is awarded to projects that include as many participants as possible. For example, a symposium jointly held by three or more institutions, featuring speakers from these institutions, and open to all AC21 members, as well as to the general public, will serve our goal of internationalization and cooperation between members more effectively compared to simple research projects conducted by one or two individuals per institution. Project Examples Forum for graduate students Small international forums Mini workshops Joint mini-symposia related to certain research areas Joint research between small groups of researchers Seed funds for schooling projects Seed funds for startup long-term research projects or centers Eligibility Applicants must be NC State faculty members or members of an eligible AC21 member institution Anticipated Funding Amount Up to $15,000 per project will be awarded Application Period Call for proposals: October 1, 2021 Deadline for submissions: December 15, 2021 View the full RFP In order to avoid confusion or multiple submissions for any project involving NC State, a designated project group leader needs to submit a complete set of application materials to ncstateglobal@ncsu.edu.
