This multi-year, multi-phased project provides FSU researchers and administrators with comprehensive tools to support the administration of research within one integrated system. The software includes electronic proposal development and routing as well as system-to-system proposal submission, where available by sponsor. It also provides tools for the development and management of ACUC and IRB protocols and for the management of subcontracts, contract negotiations, and export controls. There are five modules included as part of this project - ACUC, IRB, Grants, Agreements and Export Control. CAMS is live. Visit cams-project.fsu.edu to learn more about the system and how to access training.
