The Early Decision Commitment We offer Early Decision as an opportunity for students who are ready to commit and would like early notification of their admission status. If you choose to apply to Brown under Early Decision, we ask that you not submit an application to another institution under another early decision, single-choice early action or restrictive early action plan. If you are admitted under our Early Decision plan, you will be required to withdraw all pending applications—including those you may have already submitted to regular, rolling or (open) early action programs. Please do not assume that your admission chances are improved by applying under the Early Decision plan. The Board of Admission makes the same decisions under Early Decision that it would under the Regular Decision plan. Application and Decision Dates Under Early Decision, prospective students apply by November 1 (11:59 p.m. applicant's local time) and receive a decision by mid-December. Standardized Tests For first-year applicants in the 2022-2023 admission cycle, Brown has extended our test optional policy. This change is for the 2022-2023 academic year only. More updates and information can be found on our Standardized Tests webpage. Admission Decisions Once you have submitted your Common Application, you will receive access to your Brown Applicant Portal from us on a rolling basis. Under Brown's Early Decision plan, there are three possible outcomes: Your application is accepted: You must withdraw all applications to other colleges. Your place in Brown's first-year class is secure, pending satisfactory completion of your senior year. A final decision on your application is deferred: Your credentials will be revisited within the context of the Regular Decision pool of applicants. Your application is denied: If you are denied admission under Early Decision, you may not reapply for admission under the Regular Decision plan during the same year. Start Your Application Applications to Brown are submitted online via the Common Application. Learn how to apply and start your application.
