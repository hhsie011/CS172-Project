Faculty offer electives that reflect their own interests and often integrate elements of their own research projects. Below we group these interests under five broad headings. We do not use these headings to imply that these areas are independent of each other. As you will see through the descriptions of faculty interests and recent research, there is increasing understanding of the interrelationship between these topics. We offer a formal specialization in one of these areas--Historic Preservation. Social and Economic Equity Environmental Planning Land Use, Transportation and Infrastructure Urban Design and Development Historic Preservation 1. SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC EQUITY Faculty contacts: Elizabeth Mueller, Michael Oden, Miriam Solis, Bj√∏rn Sletto and Patricia Wilson. Elective courses and research under the broad heading of social and economic equity offer students a theoretical and practical understanding of the challenges and opportunities facing communities as a result of changing economic and environmental conditions and the role that planners, as well as non-governmental and community organizations, can play in responding to these challenges. While the challenges we face are longstanding, our understanding of how we as planners can shape solutions, and partner with others, is evolving. Practitioners will need to understand the interconnections between economic, social and environmental aspects of cities and communities to devise integrated, creative solutions. Faculty offering electives and practicum courses under this heading do work in both the US context and in other countries--particularly in Latin America. By focusing on electives and practicum courses that emphasize social and economic equity, students can develop expertise in a number of related areas including: Historical context and current debates regarding the challenges and opportunities facing local communities and local responses to economic, social and environmental change; Strategies for working with governments, communities (at different scales) and private sector actors on integrated strategies for goal setting, planning and implementation; Research methods and analytic techniques for documenting and evaluating the structure, performance and potential of regional or local economies; Techniques used in the design, implementation and evaluation of development projects in the United States and in international contexts; Organizational skills including facilitation, team building, conflict resolution, and participatory planning. About the faculty in this focus area Elizabeth Mueller teaches courses on affordable housing policy, community development, and urban politics, as well as qualitative research methods. Her research focuses on social and political inclusion in cities, how city planning and development politics shape the quality of life and opportunities available to historically vulnerable residents and communities. Her current work focuses on these topics through investigations of tensions between the goals and policies of local planning agencies and local housing agencies, as seen in current thinking about strategies for building sustainable cities. Professor Mueller and her students' work is described on the Texas Housing Lab page. Recent projects and practicum courses include Creating Inclusive Corridors: Austin's Airport Boulevard, development of the Corridor Housing Preservation Tool, the Green and Inclusive Corridors practicum, and Coming Home: The benefits of housing choices for low-wage commuters. Her co-authored 2011 Journal of Urbanism article, "Sustainability and Vulnerabliity: Integrating equity into plans for central city redevelopment," won the 2012 UT Coop Prize for Best Research Paper. She was advisor to the first place winning School of Architecture team in US Department of Housing and Urban Affairs' Innovation in Affordable Housing competition. Michael Oden's teaching and research areas include local and regional economic development, regional growth dynamics and regional governance challenges. While serving as Associate Dean and Program Director, he is teaching a core CRP course, Financing Public Services. He intends to return to teaching his elective course, Sustainable Urban Economic Development in Spring 2017. Professor Oden's current research interests include the development of a comprehensive evaluation tool for alternative land use, transportation and housing affordability models; the potential of environmental industry growth for regional and local economic development strategies, and the role of the artistic and cultural industries in urban economies. Recent research projects and publications include: the Sustainable Places Project, the article "Better is Better than More," co-authored with Architecture Professor Michael Benedikt, and his update of "Equity: the Awkward E" in colleague Steven Moore's edited volume, Pragmatic Sustainability. He also co-authored a report on the economics of historic preservation in Texas. Bj√∏rn Sletto's research focuses on indigenous land rights, environmental and social justice, and alternative planning approaches, both in the United States and Latin America. As the director of the Institute of Latin American Studies'(LILLAS) Research Initiative in Participatory Mapping, Bj√∏rn works closely with partner institutions in South America to further international scholarship on representational politics and social justice in vulnerable communities. He is also engaged with research on informality and community development in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, focusing on the role of critical pedagogy for insurgent planning in neoliberal contexts. Bj√∏rn teaches Geographic Information Systesm, environmental and social justice, public space theory, and seminars and studio courses focusing on Latin American planning and development. In his practicum course in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, his students work closely with community leaders, activist organizations and public officials to address environmental and social vulnerability in the informal settlement of Los Platanitos. Recent presentations on his work in Austin and Latin America include the east Austin environmental justice project, and mapping risk and vulnerability in Los Platanitos. For an overview of the work of practicum courses in Los Planatinos over time, take a look at the Ca√±ada project website. Patricia Wilson's research in sustainable community development focuses on individual and social transformation through civic engagement and collaborative action. She uses the methods of appreciative inquiry, social narrative, and participatory action research, and draws upon the theories of communicative action, dialogue and deliberation, and holistic emergent systems. She directs an ongoing action research project on sustainable community development. Dr. Wilson teaches participatory planning and international sustainable social development, along with a freshman signature class on participatory democracy. Recent practicum courses and writing include Mexcio Practicum: participatory action research in the Guadalupe dam watershed, a new course on tactical urbanism, and her recent Planning Forum article, "The Naked Practitioner: Participatory Community Development in Peri-Urban Mexico." 2. ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING Faculty Contacts: Katherine Lieberknecht, Robert Paterson, Miriam Solis, and Bj√∏rn Sletto. Elective courses and research under the broad heading of environmental planning provides students with a grounding in the theoretical and methodological foundations, legal/policy aspects, social justice dimensions, and planning and management techniques used to address some of the most pressing environmental issues facing communities and regions today. Environmental planners play central roles in a diversity of issues that range in scale, including: remediation of individual brownfield sites; city-wide park planning; regional air and water pollution planning; habitat conservation planning; planning for climate change adaptation and mitigation for cities and regions; avoiding and mitigating health impacts from environmental contaminants; and planning for socially and ecologically just communities, cities and regions. Through electives and practicum courses, students trained in this specialization develop a variety of theoretical, organizational and technical skills for effectively addressing the complexity of environmental issues facing communities today. These skills include: identifying and coordinating expertise in scientific and technical areas; developing frameworks for environmental planning related policies; working with communities within different social and cultural contexts; and integrating justice or ethical considerations into environmental planning strategies. About the faculty in this focus area Katherine Lieberknecht's research areas include urban water resources planning, metropolitan-scaled green infrastructure planning, and urban resilience planning. She currently teaches courses on urban agriculture systems, water resources planning, urban ecology, and sustainable land use planning.

LAND USE, TRANSPORTATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE Faculty contacts: Alex Karner, Katherine Lieberknecht, Robert Paterson, Gian-Claudia Sciara, Ming Zhang The electives and practicum courses under the broad heading of land use, transportation and intrastructure are designed to provide students with an understanding of theories, methods and techniques for integrated land use, transportation and infrastructure planning and policy-making. Students are encouraged to approach these issues from a critical perspective and to consider questions such as: What are the critical land use, transportation and infrastructure issues facing our communities? What sorts of goals do conventional methods or analysis and analytic techniques promote? Where and how should these methods and techniques be improved? What are the implications -- social, economic, environmental -- of our choices about land use, transportation, and infrastructure policies and investments? Students focusing on these topics have found jobs with cities, counties, metropolitan planning organizations, transit agencies, non-profit organizations, and private consultants. About the faculty in this focus area Alex Karner's work aims to quantify the social equity, environmental, and public health implications of transportation projects and plans by using emerging data sources and developing new, open source methods. A deep commitment to practice undergirds his research and teaching; he routinely collaborates with community members, non-profit organizations and public interest law firms to identify pressing research needs and improve conditions in communities experiencing transportation disadvantage. Some of his recent projects include analyzing realtime transit arrival data to understand disparities in service provision across metropolitan regions in the United States, developing high resolution indicators of public transit accessibility based on public census data and open source approaches, and tying underperformance on affordable housing provision to indicators of poor transportation performance. Katherine Lieberknecht's research areas include urban water resources planning, metropolitan-scaled green infrastructure planning, and urban resilience planning. She currently teaches courses on urban agriculture systems, water resources planning, urban ecology, and sustainable land use planning. Dr. Lieberknecht's recent research projects include the Texas Metro Observatory, an analysis of metropolitan water conservation, and a national survey of municipal green infrastructure initiatives. Dr. Lieberknecht is also a member of the faculty leadership team of Planet Texas 2050, a UT Austin grand challenge research initiative. In 2020-2021, Dr. Lieberknecht and Dr. Mueller will be co-teaching a practicum focused the design of social and ecological infrastructure needed to support equitable and successful voluntary coastal relocation programs.

URBAN DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT Faculty Contact: Dean Almy, Junfeng Jiao, Ming Zhang, Michael Holleran, Jake Wegmann The land development and urban design focus area provides students with specialized training and prepares them to become capable of engaging effectively with design professionals (such as architects and landscape designers), developers, and institutions around issues of real estate development, urban form and design. Students will develop an understanding of how land development policies and urban design interventions can alter the human built environment. Students in this specialization learn to delineate the legal, regulatory, economic, and social context within which real estate development and physical design can occur. Students will also be exposed to concepts and approaches used by designers in the processes of place making, and will learn to develop plans and policies that support good land development and urban design. Study of land development and urban design is especially well suited for two types of students: Those who are interested in public sector employment with regard to the policy and practice of the land development regulatory review process; urban design review and design guideline development and implementation process. Those who are interested in private sector development of land with regard to the practice of the real estate marketing and development process; urban design master planning process. Most of the built environment results from the activities of the public and private sectors with regard to land development and urban design, and this specialization prepares the graduate to participate professionally in those activities. About the faculty in this focus area Dean Almy is the Director of the Graduate Program in Urban Design and The Texas Urban Futures Laboratory. He is also Chair of the City of Austin‚Äôs Design Commission and the Texas Society of Architects, Urban Design Committee.

Students are expected to take four preservation courses (see below), and to complete a preservation studio and a PR or thesis on a preservation topic. Through the classes, students are exposed to social, political, environmental and economic issues in the identification and interpretation of cultural resources; historic preservation as an engine of economic and community development (heritage tourism, Main Street programs, incentives for adaptive use and housing rehabilitation); the regulatory and legal environment at the federal, state and local levels; and policy and design issues involved with integration of new development within existing built contexts. Coursework is supported by the rich stock of diverse cultural resources found in Texas. Students also have numerous opportunities to engage in research or coursework in international settings, as exemplified by recent projects in Mexico, Chile, Berlin, and London. Other resources include the School's significant architectural and planning documents collection, the Architectural Conservation Laboratory and Materials Laboratory, and collaborations with the National Parks Service, the State Historic Preservation Office, and the City of Austin. Recent PRs and theses have studied: the National Register's treatment of resources less than 50 years old; implementation of the new Investment Tax Credit for historic rehabilitation in Texas; Evaluation of the LEED/NC standards as applied to historic neighborhoods; Cultural Landscape Inventories for the LBJ National Historical Site, Heritage Planning for the Route of the Liberator Sim√≥n Bolivar. Methods requirements: Students in this specialization are required to take the following methods courses: the Quantitative/Analytic methods sequence (unless placing out); Public Economics and Finance; and either Participatory Planning/Dispute Resolution or GIS/Viscom. Required Courses for Historic Preservation Specialization: CRP 392C/ ARC 386M Preservation History and Theory (Holleran, Fall) CRP 389C/ARC 386M Preservation Planning and Practice (Holleran, Fall) CRP 381 Preservation Law (Rawlins, Spring) CRP 398R or CRP 698A/B PR or Thesis (see below) CRP 696 Preservation Studio (see below) (Note that two required courses are scheduled in Fall semester, and thus CRP/HP specialization will ordinarily require taking one of them in Fall of year 1) and at least one of: National Register Documentation (Smith, Fall) Sustainable Preservation (Holleran, Spring) U.S. Cultural Landscapes (Lopez) (other special topics courses from time to time) Professional Report or Thesis Requirement: CRP 398R Professional Report or CRP 698A/698B-Thesis. The topic of the Professional Report or Thesis must be approved by CRP/HP faculty and should focus on a preservation planning related issue. Preservation Studio requirement: The CRP Practicum/Studio requirement must be met with a Preservation Studio. A Preservation Studio will be offered each semester with a CRP cross-listing, or a CRP studio will be available with preservation content. About the faculty in this specialization Michael Holleran is interested in historic preservation, the history of urban design & development, vernacular landscapes, and water history. He teaches Preservation Planning/Practice and Preservation History and Theory. Recent practicum courses and research projects include the Cedar Pass Developed Area cultural landscape studio, Austin Historical Survey Wiki, the Leander Texas ‚ÄòPlacemaking‚Äô Historical Assets Inventory, and the Fifth Street Project. Sarah Lopez is a built environment historian, as well as a migration scholar. Lopez' research focuses on the impact of migrant remittances‚Äîdollars earned in the U.S. and sent to families and communities in Mexico‚Äîon the architecture and landscape of rural Mexico and urban USA. By approaching architectural history within the context of migration, Lopez examines multiple sites across international borders, arguing that we must examine the spatial and built environment histories of discrete places simultaneously. Broadly speaking, she teaches about U.S. cultural landscapes, the interface between migration, architecture, and cities, the use of interdisciplinary methods to study space and society, and world architectural history. She also teaches about how to incorporate ethnographic methods into built environment research. Recent practicum courses and research projects include States of Incarceration and the Remittance Landscape.
