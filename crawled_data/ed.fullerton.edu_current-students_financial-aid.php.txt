FINANCIAL AID FREE APPLICATION FOR FEDERAL STUDENT AID (FAFSA) The FAFSA application is free and will tell you whether or not you are eligible for various loans and grants at the federal and state levels. There are many awards that you will not qualify for if you do not complete the FAFSA, so students are encouraged to apply. Submitting the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or California Dream Act Application (CDA) to CSUF by the priority filing date is the single most important step you can take each year towards gaining financial aid. CSUF FINANCIAL AID The CSUF Financial Aid website provides general assistant with a variety of programs funded by federal and state grants, student loans, student employment opportunities, as well as scholarships provided by the university and private sources. The website has been designed to help you navigate the financial aid process and to learn important information about financial aid programs.

These students are exempt from non-resident tuition and can apply for state aid. LOAN FORGIVENESS AND CANCELLATION PROGRAMS Teacher Loan Forgiveness Program Direct Loans and Federal Stafford Loan Forgiveness Programs for teachers may forgive $5000-$17500 in student loans for teachers in certain specialties. Teachers must complete 5 consecutive full-time teaching years in low-income schools and meet other requirements. FEDERAL PERKINS LOAN Federal Perkins Loans may cancel up to 100% of your loan if you serve full-time in a public or nonprofit elementary or secondary school system that qualifies as a “high-need” institution. PUBLIC SERVICE LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAM (PSLF) The PSLF Program forgives the remaining balance of your Direct Loans after you have made 120 qualifying monthly payments under a qualifying repayment plan while working full-time for a qualifying employer. TEMPORARY EXPANDED PUBLIC SERVICE LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAM (TEPSLF) If your PSLF application was denied because some or all of your payments were not made on a qualifying repayment plan for PSLF, you may be able to receive loan forgiveness under this temporary opportunity.
