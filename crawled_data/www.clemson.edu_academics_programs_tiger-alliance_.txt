Us Clemson Home Academics Programs Current: Tiger Alliance Welcome to the Clemson Tiger Alliance Program Tiger Alliance (TA) is a college access program at Clemson University designed to illuminate pathways to college, bridge the opportunity gap and create a college-going culture for high school men in the Upstate of South Carolina. While Tiger Alliance is open to any young man who seeks to realize his goal of attending college, we specifically target Black and Latino students. Program Details “ “I am thankful for everything Tiger Alliance has done for me and continues to do. As a first-generation American and the first person in my family to go to college, it means a lot to me!” Christian Gomez senior Easley High School “ “I am truly thankful for all the information Tiger Alliance taught me. I have learned a lot from the program, and it has really helped me reach my main goal, which is college.” Austin Cordell senior Carolina High School “ “I met many of my close friends and mentors through the program. As a first-generation college student, I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do after high school. Tiger Alliance helped me find the college that was best suited for me.” Kenny Phan Alumni, ta ambassador Clemson University Upcoming Events Interested in joining Tiger Alliance? Become a Member!
