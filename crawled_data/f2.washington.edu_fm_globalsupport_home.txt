This site is designed to provide easily accessible information and resources for coordinating the many logistics involved with developing and implementing global activities and projects. Planning Your Activity Abroad Whether you are initiating or expanding a program in another country, conducting a long-term research project abroad, or hiring foreign nationals to perform work at the University, there is considerable planning and organization required that involves unfamiliar laws, regulations, taxes and more. When developing a proposal and implementation process for these global activities, you must consider a range of factors beyond those associated with the same work conducted domestically. Operational considerations for global activities may include: Determination of what type of legal registration (and/or registration with other host country authorities) is required Collaboration agreements or Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with local institutions Compliance with local employment and contractor services laws Effects of currency exchange rates on program budgets Ensuring the health, safety, and security of participants Ensuring availability of funds in-country for local expenses Purchasing logistics Visa and work permit requirements in-country for participants Technology infrastructure in host country to support the educational activities Export control laws International Project Guidance The International Projects Start-Up Guide is a resource for faculty and staff who are planning and implementing international sponsored projects. The guide provides information on: Issues that may impact how an international project is budgeted UW policies and guidelines related to international work Checklists, charts and contracts to use in planning, budgeting and implementing projects All faculty and staff with current global activities or considering new global ventures are advised to familiarize themselves with the contents of the International Projects Administrative Guide.
