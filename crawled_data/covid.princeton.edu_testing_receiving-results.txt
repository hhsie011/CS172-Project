If you do receive a positive result, you will receive an email with further instructions from Global and Community Health at UHS. You may not receive a phone call. Results are released periodically through the day, with the largest numbers being released at 9:00 a.m. and 7:30 p.m. Those with higher risk of on-campus transmissibility (students and some personnel) will receive a phone call and email from the UHS Global and Community Health team as soon as we receive notice of your positive results and are able. Students will also be provided guidance on isolation. Employees: make sure your phone number is correctly listed with the University through HR Self Service so that contact tracers can reach you if needed. Students should confirm that their phone number is correct through TigerHub. Affiliates and graduate dependents may contact covidtests@princeton.edu to update their phone number. If you test negative for COVID-19, the sample will display as "not detected" in the results tab of the web app or web portal. If you open the full results report in the web app or web portal, it will indicate that you have tested "negative." Turnaround Time We cannot guarantee turnaround times through the asymptomatic testing protocol. Please allow 3 business days after submitting a sample to inquire about "pending" test results. If you have a "pending" result associated with a sample in the results tab of the web app or web portal, you will receive a result. Please advise, during the week of May 23rd, results may take a bit longer than expected. We are unable to notify all individuals by phone if you have received a positive result. As a participant in the asymptomatic testing protocol, you are expected to check your own results regularly. “Pending” Results available The web app allows you to see whether you have a test that is pending, where you have registered and submitted a sample, but a result of that sample is not yet available. You can find these “pending” results under the “Results” tab on the bottom of the screen in the web app. If accessing results through the web portal, you will see the results tab on the left side of the screen when viewing in a web browser on a laptop or desktop computer. If viewing the web portal on a web browser on a mobile device, you'll find the results tab on the bottom of the page. Please allow at least 3 business days from when you submitted your sample before requesting follow-up on your results via covidtests@princeton.edu. Many individuals receive their results soon after emailing looking for them. If you are seeking results that are more than 14 days old, we will not be able to provide them. Please refer to your most recent test for results. If you are seeking results because you have developed symptoms, you will need to be in contact with your healthcare provider for further testing and treatment, if needed. For graduate and undergraduate students, you can contact UHS at (609) 258-3141. Employees should contact their primary care provider. Other Testing Considerations For more information on the contact tracing process, visit the UHS website. To request accommodations for medical or religious reasons, send email to covidtests@princeton.edu. For questions about accessibility, requesting accommodations or other concerns related to the asymptomatic testing protocol, please email covidtests@princeton.edu. Explanation of Results from Testing Web App Please note that due to the volume of samples we receive weekly, we will not be able to tell you why your specific test kit may have received one of the following results. Result Appearing in App Explanation of Result Action Needed, If Any Pending Sample has been registered, but results not yet available Please wait at least 3 business days before contacting COVIDtests@princeton.edu about your results Result Not Available If a sample does not receive a result in >14 days, a “pending” result will default to “Result not available.” May be due to: Sample does not arrive at Lab Kit scanned but no sample submitted Contamination detected at collection site and sample was destroyed Leakage in transit, discarded before reaching Lab Please submit another sample on your regular testing schedule. Inconclusive Click on “Inconclusive” result in web app to read the results report Please submit another sample on the next possible day.

Not Detected (Results report will read “Negative”) If your result was determined through pooled sampling, you will see more information about the pooling process in the results report. For more information about pooled sampling, please visit this CDC website. No action needed. Continue submitting samples as per your regular testing schedule. Positive See more information below. You will need to enter isolation. See more information below. No Listing for Sample If the sample you submitted to a drop box does not appear in the web app, it was not properly scanned before submitting. You will not receive a result from this sample. Please submit another sample on the next possible day.

If You Receive a Positive Result in the Web App If you receive a positive COVID result through the web app: If you are up to date on COVID vaccines and boosters, you will need to self-isolate for 5 days minimum (the day of your test is day 0), and will be required to wear a KN95 mask when around others for days 6-10. Do not remove your mask to eat or drink around others. If you are unvaccinated, isolation will be 10 days minimum. Click below for more detailed instructions based on your role at Princeton. Graduate and Undergraduate Students Right Now Please return to your local bedroom (whether that's in a dorm, apartment, or off-campus housing). A University staff member will be in touch with you about your isolation housing assignment, meals, and other isolation-related details. Please check your Princeton email regularly, make sure your cell phone is close by and that the ringer is on. Also, check to make sure your voicemail inbox is set up and not full, in case someone needs to leave you a message. If you do not hear from us in 2-3 hours, email isolationhelp@princeton.edu with the subject line "I'm isolating in my room" so that staff can easily see your email in their inbox. If you have a roommate, partner or significant other that shares a bedroom with you, ask them to stay elsewhere until the plans for your isolation have been completed. You may opt to isolate at your family home somewhere else other than the Princeton area but only if you are able to arrange private transport and not use public transportation to get there. If you return home, please email the address where you will be isolating to GCH at communityhealth@princeton.edu. Please click here for a fact sheet on isolation for students. Faculty, Staff, and Researchers Right Now If you receive your result while you are still at home, do not go to work. If you are at work, please let your supervisor know you will need to leave for a medically-supported absence, and head back home right away. You cannot be on campus during your isolation period. If you are at home, please also contact your supervisor as soon as possible to alert them that you will be on a medically-supported absence. If you will be taking public transportation to reach your home, make sure to double-mask and do not sit or stand within 6 feet of others. You should isolate away from people that you live with/household contacts if you have any If you live with someone who is not vaccinated and you cannot remain sequestered from them during your isolation period: your unvaccinated household contact will need to quarantine for 5 days following the day you clear isolation, and wear a KN95 mask for days 6-10. In the Next Few Days UHS will send an email to your supervisor confirming that you are on a medically-supported leave. If you are having symptoms, please contact your primary medical provider. Princeton’s Global and Community Health Team may contact you sometime over the next 72 hours, so please keep your cell phone on and with you during this time. Do not call Global and Community Health. Make sure to complete the Symptom Check you receive by email or text, as this may impact your release from isolation and return to campus. Ending Isolation and Returning to Work You will receive an email from Global and Community Health at UHS that you are clear to stop isolation. Do not come to campus until you receive this email. You will not need a negative test to return to work. You should not test again on campus for 90 days. Do not submit another test to the testing program during your exemption period. You do not need a confirmatory test if you received a positive result through the on-campus asymptomatic program. You will be marked as “compliant” for testing automatically; no action is needed from you. Contact Tracing Contact tracing practices have changed since the omicron variant of COVID became the dominant strain in the US. Therefore, we will not be contact tracing all those who receive a positive COVID test. Following guidance from the CDC and the NJ Department of Health, UHS is prioritizing contact tracing for populations that are at the highest risk of transmission on campus: students and service personnel. If contact tracers call, it will be a Princeton University number starting with (609) 258-. You are free to alert those with whom you have been in close contact in the past 3-5 days that you are positive for COVID. Your close contacts will not necessarily receive a phone call or an email that they have been identified as a close contact of someone who tested positive. Information for Your Close Contacts When sharing with a contact that you have tested positive, you can give them the following guidance: If they are fully vaccinated and have received a booster dose, they do not need to quarantine They should monitor how they are feeling for the next several days If they feel any symptoms that might be associated with COVID, they should be tested If they do not feel any symptoms, they should wait 3-5 days since the last time they were in contact with you and then consider getting tested During this time period, they should wear a face covering consistently inside, except when sleeping or eating. Maintain physical distance (6 feet or 2 meters) from others when eating, both while inside and outside until they have received a negative result. Please see this CDC site for more information on if you test positive: COVID-19 Quarantine and Isolation | CDC Please click here for a fact sheet on isolation for employees. Other Testing Participants Right Now You cannot be on campus or accessing campus buildings during your isolation period. If you live in on-campus housing, you may not enter other campus buildings during your isolation period. If you work on campus If you receive your result while you are still at home, do not come to campus If you receive your result when you are already at work on campus, please let your supervisor know you will need to leave for a medically-supported absence, and head back home right away. If you live in on-campus housing Remain in your home for your entire isolation period, do not enter other campus buildings If you are a graduate dependent who lives off-campus If you receive your result while you are still at home, do not come to campus If you receive your result while you are on campus, leave campus immediately and return to your home For all testing participants: if you will be taking public transportation to reach your home after receiving a positive result, make sure to double-mask and do not sit or stand within 6 feet of others. In the Next Few Days Regardless of whether you live on or off-campus, you should isolate away from people that you live with/household contacts if you have any If you live with someone who is not vaccinated and you cannot remain sequestered from them during your isolation period: your unvaccinated household contact will need to quarantine for 5 days following the day you clear isolation and wear a KN95 mask for days 6-10.
