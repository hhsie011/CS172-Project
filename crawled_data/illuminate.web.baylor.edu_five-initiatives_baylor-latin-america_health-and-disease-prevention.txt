Populations in both Texas and the Americas will be significantly impacted by addressing social determinants through community based partnerships with researchers in health-related disciplines, healthcare professionals, public health agencies, and non-governmental organizations. In collaboration with these groups, Baylor will work to assess environmental and health needs in populations, develop health promotion efforts, and advocate for health-related policies and resources in global and local settings. A focus on health will create an advantage for Baylor that is not reflected in other Latin American initiatives in peer institutions. Baylor’s legacy in aquatic science will be maximized to benefit health outcomes in Texas and abroad.
