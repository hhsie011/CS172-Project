During the Summer of 2019, we reached out to our alumnae/i to ask for news and updates, gathered departmental photos, and put together a team to help bring it all together. The last volume of The Occasional Classicist was published in 2007, so we are delighted to bring it back to life after so much growth and change has happened in the department. We look forward to hearing from more of our [email protected] community in the future and hope that our students, alumnae/i, and friends enjoy staying connected to the department. Special thanks to undergraduate student, Susan Tang ('23), and Professor Joe Pucci for their hard work helping The OC come to fruition! Interested in Submitting to The Occasional Classicist?
