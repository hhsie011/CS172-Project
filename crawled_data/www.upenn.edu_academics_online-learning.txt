Penn Online Learning Initiative In 2012, Penn launched its first Massive Open Online Courses and created an office dedicated to online learning. Initially called the Open Learning Initiative and later the Online Learning Initiative, OLI’s preliminary focus was producing MOOCs with Penn faculty and advising Penn leadership on online initiatives. Today, OLI’s mission is much broader and the initiative serves as a nexus for information about online learning across Penn. The University offers a variety of online educational opportunities including certificates, continuing education, micro-credentials, and degrees. Penn Online Learning Initiative Courses & Programs The Online Learning Initiative partners with all of Penn’s 12 schools to advance the development and delivery of online learning, creating flexible options for learners across the globe. Penn’s Online Learning Platform allows students to search for credit and non-credit experiences, and create a customized path no matter where they are learning from.
