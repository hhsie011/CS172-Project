Just like real space scientists, girls explore, observe, and investigate the Sun, Moon, and stars. Boy Scouts can learn about constellations, stars, and the planets as well as light pollution at our planetarium shows...or they can schedule a workshop offered in conjunction with the Louisville Astronomical Society to delve more deeply into the requirements of their astronomy badge. The planetarium is an out-of-this-world venue for a special group outing or a special event! We offer a unique facility for corporate events and business meetings.
