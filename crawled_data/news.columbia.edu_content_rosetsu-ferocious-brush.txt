Focusing on 60 of his most important paintings, Matthew McKelway, the Takeo and Itsuko Atsumi Professor of Japanese Art History at Columbia, and Khanh Trinh, curator of Japanese and Korean art at the Rietberg Museum in Zurich, trace his art from early work in the realist mode of his teacher Maruyama Okyo, to the haunting, visionary, and occasionally bizarre nature of his final masterpieces. Born into a family of low-ranking samurai, Rosetsu (1754-1799) is considered one of the most imaginative artists of early modern Japan, with screen paintings, scrolls, and albums depicting Zen eccentrics, raucous children, ethereal beauties, otherworldly landscapes, animals, and birds. 212-854-5573 [email protected] Genre Nonfiction Topic Arts Contact Us [email protected] Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University Â©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
