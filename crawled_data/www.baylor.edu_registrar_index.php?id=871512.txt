Skip to main content Skip to main navigation Office of the Registrar Menu Baylor>Registrar>Academic Services>Transcript Information>Additional Information Additional Information The Additional Information page is to provide helpful information regarding ordering your Official Transcript. Staff members at the Office of the Registrar are always available to answer your questions. Please call 254-710-1181 or email Registrar@baylor.edu for assistance. Requesters with Holds Transcripts will not be released to students who have Holds for the following reasons: Cashier Holds - Contact the Cashiers Office regarding outstanding balances owed to Baylor University. Loan Collection Holds - Contact Loan Collections regarding other obligations to include the Federal Perkins, Federal Nursing, and Baylor Institutional Loans. THECB Holds - Contact THECB regarding the College Access Loans (CAL) and B-On-Time Loans (BOT). Other Holds may prevent the release of a transcript. If you are a current student or a former student with BearWeb login access, you may view your holds through BearWeb (choose "Student Academic Services" - "Student Records" - "View Holds"). Please refer to Baylor University's policy Right to Withhold Transcripts and/or Block Registration. Contact the Office of the Registrar at (254) 710-1181 if additional information is needed regarding transcript holds. If you have a Loan Collection Hold on your account, you may submit the Official Transcript Request Form via mail, fax, or email. However, if you would like to request your transcript via the online method, you will need to contact Loan Collections for information on how to get your hold lifted. Pick-ups and In-Person Requests In-person requests can be made in the Office of the Registrar in the Clifton Robinson Tower during regular Transcript Office Hours: Monday-Friday 8:00am-4:30pm, Thursday 9:00am-4:30pm. The transcript limit is 10 per week, which can be printed while you wait or mailed to a third party. Sending Matching Forms or Other Attachments with Your Transcript If you are a current student, you may place your order through BearWeb by choosing the "eTranscript or Special Delivery (FedEx or Attachments)" option. If you are a former student, you will need to set up a Parchment account as a former student first. You can add an attachment (such as a transcript matching form) in Step 3 of the Parchment ordering process (the same step in which you will enter/confirm the recipient's address/email address). Please note that if your form requires input from our office (e.g., a degree verification), you will need to request a paper transcript rather than an electronic transcript. PDF eTranscripts will be sent automatically without our reviewing the attachments. If preferred, the attachment can also be submitted with the Official Transcript Request Form. Some centralized application services now accept electronic transcripts via Parchment and will not require an uploaded matching form. Instead, you will need to enter identification numbers when prompted during the Parchment ordering process, in order to match your transcript with your application. Here is a partial list of some of these services: ACCEPT ELECTRONIC TRANSCRIPTS FROM BAYLOR (will need to enter applicant ID#) AMCAS (will also need to enter transcript ID#) Centralized application services managed by Liaison International- NursingCAS, AACOMAS, VMCAS, PharmCAS, DICAS, PTCAS, etc. (For full list, see Liaison International) DO NOT CURRENTLY ACCEPT ELECTRONIC TRANSCRIPTS FROM BAYLOR (send mailed copy with PDF copy of matching form instead) LSAC TMDSAS Mailing Information Please allow up to 10 business days for postal delivery. International mailing may require more time for delivery. FedEx Mailing Transcripts can be mailed via FedEx by providing us with a FedEx account number. The account number must be provided in writing at the time the transcript is ordered, using any of our three ordering options (Current Student Online Ordering, Former Student Online Ordering, or the Print-and-Sign Request Form). FedEx orders will be sent Priority Overnight (no Saturday deliveries) domestically or International Priority internationally unless otherwise specified by the student at the time of ordering. FedEx requests received in our office after 3:00 pm will be processed the next business day. Please note that FedEx does not deliver to a PO Box. Do NOT schedule a pick-up with FedEx, as we have a drop box in our building.
