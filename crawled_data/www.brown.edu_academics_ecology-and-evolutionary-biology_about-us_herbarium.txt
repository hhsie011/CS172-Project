The collection includes around 100,000 plant specimens and is an important repository of Rhode Island and New England collections. We also have specimens from all 50 US state (plus the District of Columbia) and the collection is rich in western and southern North American plants including sets of historically valuable specimens from 19th and early 20th century western US expeditions. Among other important collections, the herbarium also includes a set of Charles Wright’s Cuban plants (1856-1867), Cyrus Pringles's plants of Mexico (1885-1909) and a unique and classic collection of Carex assembled by Stephen Olney. The Herbarium continues to be active and over the past few years we have added around 2,000 specimens to the collection. These include new collections made by faculty and students at Brown in addition to gifts from other herbaria.
