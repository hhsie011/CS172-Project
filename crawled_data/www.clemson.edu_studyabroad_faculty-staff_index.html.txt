Pursuant to these updated recommendations, the Pam Hendrix Center for Education Abroad will not be accepting proposals for new study abroad programs. If you are interested in setting up a Virtual+ program, please email abroad@clemson.edu. For additional updates on the status of travel, please see our Covid-19 Updates page. Clemson University strongly encourages its students to participate in study abroad programs as part of their overall academic experience. Study abroad serves as a vital part of a student’s academic, professional and personal growth. Faculty members play an essential role in encouraging and advising students to participate in study abroad. Faculty-directed programs are a particularly important means of encouraging our students to study abroad and of ensuring the academic quality and integrity of programming. During the 2016/17 academic year, 50% of Clemson study abroad students participated in a faculty-directed study abroad program.
