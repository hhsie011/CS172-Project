The annual candlelight vigil marking Walk the Walk Week offered a moment to reflect on the steps each member of the campus community can take to that end. In addition, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day was a University holiday for the first time, and many students, faculty and staff marked the occasion by participating in service projects. Later in the month, the campus paused taking part in an on-campus version of the March for Life. All the while, students reveled in the usual pastimes: athletics, snow games, and taking in a show.
