By facilitating access to translated measures we aim to encourage investigators to include non-English speaking participants in their studies. We hope to have an interactive library with contributions from the broader community of researchers and look forward to your comments and additions. We invite you to contribute translated measures that you have used in your research. If you are an author of a measure contained in the library and have corrections to any of the materials posted or wish for your measure to be removed, please let us know. Contact Jennifer Chavez (elcentro@miami.edu) to comment or to contribute to the library. The El Centro Measures Library is available to the research community for informational purposes only. If you intend to use any of the measures contained in the library, please contact the author or company directly to either obtain permission or purchase the measure if it is not in the public domain.
