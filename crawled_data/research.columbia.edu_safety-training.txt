Many activities that take place in the course of research, academia and/or clinical care require specialized instruction on how these activities can be conducted safely and with minimal exposure to workplace hazards. Every member of the University community engaged in laboratory operations is obligated to participate in the University’s safety training program. This obligation may be established by a regulatory agency, a condition of a grant, a University policy, a departmental requirement or as a combination of two or more of these mandates.
