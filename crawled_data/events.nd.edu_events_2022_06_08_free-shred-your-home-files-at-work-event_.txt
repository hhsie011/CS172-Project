A Shred-it truck will be parked in the parking lot of the Mason Support Center, which is located off of St. Joseph Drive behind the Notre Dame Federal Credit Union. The truck accepts paper only, so please be sure to remove any binders, binder clips or non-paper items before the event (staples and paper clips are acceptable). For the courtesy of others, we ask that you limit your shred material to no more than five file-size boxes. We also ask that you remain with your material until it is in the shred truck as Notre Dame cannot be responsible for papers left unattended. We will be happy to recycle your empty boxes after the event so feel free to leave these behind. Please contact Sarah Joswick, archivist for records management, at sjoswick@nd.edu or 574-631-4028 with any questions.
