It is at the center of cultivating and administering the broad range of Notre Dame programs, partnerships, and objectives that bring Notre Dame to the world, and the world to Notre Dame. The organization oversees the University’s robust study abroad enterprise, with more than 50 programs in which students can pursue coursework and research in virtually any academic discipline and in diverse regions around the world. NDI also supports and administers other opportunities for education abroad, including independent research, internships, and service learning. NDI oversees the University’s network of Global Gateways and Centers. These provide Notre Dame students and faculty with incredible opportunities to engage in research and collaborative projects both with University colleagues and other students, as well as with counterparts at other institutions. In addition, they provide opportunities for cooperative projects with governments, foundations, and businesses around the world. Moreover, NDI works to enhance campus diversity and cultural understanding by increasing the presence of international students and scholars on campus, and supporting them and their families with immigration services and cultural programs to assist in transitioning to life in the U.S. This is managed by the Office of International Student and Scholar Affairs (ISSA), which offers a variety of support services and programs to help international students and scholars make the most out of their time at the University.
