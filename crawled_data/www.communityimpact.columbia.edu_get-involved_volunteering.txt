Read about our 27 programs Community Impact’s 900 Columbia University and Barnard College student volunteers serve low-income and unemployed residents in the Harlem, Washington Heights, and Morningside Heights communities. In addition 160 community members, including alumni, contribute to the volunteering. If interested, there are teaching and tutoring opportunities. Volunteers can participate in 27 community service programs, ranging from youth education to adult education to emergency assistance for homeless families. While CI’s programs mostly depend on a semester or year-long commitment from Columbia students, there are also some one-time opportunities available for faculty, staff and community members to volunteer with us. Thanks to our dedicated volunteers, Community Impact is able to serve more than 8,000 people each year. Thank you for your interest in Community Impact.
