Transcript [ Music ] >> I've always been in diverse backgrounds so I feel at home here. With diverse faculty you see different initiatives so you will see an advocacy of assigning diverse textbooks, of finding diverse authors and scholars, assigning theories that pertain to gender identities, religious identities, racial identities, class, these are all the different critiques and conversations that diverse faculty bring to the table, which can only enhance our students educational experience here. As you get new interventions and for example, as we get Black scholars, Native scholars, Asian scholars, providing new perspectives, new interpretations, new directions, these are all shifts that students get to be able to experience and we are expanding our students' understanding of what the field is and also their engagement. I have something to contribute here that I think will allow me to grow within Cal State San Bernardino and in terms of diversity, equity, and inclusion, I wanted to make sure that Native voices and histories and students and student experiences and faculty experiences were also part of the campus fabric here at Cal State San Bernardino.
