As a center for business and a mecca for the arts, New Haven is recognized as a city of innovation, culture and prosperity. Approximately 20 square miles with nearly 130,000 residents and conveniently located between Boston and New York, New Haven is “large enough to be interesting, yet small enough to be friendly.” New Haven is a great place to live, work, do business, and enjoy life. We hope this site will give you a sense of New Haven’s diverse offerings including culture, community and residential areas, and services.
