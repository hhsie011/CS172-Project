Anthropology is people: it is the comparative study of the human species. Because our species exhibits great diversity, anthropologists study the whole spectrum of human existence across time and space to address fundamental questions about what we are and why. What do all the different manifestations of the human species have in common? How did this common core of humanity come into being? What forces shaped it? Can our knowledge of the human species help us to better the human condition? What are the underlying causes and mechanisms of racial, gender, and class inequality? These are the questions that lie at the heart of anthropology.
