The breadth of our curricula ranges from cinema to advertising, interpersonal communication to broadcast journalism, interactive media to documentary filmmaking, and just about everything in between. From producing reports and videos about global poverty to creating powerful advertising for nonprofit organizations, our students use communication techniques to enhance both our local and global communities. As we approach the University’s centennial, we will build upon the School’s strong foundation to transform into the very best School of Communication. We will break down walls and cross-train students to be proficient across a wide array of communication disciplines. We will promote a truly global sensibility as we conduct research and produce work that matters. We will carry out our mission while staying ahead of the technology curve, even as we continue to teach and practice the eternal lessons of good storytelling, relationship building, and ethical action. We invite you to join us in this exciting effort. At the University of Miami School of Communication, we are setting the pace in education in this enormously important and influential field. Our students are learning not only how to be great communicators, but how to use their skills and imaginations to make a positive difference in their communities and around the world.
