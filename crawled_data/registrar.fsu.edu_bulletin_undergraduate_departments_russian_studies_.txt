This area studies program is focused on Russia and Eastern Europe. A major or minor in this program serves the needs of: (1) general liberal arts students who wish to learn more about this important area of the world; (2) students who wish to pursue graduate work in this or related fields; and (3) students who seek employment in or related to Russia or Eastern Europe. The program combines area- or country- specific courses with more general comparative courses that provide students with the necessary intellectual tools, concepts, and theories to make sense out of their particular disciplinary concentrations. Students are to select language and thematic specializations in line with their intellectual interests and career goals and design their program of study around them. Computer Skills Competency All undergraduates at Florida State University must demonstrate basic computer skills competency prior to graduation. As necessary computer competency skills vary from discipline to discipline, each major determines the courses needed to satisfy this requirement. Undergraduate majors in Russian and East European studies satisfy this requirement by earning a grade of “C–” or higher in any course at FSU which meets the liberal studies computer competency designation, though it is strongly recommended that students take either CGS 2060 or CGS 2100 in order to satisfy this requirement. Requirements for a Major in Russian and East European Studies Students majoring in the program are to construct their study program around three components: (1) a language requirement, (2) area-specific course work, and (3) a concepts and theories tool requirement. EUS 2931 (Professional Development for Russian Eastern European Majors) is a required course for this program and counts towards total hour requirements. The total hour requirements for a major are thirty-six semester hours beyond the liberal studies requirements (with a grade of “C–” or better in each course). As an interdisciplinary program, no minor is required. In addition to a 2.0 overall GPA, all students must meet “mapping” requirements. See https://www.academic-guide.fsu.edu/ for more information. Language Requirement All students are required to complete relevant area language coursework to the intermediate level or demonstrate proficiency to the intermediate college level in Russian, German, Czech, Serbo-Croatian, or some other East European language (at 2200 level or equivalent course). Students will be encouraged to bring their chosen language up to an effective level of proficiency in reading, writing, and speaking by either taking additional course work on Florida State University’s campus or by participating in a semester or summer abroad program in their relevant cultural area that is administered by, affiliated with, or approved by Florida State University, as such programs become available. To encourage the achievement of language proficiency, language coursework hours taken beyond the twelve semester hour minimum or demonstrated intermediate college-level proficiency will be counted toward the required thirty-six semester hours for the major. Area Specific Course Requirement Students are to select at least twenty-four semester hours of coursework from the approved area specific course list. Other special topic area-specific courses may be approved from time to time. Students are encouraged to view the term specific course lists posted on the International Studies Canvas site and available at the advising office in 105 Bellamy and the program office in 211 Bellamy. Concepts and Theories Tool Requirement Students are to take at least six semester hours of coursework from among the concepts and theories courses listed below. Students should select these courses with some care and in consultation with their academic advisor to meet the required prerequisites for some of the approved courses. Additional Course Requirement The remaining six credit hours may be selected from any approved Russian and East European Studies course and/or an approved internship (INR 4941). Study Abroad While it is not required, students majoring in Russian and East European Studies are strongly encouraged to study abroad. The Summer programs in Croatia, Prague, and Russia offer relevant course work. See https://international.fsu.edu/ for more information on the various options available through Florida State International Programs. Students should consult with the Russian and East European Studies Director about any other study abroad programs they wish to pursue. Coursework taken in overseas locations must be approved in advance for credit toward the major. Internship The Russian and East European Studies program encourages students to take advantage of internships with an area focus. Information on possible placements can be found on the International Studies Canvas site. All internships must be approved the semester before the internship takes place. See the Russian and East European Studies program advisor in 211 Bellamy for further information. Honors in the Major The Program in Russian and East European Studies offers honors in the major to encourage talented juniors and seniors to undertake independent and original work as part of the undergraduate experience. For requirements and other information, see the “University Honors Office and Honor Societies” chapter of this General Bulletin. Second Majors Majors in Russian and East European Studies may pursue a second major. When students pursue a second major they may count six semester hours of coursework toward both of their majors. Minor in Russian and East European Studies Students pursuing a minor in the program must complete eighteen semester hours of Russian and East European course work beyond the liberal studies requirement. In this case none of the broader concepts and theories courses will count toward the eighteen semester hour minimum. Students may select freely from all area specific courses. Modern language courses numbered above 2999 may count toward the minor. Nine of the eighteen hours must be numbered above 2999. A maximum combined total of six semester hours in internship or directed individual study may apply to the minor. Approved Courses Note: Descriptions of specific courses can be found under the individual departments in which they are taught. In addition to the courses listed below, special topics courses may be approved by the program director in any particular term. These courses appear on the term course lists and are available at the International Studies Canvas Organization site, the advising office in 105 Bellamy, and the program office in 211 Bellamy.
