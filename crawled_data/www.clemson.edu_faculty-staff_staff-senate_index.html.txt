The Senate membership represents a 1:75 ratio among Budget Centers. Why We Are Here Staff Senate exists to support and represent Clemson University staff employees by giving voice to and advocating for a safe and equitable workplace, work-life balance, and professional development by promoting resources and recognition staff members need and deserve to flourish in their positions and at the University. History In 1984, Staff Senate was formed based on the need for establishing a two-way forum between the University community and classified staff at Clemson University. The Senate was the recognized voice for all classified University employees. In 2007, the name changed to Staff Senate, incorporating all permanent unclassified staff into the organization. Now, Staff Senate represents full-time permanent, time-limited, and temporary grant employees. Communication Senators are elected to represent staff. The goal is to be the link between staff and decision-making University administrators. Senate meeting summaries are the primary means of communicating Senate issues and actions to the staff. In addition, the Senate conducts surveys, distributes information, such as how to obtain a Staff Senate Scholarship, provides tips on communicating with elected officials and participates in the annual University Benefits Fair sponsored by the Office of Human Resources.
