1:00 PM Online Columbia Global Centers | Nairobi An African proverb states, "A bird is in the air, but its mind is on the ground" – meaning – wherever you are, it is important to remember where you come from and what is important. According to US News and World Report, the US admits close to 1 million international students every year. A good portion of the admitted students come from Africa, and as would be expected, they undergo a major transition from their regular life in their home countries. While the university provides critical resources to help the students acclimate to their new lives, there remains a huge void due to the life they left behind. In pursuit of higher education, students leave families, daily routines, foods and pass-time activities. All these factors entail the uniqueness of each student. Remaining engaged with the family and culture is a major contributor to a student's psyche and well-being, contributing to a focused and productive student. As a commitment to contributing to the welfare of Columbia University Students – particularly those from the African Continent - Columbia Global Centers | Nairobi, in partnership with Columbia University's African Development group, will curate a series of episodes that will focus on reconnecting Columbia students to a session of dialogues involving local artists. These artists will bring students closer to home through performance and engaging dialogues on their artistry and work around the community. Not only will the students enjoy a robust and uplifting dialogue, but this will also be a source of inspiration and a motivator to focus on their goals and anticipate a future full of promise and hope – perhaps back home on the continent. This first session of this series will feature Anto Neosoul, a musician, television host, and radio presenter named one of the 100 most influential Kenyans by Avance Media.
