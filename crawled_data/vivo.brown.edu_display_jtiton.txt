He has been active professionally both in folklore and ethnomusicology for more than 45 years. As a scholar, Titon has numerous articles, films, recordings, and nine books to his credit, including Early Downhome Blues (1977; 2nd edition, Univ. of North Carolina Press, 1994); Powerhouse for God (1988; 2nd edition, Univ. of Tennessee Press, 2018); Give Me This Mountain: The Life History and Selected Sermons of Rev. C. L. Franklin (Univ. of Illinois Press, 1989), Old-Time Kentucky Fiddle Tunes (Univ. Press of Kentucky, 2001), and the Oxford Handbook of Applied Ethnomusicology (Oxford Univ. Press, 2015). He is known for developing and practicing collaborative ethnographic field research based in reciprocity and friendship, starting in the 1960s when field researchers were taught instead to be objective scientists. Based on consulting work for Ralph Rinzler and Bess Hawes (as a presenter at festivals and a panelist for NEA—Folk Arts) he developed an understanding of public folklore that in the 1980s he brought to ethnomusicology, where he was among the pioneers in establishing an applied ethnomusicology based in social responsibility. He was the first to propose that musical cultures could be understood as ecosystems—this was in the first edition of Worlds of Music (1984)—while in the present century he is known for developing an ecological approach to cultural and musical sustainability. In 2012 he issued an appeal for a sound commons for all living creatures, part of his current project that theorizes a sound ecology. A book entitled Cultural Sustainabilities, edited by Timothy Cooley and written by colleagues and former students in his honor, was published in 2019 by the University of Illinois Press. His latest book is Toward a Sound Ecology: New and Selected Essays (Indiana University Press, 2020). Titon joined the faculty at Tufts University in 1971 as Assistant Professor of English, teaching courses in American literature and in folklore. Beginning in 1974 he also offered courses in ethnomusicology in the department of music; and in 1977 was tenured in a joint appointment as Associate Professor of English and music. At Tufts, he founded the MA program in ethnomusicology, co-founded the program in American Studies, and taught American literature, folklore and ethnomusicology there until in 1986 he moved to Brown University as Professor of Music and director of their doctoral program in ethnomusicology, a position he held until his retirement in 2013. At Brown, he taught graduate seminars and was a popular lecturer for undergraduates. His advisees hold positions at major colleges and universities and also in public ethnomusicology and public folklore. A member of the American Folklore Society since 1974, he was elected a Fellow in 1998, and served on its Executive Board 2015-2017. A member of the Society for Ethnomusicology since 1971, he was the editor of its journal, Ethnomusicology, from 1990-1995, and in 2015 was made an honorary life member of the Society. He has held visiting professorships at six colleges and universities, including Indiana University’s Folklore Institute; and he was awarded two Fellowships for Independent Study and Research by the National Endowment for the Humanities. His recordings of Old Regular Baptist music were chosen for preservation in the National Recording Registry; and his field recordings and professional papers are in process of transfer to the archives of the American Folklife Center, Library of Congress. In 2017 he received the Outstanding Achievement Award from his graduate school alma mater, the University of Minnesota. In 2020 he received the American Folklore Society's Lifetime Scholarly Achievement Award.

Research Research Overview (1) In the spring of 2016 I delivered the Basler Chair Lectures, on the subject of a sound ecology, which I intend to expand into a book on the subject, one I have been formulating in lectures, keynote addresses, and essays for the past few years. (2) I have an ongoing musical sustainability partnership with Old Regular Baptists in southeastern Kentucky, possessors of the oldest, English-language, oral singing tradition of sacred music in the US. (3) For several years I've been preparing two websites: (a) on the life and preaching of Reverend C.L. Franklin and (b) a multimedia interactive fiction titled The Virtual Folk Festival. I also write fiction and compose and perform music. Please visit my research blog http://sustainablemusic.blogspot.com for the most up to date information. Research Statement My current work includes the following projects and research interests: 1. I am writing a book proposing a sound ecology. A sound ecology is centered on sound communication (including music) in the natural and human worlds, and includes sound experience, sound exchanges (economies) and sound sociality (communities). This book project grows out of my thinking on music, sound and sustainability, a subject I've been speaking about in public forums since 2006. In the spring of 2016 I held the Basler Chair of Excellence for the Integration of the Arts, Rhetoric, and Science, at ETSU, where I gave four public lectures in which I explained my project on a sound ecology; these will form the basis for the book, which I hope to complete before too many years go by. 2. I am continuing ethnographic research on the musical culture and lined hymnody of Old Regular Baptists in southeastern Kentucky. This is an ongoing partnership project for musical and cultural sustainability. It began in 1990 and has resulted in numerous field recordings and videos, as well as two CDs published by Smithsonian Folkways, demonstrations of lined hymnody at the Smithsonian Folklife Festival in 1997 (see my article, "'The Real Thing,'" for an interpretation of their appearance at that event), and at a conference on lined hymnody that took place in 2005 at Yale University. In 2015 the first of the two Folkways CDs was selected for the National Recording Registry in recognition of its contribution to American culture and aural history. 3. A second volume, supplemented with a website, on the life and preaching of the Rev. C. L. Franklin (father of Aretha), of Detroit, MI. The first volume, Give Me This Mountain, was published by the University of Illinois Press. I spent 1977-78 in Detroit supported by a National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) Fellowship for Independent Study and Research on Rev. Franklin's life and preaching. Franklin was the most popular African American Baptist preacher of his generation, and his sermons served as models for many listeners. Like a rock star, he made record albums of his sermons (more than 70), recorded live at his home church of New Bethel, in Detroit. With gospel groups such as The Ward Singers accompanying him, he went on preaching tours to black communities all over the U.S. from the early 1950s through the early 1970s. In Detroit I was able to spend time with Rev. Franklin at his home, where I tape-recorded his life history in several sessions over many days. I was also able to make audio and video tape recordings of his sermons during this time. The videos are of special interest as they are the only films ever made of his preaching. In 2014 and 2015 I was privileged to show two of these videotapes at conferences in Detroit honoring and celebrating Rev. Franklin's legacy, titled The Voice of a Prophet, and organized by Rev. E. L. Branch, who was a young minister in Rev. Franklin's church in 1977-78 while I was undertaking the documentation for the project. 4. A hypertext-multimedia interactive fiction entitled The Virtual Festival. In this computer representation of a folk festival, the user experiences something of what it is like to be both front stage and backstage at a folk festival, viewing and listening to presentations, performances, and narratives, while also overhearing conversations backstage, many of which highlight the intentions of the festival organizers, the logistical and other problems they encounter, and the excitement generated when all come together to stage it. The Virtual Festival can be a teaching tool as well as an interactive fiction. In one projected version, it follows a conflict over authority that emerges between a performer and various festival organizers concerning the way the performer is represented, thus foregrounding certain problems and issues involved with festival presentation today. The internet is envisioned as the delivery system for this project, and I demonstrated an early version of it at the 2005 conference of the American Folklore Society. 5. Fiction writing and musical performance and composition. I continue to write and publish fiction, and to compose and perform music. My most recently published fiction is Davey (2013) and "Flight Call" (2015); my most recent public appearances as a musician took place at the Common Ground Country Fair, in Unity, Maine, in September, 2016, in April, 2016 at the Down Home in Johnson City, Tennessee, and with the "Bound to Have a Little Fun String Band" at the old-time music festivals at Searsport, Maine from 2016-2019. A CD, "Fiddle Tunes for Slack-Key Guitar," was released in the fall of 2018 and may be heard on Spotify, puchased on iTunes/Apple Music and other sources. Funded Research Although I have received grants over the years, and sat on grants review panels (NEA, NEH) and evaluated fellowship proposals (ACLS, Radcliffe) since the 1970s, since 1990 I have very seldom applied for them, thinking that my university salary and sabbatical/leave system provided sufficient time and salary to support my research.
