They gain experience in both research and technology, learn to work as members of a team, and explore options for their future. Many of the centers and institutes provide opportunities for student internships within the university as well as elsewhere in the United States and abroad. ISPA and its component centers and institutes employ over 140 people, including 25 faculty members. They have been awarded numerous contracts and grants amounting to millions of dollars.
