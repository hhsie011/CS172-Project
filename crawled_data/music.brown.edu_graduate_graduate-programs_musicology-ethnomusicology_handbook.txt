The Handbook contains a mixture of rules, regulations, rationales, and advice. As our liaison with the Graduate School, she is here to assist students in all administrative matters having to do with regulations, forms, and deadlines (including but not limited to leaves of absence, 6th-year funding requests, support assignment forms, course registration problems, and transfer credit). Additionally, each graduate student should meet regularly with his/her academic advisor and the Director of Graduate Study to discuss goals, course planning, and progress. Please alert the DGS if you encounter any broken links in this document. Musicology & Ethnomusicology Graduate Handbook Exams, Dissertations and Other Scholarly Work The first two years of study will be focused on predoctoral coursework and the acquisition of an M.A., the centerpiece of which is an extended paper completed in year 2. Students must complete 8 course credits, 3 required and 5 elective. During the third year of study students continue to do coursework, at least three credits per semester. They prepare for and take their oral and written Ph.D. qualifying exams, and begin developing their dissertation proposal. The fourth and fifth years of study center around the dissertation. The dissertation must be an original work and make a contribution to knowledge in the discipline of musicology or ethnomusicology. Many students spend their fourth year doing library research or field work, and devote their fifth year primarily to writing and revising. See the M/E Graduate Handbook for full details on this process.
