The scope of landscape architecture includes site design, land use, and urban planning at all scales. A landscape architect is responsible for the organization and placement of buildings, recreational facilities, roads, grading, and planting design. Temple's curriculum focuses on appropriate functional and ecological "fit," by using a design approach and techniques that work with and protect the natural environment. Careers in public landscape architecture include positions with regional, county, and city planning commissions, and park, recreation, housing, and transportation agencies. Private practice includes the design of recreational, residential, commercial, institutional, and industrial projects, as well as the overall planning of new communities. Environmental protection, historical restoration, and land reclamation efforts could also be an important part of your role as a landscape architect. Courses for the Bachelor of Science in Landscape Architecture are offered at the Ambler Campus with a portion of the coursework also available on Temple's Main campus. The Landscape Architecture Program has access to the Ambler Arboretum at Temple University and The Temple University Field Station at Ambler. Faculty and students use these resources in coursework and research. For more information see: https://ambler.temple.edu/arboretum and https://ambler.temple.edu/fieldstation. Sasha W.

Licensure for landscape architects is state regulated and must be obtained through achievement of three necessary components: (i) education; (ii) professional practice experience; and (iii) examination requirements. To obtain licensure, all states require candidates to pass the Landscape Architectural Registration Exam, which is administered by the Council of Landscape Architectural Registration Boards (CLARB). Additionally, a majority of states require a degree that is accredited by the Landscape Architectural Accrediting Board (LAAB). Temple University's Bachelor of Science in Landscape Architecture and Master of Landscape Architecture are accredited by LAAB, and prepare students to sit for the Landscape Architectural Registration Exam. Additional requirements (such as exams, questionnaires, or training) may be required based on the individual requirements of the state in which you intend to become licensed. https://www.asla.org/StateGovtAffairsLicensure.aspx Summary of Requirements for the Degree The degree of Bachelor of Science in Landscape Architecture may be conferred upon a student by recommendation of the faculty and upon the satisfactory completion of a minimum of 124 semester hours of credit with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0 overall and in the major. University Requirements MATH 0701 (4 s.h.) and/or ENG 0701 (4 s.h.), if required by placement assessment. All Temple students must take a minimum of two writing-intensive courses as part of the major. LARC 2496 and LARC 4198 are the specific writing-intensive courses that are required for Landscape Architecture majors. Students must complete the requirements of the university General Education (GenEd) program. Summer or semester study abroad will satisfy the GenEd Global/World Society (GG) requirement. Major Requirements No more than one grade below a C- is allowed in any course in either Landscape Architecture or Horticulture.

Rome Option Bachelor of Science in Landscape Architecture students may study abroad in the fall semester of their fourth year. Students who plan to study abroad are encouraged to meet with an advisor as early as the freshman year. It takes careful planning with an advisor to ensure that the degree is completed as efficiently as possible. Spending a semester studying abroad in Rome will waive the GenEd Global/World Society (GG) requirement.
