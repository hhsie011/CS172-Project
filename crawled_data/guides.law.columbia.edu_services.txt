For Columbia Law School Alumni: This semester, access to the Law Library by CLS alumni is on an extremely limited basis and must be pre-arranged via a consultation with a reference librarian at referencedesk@law.columbia.edu. Access to the Diamond Law Library for all other visitors is not permitted for the Summer 2022 semester. Using Law Library Databases Westlaw Edge, Lexis+, and Bloomberg Law all use individual usernames and passwords for access. 1Ls and LL.M.s receive instructions for how to set up their accounts at the time of orientation or during the first week of classes. Transfer students or students who need assistance may email referencedesk@law.columbia.edu. You may access other Law Library databases from the Law Library's Databases and Indexes A-Z webpage or by searching Pegasus for the name of the database. In most cases you will be prompted to log in with your UNI and password for access. For assistance using or locating material in one of the Law Library databases, you may contact a reference librarian. Other Columbia University Libraries Law students are welcome to both study in and use the materials of the other libraries on campus. CLIO, the Columbia University Libraries' catalog, allows you to search for physical materials as well as by article title for articles contained in many of the various databases CUL subscribes to. For information on the various services provided by the other libraries on campus, how to obtain materials from them, and much more, visit the Columbia University Libraries News webpage. Law Library reference librarians are available to assist law students with navigating CLIO and the Columbia University Libraries' collections and services, although we may refer you to other subject specialist librarians on campus where appropriate.
