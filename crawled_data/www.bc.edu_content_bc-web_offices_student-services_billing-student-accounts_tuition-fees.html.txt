The University reserves the right to correct typographical errors or to adjust the Tuition and Fees schedule at any time it deems necessary. The Trustees of Boston College reserve the right to change the tuition rates and to make additional charges within the University whenever such action is deemed necessary. Collection Cost and Fees Matriculated students at Boston College are individually, personally, and primarily responsible to the University for paying all tuition and other fees associated with enrollment and room and board. This obligation also applies to any additional tuition and fees resulting from adjustments to course schedules. Students remain responsible in accordance with University policy for tuition and fees for classes for which they register, including any classes for which they have been withdrawn, been dropped, failed, or failed to attend. Students must formally withdraw from any/all classes that they do not attend in a particular semester. Students will not be relieved of their responsibility to pay tuition unless they withdraw from classes in accordance with the withdrawal timelines and procedures published by the Office of Student Services in the University Catalog. All billing statements are sent electronically. Information on how to access student bills and related account information is available on the Office of Student Services website, including at www.bc.edu/mybill. Students are responsible for reviewing their billing statements, making payments by the due date stated in the billing statement, and notifying the University’s Office of Student Services in a timely manner of any errors or discrepancies. A student may authorize parents, guardians or others to view their statements and pay on their behalf, but each student shall remain individually, personally and primarily responsible for the payment of all amounts charged to their accounts. There may be a $150 late payment fee assessed to unresolved accounts by the due date. Students will also be charged a fee of $25.00 for a returned check or returned electronic payment ($65 for any returned item over $2,000). In the event a student’s account becomes delinquent or fails to comply with a payment plan approved by Boston College, then Boston College may withdraw the student, place holds on the student’s transcript and diploma, and deny access to University services, including registration, dining, residence hall selection, library, travel abroad and recreation services. In the event a student’s account becomes delinquent or if the student fails to comply with a payment plan approved by Boston College to bring the delinquent account current, Boston College may refer the student’s delinquent account to a collection agency, attorney or other third party that provides collection-related services. In addition to the student’s responsibility for paying any amounts due on the account prior to referral for collection-related services, the student shall be responsible for (a) paying any and all collection-related fees, which may be based on a percentage of a student’s delinquent account balance, provided that such percentage does not exceed 40%, and (b) paying any and all costs incurred in connection with the efforts to collect on the student’s delinquent account, including without limitation court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees. The University, or its agents, may also report a student’s account delinquency to one or more of the national credit bureaus. Notice of Consent to Collection Communications By registering for a course at Boston College, a student authorizes Boston College and its agents and contractors to contact the student at any current or future phone number(s), email address(es) and wireless device(s) regarding the student’s account and/or any payments owed to Boston College. Students also authorize Boston College and its agents and contractors to use automated telephone dialing equipment, artificial or prerecorded voice or text messages, and personal calls and emails, in their efforts to contact me. Students also consent to Boston College, or its affiliates, agents, and service providers, to recording telephone calls regarding the student’s account in assurance of quality and/or other reasons.

Tuition Insurance Plan Boston College is pleased to offer students a way to help protect their substantial financial investment in a college education. The Tuition Insurance Plan is an optional private insurance plan offered through A.W.G. Dewar, Inc. that assures subscribers who withdraw for illness or accident a refund throughout the semester, even if Boston College's own refund policy has expired. For costs, benefit levels, further information, or an application form, please contact John Strain at Dewar, 4 Batterymarch Park, Suite 320, Quincy, MA 02169-7468, 617-774-1555. Federal Regulations Governing Refunds If a student does not wish to leave any resulting credit balance on his or her account for subsequent use, he or she should request a refund at www.bc.edu/myservices (“Request Student Account Refund”). If a student has a credit balance as a result of Federal Aid and he or she does not request a refund, the University will, within two weeks, send the credit balance to his/her local address. Federal regulations establish procedural guidelines applicable to the treatment of refunds whenever the student has been the recipient of financial assistance through any program authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965. These guidelines pertain to the Federal Pell Grant, the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant, the Federal College Work-Study, and the Federal Stafford and PLUS Loan. In such cases, the regulations require that a portion of any refund be returned according to federal guidelines. Further, if a student withdraws, the institution must determine if any cash disbursement of Title IV funds, made directly to the student by the institution for non-instructional purposes, is an overpayment that must be repaid to the Title IV program. University policy developed to comply with the regulations at Boston College will be available upon request from the Office of Student Services. Once a class officially begins, you have until the add/drop deadline for your specific summer term to drop the course using the Course Drop form found on the Academic Forms page and receive 100% refund. After the add/drop deadline, there is no cancellation of tuition for withdrawing from a course. To view the add/drop deadline for your term, visit the Summer Registration page.
