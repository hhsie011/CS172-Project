CNE2 has a rich pool of researchers with expertise in: Clinical epidemiology Data science Population research Translational research Informatics Health services research and implementation science The mission of CNE2 is to foster and facilitate the development, visibility, opportunities for collaboration, and sustainability of Yale researchers interested in neuroepidemiology and clinical and translational research within neurology. Researchers within CNE2 produce high-quality scholarly work within observational studies using large administrative data cohorts and conducting multisite clinical trials within NeuroNEXT and StrokeNet and the Veterans Health Administration Office of Research and Development. CNE2 brings these researchers together by providing an avenue for the exchange of intellectual and material resources across clinical neurology, geriatrics, psychiatry, public health, and other clinical and academic disciplines at Yale. CNE2 is also committed to developing the next generation of clinical epidemiologists and physician scientists by providing mentorship and training for Yale faculty through monthly "chalk talks" and its T32 training grant. Yale Clinical and Epidemiology Research in Neurology (CERN) Training Program (T32) Yale University offers a new postdoctoral program in clinical, translational and epidemiologic research in neurology, sponsored by the National Institute of Neurologic Diseases and Stroke.
