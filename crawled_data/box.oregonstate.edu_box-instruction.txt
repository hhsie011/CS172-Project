You may create class-designated folders, then click the "Invite People" button to share the folder and its contents with your students. When you invite students to be collaborators, you'll need to set their permissions for accessing and editing the content in your folder. For example, if you do not want to grant students the ability to delete files in your folder, set their "Invited Permission" level to be "Viewer Uploader." We invite you to watch the short tutorial videos on the Getting Started with Box page to learn more. While Canvas can be configured to integrate with some aspects of Box, the implications of any such integration on our pedagogical practices and classroom environments must be studied further before enabling any such integration. Our goal is to ensure our learning environment meets the needs of our students and our faculty.
