Disciplinary Action Resources Introduction Iowa State University's Acceptable Use of Information Technology Resources policy (AUP) provides for access to information technology (IT) resources and communications networks within a culture of openness, trust, and integrity. In addition, Iowa State University is committed to protecting itself and its students, faculty, and staff from unethical, illegal, or damaging actions by individuals using these systems. 1. Purpose The purpose of this policy is to outline the ethical and acceptable use of information systems at Iowa State University. These rules are in place to protect students, faculty, and staff; i.e., to ensure that members of the Iowa State University community have access to reliable, robust IT resources that are safe from unauthorized or malicious use. Insecure practices and malicious acts expose Iowa State University and individual students, faculty, and staff to risks including virus attacks, compromise of network systems and services, and loss of data or confidential information. Security breaches could result in legal action for individuals or the university. In addition, security breaches damage the university's reputation and could result in loss of services. Other misuses, such as excessive use by an individual, can substantially diminish resources available for other users. top 2. Scope The AUP is an integral part of IT security policies and applies to faculty, staff, and students as well as any other individuals or entities who use information and IT resources at Iowa State University. This policy applies to all IT resources owned or leased by Iowa State University and to any privately owned equipment connected to the campus network and includes, but is not limited to, computer equipment, software, operating systems, storage media, the campus network, and the Internet. Securing and protecting these significant and costly resources from misuse or malicious activity is the responsibility of those who manage systems as well as those who use them. Effective security is a team effort involving the participation and support of every member of the Iowa State University community who accesses and uses IT resources. Therefore, every user of Iowa State Universityâ€™s IT resources is required to know the policies and to conduct their activities within the scope of the AUP, the Iowa State University Information Technology Security policy, and the Policies, Standards, and Guidelines for IT Security (see Resources below). Failure to comply with this policy may result in loss of computing privileges and/or disciplinary action. 3. Policy Statement Unless otherwise specified in this policy or other university policies, use of university information technology resources is restricted to purposes related to the university's mission. Eligible individuals are provided access in order to support their studies, instruction, duties as employees, official business with the university, and other university-sanctioned activities. Individuals may not share with or transfer to others their university accounts including network IDs, passwords, or other access codes that allow them to gain access to university information technology resources. Colleges, departments, and other administrative units have considerable latitude in developing complementary technology use policies and procedures, as long as they are consistent with this policy and any other applicable technology use policies of the university. Incidental personal use of information technology resources must adhere to all applicable university policies. Refer to Personal Use and Misuse of University Property policy (see Resources below). Under no circumstances may incidental personal use involve violations of the law, interfere with the fulfillment of an employee's university responsibilities, or adversely impact or conflict with activities supporting the mission of the university. top 4.

In any case, the user shall be informed as soon as possible so that they may present reasons in writing why their use is not a violation or that they have authorization for the use. top 5.2. Suspension of Services and Other Action Users may be issued warnings, may be required to agree to conditions of continued service, or may have their privileges suspended or denied if: 5.2.1. After hearing the user's explanation of the alleged violation, an IT provider has made a determination that the user has engaged in a violation of this code, or 5.2.2. A student or employee disciplinary body has determined that the user has engaged in a violation of the code. 5.3. Disciplinary Action Violations of the Iowa State University Acceptable Use of Information Technology Resources policy may be referred for disciplinary action as outlined in the Student Disciplinary Regulations and applicable faculty and staff handbooks or collective bargaining agreement. The university may assess a charge to offset the cost of the incident. top Resources Links Information Technology Security policy Electronic Privacy policy Personal Use and Misuse of University Property policy Mass Email and Effective Electronic Communication Guide Student Disciplinary Regulations (Code of Conduct) Social Media Guidelines [PDF] Iowa Code, see Section 68A.505 Iowa Administrative Code (IAC), see 351.1 Files Acceptable Use of Information Technology Resources [Policy in PDF] Copyright Â© 1995-2022, Iowa State University of Science and Technology.
