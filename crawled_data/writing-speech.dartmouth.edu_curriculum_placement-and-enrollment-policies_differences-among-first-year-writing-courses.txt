These courses are rigorous and demanding; all of them will help students improve their writing and all of them are staffed by experienced and committed faculty. But there are differences among these courses: Writing 2-3 This course is designed to help Dartmouth writers who feel that they may be underprepared for college academic writing and who may benefit from two-terms of instruction with intensive academic support. Writing 2-3 students receive this support from committed faculty and graduate student teaching assistants trained in writing pedagogy. By committing themselves to a rigorous plan of reading, writing, discussing, researching, conferring, and rewriting, students learn to craft clear, compelling academic arguments and prepare themselves for their future college writing. This two-term, two-credit course allows students ample time to improve their writing and to meet with the same professor and teaching assistant for two terms. The second term provides thorough instruction in the research process and requires a research paper in the winter term. Students take First-Year Seminar in spring term, following completion of Writing 2-3. Students meet weekly with their teaching assistant for a 45-minute, one-on-one conference to discuss their writing and address particular writing and research needs. Class size is limited to 15 students. Please note: Because enrollment is limited, a preference for Writing 2-3 cannot always be honored, but students may request to be put on a wait list for the course. Writing 2-3 for International Students This section of Writing 2-3 with TA support has all of the features of the course described immediately above, but it is exclusively for international students. Importantly, this is not an ESL grammar course. It is a course for students who might have conducted all or part of their schooling in English or who speak English fluently but have not had the opportunity to write extensively in English and desire a more gradual immersion into academic writing in the context of US higher education. Writing 5 Writing 5 introduces Dartmouth students to critical writing and treats writing not primarily as an instrument for communication but as a practice, a practice of thinking, by means of which ideas are discovered, examined, compared, evaluated, refined, and promoted. Each section of Writing 5 organizes its writing assignments around challenging readings chosen by the instructor. The texts for the class also include student writing. A one-term, one-credit course offered in Fall or Winter terms that fulfills the first-year writing requirement. Students take First-Year Seminar in the term following completion of Writing 5. Does not have teaching assistant support. Writing 5 students who need extra help with writing and research can find it by scheduling an appointment with a peer tutor at Dartmouth's Writing Center. Class size is limited to 16 students. Humanities 1 Humanities 1 is a one-term, one-credit course taught only in the fall that fulfills the first-year writing requirement. Students take Humanities 2 or a First-year Seminar in winter term to fulfill the first-year seminar requirement. Does not have teaching assistant support. Humanities 1 students who need extra help with writing and research can find it by scheduling an appointment with a peer tutor at Dartmouth's writing center. Class size is limited to 16 students per section. Humanities 1 has its own thematic focus.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Institute for Writing and Rhetoric Philosophy & Aims About Writing at Dartmouth Speech at Dartmouth Our Stories The Story of Writing Instruction at Dartmouth The Story of Speech at Dartmouth The Story of Writing Support at Dartmouth Curriculum Overview Writing Courses Writing 2-3 WRIT 5 First-Year Seminars Humanities 1-2 Speech Courses Speech 20 Speech 25 Speech 26 Speech 27 Speech 30 Speech 31 Speech 33 Speech 34 Speech 36 Speech 37 Speech 40 Placement and Enrollment Policies First-Year Writing & First-Year Seminar Requirements Differences Among First-Year Writing Courses FAQ Directed Self-Placement Process for Writing Registration for Writing 5 or Writing 2-3 Registration for First Year Seminars FAQ First-year Writing Registration First-year Writing Choices Prizes Writing Prize Winners Speech Contest Winners Speech Contest Call for Entries Learning Overview Writing Center Make an Appointment Materials Sources and Citations at Dartmouth Teaching Overview Guidelines Teaching Writing in the First Year Expectations for Writing 2-3 Expectations for Writing 5 Teaching the First-Year Seminar First-Year Writing: Pedagogies, Methods, & Design Active Learning in the First-Year Writing Classroom Syllabus and Assignment Design Teaching Writing as Process Integrating Reading and Writing Diagnosing and Responding to Student Writing Conducting Writing Workshops Collaborative Learning/Learning with Peers Teaching Argument Teaching Research Addressing Grammar Useful links Support The Writing Assistant Program Research Past Research Activities Research Overview Multilingual Overview Support for Undergraduate Students Support for Graduate Students Faculty Support News & People People News Employment Upcoming Events Past Events My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
