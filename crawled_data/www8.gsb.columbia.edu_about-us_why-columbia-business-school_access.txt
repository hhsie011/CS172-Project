Executives in Residence Our Executives in Residence Program, for instance, among the first of its kind when it was founded nearly 30 years ago, integrates select senior business leaders into the life of the School. These seasoned experts, from firms like McKinsey, IBM, and Goldman Sachs, are with us long term and have offices on the second floor of Uris Hall. They teach; participate in events; and counsel students, both individually and in small groups. Pracitioners & Adjuncts Because of Columbia's convenient location and deep ties to the business, government, and nonprofit communities, we get the best adjunct professors in business education. These trailblazing practitioners from nearly every industry pop up to campus during lunch or after work to teach a class, giving students immediate, inside access to their area of interest. When you go to business school at Columbia, you're not taking a two-year break from the real world — you're diving into it deeper than ever. Sidebar Content By the Numbers 500 Speakers a year visiting campus, offering unparalleled access to the pulse of business. 44,000 Alumni around the world — an impressive network to tap into as a student and after you graduate.
