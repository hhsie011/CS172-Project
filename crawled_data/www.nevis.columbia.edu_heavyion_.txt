The purpose of high-energy nuclear physics (as opposed to high-energy particle physics) is to understand the properties and states of matter at the high temperatures and pressures created by the collisions of two nuclei. General presentations on the goals of the field in general, and PHENIX in particular, are available here. Below is an overview of the heavy-ion physics experiments in which Nevis currently participates. Note that the list of physics results is necessarily incomplete, since each is a rich source of new information about the structure of matter. Consult the web sites of the individual experiments for more information.
