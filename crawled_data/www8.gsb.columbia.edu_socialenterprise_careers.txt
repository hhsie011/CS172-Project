Students and staff work collaboratively to develop relationships with organizations, provide industry information, organize career panels and networking events, and publicize job announcements through a variety of channels. Careers in social enterprise span the nonprofit, public and business sectors and are as varied as the interests of students. Venture philanthropy, international development, and renewable energy are just a few of these diverse fields of interest in social enterprise; their common thread is working to achieve social benefit through business practices. The value of the Columbia MBA is evident by the diversity of students and success of its graduates, who are employed with such organizations as The Bridgespan Group; New York City Department of Education; GE Energy (wind/renewables); EcoSecurities; Freedom From Hunger; Dalberg; Victory Schools; Reading Is Fundamental; Orpheus Chamber Orchestra; New York City Economic Development Corporation, and the American Museum of Natural History. While the Program actively supports students pursuing social enterprise positions with the Social Enterprise Summer Fellowship Program and after graduation through the Loan Assistance Program, it also offers resources for students who seek to gain skills and experience in other areas before transitioning into social enterprise related positions in business, nonprofit, or public organizations. Many alumni working for companies find ways to create social value, both within and outside their careers. Information about nonprofit board memberships, pro bono consulting, and volunteer opportunities are available online.
