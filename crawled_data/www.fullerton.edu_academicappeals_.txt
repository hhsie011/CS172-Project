Appeals must be submitted prior to specific deadlines. In order to initiate an academic appeal, the student must contact the faculty member of the course under appeal within 60 days from the first day of the next regular semester (fall or spring). A completed written appeal, including all elements of the checklist below, must be received by the Academic Appeals Board no later than 90 days from the first day of the next regular semester following the course under appeal. Summer or winter session course appeals must be initiated in the following fall or spring semester, respectively. The Academic Appeals Board can only consider student appeals based on: 1) accusations of academic dishonesty (cheating) on the part of the student; or 2) allegations that a grade was assigned in a subjective or prejudicial (arbitrary and capricious) manner. The Academic Appeals Board DOES NOT REGRADE OR RE-EVALUATE student work. All communications must be professional and maintain a tone of civility. A copy of the appeal will be shared with the faculty member to allow them to prepare a response. Appeals are considered on an individual basis. Your academic appeal request must include the following: Full name, address, CWID #, contact phone number, primary e-mail address, class level, and major; Name of the course and course #, semester taken, and instructor's name; A letter outlining the allegation (accusation of academic dishonesty or allegation of arbitrary and/or capricious behavior). Your letter must state what resolution you are seeking (for example, if you received a C in the class and you feel it should have been a B), and a justification for that request; The letter should include the names and dates (as close as possible) of all the people with whom you have consulted (i.e., course instructor/professor, department chair, associate dean, etc.) and the outcome of those interactions; Your academic appeal request can only be based on accusations of academic dishonesty or plagiarism, or allegations of arbitrary/capricious behavior by a faculty member. You must provide detailed and specific information to support a claim related to arbitrary/capricious behavior. This may include, but not limited to, e-mails, past exams, course gradebook records, and/or classwork. You must provide a detailed explanation (including documentation if appropriate) to counter an accusation of academic dishonesty or plagiarism. Attach the course syllabus and relevant e-mails to and from pertinent parties. E-mail your letter and all supporting documentation to academicappeals@fullerton.edu.
