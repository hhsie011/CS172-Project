Many of the “number-crunching” tasks formerly thought to be part of an accountant's world have long ago been replaced by sophisticated software. Instead, you can expect a satisfying and challenging professional career as an accountant, with lucrative and stable employment in a respected profession. All organizations need accounting; therefore, accounting careers can exist in any business that interests you — sports, travel, music, banking, non-profits ... anything. Accountancy is a growing field with high job security and career earning prospects. You can work your way up to CFO as a corporate accountant, rise to the partner level at a public accounting firm, become a valued advisor as a consultant, or even join the FBI as an investigator. Our accounting program is a major program of study offered in Corvallis. Options: Once you enroll in the accounting program, you can select an area of focus from the following options: Dean's Academy The Dean’s Academy is an academic forum for high-achieving first-year students, transfer students, and current undergraduate students who wish to maximize the educational and experiential aspects of their college experience.
