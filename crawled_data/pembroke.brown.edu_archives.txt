Established in 1982, the Pembroke Center Archives preserves and promotes women’s history at Brown, ensuring that special collections by and about women are included in the University’s library system and broadly available to researchers worldwide. The depth and breadth of the Archives’ two research collections—the Feminist Theory Archive, which documents the lives and work of influential scholars who place sex and gender at the center of their theoretical study, and the Christine Dunlap Farnham Archive, which focuses on the history of women, transgender, and gender nonbinary people at Brown and in Rhode Island—make Brown a national research destination for scholars and the general public. The Archives are accessed by researchers from around the globe and used by Brown students, faculty, researchers, and the general public through the John Hay Library. The Pembroke Center Archives celebrates its collections and donors each year through exhibits, including The Lamphere Case: The Sex Discrimination Lawsuit That Changed Brown, and the annual Shauna M. Stark '76 Out of the Archives Lecture series. For more information, email pembroke_archives@brown.edu.
