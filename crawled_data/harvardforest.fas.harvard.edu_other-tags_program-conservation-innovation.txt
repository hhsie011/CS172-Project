The PCI has five overarching goals: to conduct research that informs advanced conservation practice and focuses attention on the outstanding innovation in the field to educate present-day and future conservation practitioners and involved citizenry regarding emerging approaches to conserving land, water, and biodiversity to award and recognize exemplary conservation initiatives to convene focused leadership dialogues on critical conservation challenges and inventive solutions commensurate with those challenges, and to broadly communicate with a global audience regarding important conservation innovations that may be commensurate with the complex challenges of our day.
