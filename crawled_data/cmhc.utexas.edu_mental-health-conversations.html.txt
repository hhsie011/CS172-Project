The platform also teaches participants when and how to make a referral to campus mental health resources. Practicing simulated conversations allows participants to develop confidence about having these discussions in real life. While this training does not replace healthcare from a licensed mental health professional, everyone can learn how to respond to student mental health concerns in a caring and appropriate way. The simulation takes an hour or less to complete, and participants can stop and pick up where they left off. Through the stimulation you will: Complete a pre-survey Learn about mental health, how it impacts students and methods for responding to someone who is struggling Participate in scenarios to practice applying these methods Get feedback about the choices made during the scenarios Complete a post-survey Student access Mental Health Conversations is available to all UT students who are interested in gaining more knowledge about how to support peers. It is offered through a Canvas course. Access the course Faculty and staff access Mental Health Conversations is available to all faculty and staff in addition to graduate students who work in student-supporting capacities including TAs, AIs, GRAs and GAs.
