WISE reflects the functional expertise at the heart of strategic thinking and management, the analytic skills used to develop and defend points of view, and the empathy to understand and work effectively with others. DECISIVE means making the right decisions, by thoughtfully defining, analyzing, and solving problems and seizing opportunities, and by confidently understanding when and how to take risks for the better. LEADERS have the ability to craft a compelling vision for the future—including whether, why, when, and how to change—and to guide execution of the vision with and through other people. By developing such leaders, bold decisions can be made to substantially improve business performance and the world we live in. Vision Tuck will set the standard for excellence in creating, teaching, and applying life-changing business knowledge in a personal, immersive environment based in Hanover and extending around the world. We will promote a faculty research culture that fosters scholarship, creativity, and productivity. We will impart path-breaking ideas that, through management and leadership, better the world through business. We will hone our uniquely personal, immersive environment to allow for the individual learning and reflection to drive development as a leader. We will develop wise, decisive leaders with global perspectives who will transform organizations and change the world. “Global businesses and organizations need leaders who can harness information to articulate different points of view in environments of disruptive ambiguity. These are the leaders that Tuck has long developed.” – Dean Matthew J. Slaughter Strategic Goal Tuck will have the best full-time MBA program in the world and will be clearly identified as a preeminent business school. At the heart of what Tuck does is our signature full-time, two-year MBA program that creates a rich, rewarding experience for each student that no other MBA program in the world can match. By integrating a rigorous, relevant curriculum of coursework with co-curricular experiences and the career journey, students build a foundation and gain the agility to pursue a myriad of options on the path to becoming wise, decisive leaders who better the world through business. Core Values & Strategic Pillars Tuck focuses on areas of excellence—the heart of which is an incomparable MBA program—that are distinctly personal, connected, and transformative. Tuck has long cultivated an active, collaborative learning community distinguished by the core values of being PERSONAL, CONNECTED, and TRANSFORMATIVE.
