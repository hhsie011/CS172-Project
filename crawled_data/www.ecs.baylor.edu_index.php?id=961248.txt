Teal Residential College "Living in Teal has been an amazing part of my Baylor experience. I have made many of my closest friends at Teal and the community bond between all of us here is unique. From late nights studying to playing intramurals, Teal has impacted my life positively. The environment of academic achievement and faith encourage me to be successful in everything I do.
