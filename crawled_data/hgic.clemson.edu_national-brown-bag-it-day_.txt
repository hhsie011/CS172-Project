You can always pack the classic peanut butter and jelly sandwich, pack your leftover salmon and veggies from last night’s dinner, or even a delicious and nutritious salad with apples, oranges, bananas, or any other fruit. To observe National Brown Bag-It Day, simply take your lunch with you to work. Amy Overbaugh, ©2022, Clemson Extension This holiday could not be simpler. To observe National Brown Bag-It Day, simply take your lunch with you to work if you’re going into the office, or if you’re working from home, make your lunch on this day instead of buying a delivered lunch. While this day celebrates being clever and planning ahead, be sure to keep leftovers safe to consume. Make sure that your meal is cooked and reheated (if needed) to a safe temperature and placed in the refrigerator as soon as possible. Take your bragging rights to social media using #CUNationalBrownBagItDay in your post or story on Instagram and Facebook. This year we can all celebrate on May 25th, 2022! You can always shop at your local supermarkets to pick up everything you need to prepare for National Brown Bag-It Day. For more information, see HGIC 4246, Packing Lunches for Work or School, and HGIC 3600, Bag Lunch Safety.
