It combines a skill-based business analytics component with a functional supply chain management curriculum focused on business operations and cost-efficient processes, production, and distribution. Graduates will understand how to interpret data, build models, and apply algorithms to solve business problems. Potential career paths include consulting and business or operations analytics. The need for people able to connect customers with products and services as quickly and cost effectively as possible has created a surge in job opportunities for supply chain professionals. Recent reports state 600,000 supply-chain jobs will go unfilled this year, which makes this a vital addition to the Cox BBA program.
