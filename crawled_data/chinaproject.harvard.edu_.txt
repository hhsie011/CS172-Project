Examples of recent work showcasing our broad topical scope include studies of: enormous health benefits of China’s existing vehicle emission controls; cost-effectiveness of grid-integrated offshore wind power in China, wind and solar power in India, and the effects of climate change on wind potentials in both countries; prospects for biochar production as a carbon-negative energy source and soil enhancement; new chemical mechanisms of haze production in China; two-way interactions of climate and PM2.5 or ozone in China and India; the effectiveness of carbon pricing policies using firm production data and household energy demand in China; and the influence of socio-demographics and neighborhood type on non-motorized active transport in Chengdu. Read more about our publications. Explore Our Research and Meet Our Contributors Since its inception, the Harvard-China Project has hosted nearly 175 resident researchers, who have collaborated with our faculty participants from 7 Harvard schools. Studying topics ranging from testing China’s CO2 emission estimates with atmospheric measurements, to the economics and policy of electricity reform, to low-carbon urban environments, the work of our community members have contributed to the broader energy and environmental conversation in China and beyond. Explore our dynamic, engaged community and their work via three written series: 1) Read summaries of new research publications in Research Briefs, written for non-specialists; 2) Hear from our contributors, in their own words, about what pressing issues they're exploring via our Researcher Q&As; 3) And discover vignettes of our community members and what motivates their work in our Researcher Profiles. China 2030/2050: Energy and Environmental Challenges for the Future Since 2015, the China Project has been a proud recipient of a major, multi-year grant from the Harvard Global Institute under then-University President Drew Faust and current President Lawrence Bacow on the theme of 'China 2030/2050: Energy and Environmental Challenges for the Future.' While primarily supporting a diverse research agenda with Chinese counterparts, including field studies in China, the grant has also made possible a series of high-level public lectures and film screenings, summer programs in China for Harvard College students, and an enhanced bilingual communications effort.
