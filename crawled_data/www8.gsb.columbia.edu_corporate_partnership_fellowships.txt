By offering tuition support, you enable us to make a Columbia Business School education available to all qualified individuals. We are extremely grateful to all of the partners that already help in this area. With their support, we maintain as talented and diverse a student body as possible. For your firm, sponsoring a student whose interests and abilities fit your organization has valuable benefits — you gain an ambassador to the Columbia community (both as a student and later as an alumnus), as well as direct access to that person’s peers. Along the way, the Office of Corporate and Foundation Relations is here to help you cultivate a relationship with each student your firm supports.
