CIP code changes for December graduates must be submitted by June 15. CIP Code Addition Request Process After faculty in your department or graduate group approve a request for change in CIP codes, fill out this form for final approval by the Vice Provost for Education. Your department or graduate group will be notified once the CIP code addition request is approved by the Vice Provost for Education. The University Registrar, ISSS, the SAS Grad Division’s Academic Affairs Director, and Institutional Research will be cc’ed on that communication so the change can be implemented. Expect that implementation will take 8-10 weeks. CIP code changes will be applied to currently enrolled students and all future students. Course Fee Requests Starting in the fall of 2017, the University of Pennsylvania eliminated fees (fees charged to students through the University Bursar for enrolling in a course) for undergraduate courses except for special cases such as experiential-learning courses. In order to charge a course fee through the Bursar, departments and programs must receive the approval of their school Dean and the Vice Provost for Education. Once the department chair and Dean of the school have approved a request to charge a course fee, please fill out this form to request approval by the Vice Provost for Education. You should hear back from the Office of the Vice Provost for Education by email within seven business days after submitting the form. For questions about this process, please contact the Office of the Vice Provost for Education at provost-ed@upenn.edu or the Office of the University Registrar at registrar@lists.upenn.edu. Course fee request form submission deadlines: January 15 for fees proposed to go in to effect for the summer terms or fall semester. September 1 for fees proposed to go in to effect for the spring semester. 122 College Hall University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia, PA 19104 215-898-5000 provost@upenn.edu ©2022 University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104 Footer Menu University of Pennsylvania Penn Directory Site Credits
