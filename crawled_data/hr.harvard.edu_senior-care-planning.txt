The program also provides referrals and access to vetted services around the country. Services are free of charge and include: In-depth individual and family consultation: Professional guidance, planning, and ongoing support for the faculty or staff member and their family; Customized action plans: Clear and actionable steps for caregivers and their families; Facilitated family meetings: Siblings and other family members can clarify roles and plan together; and Access to national networks: Referrals to vetted providers across the U.S., including geriatric care managers, elder law attorneys, at-home care services, back-up care, senior housing, adult day programs, transportation, and Alzheimer’s and dementia care. Senior Care Planning staff will also negotiate on behalf of clients for preferred rates. Note: Register before you need it! To use any service provided by Care@ Work, Harvard faculty and staff must complete and return a waiver. Once the Office of Work/Life receives this waiver, the employee's name is added to an automatic file feed that goes to Care.com on a nightly basis. This process takes about a day. Once you are registered, you will be able to create an account that will allow you to contact Care.com. Once you have submitted a waiver, received a confirmation, and created a Care@ Work account with Care.com, you may proceed directly to HU.Care.com and log in to your account to access the benefit that is right for you.
