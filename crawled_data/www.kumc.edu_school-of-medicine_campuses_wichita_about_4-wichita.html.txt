News and Activities Board members The 4-Wichita Advancement Board was formed in 2010 to promote the expansion of KU School of Medicine-Wichita to a full, four-year campus. The dual purpose of the name, 4-Wichita, according to Jeff Kennedy, the first board chair, reflects the board’s focus on expanding from a two-year to a four-year campus in Wichita, as well as promoting the benefits of educating more medical doctors. The purpose of the board is to further the mission of the school by placing an emphasis on building public awareness, governmental support and resource development.
