(Photo by Robert Gill) PreviousNext Overview The Dartmouth Economic Research Scholars Program program (DERS) was established by the Economics Department at Dartmouth in 2013 with the goal of providing additional mentoring and support in economics research to students with strong research potential and high academic standing. Additional advising and out-of-class enrichment activities - dinner discussions, workshops, and peer exchanges - accelerate and enhance the DERS' coursework and enable closer participation with faculty on research projects. Such participation begins with paid assistantships on faculty projects, but often evolves into research collaborations with faculty and independent student projects, including senior theses. The program also aims to prepare interested students for graduate studies in economics and related fields. Applications A call for applications for the DERS Class of 2025 will be made in winter 2023. If you have any further questions, please contact DERS Director, Treb Allen.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Economics About Why Econ?
