Our faculty members create new understandings, collaborate across disciplines to unlock new fields, and train scores of future leaders in the process. As engines of research and the world’s future thought leaders, our students are equally critical to investigating ideas and fueling breakthroughs. With over 700 faculty members, FAS Faculty make breakthroughs in areas both broad and deep such as the digital humanities, the foundations of human behavior, theater and performance, energy and the environment, quantum science, and our efforts to extend research and discovery through the deployment of “big data” through our Institute for Quantitative Social Sciences—to name just a few. A sampling of the range of research and discovery at FAS: Making old hearts younger May 9, 2013 Faculty member Amy Wagers from the Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, is rewriting our understanding of aging through her research. ...

But geological evidence, including satellite images and observations from Perseverance’s NASA siblings Curiosity, Spirit and Opportunity, point to an ancient Mars that was once warm and wet....
