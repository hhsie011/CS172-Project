We hope you will take this opportunity to learn more about the dynamic research community here at BCC. Recent achievements of the scientists in BCC reflect the exciting research culture we enjoy. In the last year, over 100 research papers were published by BC chemists in internationally recognized journals and the overwhelming majority of the papers were co-authored by our graduate students. Each year, we celebrate the accomplishments of our students with our Graduate Student Research Symposium, a day-long event featuring seminars and poster presentations by our graduate student colleagues. Many of our graduate students have obtained prestigious fellowships, including those sponsored by the American Chemical Society, the Department of Education, the National Institutes of Health the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy, NASA and the pharmaceutical/biotech industries. In addition, graduates of BCC have gone on to assume positions of scientific leadership in private industry as well as some of the finest academic institutions in the world.
