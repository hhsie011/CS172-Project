EEES is a new vision for scholarship, education, and service focused on understanding the complexities of human-environment interaction at different spatial and temporal scales. Ecology, Evolution, Environment & Society (EEES) At Dartmouth we believe that an interdisciplinary program holds the greatest potential for identifying, communicating, and ameliorating the challenges of rapid environmental change and corresponding social inequities. Dartmouth is well positioned for this role due to its tradition of international leadership in the natural sciences and interdisciplinary environmental studies. Anthropologists in the EEES program explore these dynamics using perspectives from archaeology, evolutionary biology, political ecology and other approaches. The EEES program, which brings together faculty from Anthropology, Geography, Biology, Earth Sciences, and Environmental Studies, is designed to train top young scholars to conduct innovative research while promoting capacity for integrating natural and social sciences to address the socio-ecological challenges of the 21st century. Prospective students should contact a potential EEES mentor. Please visit the EEES website.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Anthropology Undergraduate Overview Major Modified Major Minor Global Health Minor How to Declare an Anthropology Major or Minor Courses Introductory Courses Archaeology Biological Anthropology Cultural Anthropology Independent Study Culminating Seminars Past Teaching Schedules Honors Program Honors Proposal Submission Form Transfer Credits Careers Alumni: Where Are They Now?
