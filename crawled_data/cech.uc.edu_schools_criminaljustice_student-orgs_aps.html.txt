Obtain a cashier's check or money order (no personal checks or cash will be accepted) for $70, made payable to "Alpha Phi Sigma Headquarters" Mail your cashier's check/money and application to: School of Criminal Justice University of Cincinnati Attn: Alpha Phi Sigma Membership Processing PO Box 210389 Cincinnati, OH 45221 Honor Regalia Regalia Rules/Regulations/Requirements: Only student members of Alpha Phi Sigma are eligible to order honors regalia. If you wish to order honors regalia for graduation, you must do so well in advance of graduation, as it takes several weeks to process your orders. In order to process regalia orders, your money order/cashier's check must be received no later than 30 days prior to the graduation date. Any orders or checks received after this deadline WILL NOT BE PROCESSED. Regalia will be shipped to the University of Cincinnati and held for safe keeping until on or near the date of graduation. Students will need to arrange a time to pick up regalia from their assigned contact person (listed below). Generally, regalia cannot be shipped to the student's home, if the student is planning to attend the graduation ceremony. Unfortunately, there is no budget set aside for shipping costs between UC and the student (shipping costs charged go toward shipment of regalia from APS Headquarters to UC only). Steps to Order Regalia: Determine which regalia you wish to order. Costs and photos are listed here. Students may choose from the honors cords, honors stole, or honors medallion. Students may order 1, 2, or all 3 regalia items. Complete your online order form here. Obtain a cashier's check or money order (no personal checks or cash will be accepted) for the total amount of your regalia order + shipping and handling costs. Mail the cashier's check/money order to the address below. *Be sure your check includes the student name, so we can match it to your online order. * School of Criminal Justice University of Cincinnati Attn: Alpha Phi Sigma Regalia Order Processing PO Box 210389 Cincinnati, OH 45221 Shipping Prices Based on Regalia Total Regalia Costs Shipping </= $30.00 $30.01-$60.00 $50.01-$70.00 $5.95 $6.95 $7.95 Please Note: It is your responsibility to mail your cashier's check/money order for your regalia in a timely manner, within 30 days prior to graduation. If you do not send your money in time/at all, your order will not be processed. We will email to confirm with you once your full order and check have been received and processed, and again to notify you when your regalia has arrived.
