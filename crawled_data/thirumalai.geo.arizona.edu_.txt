My CV kaustubh@arizona.edu Blog | GitHub | Scholar Dr. Kaustubh Thirumalai Welcome — my research group at the University of Arizona’s Department of Geosciences studies climate variability across Earth’s history. We are interested in the causes and mechanisms of past variations in the oceans and atmosphere, and how such information can help anticipate future impacts under global change. To do so, we use a combination of modern observations, geochemical measurements, and climate simulations. We are motivated to use the geological record as a laboratory to fully understand the machinery of Earth’s climate system and explore its response to perturbations. Ongoing research projects include reconstructing changes in Indian Monsoon strength using speleothems and foraminifera, paleo-ENSO research, Arctic paleoceanography, investigating ocean circulation changes through time, and marine paleoecological responses to abrupt climate change.
