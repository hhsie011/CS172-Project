LAMAR WORZEL PROFESSOR OF GEOPHYSICS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF EARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND PROFESSOR OF EARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES 842D S.W. Mudd Tel(212) 854-7287 Fax[email protected] Pierre Gentine investigates the continental hydrologic cycle using multi scale modeling and big data (machine learning, remote sensing, high-resolution turbulent simulations) in the context of rising CO2 concentrations. Gentine hopes to answer questions such as what will be the future of droughts and extreme dryness/precipitations, and how will they impact agricultural production?
