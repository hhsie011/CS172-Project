He has extensive experience in the field of Chemical, Environmental, Mechanical, and Aerospace Engineering and has been in higher education for over 30 years. With a passion for applied learning, he wants to help Wichita State train engineers who are confident in their technical chops and who apply the fundamentals in applied learning projects that teach them to exercise good judgement. Information Academic Interests and Expertise Chemical, Environmental, Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering. Applied learning. Areas of Research Interest Applied semiconductor surface chemistry to clean and etch surfaces and deposit thin films to build electronic devices; nanomaterial synthesis and self-assembly processes. Areas of Teaching Interest College of Engineering GoBabyGo Program The Wichita State University College of Engineering sponsors WSU GoBabyGo, a program that modifies off-the-shelf ride-on toy cars for kids with disabilities. Students from engineering collaborate with physical therapy students to customize each car and deliver them at no cost to the family. Would a car like this benefit your child or patient?
