That is the dilemma facing the title character in Gessica Généus' Creole-language debut. Freda (Nehemie Bastien) lives with her family in a popular neighborhood in Port-au-Prince. Individually and collectively, they reflect the challenges of modern Haiti: her brother is a deadbeat, her sister hunts for a sugar daddy and their pragmatic mother dispenses support and tough love. In the face of escalating violence, Freda's boyfriend wants to emigrate to a safer place. Bastien's spirited performance makes Freda shine with her determination to challenge the daily realities of a country at the mercy of corrupt politicians, patriarchal oppression, gangs and a colonialist legacy that seeks to erase language, culture and identity.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College African and African American Studies Program Undergraduate Overview Major Minor Courses Summer 2022 Fall 2022 Winter 2023 Spring 2023 Forms Honors Student Prizes Careers Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Foreign Study Overview Ghana Foreign Study Program Paris Foreign Study Program Research Overview Thurgood Marshall Dissertation Fellowship Previous Thurgood Marshall Fellows Africa-Related Research African American-Related Research '82 Racial Justice Initiative About the Class of 1982 Racial Justice Initiative Support the Class of 1982 Enrichment Fund Events and Initiatives News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
