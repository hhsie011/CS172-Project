As early as their first year, undergraduates are able to work one-on-one or in small groups with faculty members on cutting edge research projects. The Sc.B. degree provides a thorough foundation for further graduate study or for entry-level technical positions in each area. Students seeking the Sc.B. may either pursue the standard Chemistry concentration or one of the two optional tracks: Chemical Biology or Materials Chemistry. Students may also pursue the A.B. degree in Chemistry, which provides a core education in the discipline. Here's what concentrators from the classes of 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020, reported they were doing in their first year after graduation. 2020 Employment AmeriCorps Teacher, Teach for America Bioinformatics analyst, Dana-Faber Cancer Institute Business Development Manager, PatientWing Co-Founder and CTO, H2Ok Innovations Distance Learning Educator, Rhode Island Museum of Science and Art Research Assistant, The Rockefeller University Research Assistant, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Research Associate, LifeMine Therapeutics Graduate School Brown University, MD Brown University, MS, Biotechnology Northeast Ohio University, MD Stevens Institute of Technology, MS, Chemical Biology University of Pennsylvania, MD University of Texas Austin, JD 2019 Employment Associate Consultant, Trinity Medical Scribe, Brown Emergency Medicine Research Associate, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard Graduate School California Institute of Technology, PhD, Chemistry Georgia Institute of Technology, PhD, Chemistry Mayo Clinic School of Medicine, MD University of California, Berkeley, PhD, Chemistry University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, PhD, Chemistry Yale University, PhD, Chemical and Environmental Engineering 2018 Employment Analyst, Clearview Healthcare Partners Business Analyst, McKinsey & Co.
