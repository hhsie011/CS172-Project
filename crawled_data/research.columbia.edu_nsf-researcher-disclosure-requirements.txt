Expand all Collapse all Current and Pending Support NSF’s 2022 Proposal and Award Policies and Procedure Guide (PAAPG) contains the Current and Pending Support policies and instructions. See PAPPG, Chapter, II.C.2.h for all details. Per the PAPPG: (i) This section of the proposal is used to assess the capacity of the individual to carry out the research as proposed, as well as to help assess any potential overlap/duplication with the project being proposed. (ii) Current and pending support information must be separately provided through use of an NSF-approved format33, for each individual designated as senior personnel on the proposal. Current and pending support includes all resources made available to an individual in support of and/or related to all of his/her research efforts, regardless of whether or not they have monetary value, except as noted in paragraph (v) below [SEE PAPPG FOR DETAILS]. Current and pending support also includes in-kind contributions (such as office/laboratory space, equipment, supplies, employees, students34. In-kind contributions not intended for use on the project/proposal being proposed that have associated time commitments also must be reported.35 Biographical Sketch (Biosketch) NSF’s 2022 Proposal and Award Policies and Procedure Guide (PAAPG) contains the Biographical Sketch (Biosketch) policies and instructions. See PAPPG, Chapter, II.C.2.f for all details. Per the PAPPG: A list, in reverse chronological order by start date of all the individual's academic, professional, or institutional appointments, beginning with the current appointment. Appointments include any titled academic, professional, or institutional position whether or not remuneration is received, and whether full-time, part-time, or voluntary (including adjunct, visiting, or honorary). With regard to professional appointments, senior personnel must identify all current domestic and foreign professional appointments outside of the individual's academic, professional, or institutional appointments at the proposing organization. Post-award Disclosures Post-award Disclosure of Current Support and In-Kind Contribution Information: NSF requires that if an organization discovers that a PI or co-PI on an active NSF grant failed to disclose current support or in-kind contribution information as part of the proposal submission process (see PAPPG Chapter II.C.2.h), the institution must submit the following information within 30 calendar days of the identification of the undisclosed current support or in-kind contribution: See your most recent Notice of Award (NoA) to identify the applicable terms and conditions that apply to your award. The following links contain the important post-award disclosure requirements, and are provided as reference, however, the NOA contains the terms specific to the NSF project. Always refer to the NOA. See Article 39 of the Research Terms and Conditions/Agency Specific Requirements (specific to research grants): https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/fedrtc/agencyspecifics/nsf_0522.pdf See Article 51 of the Cooperative Agreements - Financial & Administrative Terms and Conditions (specific to Cooperative Agreements) (CA-FATC): https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/cafatc/cafatc_0522.pdf Progress Reporting NSF requires updated Current and Pending support documentation to be provided as part of the annual progress report. On October 5, 2020, NSF added the following new question to the Edit Participants screen: Has there been a change in the active other support of the PI/PD(s) since the last reporting period? If Principal Investigators (PIs)/Project Directors (PDs) and co-PIs/co-PDs select “Yes,” they will be required to upload their most up-to-date Current and Pending Support document in an NSF-approved format to notify NSF that active other support has changed since the award was made or since the most recent annual report. Current and Pending Support documents not in an NSF-approved format will trigger a compliance error preventing document upload and submission of the annual or final project report.
