During the COVID-19 pandemic, the University has worked diligently to minimize the risk of the spread of the virus on our campus – and in the community. Visitors to campus can choose whether to wear a face covering based on their personal preference and informed by their personal level of risk. Face coverings are required in areas of patient contact, including clinic lobbies and waiting areas, and employees who are unvaccinated and have an approved exemption from the University are expected to wear a face covering indoors. Creighton remains deeply committed to providing an outstanding in-person educational experience this semester, while complying with federal, state and local guidelines and establishing resources and protocols to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The University continues to monitor COVID-19 data, as well as public health recommendations, and will be flexible in its response. Individuals who are feeling ill or recently tested positive for COVID-19 should not come to our campuses. Students, faculty and staff should follow these guidelines: What if I’m feeling ill or experiencing COVID-19 symptoms? What if I test positive for COVID-19? What should I do if I was in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19? Questions? Email CoronavirusResponse@creighton.edu Download the Checklist for Hiring Managers Face Coverings on Creighton’s Campuses Out of an abundance of caution for more vulnerable patient populations, Creighton University faculty, staff and students are required to wear face coverings in areas where there is direct patient contact, including clinic lobbies and waiting areas. In addition, all employees who are unvaccinated and have an approved exemption from the University are expected to wear a face covering indoors, except when eating or drinking or in a private office. All University guests can choose whether to wear a face covering based on their personal preference and informed by their personal level of risk. Requesting N95 Masks N95 masks are also available but are reserved for students, faculty and staff in clinical laboratory and patient-care settings. To request an N95 mask and fitting with Environmental Health and Safety, either for groups or individuals: Faculty and staff should contact their school, college or department “facilitator” (see the “Requests for COVID-19 Supplies, PPE” tab below) Students should contact their dean’s office Testing and Vaccinations All full time students are required to be compliant with Creighton University’s immunization requirements, unless an approved religious or medical exemption is file with the University. To continue to make progress toward ever-changing federal guidelines, Creighton University is requiring all employees, including new hires, to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or have an approved religious or medical exemption on file with the University. (See “Vaccine Exemption Request Forms” and “Federal Guidelines for Employees” below.) Employees, working with their managers, can record paid time off for primary vaccination doses. (This does not include booster shots.) The University also strongly encourages all students, faculty and staff to obtain a COVID-19 booster. More information on booster shots and eligibility guidelines can be found on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website. All students, faculty and staff should upload confirmation of COVID-19 vaccinations to the Birdhouse. Testing Options Testing options in Douglas County. Testing options in Maricopa County. If you are not on either campus, the local health department is an excellent resource. See “What If I Test Positive for COVID-19?” Vaccine Clinics Vaccination clinics in Douglas County. Vaccination clinics in Maricopa County. Upload confirmation of vaccination to the Birdhouse. If you are not on either campus, the local health department is an excellent resource or visit vaccines.gov. Lost your vaccination card? Immunizations are reported to the appropriate state health department’s Immunization Information System (IIS). The CDC has IIS records for all 50 states listed online, where you can look up and obtain a digital copy of your COVID-19 vaccination records after verifying some personal information. In Douglas County, the health department has information on its website for requesting a replacement vaccination card. In Phoenix, individuals who have misplaced their COVID-19 vaccination card can submit an immunization record request to the Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) using this form. COVID-19 Testing at CHI Health Clinic – Student Care Clinic Students who have previously established care with a provider at the Student Care Clinic: Students registered with CHI’s MyChart Patient Portal, can send a message to their provider to either A) report their symptoms and request a COVID-19 test or B) schedule an appointment with their provider and request a COVID-19 test.

The reason for this is that most countries (and currently all where FLPAs might travel) require vaccination for arrival and are not subject to the U.S. federal exemptions. Register for Travel As a reminder, any University-sponsored travel more than 75 miles away MUST be registered with the Global Engagement Office. The University’s preferred travel company, Concur (formerly Travel & Transport), will help to ensure that trips are strategically sourced, with appropriate travel provisions. University-sponsored Travel is Resuming Gradually All University-sponsored domestic and international travel must be preapproved and registered in Creighton University’s Travel Registry System: Travelers must create a profile (first-time registration only) to submit each new itinerary and other travel documents (depending on destination). The registry system routes the proposed trip for administrative approval from designated college/school or divisional approvers. A risk management review is then conducted by the Global Engagement Office (GEO) to determine if any special waivers will be required before clearing the traveler to purchase a ticket. When cleared by GEO, international travelers must also enroll in Creighton’s Travel Security Program (includes University-approved supplemental insurance, the AlertTraveler app, etc.). All trips are tracked in the University’s Enterprise Risk Management Dashboard. Creighton strongly recommends that all travelers (faculty, staff or students) refrain from purchasing travel tickets until the Global Engagement Office has confirmed they are cleared to travel. For more information about travel registration, participating in study-abroad opportunities, returning from international travel, or coming to Creighton as an international student, please visit Creighton’s Global Engagement Office. For More Information: Contact the Global Engagement Office for sponsored travel questions. Pandemic Response and Oversight (PRO) Team Creighton’s Pandemic Response and Oversight (PRO) Team was established by Creighton President the Rev. Daniel S. Hendrickson, SJ, PhD, to monitor local, state and global public health conditions and guidelines and to make recommendations on responses to University leadership.

However, fetal cell lines – cells grown in a laboratory derived from aborted fetal cells collected from aborted fetuses decades ago – were used in testing during research and development of the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna), and during production of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Using these cell lines to test the effectiveness and safety of medications is common practice, and absent alternative vaccines that have no connection at all to these cell lines, the use of vaccines that were tested using these cell lines is considered acceptable by the Catholic Church due to the need to protect public health, especially those most vulnerable to COVID-19. Current fetal-derived cell lines used to develop the mRNA vaccines, and during production of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, do not contain any tissue from a fetus. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has written that the reasons to accept the COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna are sufficiently serious to justify their use, despite their remote connection to morally compromised cell lines. “In addition,” the bishops write, “receiving the COVID-19 vaccine ought to be understood as an act of charity toward the other members of our community. In this way, being vaccinated safely against COVID-19 should be considered an act of love of our neighbor and part of our moral responsibility for the common good.” Internal Resources Directory Office 365 BlueLine NEST Libraries Bookstore Calendar myCreighton Site Index Get In Touch Contact Creighton Jobs Maps & Directions Locations Omaha, NE Phoenix, AZ 2500 California Plaza Omaha, NE 68178 402.280.2700 Select LanguageEnglishAfrikaansAlbanianArabicArmenianAzerbaijaniBasqueBelarusianBengaliBosnianBulgarianCatalanCebuanoChinese (Simplified)Chinese (Traditional)CroatianCzechDanishDutchEsperantoEstonianFilipinoFinnishFrenchGalicianGeorgianGermanGreekGujaratiHaitian CreoleHausaHebrewHindiHmongHungarianIcelandicIgboIndonesianIrishItalianJapaneseJavaneseKannadaKhmerKoreanLaoLatinLatvianLithuanianMacedonianMalayMalteseMaoriMarathiMongolianNepaliNorwegianPersianPolishPortuguesePunjabiRomanianRussianSerbianSlovakSlovenianSomaliSpanishSwahiliSwedishTamilTeluguThaiTurkishUkrainianUrduVietnameseWelshYiddishYorubaZulu © Creighton University 2022 Legal / Non-Discrimination Policy Privacy Statement Safety & Compliance LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Instagram Youtube © Creighton University 2022 LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Instagram Youtube Close Sidebar ID
