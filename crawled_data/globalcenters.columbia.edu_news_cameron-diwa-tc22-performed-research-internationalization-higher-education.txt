August 12, 2021 Cameron Diwa is one of the sixteen Columbia students taking part in the Santiago Virtual Internship Program. A native of Eastvale, California, Cameron enjoys watching horror movies and taking online Steezy dance classes, while pursuing a Master’s in Education at Teachers College, where he is specializing in Sociology and Education. During the northern hemisphere summer, he is one of two students interning at Universidad Católica’s Vice-presidency of International Affairs, researching the internationalization of higher education under International Mobility Coordinator, Cristián Díaz, and, Director of Global Learning, Maribel Flórez. His tasks include conducting a literature review and concept analysis of global competence as it relates to the Latin American perspective, hoping this work will expand knowledge on global competence, as the Global South is often overlooked in scholarly discourses around the topic. The research team holds two weekly check-in meetings that provide an opportunity to bring their work together into a coherent journal article, which they hope to get published soon. Regarding his experience at Universidad Católica, he states: “I love that I am on a team that is motivated to include the people of Latin America in the scholarly discourse and application of global competence. Our work fits in the broader task of decentralizing western-centric understandings of higher education, specifically in international contexts.” Tags Santiago Center Stories CGC Stories: Students CGC Santiago Santiago Center Santiago Center Internships Santiago Internships Columbia Virtual Interns Internship Virtual Internship Stories Santiago Virtual Internships Santiago Virtual Internship Program News May 26, 2022 Book Talk: A Slave Between Empires May 25, 2022 Alumni Spotlight: Gonzalo Mena May 24, 2022 Paris Center Stories: Translating Theater and Acting in Paris, Summer 2022 May 18, 2022 Book Talk: Your Sons Are at Your Service May 18, 2022 Academics from Chilean University UAI Visit Columbia to Strengthen Relationship with SEAS Columbia Global CentersAmman / Beijing / Istanbul / Mumbai / Nairobi / Paris / Rio / Santiago / Tunis Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
