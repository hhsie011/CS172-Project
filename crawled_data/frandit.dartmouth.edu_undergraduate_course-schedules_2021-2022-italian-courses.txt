An introduction to Italian literature, especially short prose fiction and poetry. In this course, we will study the ways in which desire drives narrative plot; contributes to the creation of meaning; and challenges traditional constructions of politics, identity, community, gender and sexuality. Attention will be given to building a vocabulary and critical toolset for interpreting and writing about literary texts from Middle Ages to the contemporary period. Dist:LIT; WCult:W. Prerequisite: Italian 9. ITAL 33 : Topics in Literature and Culture ITAL 33:01: Into and Beyond Dante's Inferno @ 2A(Callegari): An austere ancient authority, a smitten teenage lover, a prophet, an embezzler, a national icon, an unapologetic heretic, a mercenary, and the only truly great poet to have ever lived: Dante has been called many things in the 700 hundred years since he began writing, and he continues to attract the interest of a wildly diverse group of readers. In his medieval masterpiece, the Divine Comedy, Dante irreversibly transformed literary language and perhaps even the way we perceive the universe. Our course will focus on the Inferno, before considering echoes of Dante beyond his time. Our goal will be to bring Dante's vision of Hell to life, reconstructing the terrifying landscape and interpreting the complex poetry of a text that continues to resonate with modern audiences as intensely as it did with its medieval public. Our class meetings will be flexible, to allow the participation of a wide group of students, and dynamic, inviting many outside speakers and using a variety of media to engage with Dante.

ITAL 7: First Year Seminar: What is (Italian) Cinema? at 12 (Gilebbi). Cinema is a form of expression that, by integrating different media and disciplines (including writing, music, dance, theater, architecture, fashion, etc.) creates something that is beyond the sum of its parts. But how does cinema integrate all these other media into something new? What are the specific tools needed to read, understand, and critically analyze this multifaceted form of expression, and how can we use them effectively? In this course we will tackle these questions through an exploration of Italian cinema, watching and analyzing five Italian films to explore what cinema tout court is and does. Finally, watching a film with a critical eye, like doing any critical reading, is a social interaction. For this reason, this course is organized as a student-led seminar and all writings rely on peer-reviews. ITAL 9: Italian Culture at 11 (Wyatt). Italian 9 expands on the skills acquired in the Italian language sequence (Italian 1, 2, 3, and/or the LSA) as well as offering a transition to Italian 10 and our upper-division literature and culture courses.

ITAL 23: Marvelous Worlds [17th and 18th Century Italian Culture and Literature] at 12 (Canepa): This course explores the rich innovations that marked Italian literature and the arts over the course of the seventeenth century, the period of crisis and change that goes by the name of "Baroque." In particular, we will explore the attraction to the marvelous, the spectacular, the irregular, the new, the unexplored, and the marginal, in a wide spectrum of genres: fairy tales; lyric poetry; women's writing; the commedia dell'arte, or improvised comedy; travel accounts; opera; visual arts; and more! We will also use the resources of Rauner Special Collections library and the Hood Museum, and host a workshop with the commedia dell'arte theatre troupe Pazzi Lazzi. Dist:LIT; WCult:W. Prerequisite: Italian 10. ITAL 37.10: Mafias at 10 (Canepa): What is "mafia"? Organized crime, global big business, shadow state, deeply entrenched mentalities, glamorized myth, all of the above? This course focusses on Italian mafias (primarily the Sicilian Cosa Nostra) and, to a lesser degree, other Italian and Italian-American mafias. We will examine the conditions in which mafias emerged; those that make it possible for mafias to continue to thrive today; the social "codes" of the mafias, such as honor, omertà, and vendetta; and the forms that mafias take in the collective cultural imagination, in particular as they have been translated and represented in fiction and film on both sides of the Atlantic. In the process, we will explore Italian history and contemporary society and discuss topics such as the uses and abuses of power and the attraction of outlaw cultures. **This course is not open to students who have received credit for ITAL 07.07.** ITAL 85: Independent Reading and Research Students may arrange a program of study and research with individual faculty members.
