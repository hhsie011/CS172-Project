It reads: “No person in the United States shall on the basis of sex be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance” While often understood to apply to athletics programs, Title IX is much broader than athletics and applies broadly at Teachers College and Columbia University. While compliance with the law is everyone’s responsibility, the individuals listed under "Title IX Contacts" (on the menu on the left side of the webpage) are the staff members who have primary responsibilities for Title IX compliance.
