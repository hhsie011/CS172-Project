About The newly established Center for Contemporary South Asia (CCSA) is based at the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs. CCSA supports faculty, graduate and undergraduate research and teaching on the region and is home to the South Asian Studies concentration. CCSA will function within the larger framework of the Watson Institute, which is seeking to define a new approach to regional studies for the 21st century. Anchored in the social sciences, this new approach is problem driven, comparative and multidisciplinary. Our multidiciplinarity will include sustained interaction of social scientists with the humanities on the one hand and the disciplines such as medicine and public health on the other. Programs At this time, the Center’s programmatic and research themes focused on inequalities, development, urbanization, democracy, and pluralism and diversities. Partnerships CCSA collaborates with institutions and departments across Brown University and beyond. Learn more at our partnerships page.
