Frequently Asked Questions What Is CSUF's Definition of "Completed Units"? You complete a course when you earn credit by receiving a passing grade. The following grades does not count towards your completed units, however, they count toward attempted units: Grades: F, NC, W, WU, AU, I, IC, U, WF, SP, RD, RP Do remedial and repeated courses count for financial aid? Up to 30 units of remedial course-work are allowed under financial aid regulations as long as you earn a grade of "CR" for the course. A grade of "SP" or "NC" does not count as credit earned. If you repeat a course for which you previously received unit credit for (e.g. a grade of D or higher), you may receive financial aid for one retake of the course. Financial Aid policy differs from the academic policy governing repeated courses. How many units must I enroll in and complete to maintain eligibility for aid? The Office of Financial Aid does not impose a minimum number of units each semester, although most financial aid programs require at least 6 units per semester (half-time status) to receive funds. Therefore, you may decide each semester how many units you will attempt. In deciding, consider factors such as -- employment, course difficulty, family, responsibilities, academic probation, etc. If I am on probation and fail to meet SAP, may I file another appeal? You were placed on probation because you had an appeal approved which enabled you to received financial aid while you implemented the changes necessary for you to meet the SAP standards. As a financial aid recipient, you are required to make satisfactory academic progress toward your degree attainment. Second appeals within the same academic year are generally not accepted if you fail to make progress, unless you have serious documented extenuating circumstances such as a death in the immediate family.
