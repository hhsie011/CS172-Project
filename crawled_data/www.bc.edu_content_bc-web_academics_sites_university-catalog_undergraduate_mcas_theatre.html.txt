The Boston College Theatre Department—faculty, staff, and students—is committed to theater education that combines art with scholarship and drama study with theater practice. We seek to foster creativity, critical thinking, excellence, and professionalism through the integration of courses, productions, workshops, and other activities. We value theater as a liberal art as well as a performing art, which means that we seek to understand it not only as a means of artistic expression and a form of entertainment, but as a window onto history, a method of inquiry into all things human, and a vehicle for social change. Interested students are invited to join us in this mission regardless of previous experience. Those who do will develop an intellectual frame of reference, a theatrical imagination, and practical skills that prepare them for advanced training in a wide range of disciplines and vocations.

All courses for the Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences minor in Theatre and the Lynch School of Education and Human Development minor in Educational Theatre need to be chosen from the Theatre Department curriculum. Courses taken abroad, courses taken at other institutions, and Readings and Research/Independent Study courses will only count towards a Theatre minor in rare and exceptional circumstances. Mentoring and Advisement Mentoring and Advisement The Theatre Department faculty place great emphasis on academic advisement and professional mentoring. We are committed to helping students design an academic program that stimulates their curiosity, supports their interests, and advances their abilities. In this interest, we encourage students to pursue professional internships and/or summer training programs that provide practical experience and help to clarify long-range goals. When arranged in advance, internships can earn academic credit and often lead to job offers after graduation. Junior and senior Theatre majors are guided and coached as they prepare for graduate study, advanced training, a full-time professional internship, or early-career job experience. The Theatre Department Production Program The Theatre Department Production Program The Theatre Department maintains an ambitious co-curricular production program that includes four faculty-or-guest directed Mainstage productions and two student-directed, student-designed Workshop productions per academic year. Casting is open to all students and based mainly on audition. The Theatre Department actively encourages students of color to audition for all productions and is firmly committed to a policy of non-traditional color conscious casting, which means that race and ethnicity are not a factor when casting decisions are made. Opportunities abound for students who are interested in design, technical production, and stage management. Information for Study Abroad Information for Study Abroad The Theatre Department has no formal affiliation with international programs that focus on theater training or theater study. Students who are considering study abroad are advised to meet with their advisor a full year in advance of their departure in order to plan their academic progress and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of being off campus for a semester or more as an upperclassman. In general, students can receive credit towards the Theatre major (as appropriate) for no more than one course taken abroad.
