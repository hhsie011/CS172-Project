Further progress towards global HIV targets will soon be determined with the SHIMS 3 survey. ICAP’s work in Eswatini is longstanding, as a key technical and implementation partner for projects focusing on prevention of maternal-to-child transmission (PMTCT), early infant diagnosis, HIV drug resistance surveillance, laboratory improvement, and ongoing training of health care workers, epidemiologists, and researchers.

We already know that this vaccine prevents COVID-19 disease, including severe COVID-19. The United States and many other countries use the Moderna vaccine. We want to know how many doses of vaccine are needed for protection against COVID-19 for adults living with HIV and adults with existing health conditions that may put them at risk for severe COVID-19. We also want to know if people who have already had COVID-19 (and likely have some immunity) need as many vaccine doses as other people to obtain strong protection from COVID-19.

Two national surveys, SHIMS 2011 and SHIMS2 (2015), have previously been conducted by the Ministry of Health with technical support from ICAP and funding by PEPFAR through CDC. A third survey, SHIMS3 2020, will be conducted to measure Eswatini’s progress towards global HIV targets. The survey includes household-based interviews and HIV counseling and testing for individuals 15 years and older. Survey findings will be used to assess the impact of Eswatini’s HIV response at the national level, and to help guide and target future investment and programs.

The Fleming Fund will do this through support to implementation of AMR National Action Plans by making investments in: building laboratory capacity; collecting drug resistance data; enabling the sharing of drug resistance data locally, regionally and internationally; collating and analyzing data on the sale and use of antimicrobials medicines, particularly antibiotics; advocating the application of these data to promote the rational use of antimicrobials for human health, animal health and agriculture; and shaping a sustainable system for AMR surveillance and data sharing. The Project will use a “One Health” approach which encompasses work in human, animal (agriculture) and environmental health. This approach recognizes that the nature of drug resistant infections and their spread often involved pathogens which spread to and from animals (for example, pigs and poultry) to humans; and that environmental exposure to antimicrobial agents is a key factor in driving the emergence and spread of drug resistant infections.

It was implemented by ICAP at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health (ICAP) from 2009 to 2018. GNCBP’s goal was to advance the HIV response toward epidemic control and to improve population health in sub-Saharan Africa by fostering individuals, institutions, and networks to expand, enhance, and sustain the nursing and midwifery workforce. The program used a holistic approach to strengthen nursing and midwifery education and practice through two complementary sub-projects: the Nursing Education Partnership Initiative (NEPI), which expanded the health workforce by producing new nurses and midwives; and the General Nursing (GN) project, which supported the maintenance of a skilled health workforce through continuing professional development (CPD), in support of HIV care and treatment scale up and sustainability. Together, NEPI and GN interventions increased the quantity and quality of the nursing and midwifery workforce by addressing seven domains of health workforce development: infrastructure; curriculum; faculty; clinical skills; production; in-service training; and partnership for policy and regulation.

In December 2003, the MTCT-Plus Secretariat in New York (the precursor to ICAP, headed by ICAP’s Wafaa El-Sadr and Elaine Abrams) received its first grant from the new President’s Emergency Program For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Four years later, the MTCT-Plus Initiative of Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health was providing HIV care and treatment for nearly 17,000 people at 14 sites in nine countries. MTCT-Plus received expansion funding from USAID in 2003 and 2006. By 2010, ICAP had provided HIV care and treatment to more than one million people.
