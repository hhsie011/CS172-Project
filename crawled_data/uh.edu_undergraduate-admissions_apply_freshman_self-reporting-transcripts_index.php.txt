Applicants must report grades from all English, math, science, and social studies courses. Since accuracy is critical, we strongly suggest having a copy of your high school transcript available to use as a reference while self-reporting grades. After you graduate from high school, submit an official final high school transcript that includes your graduation date. How to Self-Report Your Transcript Step 01 Log into your my.uh.edu self-service portal After applying for admission, you’ll receive a UH ID number and access to my.uh.edu self-service portal. Log into the my.uh.edu self-service portal and click on “Tasks.” Step 02 Select "Self-report High School Grades." A new tab will open for the self-reporting tool. Step 03 Click on “Add Course” and enter all your courses and grades as they appear on your official transcript. For each academic year 9 – 12, you will enter all courses and grades individually for English, math, science, and social studies Select from the list of course names Choose whether this course was taken in a semester, trimester, quarter or full year. Enter the level of the course. You can choose from a normal high school course, an honors course, an Advanced Placement course or an International Baccalaureate course.
