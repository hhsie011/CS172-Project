She is currently Science Director at IPAM and for the past 26 years, she has been working and coordinating a research team dedicated to understand the dynamics of fire and forest degradation and its relation with land use and climate change and conservation in the Amazon and Cerrado biomes. Her work experience includes facilitating consensus-building over natural resources in the PanAmazon region through improving understanding of patterns and extent of fire, deforestation and land use changes. She was part, as one of the coordinators, of the Regional Planning process along the BR-163 Highway, in Central Amazonia, which involved a multistakeholder process to build consensus on land use planning to mitigate the impacts of the paving of a major highway in the Amazon. Results of this process included more than 15 million hectares of forest protected by a mosaic of conservation units created along this road corridor. She has also been responsible for coordinating the development of social technologies to support better socio-environmental management and forest conservation, with the development of two awarded APPs to support better monitoring of indigenous territories and health in partnership with indigenous groups. She is coordinator of the Cerrado Biome mapping and Brazil fire mapping within the Mapbiomas initiative, as well as the Land Use Change Sector of the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Estimation System (SEEG) initiative. She is currently part of the Science Panel of the Amazon as one of the working group lead authors. Jos Barlow is a Professor of Conservation Science at Lancaster Environment Centre in the UK and contributes to three post-graduate courses in Brazil. He has been studying tropical forest biodiversity and carbon balance for over 20 years, and co-founded the Sustainable Amazon Network (Rede Amazonia Sustentavel) to develop policy-relevant science in the Brazilian Amazon. He is Executive Editor of Journal of Applied Ecology and a lead author on the UN’s Science Panel for the Amazon. Luciana Villa Nova is a Brazilian Biochemistry Pharmacist specialized in Business Administration and Sustainability Management. She is an entrepreneur, Innovation and Sustainability Executive at Mangará Inovação e Sustentabilidade and Head of Innovation and Sustainability at Semina Farmacêutica. She joined Natura in 1996 in a training program and throughout the years she has gained experience in various areas such as R&D, Scientific Area Networking Management, Technical Business Unit Management and Sustainability. She was in charge of sustainability strategic planning at Natura, working on projects in sustainable use of biodiversity, including the management of social local initiatives for the Amazon rainforest and the Amazon Program. Luciana was also responsible for Natura's strategy and guidelines for social inclusion and local development. She is currently studying for a masters degree at Fundação Getulio Vargas / São Paulo in Management for Competitiveness in Sustainability. She is passionate about natural products and biodiversity. Natalia Piland is an urban ecologist currently employed as Interdisciplinary Scientist at The Nature Conservancy's New York Cities Team. Natalia is deeply interested in the ways in which humans interact with nature and scientists interact with society. As part of the Science Panel for the Amazon, Natalia helped organize the development of the chapters under working group 12, "Power of Amazon Peoples" lead by Mariana Varese and Paulo Moutinho, and is an author on "Chapter 33: Connecting and Sharing Diverse Knowledges to Support Sustainable Pathways in the Amazon." Her doctoral research (University of Chicago/Field Museum) focused on various dimensions of urban avian diversity in Latin American cities, her post-doctoral research (Florida International University) focused on participatory methodologies, human-river relations and connections in the Amazon and Miami, and professional development in green-STEM. Her current research focuses on human-nature connections in New York City and the urban forest.
