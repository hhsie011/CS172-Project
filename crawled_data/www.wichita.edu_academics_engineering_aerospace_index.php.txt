Located in the Air Capital of the World, we have long benefitted from and contributed to Wichita's rich aviation history, home to such names as Airbus, Bombardier-Learjet, Textron/Cessna/Beechcraft, and Spirit AeroSystems. WSU's Cooperative Education program gives students the opportunity to work locally and at NASA centers -- gaining resume experience and making contacts in aerospace and other industries that hire our graduates. We're hands-on in the classroom, too. Our laboratories, including those at WSU's National Institute for Aviation Research, are among the best in the nation and the WSU Honors Program and Aerospace Engineering Honors Track provide top students with additional challenges and rewards. » Learn more about AE at WSU Looking for Something?
