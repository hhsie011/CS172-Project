Today, USFQ is organized into 10 academic colleges and a postgraduate college, covering a comprehensive range of fields. In 2002, USFQ inaugurated USFQ Galápagos, an educational extension institution that develops academic research, conservation, and development programs in the Galápagos Islands.

Located in the Andes Mountains, Quito is 2,850 miles above sea level—the second-highest capital city in the world. The colonial-era architecture in Quito’s center is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Ecuador’s altitudes make for a variable climate, with equatorial daylight consistent year-round. Ecuador's biodiversity stemming from its four distinct regions supports rich flora and fauna, and the world-famous Galápagos Islands are just one of its natural attractions.
