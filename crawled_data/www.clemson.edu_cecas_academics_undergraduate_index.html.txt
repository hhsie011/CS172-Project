CEDC Website The Den In The Den (Design & Entrepreneurial Network), students collaborate in an “open mic” setting to share ideas for a business product or concept and to form interdisciplinary business teams. The Den Program LEAD Forward Constructed on a unique leadership development model, LEAD Forward is based on the concept of having a leader mindset. A main principle is that one must think like a leader before acting like one. LEAD Forward Program Building Success Clemson RISE Live and Learn Clemson RISE is a first-year experience designed to help students thrive inside and outside the classroom.

You will have opportunities to engage with fellow students and faculty, develop and apply your strengths, discover and invent new ideas and achieve academically in the living-learning environment. RISE Living-Learning PEER & WISE Empowering Future Leaders PEER and WISE are dedicated to increasing diversity in science and engineering by addressing and assisting students in technical majors. We provide career development and networking opportunities by pairing students with successful people in their classes and the workforce. These personal contacts can not only furnish tremendous support while pursuing studies, but they establish a network upon which to call when launching a career. PEER/WISE Programs SPECTRA Transfer Technical College Scholarship Opportunity The Student Pathways in Engineering and Computing for Transfers program allows students who intend to transfer to begin at any of the Technical College within South Carolina.

SPECTRA Program Student Support Our support services are designed to equip you with strategies and resources you can use to succeed as a student. Whether to reduce test anxiety, explore major options, or become more confident in your courses, we want you to achieve your goal of earning a Clemson University degree. Academic Support CU Arrow Academic Advising Group Tutoring Mentoring Career Counseling Co-ops & Internships Honors College Workshops First-Year General Engineering Every student who plans to major in engineering starts with admittance into General Engineering. You’ll spend your first year taking courses designed to bridge the gap between high school and college-level learning while examining the 10 undergraduate engineering disciplines offered at Clemson. From there, you’ll determine which specialty best fits your talents and interests. GE Advantage Small classes are a big difference between Clemson’s GE program and comparable programs at other major universities. First-year engineering courses rarely exceed 50 students per section. General Engineering Program Juliana-Marie Troyan has made the most of her Clemson education, including building great relationships with her professors. “ “It’s the support of the faculty that’s really helped me, specifically the willingness to help outside of the classroom. I think that has made the biggest difference for me. ” Juliana-Marie Troyan MAY '21 Not an Engineer? Go Right Into Your Major. If you’re interested in computer science, computer information systems, or geology, you are admitted directly to your major. An assigned adviser in your department of interest will help you set academic goals and then map out a plan to reach them. Of course, you’ll still have access to the same level of attention and resources as GE students: leading faculty, elite facilities, advanced technology, and relevant involvement opportunities that enrich your education.
