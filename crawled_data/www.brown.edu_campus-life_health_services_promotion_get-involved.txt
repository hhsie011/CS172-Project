SAPE The Sexual Assault Peer Education (SAPE) program was created to provide an opportunity for students to play a meaningful role in moving Brown toward a culture of consent. Working in concert with BWell Office of Health Promotion, SAPE is one of the prominent prevention programs addressing these issues on Brown’s campus. The group is open to all students. Our student-designed curriculum focuses on understanding systems of oppression, dismantling rape culture, and creating community-based plans for accountability and change. Learn more about SAPE.

Peer Educators are trained in current sexual health knowledge and effective approaches to sexual health education. Members of SHAG facilitate workshops in conjunction with Health Education staff and also participate in sexual health outreach projects through Health Promotion (like tables on the green and materials development and distribution). Learn more about SHAG.
