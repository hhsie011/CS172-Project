Each year, three scholars working in different disciplines come together for yearlong residential fellowships at the Pembroke Center, where they participate in the Pembroke Seminar, teach one undergraduate course and pursue individual research. Undergraduate students benefit from the cutting-edge courses postdoctoral fellows offer, and discourse at the Pembroke Center is deepened by the fellows’ projects and perspectives, as well as by the programming they create. Postdoctoral fellows further develop their teaching skills and work within a welcoming, collaborative, interdisciplinary and intergenerational group of scholars. At the same time, fellows can take advantage of the many resources at the Pembroke Center and the University as they advance their research projects. 2021/2022 Pembroke Center Postdoctoral Fellows Erica Kanesaka Shauna M.
