Engineers visit NYC classrooms to lead students in a hands-on and engaging lesson and demonstration. After the session, students will be able to envision themselves as engineers and scientists. The programs will shed a light on how engineering is part of our everyday lives and how students can make an impact in the world through engineering. Overall, our sessions are designed to show students that engineering and science are fun and exciting. The Outreach Office is excited to announce we are relaunching the Engineering Speaks program in January 2022! If you are a Columbia Engineering educator (faculty, post-doc, PhD student), and are interested in being matched with a local school to lead a fun and engaging STEM lesson of your choosing, use the form below to submit your idea for a lesson. Submissions for spring participation are still being accepted. For the 2021-2022 school year, participants can opt for an in-person learning experience or a virtual learning experience.
