Undergraduate VISA and HIAA concentrators — as well as independent concentrators who intend to lead a career in the arts — are encouraged to apply for the 2022 Flexible Flyer Fellowship Award. The fellowship, established by an anonymous gift from a Brown alum, awards an annual prize of $600 to support an independent project by a rising junior or senior. Application deadline: Monday, May 2, 2022. Rising seniors who are pursuing an Honors Thesis in the History of Art & Architecture are also invited to apply for the 2022 Rebecca Molholt Vanel Travel Award.

Application deadline: Wednesday, June 1, 2022 (also the Honors Thesis Proposal deadline). The Department has several Summer 2022 funding opportunities available for graduate students, including the Kermit S. Champa Award and the Molholt Vanel Graduate Travel Award.
