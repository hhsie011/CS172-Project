Strengths include vision research, computational approaches to the study of cognition, study of the frontal lobe (what makes us human), decision making, and cognitive control. This theme serves as a vital linkage connecting knowledge of cell and circuit function to human behavior in health and disease. Key clinical applications of work under this theme include autism, ADHD, and fronto-striatal disorders.
