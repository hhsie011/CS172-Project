In our field, we learn to ask questions and solve problems — skills that can change our understanding of nature or can better the society in which we live. Discover Science We learn by doing. Just as one might learn to play the violin by practicing, discoveries in science are made by trying things out. Undergraduates in the College of Natural Sciences learn science by trying new things and finding their own interests. Get involved in the Freshman Research Initiative » Join a faculty research lab » Study abroad » Explore options by major » Discover Yourself Every undergraduate in the College of Natural Sciences joins one of our peer communities, which are formed based on similar major, academic interest, or student background. These communities are the nucleus for you to discover yourself and your interests, and provide the support for you to be successful as a college student. Join a student community » Join the Natural Sciences Council » Join a student organization » Discover the Paths to Your Future The college has a lot of options for your degree. While no single path is the "best" or "most prestigious," some of these options can be the right fit for your goals. Choosing a major is about finding an area about which you are passionate. Choosing a degree plan within that major is about building up the right set of skills that will support you in your career ahead.
