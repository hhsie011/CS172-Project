Information coming soon! Recruitment Information & FAQs Click to Register for IFC Formal Recruitment How does recruitment work? The primary way men join our IFC community is through formal recruitment, which will be held September 19-23, 2022, with a mandatory Potential New Member Orientation prior to the start of recruitment rounds on the 19th. This is the process through which a man can join Kappa Alpha Order, Kappa Sigma, Lambda Chi Alpha, Phi Gamma Delta, Sigma Chi, Sigma Phi Epsilon, and Zeta Beta Tau. During this time, potential new members will have the chance to meet each of our fraternities, with the week culminating with IFC Bid Day. Formal Recruitment registration will open in May 2022 and close in September 2022. Do I have to visit every chapter? Yes. Since the fraternity recruitment process is formal, you will have the opportunity to visit all our fraternity chapters before accepting a bid of membership. That said, we do encourage you to keep an open mind during these visits to determine where you best fit. Do grades matter? A 2.50 GPA is required to participate in the formal recruitment process at the UofM. However, each fraternity has a grade point average requirement specific to their organization standards. Academic performance is a standard within the fraternity community; therefore grade point averages are a significant factor in the membership selection process. However, academics are only one of those factors. What happens when I receive a bid? It is possible that you may receive multiple bids of membership to different fraternities. After you accept a bid, you will be added on the chapter's roster. Once that form has been submitted, you are ineligible to receive a bid from a different chapter until the following semester, should you decide to remove yourself from the chapter you join. How will I know which group is right for me? Each fraternity has its own mission, creed and values. All IFC organizations strive to provide members with friendship, opportunities for personal growth/development, and fun. In order to choose a chapter that is right for you, you should participate in one of the formal recruitment processes, either during the fall or spring. This process will allow you and the chapters to decide on the best fit. As you go through the process, be sure to keep an open mind, ask questions, and be yourself! What is the new member process like? Each fraternity has its own new member education program. The purpose of a new member program is to educate a new member on his organization's values and its history. Typically, the programs are fun and interesting and lead up to initiation into the organization. Do the fraternities haze their new members? Neither the IFC nor the University of Memphis condone hazing in any form. Each of the groups have banned hazing in all of their chapters and have policies in place stating so. If you have concerns about hazing, please contact Fraternity/Sorority Affairs (901-678-8679), where all reports will be handled with discretion. Hazing can be reported online using this form. How hard is it to balance fraternity life and academics? Everyone is different when it comes to time management. Many fraternity men are able to manage fraternity responsibilities, jobs or internships, academics and involvement in other campus organizations. If you are interested in being involved in a variety of organizations during your time at Memphis, feel free to ask members during recruitment about balancing their time! How much does it cost to be in a fraternity? Being in a fraternity is like all other membership organization and does require a payment of dues. This money is used to fund the operations, social events, and programming for the chapter. It also allows the inter/national organization to continue to provide resources and support for the chapter. The costs of fraternity membership vary from chapter to chapter. Typically the first semester is the most expensive, including one-time fees (badge fee, initiation fee, etc.).
