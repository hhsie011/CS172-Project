Local HR offices administer the compensation system for employees in their units, evaluating jobs and determining the grade of each position based on professional knowledge, skills, required education and experience and job responsibilities; Harvard benchmarks; and the complexity and scope relative to other University positions. Administrative and professional positions: Every professional, nonunion position is classified by a job grade from 55-64. Benchmarks are developed by the Harvard Human Resources Compensation and local HR offices, with a position’s grade reflecting factors such as scope and impact of decision-making, budget management and resource generation, supervisory/management responsibility and planning. Clerical and technical positions: Clerical and technical jobs, including HUCTW staff, are classified in job grades 47-56. Generic position descriptions for each grade are available. Service and trade roles are classified in job grades 01-43. These jobs have been determined to be eligible for overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Salary ranges at Harvard Salary ranges within each pay grade are based on qualifications, skills, experience, equity in comparison to similar positions, and external market values. Salary ranges allow for differences among positions within the same grade as well increasing levels of responsibility and performance within the same job. The salary ranges in the table below reflect base salaries paid for all positions at a given grade across the University. Typically a new hire can expect a starting salary somewhere in the lower part of the range. The amount will vary based on the position and the candidate’s relevant experience.
