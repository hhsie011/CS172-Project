A safe laboratory environment is the product of individuals who are well trained, technically proficient in safe practices, and share responsibility for their own safety and for the safety of their colleagues, their community, and the environment. Personal responsibility involves the practice of assessing risks prior to conducting activities that involve new protocols or pathogens. A safe and healthful environment is the product of responsible institutional leadership. National codes of practice foster and promote good institutional leadership in biosafety. We feel these Biosafety Web pages are a helpful reference and guide to the university community, which accepts responsibility for complying with sound biosafety practices, university policies, and governmental regulations.
