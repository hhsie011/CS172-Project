Specific research topics include groundwater remediation, biotechnologies, transport processes, nanoscience, carbon-based materials, environmental pollutants, and thermal and electrochemical energy conversion. Chemical and Environmental Engineering Research The Chemical and Environmental Engineering program applies chemical and engineering principles to emerging technologies and investigates their impacts on human health and the environment. Specific research topics include groundwater remediation, biotechnologies, transport processes, nanoscience, carbon-based materials, environmental pollutants, and thermal and electrochemical energy conversion. The Chemical and Environmental Engineering program conducts fundamental research relevant to the design, application, detection, and health impacts of environmental pollutants and chemical products. The discipline is rooted in thermodynamics, transport phenomena, environmental chemistry and biochemistry, and draws from a broad range of tools in the modern molecular and nanosciences. Active research areas include chip-based medical diagnostics, environmental remediation technologies for soil, water and air, mixture thermodynamics, carbon materials, fuel chemistry, DNA and RNA amplification processes, environmental nanotechnology, electrochemical technologies including batteries and fuel cells, nanotoxicology, high resolution mass spectrometry, metabolomics,and safe nanomaterial design. Chemical and Environmental Engineering Faculty Recent News May 19, 2021 News From Engineering Suuberg, Brown Engineering connections are top academic contributors in vapor intrusion field January 21, 2021 News from Brown Researchers develop new graphene nanochannel water filters Brown University researchers have shown that tiny channels between graphene sheets can be aligned in a way that makes them ideal for water filtration. October 15, 2020 News From Engineering Researchers take step toward understanding how toxic PFAS chemicals spread from release sites New lab studies are helping researchers to better understand how so called “forever chemicals” behave in soil and water, which can help in understanding how these contaminants spread. August 12, 2020 News from Brown New catalyst efficiently turns carbon dioxide into useful fuels and chemicals By efficiently converting CO2 into complex hydrocarbon products, a new catalyst developed by a team of Brown researchers could potentially aid in large-scale efforts to recycle excess carbon dioxide. February 4, 2020 News From Engineering Researchers report progress on molecular data storage system December 18, 2019 News From Engineering Research Provides New Design Principle for Water-Splitting Catalysts Understanding why platinum is such a good catalyst for producing hydrogen from water could lead to new and cheaper catalysts — and could ultimately make more hydrogen available for fossil-free fuels and chemicals.
