From a Strong Start... In 1968, guided by Charles Nichols, 65 of the 85 Black students enrolled at Brown and Pembroke marched down College Hill to the Congdon Street Baptist Church to protest the lack of support provided by the University. The students remained for three days, at which point the administration agreed to increase admit rates for Black students, hire more Black staff and faculty, increase financial support, and create an intellectual home for Black studies on campus. Despite moving into a permanent home in Churchill House in 1971, the status of the program remained tenuous. 1975 saw a takeover of University Hall where students from a wide range of backgrounds pressed the University to make good on the promises of 1968. Campus activism continued to gain momentum through the 80’s, including an occupation of the John Carter Brown Library in 1985. The second half of the decade saw a renewed commitment by the University to turn its focus to diversity on campus. In 1986, tenured faculty were formally appointed to Afro-American Studies, and Rites and Reason Theatre was incorporated into the program. Walkout!

The 2000’s saw growth in faculty numbers and the continued productivity of Rites and Reason Theatre. In 2011, the graduate program was initiated, marking yet another pivotal point of growth in the life of the Department. In 2020, Rites and Reason Theatre celebrated its 50th anniversary, marking it as one of the longest operating standing Black theatres in America, known for its unique Research-to-Performance Method of new play development. Rites and Reason Theatre Rites and Reason Theatre is a research and development theatre producing new creative works that analyze and articulate the experiences and expressions of the African Diaspora.
