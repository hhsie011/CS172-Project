NATS AUDITION SUCCESS The accomplishments of these special students only begin to tell our story. In addition to these individual success stories, there is great depth in our student population. Each fall, voice students from universities in Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico gather for the Texoma Regional Conference of the National Association of Teachers of Singing. As a part of this conference, college students participate in the Student Auditions, where each student singer competes with peers who have had the same amount of collegiate vocal training. For example, female students in their first year of vocal study compete with other female singers in their first year, male singers in their second year compete with other male singers in their second year, etc. The field of singers is narrowed through this audition process to a group of five finalists in each of the 10 collegiate and graduate divisions. While this only represents a two-day snapshot each year of the college singers throughout the region, the results over several years indicate a clear trend. The students at Baylor stand apart from their peers. Of a possible 840 named collegiate divisional finalists at the Texoma Region NATS Student Auditions from 2001 to present, Baylor has produced more NATS finalists than any other university in our region. Baylor University - 161 (16.6%) Stephen F. Austin University - 88 (9.1%) University of North Texas - 86 (8.9%) Southern Methodist University - 84 (8.7%) Oklahoma City University - 62 (6.4%) University of Texas-San Antonio - 60 (6.2%) Texas Christian University - 54 (5.6%) Texas State University - 51 (5.3%) Texas Tech University - 43 (4.4%) Sam Houston State University - 38 (3.9%) University of Mary Hardin-Baylor - 32 (3.3%) University of Oklahoma - 27 (2.8%) Oklahoma State University - 24 (2.5%) West Texas A&M University - 19 (2%) PROFESSIONAL SUCCESS Baylor alumni have not only been successful as students here, but have gone on to great success after their time in the School of Music.
