DragWords Without BordersYi WuZantop Lecture Apply Reset Bruno Carvalho '04 June 30, 2020 Professor Bruno Carvalho, Harvard University works on cities as lived and imagined spaces. He studies relationships between cultural practices and urbanization, specializing on Brazil from the eighteenth century onward. Carvalho's interdisciplinary approaches bridge history, literary analysis, and urban studies. At Harvard, Carvalho is Co-Director of the Harvard Mellon Urban Initiative, a member of the Faculty Advisory Committees on Ethnicity, Migration, Rights, and in the Brazil Studies Program, as well as a Faculty Affiliate of the Afro-Latin American Research Institute, the Center for the Environment, the Graduate School of Design, and the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs. He recently published The Amazon Will Soon Burn Again, New York Times, May 27, 2020 [more] Brett D. Wilson, '92 January 17, 2012 I graduated from Dartmouth in 1992 with a degree in Comp Lit. From there I went on to earn a PhD from UPenn, finishing in 2003, and I'm now a recently tenured Associate Professor of English at the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, VA. I thought that the Comp Lit program might be interested to know that my book on 18th-century British drama, A Race of Female Patriots: Women and Public Spirit on the British Stage, 1688-1745 has just been published by Bucknell University Press. And my interest in literary scholarship all began with a course with Peter Bien on Odysseus/Ulysses...

There, I supported a team of agents dedicated to finding foreign publishers for American authors and eventually managed translation deals in Eastern Europe and Greece. While the role fed my interest in contemporary literature, translation, and foreign cultures, and I really enjoyed working in publishing, I always knew that I wanted to be an author, not an agent.

I left Goldman after a year for a position in the Dubai office of Oliver Wyman, an American consultancy, and have stayed with the company for the last two and a half years, though I have since moved back to New York. While at Oliver Wyman, I have worked on projects in four industries across seven countries, and have worked on English-, French-, and Spanish-speaking case teams. [more] Jennifer Gill '01 March 15, 2011 I chose comparative literature because the courses were the most interesting and Comparative Literature seems to attract the best professors from a variety of disciplines. At the time, it seemed like the best of both worlds and I knew that I could figure out how to make sense of it all from a career perspective later. Ten years later, I found myself at INSEAD, one of the top European business schools. To get into INSEAD, you need to speak three languages and have worked abroad.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Comparative Literature Program Undergraduate About the Program Courses Courses Recommended For First Year Students Course Descriptions Major How to Apply Minor in Translation Studies Honors Thesis Program Thesis Timeline Past Theses Awards & Prizes Undergraduate Alumni Undergraduate Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Graduate Overview About the Program Current MA Students How to Apply Degree Requirements Courses Graduate Alumni Graduate Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Academic Achievement Award COLT MA Graduate Handbook News & Events Overview Annual Hoffman Lecture Annual Zantop Memorial Lecture People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
