Those concentrating on language would select at least some of these four courses from the forties; those focusing in culture would select additional courses in the teens; and those interested primarily in literature would design a major with an emphasis on courses in the thirties. Two courses from the LSA+ may be counted toward the major and counted as a culture course. The culminating experience requirement must be satisfied by completing RUSS 71or RUSS 86. In addition, those writing an honors thesis will enroll in RUSS 87, and may also take RUSS 85 as part of their preparation for the thesis.

The courses outside of the Russian department must be approved by the Chair. 2 (two) courses from the LSA+ may be counted toward the major. For the culminating experience course, students may take Russian 71 (with the permission of the instructor) OR, with the approval of the Russian department faculty, designate a course in the Russian department or another department that will serve to satisfy the requirement.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Russian Undergraduate Majors and Minors Majors: Russian Language and Area Studies Minors Courses Course Descriptions Courses by Term Placement Test Awards & Prizes The Solzhenitsyn Prize in Russian The Pray Modern Language Prize in Russian The Richard Sheldon Prize The Honors Program Foreign Study Resources & Opportunities Overview Student Assistant Teacher Opportunities Martin T.
