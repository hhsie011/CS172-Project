This process would apply to an existing employee with a new job responsibility interacting with a minor or for those serving as a volunteer (unpaid staff) on campus. The request for child abuse certifications must be submitted 60 days prior to the start of any activity interacting with minors to ensure ample processing time. Direct managers may request child abuse certifications via noncredit.temple.edu/hrcert. Exceptions A Short-term Activity Disclosure Application may be considered when the defined criteria for its use are met. If an individual will not have one-to-one contact with a minor; if the activity with minors is a one-time occurrence that will not exceed five (5) consecutive calendar days in duration; if the individual will be in the immediate vicinity of a Temple supervising staff member at all times that is authorized to interact with minors, they may submit a Short-term Activity Disclosure Application for consideration (see forms). Volunteer certifications are not valid for employment. The Office of Background Checks and Compliance does not process, collect, analyze or store contractor (non-Temple employee) certifications or those receiving academic credit. It is the responsibility of the program administrator to ensure compliance of contractors and students on campus.
