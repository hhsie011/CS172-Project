Frontlines: Experiences and Lessons Learned in Wuhan, China and New York, USA Beijing Nurses on the COVID-19 Frontlines: Experiences and Lessons Learned in Wuhan, China and New York, USA We are extremely honored to invite nursing educators, scholars, and frontline nurses from Columbia University School of Nursing, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, and Wuhan University School of Health Sciences to share inspiring stories and lessons learned responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. November 25, 2020 There's never been a better time to hear and learn the observations and experiences from frontline nurses in the COVID-19 pandemic which has affected the life and health of more than 59 million people across the world. On November 25 at a webinar hosted by Columbia Global Centers | Beijing and Columbia School of Nursing, educators, scholars, and frontline nurses from Columbia University School of Nursing, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, Wuhan University School of Health Sciences, and Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University shared working procedures and experience at the makeshifts/field hospitals in Wuhan from the scratch, professional care circle to relief burnout, nursing education and capacity building in the frontline, as well as inspiring stories and lessons learned for a better preparedness for the future crises and more. In the meanwhile, the discussion also reminds us to cope with the “pandemic fatigue” and be responsible to maintain the public health security and protect the frontline healthcare providers. There are also great opportunities for collaboration in education and research to fight in solidarity for better public health preparedness.
