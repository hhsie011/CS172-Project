Degree offerings include the Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Art and Design, Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) in Integrated Studio Arts, and Master of Fine Arts (MFA) in Integrated Visual Arts. BFA Integrated Studio Arts (ISA) (Fine/Studio Arts) Students will select from ISA's studio options including ceramics, digital media, drawing, furniture/wood design, illustration, jewelry and metalsmithing, scientific illustration, mixed media, new genres, painting, photography, printmaking, and textiles. Over the four-year course of study students will develop a portfolio and prepare for a professional practice in the visual arts. This concentration engages aesthetics, visual problem-solving, critical thinking, and skill development, drawing on historical and cultural theory, contemporary trends, and studio practice. Transfer students with studio credits from other colleges and universities may present a portfolio of work created in those courses to determine if these credits can be applied toward specific studio requirements. Students will present this portfolio upon admission and prior to registration for classes. Arrangements for this process should be made with the department's academic advisors. The department offers an undergraduate minor in Illustration and participates in the undergraduate minors in Classical Studies, Critical Studies in Design, Design Studies, Digital Media, and Textile Design.

Application Requirements To apply for this program, please submit the following materials. Digital portfolio: — Twenty (20) images of recent work with no more than four (4) of the images being details — Descriptions on each image need to include title, date, size and medium One-page statement of intent Current resume Name and contact information of three (3) references Graduate Program The department offers the Master of Fine Arts (MFA) in Integrated Visual Arts (IVA). The MFA curriculum in IVA requires a minimum of 60 credits. This MFA is a unique interdisciplinary program offering integrative study among a combination of media areas including ceramics, computer applications, drawing, textiles, illustration, jewelry/metalsmithing, painting, printmaking, photography, furniture/wood design and areas outside of AVC. The IVA program offers an innovative curriculum aligned with emerging art and design markets. IVA graduates link traditional studio disciplines with interdisciplinary studies. Graduates are prepared as visual artists to enter studio practice, business, higher education, or new interdisciplinary fields. The MFA is recognized as the terminal degree. A required thesis exhibition is composed of two parts: a substantial solo exhibition; and a written thesis statement that describes the development of the work in the exhibition, its objectives, and its historical and cultural points of reference. A written thesis with no exhibition component may be an appropriate alternative, but some portion of the work should entail an element of creative problem-solving in the form of a visual product. Upon completion of the graduate program IVA graduates are expected to: Have developed a fully realized creative direction which provides a platform for continued professional research and growth, and visual expression; Have produced a body of work which demonstrates a high level of creative investigation and accomplishment; Have acquired a professional level of technical proficiency in one or more media areas; Effectively communicate their ideas verbally and in writing; Understand the context, both historical and current, within which their creative pursuits exist; Have developed a well-formed and informed personal creative philosophy and a strong studio skill set; Understand current and relevant ethical, ecological, and social issues; and Use relevant theory in pursuing creative university-level scholarship.
