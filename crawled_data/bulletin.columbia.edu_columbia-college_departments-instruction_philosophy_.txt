Because philosophy treats issues fundamental to both the sciences and the humanities, students are also welcome to combine their philosophy major with work in other fields. Before declaring a major in philosophy or economics-philosophy, and before deciding to combine philosophy with another discipline, students should meet with the director of undergraduate studies to formulate the program best for them. Philosophy majors are given a foundation in logic and philosophical methodology, and are asked to confront fundamental questions in the main areas of philosophy: epistemology and metaphysics, ethics and political philosophy, philosophy of mind and language, and history of philosophy. The department requires that all majors take at least one seminar (PHIL UN3912), designed to allow students to focus on particular philosophical issues or texts in greater depth. Outstanding seniors may also pursue their own philosophical project in a senior thesis. Over and above the courses required of all majors, there is room for considerable flexibility. Through an appropriate choice of electives from among the department’s offerings (and from related courses in other departments), there are special opportunities for focusing more intensively on one or two subfields of philosophy, e.g., logic and the philosophy of mathematics, philosophy of science, ethics and political philosophy, or the history of philosophy. Students should consult with the director of undergraduate studies on how best to pursue such programs. Study Abroad: Reid Hall, Paris For information on the Columbia in Paris Program at Reid Hall, including summer courses, consult the Columbia University in Paris Bulletin (available in 606 Kent and online at the Office of Global Programs website), call 212-854-2559, or send an email to reidhall@columbia.edu. For information on applicability of Reid Hall courses to the major or concentration, consult the director of undergraduate studies. Grading Courses in which a grade of D has been received do not count toward the major or concentration requirements. Senior Thesis Undergraduates majoring in Philosophy or Economics-Philosophy may propose to write a senior thesis. Students who wish to write a thesis should approach a faculty member at the end of their junior or beginning of their senior year, and begin working on the proposal early in the fall semester of their senior year. Proposals are due in early December, and will be reviewed by a committee which will include the Director of Undergraduate Studies; students will be notified of the committee’s decision within two weeks. Students whose proposals are approved should register for their faculty advisor’s section of Supervised Independent Research for the spring term of the senior year. Theses are due in early April. Students who have a grade point average of 3.6 or above in the major and who complete a thesis will be placed into consideration for departmental honors, though any senior may complete a thesis regardless of their grade point average (upon approval of the proposal). See the full policy and procedure concerning senior theses on the departmental webpage: http://philosophy.columbia.edu/content/senior-thesis-philosophy Departmental Honors Departmental honors are highly competitive. Normally no more than 10% of the majors graduating in the department each year will receive departmental honors. In order to qualify for departmental honors in philosophy, a student must have a grade point average of at least 3.6 in the major. For students with a GPA of 3.6 or above, there are two possible routes to consideration: A student may complete a senior thesis; those students who complete senior theses will automatically be considered for honors without having to be nominated. A student may be nominated by a faculty member early in the spring semester of the senior year; nominated students will be invited to submit a writing sample at least 15 pages in length. A nominated student who is also writing a thesis may submit their thesis as the writing sample, or may choose to submit a different work. Both the senior theses and writing samples are due in early April. The departmental honors committee will then review the submitted material and the academic records of the writers, and will report to the full faculty. The full faculty will then decide which students to recommend for departmental honors to the Columbia College and General Studies administrations.

All majors must consult with the director of undergraduate studies each term before registering for classes in order to plan and update their individual programs of study. Students planning to major in philosophy are advised to begin with PHIL UN1010 METHDS/PROB OF PHILOS THOUGHT. Beginning students are especially encouraged to take 2000-level courses, both in the history of philosophy and in systematic philosophy. These courses are typically less specialized and less narrowly focused than higher-numbered ones. More advanced students are encouraged to take 3000-level courses. The department requires that all majors take at least one seminar, PHIL UN3912. No more than one course at the 1000-level can be counted toward the major. In order to enroll in one of the 4000-level courses, students must have taken at least four courses in Philosophy. The major requires a minimum of 30 points in philosophy chosen from courses prefixed with UN or GU: Course List Code Title Points PHIL UN2101 The History of Philosophy I: Presocratics to Augustine PHIL UN2201 History of Philosophy II: Aquinas to Kant PHIL UN3411 SYMBOLIC LOGIC At least one course in either metaphysics or epistemology e.g., PHIL W3960, or a related course to be chosen in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies. Select at least one course in either ethics or social and political philosophy from the following: PHIL UN2702 Contemporary Moral Problems PHIL UN3701 ETHICS PHIL UN3751 SOCIAL ＆ POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY A related course to be chosen in consultation with the director of undergradute studies. PHIL UN3912 SEMINAR Concentration in Philosophy Philosophy, as an academic discipline, has significant points of contact with a wide range of other subjects—in the humanities, the social sciences, and the natural sciences. A concentration in philosophy thus can be an attractive option for many students. Those considering becoming concentrators are strongly encouraged to meet with the director of undergraduate studies early in their sophomore year, in order to discuss their specific interests and to plan their programs of study. All concentrators should consult with the director of undergraduate studies each term before registering for courses. The concentration requires a minimum of 24 points in philosophy, chosen from courses prefixed with UN or GU. There are no specific courses required for the concentration. Students may choose courses prefixed with GR only with the instructor’s permission. PHIL UN3912 is open to junior and senior concentrators who have taken at least four courses in philosophy. Major in Economics-Philosophy Please read Guidelines for all Economics Majors, Concentrators, and Interdepartmental Majors in the Economics section of this Bulletin. Economics-Philosophy is an interdisciplinary major that, while introducing students to the basic methodologies of economics and philosophy, stresses areas of particular concern to both. These include subjects such as rationality and decision making, justice and efficiency, freedom and collective choice, and the logic of empirical theories and their testing. Many of the issues are dealt with historically, and classic texts of Plato, Kant, Mill, Marx, and Smith are reviewed. Two advisers are assigned for the interdepartmental major, one in the Department of Economics and one in the Department of Philosophy. Please note that the Economics adviser can only advise on the Economics requirements and the Philosophy adviser can only advise on the Philosophy requirements. The Economics-Philosophy major requires a total minimum of 54 points: 25 points in Economics, 16 points in Philosophy, 6 points in Mathematics, 3 points in Statistics, and 4 points in the interdisciplinary seminar as follows: Course List Code Title Points Economics Core Courses ECON UN1105 Principles of Economics ECON UN3211 Intermediate Microeconomics ECON UN3213 Intermediate Macroeconomics ECON UN3412 Introduction To Econometrics Mathematics Sequence Select a mathematics sequence Statistics Select a statistics course Economics Electives Three electives are required; refer to the Economics section of this bulletin.

Buddhist philosophers generally agree about what doesn’t exist: an enduring, unitary, and independent self. But there is surprisingly little consensus across Buddhist traditions about what does exist and what it’s like. In this course, we will examine several Buddhist theories about the nature and structure of reality and consider the epistemological and ethical implications of these radically different pictures of the world. We will analyze and evaluate arguments from some of the most influential Indian Buddhist philosophers from the second to the eleventh centuries, including Nāgārjuna, Vasubandhu, Dignāga, Candrakīrti, Śāntarakṣita, Śāntideva, and Ratnakīrti. Topics will include the existence and nature of the external world, the mind, and the self; practical and epistemological implications of the Buddhist no-self principle; personal identity; the problem of other minds; and causal determinism and moral responsibility Fall 2022: PHIL UN3000 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment PHIL 3000 001/15015 M W 2:40pm - 3:55pm 716 Philosophy Hall Allison Aitken 3.00 0/20 PHIL UN3264 19th Century Philosophy: Hegel. 3 points.

Six major concepts of political philosophy including authority, rights, equality, justice, liberty and democracy are examined in three different ways. First the conceptual issues are analyzed through contemporary essays on these topics by authors like Peters, Hart, Williams, Berlin, Rawls and Schumpeter. Second the classical sources on these topics are discussed through readings from Hobbes, Locke, Hume, Marx, Plato, Mill and Rousseau. Third some attention is paid to relevant contexts of application of these concepts in political society, including such political movements as anarchism, international human rights, conservative, liberal, and Marxist economic policies as well as competing models of democracy Fall 2022: PHIL UN3751 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment PHIL 3751 001/11484 T Th 8:40am - 9:55am 716 Philosophy Hall Axel Honneth 3.00 35/35 PHIL UN3756 Critical Philosophy of Race: What is Race?. 3 points. This course is a philosophical examination of the meaning and significance of the concept of race. The course will chiefly aim to answer: What do we mean by the term “race”? And why is it often tied to the existence of racism? From where does the concept come? And what role did “race” play in the philosophical thought and the culture of Western modernity? Among the questions that can be asked are, How do concepts of race contribute to the formation and justification of various economic, political, and social institutions and practices, such as slavery, colonialism, and segregation? However, we will also inquire at the end of the course whether “race” is always a destructive concept, or whether it can be re-defined as part of a liberation project centered on racial identity: the appreciation and celebration of racial difference and solidarity.

Especially in times when happiness seems difficult to find, we naturally want to know what happiness is and how best to secure it. In this course, we will consider happiness in relation to well-being, examining four major theories of well-being (hedonism, desire-fulfillment theories, objective list theories, and eudaimonism/perfectionism). We will gain a nuanced understanding of each view by juxtaposing their ancient and modern advocates and opponents Fall 2022: PHIL UN3863 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment PHIL 3863 001/13034 W 12:10pm - 2:00pm 716 Philosophy Hall Anthony Marsh 3.00 15/15 PHIL UN3912 SEMINAR. 3.00 points.

Artificial intelligence (AI) promises—or threatens—to transform every area of our lives and societies. It has already begun to upend our understanding of human nature, radically alter our social institutions, and revolutionize scientific practice. And in some circles, there is increasing concern that AI is developing intelligence to rival our own. This course will explore these issues through the philosophy of mind, cognitive science, and ethics. We will ask whether AI systems could have minds like ours, whether they could be conscious, whether they might eventually deserve moral consideration, and how we can use them fairly in our current societies Spring 2022: PHIL UN3870 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment PHIL 3870 001/14710 W 12:10pm - 2:00pm 716 Philosophy Hall Andrew Richmond 3.00 15/15 PHIL UN3912 SEMINAR. 3.00 points.

This course is a philosophical examination of the meaning and significance of the concept of race. The course will chiefly aim to answer: What do we mean by the term “race”? And why is it often tied to the existence of racism? From where does the concept come? And what role did “race” play in the philosophical thought and the culture of Western modernity? Among the questions that can be asked are, How do concepts of race contribute to the formation and justification of various economic, political, and social institutions and practices, such as slavery, colonialism, and segregation? However, we will also inquire at the end of the course whether “race” is always a destructive concept, or whether it can be re-defined as part of a liberation project centered on racial identity: the appreciation and celebration of racial difference and solidarity.

In his Theses on Feuerbach, Karl Marx writes, “Philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it.” The questions to ask in response to Marx’s exhortation include: how do we recognize the need for change and appropriately effect it? What are the relations between our goals and the means to them? How can we better understand our goals to make the means more suitable? When we organize to produce results, what are we doing? Do we know exactly who and what we want to change? What are the “ethics of process”? What exactly do we do when we organize? A tentative definition: to organize is to bring together individuals who have common interests in a way that will enhance their power. What kind of power is this? What other forms of power are there? What is the best form of coordinating among individuals? If we better understand the dynamics of organizing, should we reconceive our goals accordingly? How do we better tap into shared values and concerns? What temptations and distractions get in the way of our goals? What problems prevent us from achieving them? Do we have goals that can be achieved? If not, how can we revise them?
