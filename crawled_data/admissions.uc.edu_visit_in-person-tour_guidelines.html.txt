Indoor Masking Requirement Following updated CDC guidance, facial masking is now optional, except in classrooms and labs, for UC faculty, staff and students. Beginning March 12, 2022, all masking restrictions will be eliminated including in classroom and labs, as long as rates of hospitalization and transmissibility remain in the low-to-medium zones. It is important to note: Masks will continue to be required on UC operated transportation, in clinical settings and for at least 10 days after an exposure to COVID-19 or a COVID-19 diagnosis, regardless of vaccination status.
