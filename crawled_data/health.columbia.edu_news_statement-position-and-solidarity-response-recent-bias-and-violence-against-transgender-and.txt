Editor's note: Updated on June 25, 2021 to include changes in federal policy. By Transgender and Gender Expansive Team at Columbia Health August 31, 2020 Columbia Health and Transgender and Gender Expansive Team (TGET) welcome the U.S. Department of Education’s June 2021 confirmation that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity is prohibited under Title IX and encourage governmental efforts that would facilitate the ability for LGBTQ individuals facing bias-fueled violence in their home countries to be granted asylum in the United States. In addition, Columbia Health and TGET oppose recently proposed, and in some cases passed, anti-trans legislation prohibiting the ability of medical providers to provide gender-affirming care to transgender and gender expansive children and adolescents. In addition, TGET at Columbia Health stands in solidarity with activists across the United States and beyond in response to anti-Black violence. Black Lives Matter and Black Trans Lives Matter and we honor the lives of those we’ve lost including Nina Pop, Riah Martin, Tony McDade, Dominique “Rem’mie” Fells, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, Oluwatoyin Salah, Ahmaud Marquez Arbery, Rayshard Brooks, and so many others. TGET, an interdisciplinary group of clinicians and health professionals at Columbia Health, remains committed to working collaboratively with and providing gender-affirming resources, services, and support to Columbia’s transgender and gender expansive students. Further, this commitment is inclusive of continual self-reflection, evaluation, and advocacy on the part of our staff to work towards the highest standard of care. The following resources may be helpful to students seeking support around some of these concerns (note: this is not an exhaustive list; please contact TGET for more resources and support): [email protected] Counseling and Psychological Services Support Groups Sylvia Rivera Law Project Transgender Law Center Lambda Legal Immigration Equality Transgender Legal Defense Fund News May 23, 2022 Commencement Honors for Columbia Health SVP, Dr. Melanie Bernitz April 25, 2022 Columbia Health Releases its 2020-21 Annual Report April 25, 2022 Dr. Michael McNeil, Chief of Administration for Columbia Health, included in Inside HigherEd article March 21, 2022 Our opposition to ongoing efforts to harm the lives and well-being of trans and queer people March 16, 2022 Making decisions about your well-being amid changing COVID-19 public health guidance Columbia Health Administration Wallach Hall, Suite 125, Mail Code 4202, 1116 Amsterdam Avenue · New York, NY 10027 Phone 212-854-2284 Contact Us [email protected] Internal Use Only Login to Access Follow Us Facebook Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
