The library includes materials on the history of preaching, the practice of preaching, pastoral ministry, and numerous volumes of collected sermons. Search the library catalog online and check out a book in person in Room 315 at Truett Seminary. The John Newport Preaching Collection Former Baylor professor and renowned Baptist preacher Dr. John P. Newport accumulated a collection of titles related to preaching over the course of his career. Many of the volumes were purchased from used bookstores in Scotland while Newport was completing his Ph.D. at the University of Edinburgh in the 1950s. He considered his collection "one of the finest collections of Christian preaching in the English language at the time." Thanks to the generosity of Newport's former student and friend, Mark Brister, the John Newport Preaching Collection is housed in the office of the Kyle Lake Center. Guests may view the collection in person or access the list of titles online. Digital Resources Sermons by George W. Truett Baylor University's Digital Collections has shared 66 previously unreleased sermons by George W. Truett. The collection contains 33 hours of audio and 258,000+ transcribed words of Dr. Truett's final two full years in the pulpit (1941-1943). Publications The Truett Pulpit previously existed as a bound annual anthology of sermons by Truett faculty and/or outstanding chapel speakers. It is distributed free of charge or it can be accessed in digital form. Sabbatical Program The Sabbatical Program offers pastors an opportunity to spend one to four weeks in residence as a Fellow of the Center with access to all center programs, resources, and guided reading and/or individualized study program designed specifically for the sabbaticant.
