What can—and do—statistical models tell us about who the winner will be? Does our electoral system need reform? How does the rest of the world view the latest developments in the American experiment? Political scientist Andrew Gelman (Department of Statistics and the School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University), discusses his election modeling system (published weekly in The Economist magazine) and electoral system reform with host Professor Safwan M. Masri, Executive Vice President for Global Centers and Global Development, Columbia University. Joining the discussion will be Wen-kuni Ceant (Winnie), Fulbright Scholar and CEO of Politicking, and Zachary Kimmel, Columbia College '21, founder and outreach director of Columbia Votes. Introducing the event and moderating students’ questions and answers will be Shannon Marquez, Dean of Undergraduate Global Engagement. Columbia students who are active in current election campaigns and in electoral reform will add their on-the-ground perspectives on their work and what is at stake. Global Columbia Collaboratory students will provide questions that will help frame the discussion, and Global Center Directors from around the world will offer their regional perspectives on these U.S. elections.
