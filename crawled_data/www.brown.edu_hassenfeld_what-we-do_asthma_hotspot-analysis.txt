The purpose of this project is to geographically identify hot spots for asthma and examine neighborhood characteristics associated with asthma. Specific Aims 1. Identify geographic hot spots for asthma. 2. Examine neighborhood characteristics associated with asthma and other environmentally-mediated health conditions. Future Goals, Outcomes and Next Steps The mapping is important locally for guiding interventions and should also contribute to the scientific literature. We have mapped and performed spatial analysis on a decade of data from all Lifespan hospitals, including Hasbro Children’s Hospital. We are now focused on examining claims data from the Rhode Island Medicaid program.
