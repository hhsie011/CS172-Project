Tyler Sculpture majors join a warm community of bold thinkers and makers who, through intense study of theory and the exploration of materials and media, become critical thinkers and problem solvers. Students develop technical proficiency and gain practical knowledge of technology, including robotics, digital fabrication, video editing, woodworking, metalworking and more. Tyler offers access to the region's vibrant contemporary art scene in Philadelphia and nearby cities like New York and Washington, D.C. Students graduate to become socially-conscious practicing artists, find employment in education, industrial design, fabrication and more and earn placements in top graduate programs.
