Dr. Wilson graduated from Harvard College and Harvard Medical School. He completed a Primary Care Internal Medicine residency program at Beth Israel in Boston, MA, where he then served as Chief Medical Resident. He was a General Medicine Fellow and received an Sc.M. in Epidemiology from the Harvard School of Public Health. In 1993 he joined the faculty at Tufts Medical Center where he rose to the rank of Professor in 2006. In 2010, he moved to Brown to become Chair of the Department of Health Services, Policy and Practice at the School of Public Health. Dr. Wilson is the Co-Director of the Professional Development Core of the Providence/Boston Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) and Director of the Professional Development Key Component of the Rhode Island Institutional Development Award in Clinical and Translational Research (IDeA-CTR). He has two active R01 awards from NIMH to study aspects of HIV and aging. Dr. Wilson’s main research interests are in how structural features of healthcare systems affect the interactions between physicians and patients, and how those interactions in turn affect patients' health outcomes. He has studied patients with chronic conditions such as the elderly, persons with depression, and persons with HIV. In recent years, his research has focused on understanding and improving the quality of medication prescribing and medication management, the development and testing of interventions to improve adherence, and aspects of HIV and aging. He is national Co-Chair of the Behavioral Science Advisory Group that provides input to the five international HIV clinical trials groups funded by the NIH Division of AIDS, and a member of the National Board of the HIV Medicine Association. In 2014, he was appointed by Governor Raimondo to be Co-Chair of the “Working group to Reinvent Medicaid” in Rhode Island, and has been a member of a number of subsequent groups appointed by the Governor to reform health care in the state.

Full Text PubMed Research Research Overview Dr. Wilson is interested in how structural features of healthcare systems affect the interactions between physicians and patients, and how those interactions in turn affect patients' health outcomes. To study these relationships he has studied patients with chronic conditions such as the elderly, persons with depression, and persons with HIV. Recently he his research has focused on understanding and improving the quality of medication prescribing and medication management. Research Statement Dr. Wilson is a Professor and Chairman of the Department of Health Services, Policy & Practice in the Public Health Program at Brown University, as well as a practicing primary care physician. His is also a Professor of Medicine. His research interests are in structural elements of health care delivery systems, and how these structural elements affect patients' experience of their care, physician-patient interactions, patients' health outcomes, and medication adherence. Dr. Wilson is particularly interested in methodological aspects of adherence measurement and in physician and system-focused interventions to improve adherence. In collaboration with Dr. Bart Laws, Dr. Wilson has developed and tested a new method, the General Medical Interaction Analysis System (GMIAS), to code audiotapes of physician-patient office visits for antiretroviral medication adherence and other specific content. In a related project funded by PCORI, Drs. Laws and Wilson extended the GMIAS to better understand shared decision-making in medical subspecialty visits. In work funded by NIMH, Dr. Wilson and his team developed and validated a new, 3-item self-report scale to quantify medication adherence that is being used in studies around the world. In a new series of projects funded by NIMH, Dr. Wilson and his team are examining aspects of HIV and ageing using a large, longitudinal Medicaid claims dataset. One focus of this work it to understand the impact of comorbid conditions on aging and health care utilization for persons with HIV. Another focus is to explore the quality of care that persons with HIV receive in nursing homes in the US. Dr. Wilson is the Co-Director of the Providence/Boston Center for AIDS Research (CFAR, http://www.ltbcfar.org/), and also the Director of the Professional Development Key Component of the Rhode Island Institutional Development Award in Clinical and Translational Research (IDeA-CTR, https://www.brown.edu/about/administration/biomed/clinical-translational-science/).
