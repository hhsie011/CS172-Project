A well known tattooist living in Oaxaca, Dr. Lakra also makes drawings and collages on top of pages from vintage magazines, advertisements, and pin-up posters. His intricate drawings borrow from stock tattoo imagery such as nudes, skulls and dragons as well as from pre-Columbian art and Surrealism. Lakra used a tattoo needle and tattoo machine to draw the lines on the etchings plates for two prints he made at the Nemain Center. Jerómino López Ramirez, better known as Dr. Lakra, was born in Mexico City in 1972. From 1988 - 1991, he was an active participant in Taller de los viernes, a weekly meeting of artists held at the home of Gabriel Orozco where a number of artistic and cultural projects took shape. Dr. Lakra’s work has been the subject of solo exhibitions at the Drawing Center, NY, Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, and exhibited widely throughout the United States, Mexico and Europe at venues such as Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Oaxaca (MACO), Oacaca, Mexico and Tate Modern, London, England. His work is in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, Hammer Museum, Los Angeles, and the Walker Center for the Arts, Minneapolis, among others.
