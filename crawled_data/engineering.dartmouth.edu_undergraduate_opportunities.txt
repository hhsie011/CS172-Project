On This Page Research Opportunities Undergrads in the Lab Entrepreneurship Opportunities Research Opportunities There are several ways undergraduates can participate in research projects. First Year Research in Engineering ﻿Experience The First Year Research in Engineering Experience (FYREE) program provides first-year undergraduates and prospective engineering majors with early hands-on experience and mentoring within engineering. Learn More Women in Science Project Dartmouth's Women in Science (WISP) Research Internship Program matches undergraduate women with paid, part-time research internships in STEM. Open to first-year and sophomore women, WISP provides early hands-on, research experience and mentoring from a Dartmouth faculty or a research scientist. Learn More Honors Program Engineering majors with a grade point average of 3.33 in their major, with an overall GPA of 3.0, are eligible for admission to the Honors Program in Engineering Sciences. Honors students have the opportunity to complete independent research under the guidance of engineering faculty. Learn More Research Project Assistant Dartmouth faculty hire undergraduate assistants in their labs to work alongside and support graduate and post-doctoral researchers with active research. Students have had opportunities to contribute to ongoing research on sustainable energy solutions in the arctic, biofuels, or wearable medical technologies. Learn More Undergrads in the Lab See Video Playlist Dartmouth undergraduate students talk about their research on fusion energy, HIV/AIDS, space weather prediction, and more. Entrepreneurship Opportunities Intern at one of the many companies founded by engineering faculty. "We have interns working side-by-side with company scientists. The students want to do things in the lab, and the beauty is that they get to see the big picture and contribute." —Professor Tillman Gerngross, Co-founder of GlycoFi (now part of Merck, Inc.), Adimab, Arsanis, Avitide, Alector, and Adagio. Work in a Faculty Startup Half of our tenure-track faculty are entrepreneurs, and many engineering students begin their careers by working alongside their professors. See Faculty Startups "Undergraduate assistants have been a key asset in my efforts to assemble a team of highly intelligent, creative, and productive researchers. Undergraduate students have been deeply involved in several of the lab’s ongoing projects, including some that we hope to publish in the near future. As a result, I have found that training good undergraduate assistants is a win-win situation: They have the opportunity to work in a cutting edge biotechnology laboratory and develop a set of research skills that will jump-start their future career plans, while I gain a highly motivated assistant who contributes to, and in some cases independently drives, our short term and long term research goals." — Professor Karl Griswold 15 Thayer Drive, Hanover, NH 03755 +1 (603) 646-2230 Undergraduate Graduate Research Entrepreneurship Community About ThayerExpress Faculty Offices Visit Apply Give Facebook Instagram Twitter LinkedIn YouTube Flickr © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • A-Z Index • Privacy • Feedback
