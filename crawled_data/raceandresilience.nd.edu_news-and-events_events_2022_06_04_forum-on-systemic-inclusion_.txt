Open to all members of the campus community, including students, faculty, staff, alumni, and all reunion attendees. Learn how Notre Dame can become a leader in continuing the transformation to a sustainable, systemically inclusive culture that benefits and supports all student populations. Your participation will help ND become a truly inclusive community and a beacon for others. The forum will address questions such as: How far has the ND student-of-color experience come in the past 50 years? What can be done to build an inclusive culture on campus? How can ND become a model for other communities? How can ND alumni help build a legacy of inclusion for all? Speakers Bill Hurd, M.D. ’69 B.S. Electrical Engineering; M.S. Management MIT; M.D. Meharry Medical College Ophthalmologist, Memphis, TN Bill majored in electrical engineering at ND and was a world‐class sprinter on the track team as well as a jazz saxophone virtuoso.
