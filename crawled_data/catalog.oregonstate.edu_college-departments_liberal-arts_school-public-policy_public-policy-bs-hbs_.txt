The discipline of public policy is closely connected to the practice of policy and this program ensures that students interact with policy-makers as well as the knowledge-producers who support policy decisions. Graduates of the BSPP will have the skills necessary for understanding the political, economic, and social constraints faced by policy makers, assessing the performance of alternative approaches to policy implementation, evaluating the effectiveness of policies, and appreciating the sharp conflicts in fundamental human values that animate critical policy debates. The Public Policy Major will provide students with a set of research, analytical, and management skills that will be transferable across sectors and across issue areas. The undergraduate program will prepare graduates for a career not only in public service (federal, state, and local government), but also in not-for-profit and for-profit organizations, as well as admissions to competitive graduate programs in a wide range of programs through which they may further broaden their intellectual and practical experience and expertise. The BSPP is designed with an emphasis on substantive interdisciplinary knowledge about important policy issues, analytic skills, and policy practice. Students will have the opportunity to pursue their individual interests and passion in specialization areas, each of which is supported by a wealth of experience and expertise in both the School of Public Policy and across the OSU campus. In addition, the degree requires a supervised practicum with a public, non-profit, private, or international organization. Major Code: 801 Apply social science methods and policy analysis to practical problems of government, communities, regions, and/or global issues. Demonstrate the ability to apply oral and written communication skills in public appearances, written reports and documents. Follow ethical principles for citing sources, using human subjects, serving the public, and working with colleagues. Develop critical thinking about public policy issues and the ability to conduct professional analyses of social, political, and economic structures and bureaucratic processes.
