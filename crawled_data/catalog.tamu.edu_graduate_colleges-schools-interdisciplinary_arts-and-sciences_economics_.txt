Puller PhD Advisor: A. Glass MS Advisor: L. Gan Graduate study in economics leads to the degrees of Master of Science or Doctor of Philosophy. The graduate program develops theoretical and quantitative skills and analyzes a broad range of contemporary policy issues in order to prepare students for careers in academe, business and government. Both MS and PhD degrees are offered. It is not necessary to have a master’s degree before beginning a doctoral program. To enter the doctoral program in economics, the student should present undergraduate credits in economics, although an undergraduate major in economics is not necessary. Additional preparation should include work in mathematics and statistics. The department has no foreign language requirement for a graduate degree in economics.
