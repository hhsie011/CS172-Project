Please contact the major programs for more information on how they plan to continue offering the P3 model of training. ** New methods to increase crop productivity are required to meet anticipated demands for food, feed, fiber, and fuel. Using modern sensors and data analysis techniques, it is now feasible to develop methods to predict plant growth and productivity based on information about their genome and environment. However, doing so requires expertise in plant sciences as well as computational sciences and engineering. Read more about News P3 trainee, Kevin Chiteri, receives C.R.
