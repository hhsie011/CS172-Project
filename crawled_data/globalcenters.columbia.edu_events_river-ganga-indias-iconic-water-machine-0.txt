It is also a highly engineered hydrological super-surface. Human activity combined with the dynamic nature of the monsoons has resulted in the river undergoing radical physical changes every year. For any future directive regarding the development and management of the Ganga to be effective, capturing this dynamism is essential. Columbia Global Centers | Mumbai and the American Center, invite you to the exhibition ‘The River Ganga: India’s Iconic Water Machine,’ researched and designed by Dr. Anthony Acciavatti from the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation (GSAPP) at Columbia University. By combining techniques from the arts and sciences, Acciavatti has created the first comprehensive visual profile of the Ganga River Basin in 50 years. This exhibition is a curated excerpt of his systematic, decade-long mapping of the basin’s infrastructural transformation that resulted in more than 25,000 photographs, 15 sketchbooks’ worth of drawings, 1,000 journal entries, and 350 original charts. About Anthony Acciavatti Dr. Anthony Acciavatti is Adjunct Assistant Professor at Columbia University’s Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation. He is the author of the award winning Ganges Water Machine: Designing New India’s Ancient River, the first comprehensive visualization and history of the Ganga River basin in half a century. His work on the Ganga has been exhibited in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Dr. Acciavatti’s work spans the disciplines of science, art, architecture, engineering, and history. In particular, he studies how we claim knowledge of the environment through drawings, models, and direct experience. He holds degrees from Harvard and Princeton universities as well as the Rhode Island School of Design. He has also taught at Princeton University and the Rhode Island School of Design. He is currently a Mellon Fellow at Princeton University where he is working on a book and film about the monsoons. Mapping the River Ganga Find out more about the Mumbai Center's 18-month project.
