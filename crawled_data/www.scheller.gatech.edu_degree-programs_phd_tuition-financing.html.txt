Our low tuition costs make Georgia Tech one of the more reasonably priced educational options in the United States. Financial Support All incoming students, regardless of need and background, are awarded a graduate research assistantship (GRA) that includes a tuition waiver and a living stipend of $30,000. The GRA provides a waiver for out-of-state tuition and a substantial reduction of in-state tuition and fees, resulting in a final cost of approximately $1,300 per semester. Students are guaranteed funding for up to five years. In addition, financial support for research and conference attendance is provided. The responsibilities for graduate assistant positions vary and may include research, tutoring students, or administrative tasks. All financial aid awards are contingent upon a student's satisfactory academic progress. The deadline to apply for consideration for a graduate assistantship is Jan. 6. All applicants are automatically considered for graduate research assistantships; no separate application is required. In addition to graduate assistantships, other forms of financial aid available to PhD students are below. President's Fellowship President's Fellowships were established in 1973 to enhance the scope and quality of Georgia Tech's Ph.D. programs. Through the continued support of the Georgia Tech Foundation, President's Fellowships are offered annually to a select number of highly qualified U.S. citizens or permanent residents who intend to pursue doctoral degrees. A President's Fellowship offers $5,500 per year, in addition to the College’s graduate assistantship, plus a waiver of tuition, for three semesters per year for a total of four years. Fellowship recipients bring exemplary levels of scholarship and innovation to the academic departments that host their study and research. In turn, the fellowship program assists these students in preparing themselves with minimum delay for outstanding careers in the discipline of their choice. Scholarships and Financial Aid Georgia Tech offers financial assistance from a variety of sources. To be considered for scholarships awarded by the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid, you must complete a financial aid application (FAFSA) and the Georgia Tech Application for Scholarships and Financial Aid each year. Contact the Office of Student Financial Planning and Services at 404.894.4160 for the appropriate forms. Scheller College of Business Home Why Scheller?
