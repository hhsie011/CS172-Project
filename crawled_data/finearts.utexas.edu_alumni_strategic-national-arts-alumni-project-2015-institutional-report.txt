APPLY GET INVOLVED Search this Website Search Strategic National Arts Alumni Project 2015 Institutional Report Every five years, the College of Fine Arts participates in the Strategic National Arts Alumni Project (SNAAP), which gives us valuable insight into the educational experiences and professional outcomes of our alumni and allows us to benchmark against our peers, both public and private. Since 2008, SNAAP has collected and analyzed data from over 200,000 arts graduates from across North America. More than 300 colleges and universities have participated in the study, and SNAAP data have been used for assessment, curriculum reform, recruitment, benchmarking, alumni engagement, advocacy and more. The survey asks arts alumni questions about their experience in their program at UT, the skills they gained, what they’re doing now, how much student debt they accrued, how long it took them to find their first job, how satisfied they are in their current job or profession, their salaries, whether they continue to maintain an artistic practice and much more. Below, we share some highlights from College of Fine Arts alumni who participated in the most recent 2015 SNAAP survey. (We will survey our alumni again in 2020.)
