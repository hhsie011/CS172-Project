Most of the activities are designed for the beginner level. Intermediate/ advanced courses are offered at selected times. All courses are designed to develop and/or improve skills and knowledge, increase physical activity, and promote well-being. Courses aim to promote holistic, sustainable opportunities to engage with physical activity and physical well-being concepts. A major goal is to provide a positive, enjoyable experience for students, leading to the development of an active, healthy lifestyle. The majority of the courses are offered in ten time preferences. However, there are early morning conditioning activities, Friday-only classes at Baker Athletics Complex, and special courses that utilize off-campus facilities during weekends. A description of the scheduled activities for each time preference is included in the Department of Physical Education website. A list of the activities for the term is included in the Directory of Classes and on the website. Students may select physical education courses during online registration. Students may register for only one section of Physical Education each term. Physical Education Requirement Successful completion of two Physical Education courses is a Columbia College requirement that students are advised to complete by the end of the first year. Students may elect to take one or two additional terms of Physical Education Activities for credit. Students receive 1 point of academic credit for each completed term of physical education for a possible total of 4 points. For more information on this requirement, please visit the Core Curriculumâ€”Physical Education Requirement section of the bulletin. Medical Conditions Students who request to have their Physical Education activities limited or waived because of a medical condition should contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies for Physical Education. In some situations, students may require an evaluation by a clinician at Health Services at Columbia in order to receive a waiver. In consultation with the Director of Physical Education, students may be instructed to contact Dr. Melanie Bernitz, Medical Director of Columbia Health Programs, who facilitates these evaluations. Grading The grading in all physical education courses is Pass/Fail. Students who fulfill the attendance and participation requirement receive a Pass. Those who miss more than the permissible number of classes and who do not drop the course by the official drop deadline receive a W (Withdrawal). Those who anticipate attendance problems should contact their instructors or the Director of Undergraduate Studies for Physical Education. Swim Test All students are also required to pass a swimming test or take beginning swimming for one term to fulfill the swimming requirement. A waiver of the swimming test requirement may be granted if a student has a disability certified by a medical authority that precludes swimming. Students may also request waivers and accommodations on the grounds of religious observance or gender identity/expression. All requests for waivers and accommodations are reviewed by the director of physical education. Locker and Towel Service Students have access to a lock/towel service and, with the exception of tennis, equipment for the activities is supplied by the Physical Education Department. Intercollegiate Athletics Students who are participating on an intercollegiate team should register for the appropriate team section of PHED UN1005 Intercollegiate Athletics. Intercollegiate athletes are responsible for taking the swimming test. Student athletes who cannot pass the test should take beginning swimming at the first possible opportunity. Student athletes who register correctly and participate on a team receive a Pass; those who drop off a team in midterm and still wish to receive academic credit must notify the Physical Education Office and be placed in an activity to complete the attendance requirement. Otherwise, the student must officially drop Intercollegiate Athletics or they receive a mark of W (Withdrawal).
