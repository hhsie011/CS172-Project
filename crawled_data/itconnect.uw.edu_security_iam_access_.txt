Contact UW-IT About UW-IT Access management Access Management enables customers to define and manage access policies to provide their users access to online data, resources, and applications. Access management helps you to manage risk and comply with governing policies. In some cases you can also delegate management authority to others. ASTRA (Access to Systems, Tools, Resources and Applications) ASTRA is an access management service that stores authorization information about who can use a variety of UW administrative applications and other resources. UW Groups The UW Groups service (groups.uw.edu) is the central location where UW Groups are created and managed, so that they can be integrated and used in applications. UW Groups support collaboration, communication, sharing and access control by making it easier to reuse groups in your access policies. See also: Access Management in the UW-IT Service Catalog.
