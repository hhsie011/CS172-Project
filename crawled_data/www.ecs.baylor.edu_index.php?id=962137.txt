Battershell Denton Wood Videos Marques Jones Heather Benoit Spotlight Timeline Merchandise Baylor>Engineering & Computer Science>Students & Academics>Student Services>Academic Advising>Academic Actions Academic Actions Decisions regarding Academic Probation/Suspension in the School of Engineering & Computer Science are made by the Assoc. Dean for ECS Undergraduate Programs, Dr. Michael Thompson. Academic Probation At any time a studentâ€™s term and/or cumulative grade point average (GPA) is below 2.0 on a 4.0 scale, the dean of the academic unit in which the student is enrolled will notify the student that he or she will be placed on academic probation during the next term. Any student with 30 or fewer hours who is placed on probation is required to develop and implement an academic improvement plan. Details will be specified in the probation letter from the student's academic dean. Any student on academic probation is required to obtain academic advisement before registering for the next term. If at the end of the probation term both the student's term GPA and cumulative GPA are 2.0 or above, the student will be removed from probation. However, if at the end of a probation term the student's term GPA is 2.0 or above, but the student's cumulative GPA is still below 2.0, the student will be continued on probation until the cumulative GPA also reaches at least a 2.0. Academic Suspension Once a student has served at least one term of academic probation, if the student's term GPA is ever below a 2.0 for a subsequent term, the student will be subject to academic suspension. Any student who is subject to suspension will be informed in writing by the dean of the academic unit in which the student is enrolled that suspension appears to be appropriate. The letter will indicate that the student has seven (7) business days from the date of the letter to provide the dean with relevant information (change of grade, verifiable medical condition, or other circumstances) that might affect the dean's decision. After reviewing the student's academic records and other relevant information supplied to the dean by the student, the dean will decide whether to place the student on academic suspension or to extend the student's period of academic probation. The dean will notify the student in writing of the decision. The period of suspension for a student who is placed on academic suspension for the first time is two enrollment terms (summer and fall or spring and summer). If a student is suspended at the end of the summer term, the suspension is fall only. The period of suspension for a student who is placed on academic suspension for a second time is three (3) subsequent enrollment terms (Summer counts as one enrollment term). A student who is reinstated following his or her academic suspension is on academic probation and must meet the terms of academic probation to avoid another academic suspension or a dismissal. Applying for Reinstatement Following Academic Suspension Students must apply for reinstatement following academic suspension. The student must explain to the dean in writing his or her assessment of the reasons for the academic difficulties and how, if reinstated, he or she expects to change academic performance so as to raise the term and cumulative GPA to the required level. The dean may elect to grant the student's appeal or extend the academic suspension for an additional term.
