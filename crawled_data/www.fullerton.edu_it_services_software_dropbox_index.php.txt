Dropbox is also available for your iOS, Windows, and Android devices. The sign in and connect process for these devices is similar to the web version, and the file and folder views will also be the same. Account Info If your personal account already uses your @fullerton.edu address, you will have the option of migrating these files to a new personal account using a different email address (@gmail.com, for example), or migrating these files to your CSUF Dropbox account. If you were using your CSU Fullerton email as your personal account, you should inform non-work collaborators of your new address, as anything shared in the future with your CSU Fullerton email will end up in your CSUF Dropbox.
