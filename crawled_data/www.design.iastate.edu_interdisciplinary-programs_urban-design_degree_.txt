Courses are taught by faculty from architecture, community and regional planning and landscape architecture, with an understanding that urban environments should be engaged through an integrated design process that includes ecological, social, material, economic and urban-policy factors. The urban design degree reflects a deep commitment to resilient and just urban environments within the context of an increasingly concentrated, connected and diverse urban world. Accordingly, the coursework engages emerging urbanization topics, including: the formation of more adaptable, flexible and resilient cities; the exponential growth of megacities and steady decline of investments in traditional urban economies in the 21st century; the transformation of industrial landscapes, particularly within the Midwestern context, and the global impact of transnational economic operations; the spatialization of informal economies, practices and services across the south-north global divide; and a reexamination of the potentials of hard and soft infrastructures, principles of the circular economy and a reframing of the urban-rural divide. The program consists of 30 credits (2022-23 curriculum pdf), typically distributed over three semesters (fall, spring and summer); however, students may choose to distribute these credits over four or five semesters. The degree is geared toward students with professional degrees in architecture (BArch, MArch), landscape architecture (BLA, MLA) or planning (BSCRP, MCRP, MUP). Applicants are welcomed from other related disciplines. Graduate students can also pursue the following double degrees in the College of Design: MArch/MUD, MCRP/MUD and MLA/MUD. Current undergraduate students can apply to pursue this degree, concurrently. Admission Requirements We have a two-phase application process. The priority application consideration date for fall admission is February 1. Please submit your pre-application by this date to receive first consideration for admission. Applications will continually be accepted and evaluated until the cohort is full. While typical admission is in the fall, we will accept applications for spring or summer semester admission.
