Social Work is a profession dedicated to partnering with people to create change. It is set apart from other human-related disciplines by its person-in-environment focus. That means that social workers have a dual orientation at all times - the individual and the environment. Social workers are educated in a body of specialized knowledge and skills, while being committed to a core set of values. While different individuals or organizations may express these a little differently, they all share the same basic principles. Here in the TTU Social Work Program, we adhere to the National Association of Social Workers (NASW) Code of Ethics. In that document, the organization identifies and defines six core values including service, social justice, dignity and worth of the person, importance of human relationships, integrity, and competence.Those core values ground our professional practice as social workers. The code then goes on to guide and regulate our practice. Professional social workers work in a great variety of different practice settings. Some of these include the broad areas of health, politics, policy, child welfare, school social work, mental health, aging, families, addictions, disabilities, corrections, administration, research, community organization and advocacy, homelessness, and many, many others. Social workers work for both public and private organizations. Jobs and Salaries Becoming a social worker does not require a vow of poverty! While most social workers choose the profession for its intrinsic rewards, financial benefits also exist. According the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the median wage for social workers in 2015 was $45,900, even higher in Texas. Further, the BLS reports that the profession is expected to continue to grow faster than the average rate for all occupations, largely in the areas of medical social work and mental health services.
