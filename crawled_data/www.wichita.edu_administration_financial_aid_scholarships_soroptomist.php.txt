ScholarshipUniverse Soroptimist Scholarship Fund Soroptimist Scholarship Fund In 1986, the Wichita Chapter of Soroptimist International established the first-ever adult education scholarship for female students after discovering the lack of funds available for adult women. The Soroptimist Scholarship Fund for WSU Students assists those women acquiring a degree for a career or career advancement for the benefit of themselves and their children. This scholarship gives consideration to economic need, academic promise, and leadership qualities. No recipient is excluded; however, preference is given to mature, undergraduate, degree-bound women endeavoring to acquire or advance in a career for the benefit of themselves & children dependent on them. The scholarship may be renewed. Requirements: Be an undergraduate student Be enrolled full or part time at Wichita State University.
