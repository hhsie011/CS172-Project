The bold orange, the Tiger Paw, the CLEMSON — it means we share a determined spirit, a dedication to excellence. We know the difference between a rock and THE rock. We know orange and purple go great together. We know Old Green Tom, Bowman Field, Death Valley. And if anyone shouts "1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4" we know what comes next. We are Clemson. And our brand is one of the most highly recognized, valuable brands among all universities. That's why we guard it so carefully. Go Tigers!
