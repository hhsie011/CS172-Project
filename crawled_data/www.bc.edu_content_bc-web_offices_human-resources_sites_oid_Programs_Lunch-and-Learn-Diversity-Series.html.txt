On Thursday, February 3, 2022, Boston College Law School Library colleagues Laurel Davis, Mary Bilder, and Avi Bauer sparked an illuminating discussion of Robert Morris' legal advocacy for human rights in the 1800s and his valuable contributions to Boston College's early library collection. Participants explored a digital exhibit walkthrough that captured the importance of inclusively bringing narratives and figures to light in an accessible, empowering fashion. On Tuesday, November 30, 2021, Shannon Jacob, African and African Diaspora Studies faculty, presented "Spirituals: Worship, Instruction, and Protest." This interactive session, engaged in the practice of deep listening, provided a heightened sense of understanding and empathy through the study of history, music, and humanity. On October 11, 2018, Dr. Zareen Karani Araoz presented "Managing Across Cultures," an interactive session on the importance of communication in today’s diverse world, especially on a college campus. Forty staff and faculty attended "Raze the Roof; Raze the Stairs; Raze your Thinking about Disabilities," held on November 4, 2015. This event encouraged the BC community to think differently about disabilities--not to pity or scorn but to pave a way for access into buildings, curriculum, workplaces, gatherings, friendships, and more. Nearly 40 staff and faculty attended "An Ignatian Approach to Decision Making" on April 4, 2017, which explored ways in which Ignatian discernment and values can be implemented into every day decision-making.
