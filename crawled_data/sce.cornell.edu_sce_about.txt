Ezra Cornell Cornell University founder, 1868 A history of accessible education We work hard to live up to Ezra Cornell's vision, and we proudly extend it to include "at any time, in any place." SCE traces its roots to 1876, when Cornell offered classes to help school teachers further their education over the summer. Since then, we have offered programs at times and in places and ways that best meet the needs of our diverse student body.
