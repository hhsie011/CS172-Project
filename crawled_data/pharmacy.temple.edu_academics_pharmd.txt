Discovering your successful pharmacy career starts here. The Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) degree is designed to help you develop and master professional, academic, and interpersonal skills as a pharmacist. To master these skills, you will participate in a dynamic curriculum with didactic coursework, small group recitations, and labs. You will have the opportunity to differentiate your degree by pursuing an elective track in Clinical Trials, Drug Safety, or Advanced Clinical Practice and/or a dual degree through our collaborations with the Regulatory Affairs and Quality Assurance program (PharmD/Master of Science in Global Clinical and Pharmacovigilance Regulations) and the Temple University Fox School of Business (PharmD/MBA). Inquire for more details on our programs. Fourth-year rotations will also expose you to new possibilities. You can apply to complete your Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience (APPE) requirement locally, at our affiliated sites in Alaska or on an American Indian reservation in New Mexico, in cooperation with the Indian Health Service (IHS). Abroad, we offer pharmacy mission rotations in Guatemala and Vietnam to expose students to a non-traditional pharmacy experience. We welcome applicants from all academic backgrounds. Many students choose to start their path to pharmacy by enrolling as an undergraduate at Temple University. We also have agreements with Bloomsburg University, Chestnut Hill College, Eastern University, regional community colleges, and more to come that allow undergraduates students to conveniently and cost effectively transition to pharmacy school. However you choose to complete your PharmD, Temple will thoroughly prepare you for a successful career as a practitioner in the middle of one of the most well-connected cities in the world.
