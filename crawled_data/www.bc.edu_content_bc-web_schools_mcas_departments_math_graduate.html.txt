Get Started Request Info Apply Now Learning Outcomes The Department of Mathematics is engaged in an ongoing effort to assess our programs. We have organized this effort around several learning goals. We measure student outcomes in these areas annually, and we use that information to improve the structure and content of our major, and of our doctoral program. The learning outcomes to be attained for graduate students are: Students will have broad knowledge of the major areas of modern mathematics (algebra, analysis, and geometry) and detailed command of advanced topics in at least one of these areas. Students will be able to do original research in their area of study. Students will teach effectively courses in mathematics at the college level.
