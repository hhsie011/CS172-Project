PreviousNext Professor Michael Cox is co-founder and co-host of the "In Common" podcast. In Common is a podcast exploring the lives, research and activities of scholars and practitioners as they promote sustainable human-environment interactions. It is the official podcast of the International Association for the Study of the Commons (IASC) and also produces content in coordination with the International Journal of the Commons (IJC). Full episodes of the podcast contain long-form interviews, while Insight episodes contain highlights of these longer episodes. Additionally, the podcast contains a series of Future Earth's Programme on Ecosystem Change and Society (PECS) webinars describing different methods to analyze human-environment interactions. This series is run by Mike Schoon from Arizona State University. The Blog, run by Praneeta Mudaliar, explores similar content but is not interview based. This podcast was originally founded as the Finding Sustainability Podcast in 2019, based on a conversation that Stefan Partelow and Michael Cox had via Twitter about the need to create an alternative space for discussions about environmental social science.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Environmental Studies Undergraduate Overview Major and Minors Culminating Experience ENVS 50 Archive Minor Tracks Courses Sample Syllabi Waitlists and Applications Transfer Term Credit Honors Recent Honors Theses Learning Outcomes Graduate Foreign Study Overview Africa FSP Syllabi and Documents Paulson Fellowships Research Overview Student Research and Internships Faculty Research Fields Hornig Library of Environmental Studies Community Overview Careers Alumni Stories Office of Sustainability Dartmouth Organic Farm Sustainability Solutions Café Past Café Events News & Events News & Events Past Events Archive People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
