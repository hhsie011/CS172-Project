One-Eyed Girl recalls the power and drama of German Expressionist prints in its quirky distortion of the sitter’s large, hypnotic eye. Self Eater reconsiders the artist’s paintings of self-consuming figures in a vibrantly colored woodcut with collaged elements and Untitled (Poisoned Man) commemorates Viktor Yushchenko, the poisoned Ukrainian politician, by rendering the undulating planes of his deformed face in woodcut, lithography and chine collé. Schutz has aptly noted about her work, “Still lifes become personified, portraits become events, and landscapes become constructions. I embrace the area between which the subject is composed and decomposing, formed and formless, inanimate and alive..." Schutz (b. 1976) is a painter who lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. She studied at the Cleveland Art Institute and received a MFA from Columbia University in 2002. Schutz has exhibited widely in the United States and abroad at institutions including the Rose Museum, Brandeis University, Boston, MA; Cleveland Art Museum, Cleveland, OH; Contemporary Fine Arts, Berlin; ICA Boston, MA. Her work is included in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, New York; The Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; Corcoran Gallery in Washington, DC and The Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, CA among others.
