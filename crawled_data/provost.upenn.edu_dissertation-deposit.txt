PhD Dissertation Deposit At the University of Pennsylvania, a doctoral candidate presents and defends the dissertation publicly, and then, with the approval of the dissertation committee and graduate group chair, submits the final manuscript for publication. Finally, the PhD degree is awarded to the candidate upon the recommendation of the Graduate Council of the Faculties. Note: Special dissertation defense and deposit instructions continue to be in effect for the Summer 2022 semester. Dissertation defenses may be in-person or presented via remote conferencing. Electronic signatures will be allowed on all required forms for depositing, a printed copy of the dissertation will not be required, and the dissertation must be submitted electronically. Deposit Appointment Depositing your finalized dissertation is the final step to obtain your degree. Degree candidates must confirm with their graduate group coordinator that all required forms have been submitted in Penn Graduate Forms before the date of their deposit appointment. View the PhD Graduation Checklist for instructions on how to deposit and guidelines for a final formatting check. Doctoral degree candidates will schedule a deposit appointment; however, this is not a meeting, and you will not be present when your dissertation is reviewed. Deposit appointments are scheduled to manage the flow of degree candidate submissions received from all schools. Deposit appointments are scheduled via Calend.ly and available during the deposit periods listed on the Graduation Calendar. Students who wish to schedule deposit appointments during peak times (the last three weeks of a term) will be required to attend a formatting pre-check appointment with a Graduate Fellow prior to their appointment. Email grad-degree@provost.upenn.edu to sign up for peak appointment times.

Formatting will likely take longer than you anticipate, so please set yourself up for success by following the formatting guideless for your own document early in the process or using the dissertation template provided. Complete the PhD Dissertation Formatting Checklist and make sure your title page looks like the sample dissertation title pages. One-on-one Formatting Support (new for Spring 2022) Starting with the Spring 2022 term, we will pilot one-on-one formatting support via Zoom for PhD students with our Dissertation and Thesis Graduate Fellow. The Graduate Fellow is available to meet with students who have formatting questions, need technical support in Word, or just for peace of mind before a deposit appointment. Students can book an appointment directly with the Graduate Fellow at: https://calendly.com/elwebb/graduatefellow. Students who plan to deposit during peak periods will be required to attend a pre-deposit appointment with the Graduate Fellow. The dissertation does not need to be finalized for this pre-check appointment, but students should have their preliminary pages (title page, optional copyright notice, table of contents, etc.) ready with their draft of the main text. Additionally, any student who uploads a dissertation with significant formatting errors will be required to meet virtually with our Graduate Fellow for support before they submit a new draft. Research Master's Thesis Deposit Requirements to Graduate In the final term of their program, the Research Master's degree candidate must complete these steps to graduate: Apply to graduate using the degree candidate system Schedule a thesis deposit appointment Upload the final, approved, and properly-formatted thesis in this Qualtrics form Meet all graduate degree requirements within the program of study Clear their bursar bill in Penn.Pay.
