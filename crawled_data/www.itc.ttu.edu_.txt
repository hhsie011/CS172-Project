We are committed to serving the research needs of university researchers, cotton breeders, public agencies, and textile manufacturers. In addition, our academic programs, in conjunction with other colleges at Tech, are continually in progress. Research done at the Fiber and Biopolymer Research Institute is changing the way the world talks about Fiber Quality. Mission Statement: To be an international leader in: (1) research and technology transfer in fibers and textiles; (2) academic and professional education; (3) testing, evaluation and consultation related to fiber and textile product properties; (4) development of textile testing methods and instrumentation; and (5) textile manufacturing and bioproducts development. Vision Statement: The Fiber and Biopolymer Research Institute should be recognized as an international leader in research and technology transfer in fibers and textiles. It should exploit this leadership to benefit the agricultural production of textile fibers, to increase the use-value of these fibers, and to foster development of value-added textile products. <!-- intentionally non-empty iframe; for xsl --> Fiber and Biopolymer Research Institute Follow Fiber and Biopolymer Research Institute on PinterestFollow Fiber and Biopolymer Research Institute on Pinterest Snap Fiber and Biopolymer Research InstituteSnap Fiber and Biopolymer Research Institute Address 1001 East Loop 289 Lubbock, TX 79403 Phone 806.742.5333 Email fbri@ttu.edu Texas Tech University 2500 Broadway Lubbock, Texas 79409 806.742.2011 Follow Texas Tech University Like Texas Tech University on FacebookLike Texas Tech University on Facebook Follow Texas Tech University on twitterFollow Texas Tech University on twitter Check in with Texas Tech University on FourSquareCheck in with Texas Tech University on FourSquare Subscribe to Texas Tech University on YouTubeSubscribe to Texas Tech University on YouTube Follow Texas Tech University on FlickrFollow Texas Tech University on Flickr Follow Texas Tech University on InstagramFollow Texas Tech University on Instagram Connect with Texas Tech University on LinkedInConnect with Texas Tech University on LinkedIn Contact Texas Tech UniversityContact Texas Tech University Contact Us Campus Map Jobs @ TTU Emergency Communication Center General Policy Information Public Access to Course Info Energy Management Mental Health Resources Title IX Fraud and Misconduct Hotline Online Institutional Resumes TTU System TTU Health Sciences Center TTUHSC El Paso Angelo State University Midwestern State University Statewide Search State of Texas Texas Homeland Security Texas Veterans Portal Texas CREWS SAO Fraud Reporting Open Records Requests Â© 2022 Texas Tech UniversityJun 2, 2021 10:32 AM Fiber and Biopolymer Research Institute The Facility Fiber and Biopolymer Research Institute The Facility Back Contacts and Maps The FBRI Labs Biopolymer Research Group Cotton Phenomics Research Group People Fiber and Biopolymer Research Institute Back Faculty Staff Postdoctoral Research Associates Research Assistants | Graduate Students Laboratory Services Fiber and Biopolymer Research Institute Laboratory Services Back Testing and Services Test Request Form Publications Fiber and Biopolymer Research Institute Publications Back Newsletter FBRI Publications FBRI Presentations Textile Topics Archive Additional Resources TTU HomeDirectory Raiderlink A-Z Index
