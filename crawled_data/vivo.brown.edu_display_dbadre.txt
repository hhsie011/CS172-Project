Following a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of California, Berkeley, he joined Brown's Department of Cognitive, Linguistic, and Psychological Sciences in 2008. He is an affiliate of the Carney Institute for Brain Science and a trainer in the Neuroscience Graduate Program. Prof. Badre is a Fellow of the Association for Psychological Science. He has served as editor or on the editorial boards of several journals. He has been a standing member of the Cognition and Perception study section of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) since 2016, and has served as its Chair from 2020. Prof. Badre's research focuses on the cognitive neuroscience of cognitive control, which concerns how the brain translates goals and plans into concrete behaviors. His research is supported by the NIH and through the Office of Naval Research. His work has been recognized by several awards, including an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Fellowship in Neuroscience, a James S. McDonnell Scholar Award in Understanding Human Cognition, and the Cognitive Neuroscience Society Young Investigator Award. Professor Badre was a finalist for the PROSE Award from the Association of American Publishers for his 2020 book about the neuroscience of cognitive control, On Task.

Humans can avoid habitual tendencies and pick the right action for the right situation, an ability termed "cognitive control" or "executive function". Losing cognitive control, due to neurological or psychiatric condition, severely diminishes independence and quality of life. Our lab studies cognitive control of memory and action, using cognitive neuroscience methods that include structural and functional MRI, brain stimulation, EEG/ECoG, computational modeling, and testing of patient populations.
