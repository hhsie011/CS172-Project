Graves Jr. and Prof. Alan H. Goodman tackle common misconceptions about race, human biology, and racism. Using an accessible question-and-answer format, Graves and Goodman explain the differences between social and biological notions of race. Although there are many meaningful human genetic variations, they do not map onto socially constructed racial categories. Drawing on evidence from both natural and social science, Graves and Goodman dismantle the malignant myth of gene-based racial difference. They demonstrate that the ideology of racism created races and show why the inequalities ascribed to race are in fact caused by racism.
