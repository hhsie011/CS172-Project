The pandemic disrupted life, affecting citizens' social, economic, and health fabric worldwide. People were forced to adapt to a new way of living, such as working remotely, dealing with loss and grief arising from the death of a loved one, among others. These circumstances brought about distress, a situation that needs to be addressed. It, therefore, becomes paramount that people are equipped with coping mechanisms to deal with the various life stressors that have arisen from the pandemic and life generally. One such strategy is improving an individual's emotional intelligence (EQ) capabilities. In partnership with Albert Migowa, Columbia Global Centers | Nairobi introduced a series that intends to cover diverse topics on EQ to help members of the general population cope and adapt to life in the 21st Century, particularly with the challenges presented by the pandemic. The first part of the series held in November 2021 covered "What is Emotional Intelligence?" (watch the video here) where we defined and delineated the concept. This second part of the series will delve deeper into the various subjects that contribute to an individual achieving emotional intelligence, with a focus on "Self-Awareness." In the pipeline are sessions that will run till October on other subject areas such as Resilience, Self-Care, Self-Regulation, Time Management, Decisiveness, Stress Management, Critical Thinking, and Mansplaining. Your participation in this webinar session would be greatly appreciated. Expand all Collapse all Moderator Bio Albert Migowa Albert Migowa is a trained Counseling Psychologist.
