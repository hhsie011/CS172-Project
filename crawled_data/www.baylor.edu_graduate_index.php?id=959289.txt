This page offers a comprehensive list of information and requirements for the semester preceding your graduation. If you have any questions, or cannot locate the information you are looking for, please contact our Baylor University Commencement website. Run a Degree Audit Running a degree audit will allow you to ensure that you have fulfilled all of your degree requirements. If you see any discrepancies, contact your Graduate Program Director. Click here for instructions. All incompletes for coursework other than dissertation/thesis hours must be cleared before the oral examination can be taken. Verify the Semester Deadlines There are many deadlines during your final semester that you must be aware of and meet. These include, but are not limited to: filing for graduation, Dissertation and Theses defense, oral exams, and satisfaction of the foreign language requirement. Make sure that you mark these dates on your calendar. View the calendar File for Graduation - (Masters and Doctoral Students only) The window for filing for graduation for each term is: Spring Graduation: October 1 - February 1 Summer Graduation: February 1 - June 1 Fall Graduation: February 1 - October 1 Students who have met all of the requirements of their degree and wish to declare their intent to graduate must apply to graduate in BearWeb. Please see the attached instructions. If you are a joint student, you must apply to graduate from each program separately. If you are a PhD student wishing to graduate with a non-terminal master’s degree, please contact Alana Schaeper. If you have any other questions, please contact Alana Schaeper. If you use student loans or other forms of financial aid to pay your bill you should file for graduation as early as possible so the Student Financial Aid (SFA) office can ensure your award offer for the upcoming year is accurate. In some cases the Student Financial Aid (SFA) office may be required to make revisions to your financial aid awards. Award revisions are most often required for students graduating in December since most award offers are for the full academic year (fall/spring). If you have been offered financial aid for an enrollment term beyond your graduation term, please contact the SFA office to inform them and they will determine if revisions to your awards are necessary.
