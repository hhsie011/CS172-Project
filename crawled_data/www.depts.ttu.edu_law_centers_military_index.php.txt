Texas Tech University Directory Raiderlink A-Z Index School of Law Menu Search TTU School of Law Centers Center for Military Law and Policy Center for Military Law and Policy The Center for Military Law and Policy was established in November 2004 as a means of capitalizing on the unique experience and knowledge of the Texas Tech faculty in the field of military law. The center provides a platform for scholarly research related to military law, a forum for discussion of current issues related to military law, and a resource for information about legal careers in military and national security law. Heavily publicized cases involving sexual assault and sexual harassment, abuse of recruits at training centers, and abuse of prisoners in Iraq have created more press coverage of the military justice system than at any previous time. Thus, “The point of creating a Center for Military Law and Policy is not to create a civilian school of instruction for military law, but to bring credibility and a scholarly discussion to the modern military law debates,” said Glenn D. West Endowed Research Professor of Law Richard D. Rosen, the director of the center. With several former military lawyers on staff, the Texas Tech University School of Law provides a unique academic environment to study and critique the military judicial system, “We want to look at these military law issues as honestly and independently as we can,” Rosen said. Directors Glenn D. West Endowed Research Professor of Law Richard D. Rosen is the center's first director. Before joining the faculty, Professor Rosen completed a 26-year career in the Army as a judge advocate. Dean (emeritus) and Major General (retired) Walter B. Huffman and Professor Rosen have recently written a major treatise on military law. Professor Rosen's military assignments include: Commandant of the Army Judge Advocate General's School, Charlottesville, Virginia Staff Judge Advocate of the III Armored Corps and Fort Hood, Texas Chief of Personnel, Plans and Training, The Pentagon, Washington, DC Special Counsel to the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division, Department of Justice, Washington, DC Deputy Legal Advisor to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, The Pentagon, Washington, DC Staff Judge Advocate of the 1st Cavalry Division, Fort Hood, Texas Other Faculty With Military Law Experience In addition, faculty members with military law experience include: Dean (emeritus) and Major General (retired) Walter B.
