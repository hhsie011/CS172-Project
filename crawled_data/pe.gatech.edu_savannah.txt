Learn More "The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt certification from Georgia Tech through the VET2 program put me ahead of other job seekers and has helped with my studies at Havard Business School. It helped me to look at things strategically and technically from a process standpoint." Charles Hudson National Security Advisor "After a career as a chemist and then IT professional, I was eager to get my feet wet in web development. The coding boot camp changed my life. I now work at a company where I feel supported and am thriving. I apply the skills I learned in boot camp to the work I do for our clients." Jessie Gilligan Developer "The purpose of taking these courses was to advance my career and gain and greater understanding of the role that I am in with my employer. Our group was diverse in all of their roles and came from various industries, so I was able to get information they shared, and I can apply that to what I am doing in my own role." Roz Nero Procurement Negotiator "I knew that a Lean Six Sigma certification would help me standout to potential employers, but I am so thankful for acquiring the valuable skills that I use every day in my current position. The instructor was excellent, and the entire class was really engaged.
