UHP provides numerous possibilities for you to find what you are truly passionate about and then guides you towards those passions. Favorite honors experience I have done a self-designed experiment focused on the mental health of our current nursing students and what they do to keep up with that. It was a very surreal experience to just be able to create a project of my own and have it be about something that I am deeply passionate about. Best UC moment so far The COVID-19 pandemic has caused many of the events at UC to pause, however, even amongst the restrictions UC managed to continue to host numerous activities in a virtual format. My friends and I often attended virtual dance workshops. Even with it being virtual, it still managed to be a very fun time! Broaden your horizons and don't be afraid to do things that make you step out of your comfort zone. This is a great opportunity to experiment with your passions. What's next? After graduating I hope to take my certification exam and work as a nurse while pursuing a Master's degree in Nursing. I hope to work in a clinic someday as a nurse practitioner.
