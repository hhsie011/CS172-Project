Wellness' Destined For A Destination Monday, November 29, 2021 Virtual Event A Wellness Experience to get you moving, get you outdoors, and get you connected with your environment Register here Join this Wellness Experience that runs November 15 through December 5 How this Wellness Experience works: Register for Destined For A Destination to get motivated to be physically active, and feel connected to others in the Cornell community, as we head from fall into winter. Wellness staff will provide you with two themes for outdoor destinations each Monday, beginning November 15, for 3 consecutive weeks. For example you would receive a message like this, "One of your destinations for this week is an outdoor garden and the other is an outdoor Athletic field". You can pick either themed destination that interests you most, then walk, run, roll or ride (bike) there. Take a picture of yourself and/or your destination and post it to the Cornell Wellness Facebook page or tag us in Instagram. Alternatively, you can email the photo to Kerry at kk253@cornell.edu and she will post them for you. Staff, faculty, retirees, students, and their spouses/partners are all welcome to participate in this wellness experience. There is no need to be a Wellness/CFC member to participate or to be on the Cornell Ithaca campus. #MoveMore Tweet Share Subscribe Google Calendar iCal Outlook Event Type Class/ Workshop Departments Wellness Program, Division of Human Resources – Wellbeing University Themes Campus Life Group Working at Cornell Hashtag #CornellWellness #WorkingAtCornell #CornellWellbeing Contact E-Mail kk253@cornell.edu Contact Name Kerry Howell Recent Activity No recent activity Submit an Event Create your own custom weekly events email All Events Featured Events Places to Go Groups I'm Interested Invite Friends People Interested (1) Helpful Links expand menu Academic Calendar Leadership Careers Events News Title IX Emergency Preparedness Visiting Cornell expand menu Campus Tours Maps & Directions Ithaca-NYC Travel Johnson Museum Botanic Gardens Ithaca Ithaca Today expand menu Live View Weather Ithaca, New York University Privacy Web Accessibility Assistance Copyright Site Information Contact Facebook Twitter Instagram YouTube This event content is powered by the Localist Event CMS.
