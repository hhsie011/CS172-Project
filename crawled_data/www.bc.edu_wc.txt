Thrive Learn More Thrive is a mentor program for sophomore women to build new relationships and engage in authentic conversations about vocations, community and friendship, spirituality, goal-setting, and more. Women's Center Featured Feminist Alexandra Abrue Resident Director, Office of Residential Life I define feminism as Gloria Steinem would but with one, slight edit: “A feminist is anyone who recognizes the equality and full humanity of women, men, (and all gender identities).” Feminism allows all individuals to dream big and strive for their greatest goals. It is giving a platform to voices that are silenced. Feminism requires all of us to do what we can within our own sphere of influence to ensure equality amongst all regardless of their gender identity.
