Give yourself enough time before the application deadline to complete the application, supplement, and required supporting documents. Refer to the checklist. Know Cornell. Be sure to carefully review the information online about the college or school to which you’re applying. Understanding the college or school you want to attend will be a big help when writing your college interest essay. Write with purpose. Spend time on your essay and research the academic area(s) you’re applying to! Admission committees want to know that Cornell is a good fit for your academic interests…and that you are a good fit for them. Know the requirements. Review the required preparation for your intended major. Check email. Carefully type your email address on application materials. Make sure to check your email for important information and that your settings allow you to receive email from Cornell. Label pages. If mailing materials, pages can get separated, so include your full name and date of birth on each page mailed. Don't staple. For groupings of multiple pages, please use paper clips (do not staple). Make copies. After completing your application, save copies for yourself. Check status online. Set up your online application status account by following the instructions you will receive by email after submitting the application and fee or fee waiver. Click submit. When submitting your application online, be sure to click “Submit/Send” for both the application and the supplement.
