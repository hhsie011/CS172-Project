What are the latest trends in the global coronavirus outbreak? What can we learn from varied responses and from countries and communities that have managed to mitigate the health and economic impact of the virus? What has contributed to a nationalistic response rather than an inclusive approach that brings together nations in pursuit of global solutions? How does the rest of the world view the American response? Leading public health researcher and infectious disease physician and epidemiologist Wafaa El-Sadr (Director of ICAP, Professor at Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University) will discuss the latest developments in the COVID-19 outbreak and how lessons learned from global responses can help to stem this pandemic. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. El-Sadr has shared her expertise as a member of the New York City’s Mayor’s Scientific Advisory Council, the NYC Test and Trace Group, and the Columbia University COVID-19 Task Force. Introducing the event will be Professor Safwan M. Masri, Executive Vice President for Global Centers and Global Development, Columbia University. Julie Kornfeld, Vice Provost for Academic Programs and Associate Professor of Epidemiology, Columbia University will serve as moderator and facilitate students’ questions and answers. This discussion will serve as the first in a multi-part regional series that will focus on the unique aspects of the pandemic on regions across the globe including Asia, Europe, Latin America, Africa, India and the United States. Wafaa El-Sadr, MD, MPH, MPA is a University Professor of Epidemiology and Medicine at Columbia University, the director of ICAP at Columbia University, and director of the Global Health Initiative at the Mailman School of Public Health. Dr. El-Sadr is a prominent researcher and has led numerous epidemiological, clinical, behavioral, and implementation science research studies that have furthered the understanding of the prevention and management of HIV, TB, and non-communicable diseases. She is a principal investigator of the NIH-funded HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN), which seeks to prevent HIV transmission, globally. Dr. El-Sadr is a member of the NIH Fogarty International Center Advisory Board. In 2008, she was named a John D. and Catherine T.
