Electronic design and applications is a vital area of electrical engineering, encompassing the experimentation, design, modeling, simulation and analysis of single devices or circuits as well as complete signal processing systems. The unique combination of ECE's educational program, and the leading edge fabrication and testing facilities provides a full cycle exposure, from concept to product realization. ECE offers its graduate students on-going opportunities to work as Graduate Research Assistants, or Graduate Teaching Assistants. Virtually all Ph.D. students receive funding support through research or teaching. View Faculty members for Electronic Design and Applications Research Electronic Design and Applications (EDA) faculty and students are engaged in a range of basic and applied research projects supported by governmental and industry sponsors like Analog Devices, AT&T, Hewlett-Packard, Texas Instruments, Lockheed-Martin, Boeing, Linear Technology, Keithley Instruments, Cypress Semiconductor, the National Science Foundation, the National Security Agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and the U.S. Army Research Office. Research laboratories at Georgia Tech managed by EDA faculty are equipped to study, design, simulate, build, and test devices, integrated circuits, boards, and systems across a broad range of frequencies. Electronic Design and Applications research falls within the following major areas: MEMS Devices and Circuits Analog Electronics and VLSI Radio-Frequency (Wireless) Integrated Circuits (RFIC) mmWave and THz Circuits for Remote Sensing and Communications High-speed Mixed-signal Systems Biomedical and Wearable Electronics Sensing Microsystems and Energy Harvesting Power-management Integrated Circuits Academics The depth and breadth of faculty expertise in all areas of electronic design and applications is reflected in the curriculum, which provides students a strong foundation in analog circuits and systems with an emphasis on integrated-circuit technology.
