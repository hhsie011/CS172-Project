Contact UW-IT About UW-IT Disabled Network Service Access to the UW network can be disabled/unavailable for four main reasons. DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) violations You should have received a notice about a DMCA violation. Off-campus access is blocked, and you will need to respond to the DMCA violation to get your access restored. Security Issues Network security scanning has detected that your computer has been compromised by a virus or other malware. You should have received a notice from the CISO explaining the steps needed to restore access. Network Disruption Network Operations has identified your network device as disrupting network service for other users, e.g., an unapproved wireless repeater, a DHCP server, a bad network adapter. You should have received a notice from Network Operations explaining the steps needed to restore access. Something is broken. It happens; older equipment fails or someone has cut through a cable. If your computer is not listed on the disabled ports list below contact the UW-IT Service Desk for assistance. Getting Enabled If you decide you may be blocked, take the following steps: Verify whether your computer is currently blocked by going to Network Blocks page in the Network Portal. If it indicates that your port is blocked proceed to step 2 below. If the Disabled Ports service says your port is not blocked, you have some other problem not addressed here. Check your email to see why your port was blocked. If you cannot tell why please contact the UW-IT Service Desk and they should be able to determine why you were blocked and the steps necessary to become unlocked. You can obtain help from several sources: The Computer Vet in the Learning Commons in Odegaard Undergraduate Library can help with operating system updates, anti-virus software installation, and cleaning out infected computers. Your Department’s IT support team. Many commercial computer maintenance services are available off-campus. Tags: BlockedConnection Issuesdisabled network See a problem on this page? Let us know.
