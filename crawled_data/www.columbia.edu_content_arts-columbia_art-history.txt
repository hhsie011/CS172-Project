Art history is deeply tied to the cultural life of New York City, where more people are engaged in making, writing about, exhibiting, and collecting art than any place else in the world. Whether classes are devoted to Roman sculpture, Japanese ceramics, or French painting, art history at Columbia and Barnard brings students into direct contact with works of art in the city's museums and galleries, while classes in architectural history introduce students to the staggering diversity of New York's buildings and public monuments.
