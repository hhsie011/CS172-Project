How about creating a Facebook page, Twitter account, e-blast, or even getting a video loaded onto Clemson’s YouTube Channel? If so, the Social Media Team can be a helpful resource. Strategy & Account Management: Chas Williams — Brand Social Strategist Hillary Smith — Social Media Strategist General Inquiries & Questions: social@clemson.edu Our goal moving forward is to better understand and help facilitate the use of new and social media throughout the various levels of communications at Clemson. It is clear that many departments are attempting to create new and social media strategies independently of one another, and we understand what a difficult task that can be. The more collaboration there is between colleges and departments on these strategies, the more efficient and effective they will be.
