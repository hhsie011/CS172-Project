Upcoming Dates Undergraduate Postbac Premed Planning Day provides incoming GS undergraduate and Postbac Premed students the opportunity to interact with one another, as well as to meet continuing GS students, learn more about educational financing options, become familiar with the Morningside Heights campus, and begin to acquaint themselves with academic life at Columbia University. Expand all Collapse all Meeting with an Academic Advisor Undergraduate & Postbac Premed Students After attending a Planning Session, students will be given a final assignment as to who their individual academic advisor will be while enrolled at Columbia. Students are required to schedule an appointment to meet with their advisor to discuss courses selection (this can be done virtually as well.) Same-day advising appointments are reserved for out-of-town students. Students who live outside the tri-state area and plan to make a special trip to New York to attend a Planning Day may request a same-day appointment with an advisor. At least one week prior to the Planning Day, students should email the following information to either [email protected] (undergraduate students) or [email protected] (Postbac Premed students). Name CUID (found in Admissions Letter) Date for which you have registered for a Planning Day (and received a confirmation email) Phone Number Email Address Students who have not registered for a Planning Day online will not be able to schedule an appointment with their advisor. Planning Session While most of the GS Planning Day activities are optional, attendance at a Planning Session is: Mandatory for all new students A prerequisite for registering for classes and meeting with an academic advisor During the Planning Session, students will receive an overview of the registration and advising process, general academic requirements, and relevant policies, as well as website links and resources needed to plan their academic schedules. Important Registration Information Students cannot attend a Planning Session until they have formally accepted the offer of admission, signified by submitting the Acceptance Reply Form along with a non-refundable $500 tuition deposit. In order to assign students an academic advisor, these items must be received two weeks prior to attending a Planning Session. To submit your acceptance reply form and tuition deposit online using a credit or debit card, please log in to your application profile. Students are encouraged to attend a Planning Session at their earliest convenience. The sooner students register for classes, the better chance they will have to register for courses that fit both their interests and schedules. Seats are limited for each Planning Session. Students may register for only one Planning Day at a time. Students who can no longer attend the session for which they registered must cancel their registration before registering for a new session, by referring to the confirmation email, which provides a link to cancel. After registration has been canceled, please return to this page to register for a new session. GS Planning Days Registration Deadline: 12 p.m., three business days prior to the session you plan to attend In addition to the mandatory Planning Session, students will have the opportunity to take a student-led campus tour, meet with a financial aid officer, and attend a meet-and-greet with current GS students. Remote Planning Sessions Registration Deadline: 12 p.m., one business day prior to the session you plan to attend Remote Planning Sessions are intended for students who are unable to attend an on-campus Planning Day. They take place online and do not include the student-led campus tour, meet-and-greet, or financial aid workshop.
