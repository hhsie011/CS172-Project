The original Gardner gift was especially rich in works on Chinese history and literature, especially Qing dynasty history which was Professor Gardner's specialty. Most of the works from his library were published in the 1880s, with some dating as early as the beginning eighteenth century and others as late as the 1930s. The holdings cover the areas of language, literature, history, philosophy, religion, art, archaeology, and social sciences. The essential part of the Gardner Collection is located on the third floor of the Rockefeller Library. There are Chinese traditional styled bookcases built in 1969 surrounding three sides of the wall of the Gardner Room. About 93 titles of Chinese rare books (mostly published between 17th and 19th centuries), are stored in eight Cabinets. These titles are all traditionally bound and in very good conditions. The bookcases are designed perfectly match the size and style of volumes inside, which becomes one of valuable treasures of Brown University Library. It is a unique book room with special bookcases in North America. ...more information Palm Leaf Manuscripts The Rev.
