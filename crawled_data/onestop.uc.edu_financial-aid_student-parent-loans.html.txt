You are investing in yourself and your future. As such, many students (and parents) find that low-interest, educational loans provide a sound strategy toward meeting the costs of attending college. The key to loan borrowing is doing so responsibly and knowing the resources that can help you understand and manage your student debt. Federal Direct Subsidized/Unsubsidized Loans Direct Subsidized Loans are loans made to eligible undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need to help cover the costs of higher education. The US Department of Education pays the interest on your Subsidized Loan while you are enrolled at least half-time. Direct Unsubsidized Loans are loans made to eligible undergraduate, graduate, and professional students, but eligibility is not based on financial need. You are responsible for paying the interest on your Unsubsidized Loan during all periods. It is important to consider and compare all federal loan options. Federal Direct PLUS Loans Direct PLUS Loans are loans made to help pay for education expenses not covered by other financial aid. Eligibility is not based on financial need, but a credit check is required. Borrowers who have an adverse credit history must meet additional requirements to qualify. Parent PLUS Loans are loans for parents of dependent undergraduate students. Federal Graduate PLUS Loans Graduate PLUS Loans are loans for graduate or professional students. Alternative/Private Student Loans Alternative/Private Loans are non-federal educational loans that students and parents can borrow for educational expenses.
