Foster Success Center University Advisement University Advisement equips Baylor students and the broader community with resources which facilitate academic success. We partner with each student to provide assistance on his or her academic journey. Advisors equip and challenge students to take responsibility for developing a personalized, practical, and appropriate educational plan. This plan should reflect the student’s individual interests, abilities, goals, and values. The plan should also encompass a comprehensive educational experience that integrates courses with related learning opportunities outside the classroom. Explore Welcome to Baylor and University Advisement! We’re excited to welcome our new freshman and transfer students for Summer and Fall 2021. Please check out the helpful guidance on our New Students page. In University Advisement, we advise students who are exploratory or undecided and students in most pre-majors including Pre-Business, Pre-Psychology, Pre-Nursing, and others. A pre-major is one that involves students completing certain requirements (courses, GPA, hours, etc.) prior to being admitted to the major. Not sure what to declare as a major? We can help with our Major Exploration Program. Our advisors will guide you on the journey to finding that right-fit major. In addition to the advising process, ask your academic advisor when you meet for registration about our New Student Experience course, Major Exploration.
