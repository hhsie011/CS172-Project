I teach and write about twentieth-century U.S. history, and my interests range widely over urban history, the history of American politics and political culture, and transformations in American in the long post-World War II era. My first book, American Babylon: Race and the Struggle for Postwar Oakland (Princeton, 2003), won four professional prizes, including the James A. Rawley prize from the Organization of American Historians (OAH). My second book, All in the Family: The Realignment of American Democracy Since the 1960s (Hill and Wang, 2012), is about gender, sexuality, and political culture in the U.S. from the 1960s to the 2000s. With Margot Canaday and Nancy Cotty I co-edited, and wrote the introduction to, Intimate States: Gender, Sexuality, and Governance in Modern U.S. History (University of Chicago Press, 2021) about the modern history of the American state's power in, and over, people's intimate lives. I am currently working a book tentatively entitled Driven: The Rise and Fall of the Hydrocarbon Middle Class, about houses, cars, and children in the making of the modern middle-class family and the modern energy regime. I am also the co-author (with Rebecca Edwards and Eric Hinderaker) of a college-level textbook, America's History, published by Bedford/St. Martin's.

Full Text Research Research Overview Robert Self studies the history of politics and political culture in the post-World War II United States. His work to date has focused on the interaction among social movements, the state, and larger social and cultural shifts in American life in the decades since 1945. He has worked on the black freedom movement, gender and sexual politics, modern conservatism, urban history, and the complex and ongoing struggles over political commitment and engagement in the twentieth century. Research Statement My most recent book, All in the Family: The Realignment of American Democracy since the 1960s, takes my long-standing interest in political culture and liberalism in new directions. National in scope, the book is an exploration of how the sexual revolution, feminism(s), gay and lesbian liberation, and the new Right transformed American politics between 1964 and 2004. I treat the interaction and collision of these forces as an expansive process that included the multiple gender disruptions of the period: from the Vietnam War's problematic male soldier to the politics of abortion, welfare, black power, and gay liberation. In between the Civil Rights Act (1964), Watts rioting (1965), and the Moynihan Report (1965) and the Bush-era insurgencies of the 2000s, I trace the search for new male and female political subjectivities and the contests over manhood, feminism(s), and gay rights that remade liberalism in the intervening decades.
