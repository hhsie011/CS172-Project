Innovation is constant, and the economy is driven by new ventures. Accounting professionals who think critically with a global perspective are integral to the success of organizations. Choices in Courses and Careers Whitman’s major programs in accounting provide students with the academic training and experience needed to become professional accountants. The accounting program is designed for students who plan to enter public accounting or other professional accounting fields. However, we also have a program that is appropriate for individuals who plan to enter other areas of accounting or to complement other programs of study. In fact, the latter program is often combined with a major in finance or other subject areas. Many of our students also take advantage of the opportunity to work toward an M.S. in professional accounting degree after completing the B.S. requirements through our master’s program in accounting.
