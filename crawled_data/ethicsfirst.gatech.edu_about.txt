The Office works with the Georgia Tech community to manage compliance risk and put our ethical values into practice. Ethics is about doing the right thing. It’s about putting Georgia Tech values into practice by setting the standards for how to act. Compliance helps set up structures (training, approvals, processes, and systems) to make following our ethical standards easier. Culture is what we believe and how we behave as an Institute, and the Office of Ethics and Compliance is here to create a culture that promotes Georgia Tech’s ethical values and puts them into action by setting the standards to guide decision making.
