We will provide religious and medical exemptions, as we do for the influenza and measles vaccines, in accordance with New York State public health laws. We regard this decision as essential to ensuring the health of Columbia students and the broader University and surrounding community, and also to containing the spread of the virus in New York City, one of the most severely affected locations in the country throughout this past thirteen months. The vaccine mandate will be integrated into our Columbia Community Health Compact, an agreement all students, faculty, and staff are required to sign in order to access campus facilities. The mandate will take its place alongside our testing program and public health protocols, including face covering and physical distancing.
