APPLICATION ADVISING Prior to requesting a one-on-one appointment with an admissions representative, all prospective applicants must attend an information session. If, after attending an information session, you still have lingering questions, you may request a virtual appointment to address those questions. Admissions representatives are able to answer questions about the process and our program but are unable to provide specific advice on what an applicant can do to address strengths and weaknesses; it is up to applicants, themselves, to make that determination. Please note, during peak application season, we may be unable to accommodate requests for individual advising but will do our best to answer your questions via email. TOURS We are glad to offer opportunities to tour the School of Dentistry this summer and fall. Tours are open to individuals considering applying in a future cycle (2023 or later). Unfortunately, we are not able to accommodate additional guests beyond the prospective student.
