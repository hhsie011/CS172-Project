The department offers instruction in the core ancient languages that are essential for research in our fields: Akkadian (Babylonian and Assyrian, all stages), Egyptian (all stages), Hittite, and Sumerian. Instruction in Arabic, Aramaic, Greek, Hebrew, Latin, Sanskrit, Syriac, and Ugaritic is also available at Brown. In addition to training in philology and critical research methods, our students also become conversant in the archaeological sequence, art and architecture, and repertoires of material culture found across the ancient Near East. PhD Program in Egyptology and Assyriology Brown’s doctoral program in Egyptology and Assyriology has a number of distinguishing features: We offer in-depth disciplinary training that allows our students to pursue focused research in any one of our core fields: Assyriology, Egyptology, the history of ancient science, and the archaeology of Egypt and the Near East. We encourage creative interdisciplinary work, including but not limited to research that bridges Egyptology, Assyriology, and the history of ancient science in innovative ways. Our doctoral students have the opportunity to do coursework in and cultivate stimulating intellectual relationships with faculty from Anthropology, Classics, History, the Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World, and Religious Studies. In addition Brown’s Graduate School has an Open Graduate Program that allows interested doctoral students at Brown to pursue a concurrent master’s degree in a secondary field that is outside the scope of their doctoral program. We provide significant funding both in the department and across the university to support graduate students' original research. Our doctoral students have recently used support from the department and university to carry out research in museum collections in the US, Europe, and Africa; to participate in archaeological fieldwork (survey and excavation) in Egypt, Sudan, and Turkey; and to present the results of their research at international conferences and symposia. We emphasize developing our students professionally and encourage students to reach important early career milestones during their time in the program, such as giving conference papers and submitting academic publications; to that end we have incorporated valuable professional academic skills into our curriculum and assessment. We provide a variety of opportunities for our PhD students to train as teachers and develop valuable teaching skills that will be useful in a wide variety of educational settings, including research universities, museums, or teaching colleges focused on the liberal arts. A few areas of particular interest to the department’s faculty include: ancient science (astronomy and astrology, timekeeping and calendrics, divination and medicine); cultural interactions throughout the Mediterranean, Near East, and Africa in the second and first millennia BC; religion and ritual in the ancient Near East, from Egypt and Sudan to Anatolia and Mesopotamia; the history of the Egyptian language and its grammar; the origins and development of writing and the diffusion and reception of cuneiform, hieroglyphic, and alphabetic scripts in the ancient world; kingship and monumentality in ancient Egypt and Sudan; the integration of textual and archaeological methodologies; Coptic manuscripts; the ancient Near East in classical periods and Greek and Roman cultures’ perceptions of the more ancient past; Mesopotamian and Egyptian literature; ancient empires of the Near East in context; and the origins of Egyptian civilization. PhD Tracks The department currently offers three tracks: Assyriology Egyptology, and History of the Exact Sciences in Antiquity Each track has different course requirements, details of which may be found in the Graduate Student Handbook. Students who enter the program in one track may switch to another track providing they are still able to complete the coursework requirements by the end of their third year. Applying for Graduate Studies We welcome applications to our PhD program from prospective students interested in pursuing graduate studies in Egyptology, Assyriology, and the History of the Exact Sciences in Antiquity. All applications must be submitted online to Brown's Graduate School. For students accepted into the program, Brown’s Graduate School typically guarantees five years of full funding (tuition, fees, health insurance, and stipend to cover living expenses). The typical PhD program at Brown therefore includes three years of coursework and exams, followed by two years dedicated to researching and writing a doctoral dissertation that constitutes an original contribution to scholarship in the student’s field. Egyptology and Assyriology has overlapping interests with a number of other academic units at Brown, especially Anthropology, Ancient History, Classics, Religious Studies, and the Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World. We advise prospective students with interests that cross multiple disciplines to contact the faculty in the relevant programs to discuss which program would be the best fit. The Department of Egyptology and Assyriology will normally not consider applications from prospective students who have applied to more than one program at Brown. Further details about applying for our graduate program may be found on Brown.edu. Please note that the deadline for submitting applications to the Graduate School is 15 December for admission into the program for the following September.
