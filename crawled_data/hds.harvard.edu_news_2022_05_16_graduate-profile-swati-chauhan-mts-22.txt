How I've Changed I have become accustomed to listening and assessing my assumptions. Lately, I am appreciating the desire to improve myself with every passing day. Memorable Moment Seeing friends after a year of remote learning. Meeting Sunshine in Lamont, our midnight walks back home, discovering the "Alice in Wonderland" gate. Favorite Class or Professor "Intro to Buddhist Commentaries" with Professor Hallisey, "History of Kashmiri Brahmins" with Professor Witzel, "Sanskrit" with Nell Hawley. Message of Thanks I am glad to be in community with my dear friends Sunshine, Nathan, Chantal, Rebecca, and Margaret. I am also thankful to Professors Hallisey, Eck, and Witzel. I have become a better student and, more so, a better person through their encouragement. Many thanks to Professors Clooney and Kim for saying, "Explore this further." It has led to newer discoveries, always.
