We will provide an overview of two programs, the Columbia Climate School in the Green Mountains Program and the Columbia Climate Corps program. Participants will learn more about the two program experiences, meet faculty and staff involved in the activities, hear about the application process, learn about scholarship opportunities, and get their questions answered. The event will be recorded. The Columbia Climate School in the Green Mountains program is a 2-week campus-based program for high school students in Castleton, Vermont to mobilize action, drive impact, and effect change in response to our warming planet. Engage with experts from Columbia Climate School and learn about cutting-edge innovations in action. Meet, collaborate, and build partnerships with like-minded students and tap into collective strengths for action. The Columbia Climate Corps programs are small group climate and sustainability-focused traveling programs designed for motivated high school students. These summer programs combine intentional travel with in-depth educational opportunity, taking students across the United States and abroad to experience a destination through the lens of climate change and focus intently on one or two location-specific themes. Faculty and staff from the Columbia Climate School will join students on these trips, engaging them in cutting-edge research, leading lectures and facilitating workshops.
