Welcome to the FSU Childcare & Early Learning Program's website! We care for and nurture young children of student parents, faculty and staff so they may pursue their studies, research and career goals knowing their children are in a safe environment that promotes life-long learning. We capture and extend children's natural eagerness to learn so that it is not lost or dampened by drill, rote or other mind-numbing practices. For FSU students and academic departments, we provide a "lab school" where students can put theory into practice. If you search the website and have questions that remain unanswered by the information provided, please contact our office for assistance. We look forward to serving you through your on–campus experience! Find out more about us » Contact Us Address: FSU Childcare & Early Learning Program University Housing 612 S.
