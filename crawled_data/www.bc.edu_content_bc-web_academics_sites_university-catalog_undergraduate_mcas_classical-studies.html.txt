Islamic Civilization and Societies Mathematics Music Philosophy Physics Political Science Psychology and Neuroscience Romance Languages and Literatures Sociology Theatre Theology University Courses Classical Studies Classical Studies encompasses all the social, material, and intellectual culture of the ancient Greek and Roman worlds, as they can be studied both in the original languages and in English. The department offers courses under three headings, including (1) elementary and intermediate courses in Latin and Greek, designed to teach a student to read the languages; (2) courses in Greek and Roman literature, history, art and archaeology, society, and culture, including Core Literature, History I, and Fine Arts courses, taught in English and designed to acquaint a student broadly with the world of classical antiquity; (3) advanced reading courses in ancient authors and genres taught in the original languages. Courses related to antiquity are also available in other departments. Classical Studies Courses Classical Studies Faculty Classical Studies Website Print Open All Close All Major Requirements Major Requirements The major includes courses in Latin and/or Greek language and literature, from the elementary to the advanced level, and courses in ancient civilization and culture. Readings in the latter courses are in English. There are no separate majors in Latin or Greek. The program is designed to be flexible in response to the interests and prior experience of individual students. Requirements, totaling a minimum of ten courses (or 30 credits), fall under three headings: Three courses or 9 credits (minimum) in Latin and/or Greek at the advanced level. Three courses or 9 credits (minimum) in the area of ancient civilization and culture. Four other courses or 12 credits, either in Latin and/or Greek language at any level (excluding only Elementary Latin) or in ancient civilization and culture, in any combination. Notes Students who may think of going on in Classics are strongly advised to study both languages and to take as many advanced courses as possible. They should also discuss their interest with a faculty member at the earliest opportunity. The Minor in Ancient Civilization The Minor in Ancient Civilization The interdisciplinary minor in Ancient Civilization is designed to make the study of the ancient world available to students without the requirement of learning Latin or Greek. Students learn about the history, literature, art, and culture of antiquity in courses that emphasize the study of primary texts in English translation. As a minor, it naturally looks to students whose main interests lie in other areas, but who are curious about the ancient world and who seek a program that is at once structured and interdisciplinary. It makes a good complement in particular to majors in English, History, Art, Art History, and Film, Philosophy, and Theology but is available to everyone regardless of major. A list of the courses that are available each semester from the various departments and that count for the minor will be available at registration time. A program consists of six courses under three headings: One course in Greek History (CLAS2205) or Greek Civilization (CLAS1186). As a rule, one or the other of these courses will be taught each year. One course in Roman History (CLAS2206) or Roman Civilization (CLAS2262). Again, as a rule one or the other of these courses will be taught each year. Four electives, taught in Classics and other departments, chosen from various offerings in ancient culture, for instance, in the areas of literature, philosophy, religion, history, art, and archaeology. Latin Minor Latin Minor The Latin minor consists of 6 courses/18 credits: Courses (12 credits) in Latin above the elementary level 1 of the following courses on Roman culture: City of Rome (CLAS2262) or Roman History (CLAS2206) 1 elective: either Latin (intermediate or above) or a course on Roman civilization Courses for the Latin Minor I. 4 courses (12 credits) in Latin above the elementary level CLAS1056 Intermediate Latin I CLAS1057 Intermediate Latin II CLAS1058 Advanced Intermediate Latin CLAS3312 Roman Love Elegy CLAS3320 Roman Civil War Literature CLAS3325 Lucretius CLAS3329 Ovid, Metamorphoses CLAS3333 Apuleius CLAS3335 Ovid CLAS3336 Horace CLAS3337 Lucan CLAS3340 Latin Pastoral Poetry CLAS3342 Livy CLAS3338 Cicero and Sallust: Catiline CLAS3350 Catullus CLAS3356 Tacitus CLAS3370 Roman Comedy CLAS3375 Vergil II. 1 course on Roman culture: City of Rome (CLAS2262) or Roman History (CLAS2206) III. 1 elective: either Latin (intermediate or above) or a course on Roman civilization Any of the Latin courses above Electives: CLAS1702 Rome: Art, Regime, and Resistance CLAS2210/HIST2207 Roman Spectacles CLAS2206/HIST2205 Roman History CLAS2225/HIST2225, Ancient Medicine CLAS2230/ENGL2200 Classical Mythology CLAS2236/HIST2206 Roman Law and Family CLAS2240/ENGL2204 Dangerous Women in Classical Literature CLAS2242/THEO2241/HIST4211 Roman Religion CLAS2250/HIST2837 Multiculturalism in the Roman Empire CLAS2262/ARTH2262 City of Rome CLAS2270 Gender and Sexuality in Ancient Rome CLAS2280/ENGL2202 Beast Literature CLAS2285/THTR2286 The Chorus, Ancient and Modern CLAS2286/LING3205 History and Structure of Latin CLAS2294/HIST2203 Greco-Roman Egypt CLAS2295/ENGL2295 Ancient Comedy CLAS2384/LING 2384/THEO2384 Church Latin CLAS/HIST Everyday Aphrodite: Classics and the History of Sexuality THEO5448 Patristics: Latin and English Ancient Greek Minor Ancient Greek Minor The ancient Greek minor consists of 6 courses/18 credits: 4 courses (12 credits) in ancient Greek above the Elementary level 1 of the following courses on Greek culture: Greek Civilization (CLAS1186) or Greek History (CLAS2205) 1 elective: Either ancient Greek (intermediate or above) or a course on Greek civilization Courses for the Ancient Greek Minor I. 4 courses (12 credits) in ancient Greek above the Elementary level CLAS1052 Intermediate Greek I CLAS1053 Intermediate Greek II CLAS3302 Greek Rhetoric CLAS3315 Homer CLAS3330 Aphrodite CLAS3331 Sophocles and Aristophanes CLAS3345 Sophocles CLAS3373 Euripides CLAS3382 Herodotus CLAS3387 Thucydides THEO7803 Graeca II. 1 course on Greek culture: Greek Civilization (CLAS1186) or Greek History (CLAS2205) III. 1 elective: either Greek (intermediate or above) or a course on Greek civilization Any of the ancient Greek courses above CLAS1186 Greek Civilization CLAS1701 Death in Ancient Greece, Achilles to Alexander CLAS2205/HIST2201 Greek History CLAS2207/HIST2202 Greeks and Barbarians CLAS2208/ARTH2206 Art and Myth in Ancient Greece CLAS2216/ARTH2216 Art and Archaeology of Homer and Troy CLAS2225/HIST2225 Ancient Medicine CLAS2230/ENGL2200 Classical Mythology CLAS2240/ENGL2204 Dangerous Women in Classical Literature CLAS2254/HIST4202 Culture of Athenian Democracy CLAS2260/ENGL2111 Greek Drama and Society CLAS2280/ENGL2202 Beast Literature CLAS2285/THTR2286 The Chorus, Ancient and Modern CLAS2294/HIST2203 Greco-Roman Egypt CLAS2295/ENGL2295 Ancient Comedy CLAS/HIST Everyday Aphrodite: Classics and the History of Sexuality ARTH3311 Greek Art and Archaeology PHIL3332 Political Thought of the Greeks PHIL4405 Greek Philosophy PHIL5505 The Aristotelian Ethics PHIL5528 Skepticism/Stoicism/Neoplatonism THEO5425 Patristic Seminar: Intermediate Greek and English Information for First-Year Majors and Non-majors Information for First-Year Majors and Non-majors “Classics” as outlined above is a broad, interdisciplinary field of study. For a first-year student, courses of two types are likely to be of most immediate interest: (1) Core Literature, History, and Fine Arts courses, in which the reading is entirely in English, and (2) elementary and intermediate language courses in Latin and Greek. If you would like to begin a language now or have had only one or two years of a language in high school, you should choose an elementary course: CLAS1010 Elementary Latin I or CLAS1020 Elementary Greek I. If you have studied a language for three or four years in high school, you may want to choose an intermediate course: CLAS1056 Intermediate Latin I or CLAS1052 Intermediate Ancient Greek I. Completion of the second semester of Latin or Greek at the intermediate level will fulfill the Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences and Carroll School of Management language proficiency requirement (beginning with the class of 2022, the Carroll School will no longer have a language requirement). In addition, the Department offers elective courses in ancient civilization and on Greek and Roman authors. Those in ancient civilization are taught entirely in English. They make excellent choices for freshmen interested in antiquity. Those on Greek and Roman authors require a background in the appropriate language. If you have studied Latin or Greek for four or more years in high school, you may wish to try courses in Greek and Roman authors. For further information, consult the Chair of the Department. Information for Study Abroad Information for Study Abroad The Classics Department does not have a general set of requirements for study abroad. Students are advised individually, and recommendations are made based on their academic records and the specific program.
