On Sunday, May 29th, the Economics Department celebrated Commencement with over 300 undergraduate students and 11 PhD students completing their degrees in Economics. Specifically, 331 students received undergraduate degrees in Economics. Of these, 214 concentrated in Economics, 66 in Applied Math–Economics, 50 in Computer Science-Economics, and 1 in Mathematics-Economics. This means that roughly 1 out of every 5 of the seniors who graduated from Brown this weekend completed one of our department’s concentrations, making economics one of the most popular concentrations at Brown. We are very proud of our PhD graduates, who will be going to to work at companies such as: Amazon, the World Bank, universities all over the world and various research groups. It has been an honor to work with them over the past 5-6 years. Best of luck to all the graduates and thank you to the students, faculty, staff, and families who participated in such an important day!
