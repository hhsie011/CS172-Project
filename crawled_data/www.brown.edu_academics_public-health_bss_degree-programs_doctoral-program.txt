Students learn to employ behavioral and social science theory and methods to understand contemporary health problems. The signatures of Behavioral and Social Sciences training at Brown University include health behavior interventions development and evaluation, and collaboration across disciplines and between researchers and communities. Faculty and students engage in research that seeks to identify social, psychological, and behavioral risk factors for disease and illness; understand the psychosocial determinants of health care; understand health protective behaviors, relationships, and institutions; and develop and evaluate health-promoting interventions that are grounded in behavioral and social science theory. Students in the Doctoral Program in Behavioral and Social Health Sciences demonstrate mastery of relevant theory and methods, assessed via coursework and examinations, and complete a dissertation that represents original research. All students admitted to the PhD program receive funding in the form of a fellowship, teaching assistantship, or research assistantship. The funding package includes tuition, health insurance, and an annual stipend. Four years of financial support is the norm for those entering with a relevant Master’s degree and five years for those entering without such a background. The application deadline is December 1.
