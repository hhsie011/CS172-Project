This position is sponsored by the NIH and is contingent on continued funding. The initial term of appointment is one year, but reappointment for a second year is expected, subject to good performance. The PSTC builds scientific understanding of local, national, and global population challenges and their implications for health and well-being. Research at the PSTC is distinguished by its commitment for collaboration across disciplinary and institutional boundaries as well as its strong portfolio of global research. PSTC focuses on demographic research in six main areas: children, families, and health; migration and urbanization; population and environment; demographic change and global development; reproductive health and HIV/AIDS; and social inequalities. Potential applicants are encouraged to consult the PSTC website to learn of research activities, intra-institutional links, and faculty affiliate interests. We also welcome applicants with financial support from other sources, including NIH T32 Individual Postdoctoral Fellowship. Postdoctoral Fellows are expected to spend part of their time working independently and part of their time working collaboratively with one or more mentors among our faculty affiliates. In addition, Postdoctoral Fellows are expected to coordinate or participate in relevant working groups, regularly attend the weekly PSTC Colloquia and other PSTC workshops and mentoring activities, present their work to the PSTC community, present research at the Population Association of America (PAA) annual meetings, and submit one or more articles for publication. They are encouraged to prepare grant applications. We request that applicants visit our PSTC faculty page and identify one or two potential faculty mentors; however, applicants do not need to contact potential mentors prior to submitting an application. Diversity, equity and inclusion are integral to the commitment of the Population Studies and Training Center and Brown University. Accordingly, PSTC seeks qualified candidates who can contribute to racial equity, diversity and inclusion in their scholarship and professional activities. Further, the PSTC is keenly interested in diversifying higher education and encourages applications from historically underrepresented groups in higher education. Qualifications NIH requires that applicants be citizens or permanent residents of the United States at the time of application. Applicants must have a Ph.D. in anthropology, economics, sociology, demography, or a related social science discipline at time of appointment.
