Dental disease is the number one disease entity affecting adult pets. Based on a study by the American Veterinary Dental Society, more than 80 percent of dogs and 70 percent of cats develop some degree of periodontal disease by the age of 3 years. Our dentistry team provides progressive oral health care through the diagnosis and treatment of many oral conditions such as gingivitis, periodontal disease, malocclusions, fractured teeth, oral tumors, or painful cavity-like lesions. The OSU Veterinary Medical Hospital is fortunate to have a board certified veterinary dentist in the hospital every Thursday to provide optimal dental care for your pet. Services available include teeth cleaning, oral surgery, root canals and periodontal surgery. In addition, our veterinarians provide preventive dental care as part of the total wellness care for your pet.
