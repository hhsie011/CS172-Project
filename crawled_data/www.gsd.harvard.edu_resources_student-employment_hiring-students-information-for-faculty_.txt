Students are required to submit approved timesheets by the end of the week the work was performed. It is required by Massachusetts law that individuals be paid within 6 days of the end of the pay period. Students should not wait several weeks before submitting timesheets. This creates issues if the GSD is audited and prevents us from keeping accurate records on your accounts and avoiding budget deficits. Students can work a maximum number of 20 hours/week in total, inclusive of all jobs combined at the University when classes are in session, and 40 hours/week in total, inclusive of all jobs combined at the University during breaks.

A Teaching Fellow is an eligible GSD doctoral student who is assigned to assist faculty in teaching select required courses; only a limited number of courses are assigned Teaching Fellows, following established criteria. Priority Criteria for Assignment of Funded Teaching Fellows: Course is a program requirement Course is a large lecture with over 50 expected to enroll Discussion Sections are required in addition to lectures Course has only one instructor Doctoral student’s specific expertise is needed to teach a portion of the class If funded TFs are available, exceptions may be made for courses such as: Electives with enrollment over 50 New courses that require development assistance Faculty and instructors are invited to submit a request for the assignment of TFs to courses in the upcoming academic year. Ensure the position will only include the responsibilities indicated on the Teaching Fellow page. Effort is given to accommodate requests while balancing the needs of faculty, students, and the school. Funded TFs are assigned to courses by a committee consisting of the Associate Dean for Administration, Senior Director of Curricular Affairs and Institutional Research, and the Doctoral Program Directors, and coordinated by the ASP Program Administrator. Faculty should not consider arrangements for a funded Teaching Fellow confirmed until notified in writing by the ASP Administrator, Margaret Moore de Chicojay. In rare cases, faculty teaching courses that are not eligible for a TF may request to hire a Doctoral Teaching Associate (DTA) to support their course. DTAs may be assigned work comparable to that of a TF, including conducting teaching sections, tutorials, and design critiques. They may also read papers, review designs, recommend grades and assist in supervising independent study projects. DTAs may not be responsible for the structure and content of a course, may not offer more than one lecture in the absence of the faculty instructor of record, and may not assign course grades. DTAs must comply with their visa terms, if any, including the stipulation that the sum of all their employment cannot exceed 20 hours per week. These assignments must still be approved centrally; contact ASP Administrator, Margaret Moore de Chicojay. TF assignments for fall and spring will be communicated to faculty over the summer. These assignments are subject to change.
