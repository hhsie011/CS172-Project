4:30 PM Columbia Global Centers | Beijing EVENT BRIEF Aiming for a zero-waste future for the industry, researchers Alissa Park and Sean Zhou from Columbia University’s engineering school have developed a process to extract valuable materials from slag – the waste of iron and steel production – for use in a range of industries, including iron & steel, paper, plastic, cement, oil, and gas. Additional benefits of this project includes reducing overall carbon emissions by using industrially emitted carbon dioxide as one of the reactants in their process. In partnership with Baotou Steel in China, one of the world's largest steel producers, the researchers will launch a pilot study at the Baotou Steel factory in Inner Mongolia, China. If the project is successful, it could substantially reduce the solid waste that has built up in countries with a heavy steel and iron-manufacturing presence, including the United States and China, while reducing the amount of raw material needed in manufacturing and construction. On May 25 at the press briefing, details of this groundbreaking new technology and the planning of the pilot in China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will be revealed for the first time by Alissa Park and Sean Zhou.
