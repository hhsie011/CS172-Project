Implementation Science Initiative Learning Health System Initiative Leveraging CU and NYP resources to optimize our health systemâ€™s performance by enhancing the patient experience, improving population health, and improving the work life of health care providers. Learning Health System Initiative Committees Internal to the Irving Institute, we establish long-term committees in response to immediate needs as they emerge in our communities, and across campus. Working with our leadership, faculty and staff we organize and activate projects to effect change. COVID-19 Research The Irving Institute COVID-19 Research Committee - a rapid, forward-looking response strategy to accelerate translational COVID-19 research. COVID-19 Research Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Committee The mission of the DEI Committee is to advance health equity through program-wide efforts to remove obstacles impacting healthcare, clinical research, and an inclusive healthcare workforce. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Committee Previous Development Projects Through our initiatives and committees, the Institute harnesses the power of shared resources and partnerships to address ever-evolving needs. The marker of success is when these initiatives grow beyond their initial development phases and mature into stand-alone institutional pillars.
