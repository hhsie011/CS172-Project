This roundtable discussion included peers working on this issue from a variety of sectors, with the goal of ensuring that children in crisis do not lose the opportunity to thrive. About the Project The National Center for Disaster Preparedness (NCDP) at Columbia University’s Earth Institute is increasingly involved with issues involving children in crisis domestically and abroad. As part of this growth, we are embarking on an important project with support from Islamic Relief USA to develop tools to help mitigate the impact of toxic stress on refugee children. Our current initiative is focused on developing a tool we call Tifl-Com. Tifl-Com (طفل ) Tools and Information for the Lives of Children on the Move, aims to use mobile app technology to identify and manage the effects of toxic stress, grief, and trauma in Syrian refugee children. The first phase of this project is a needs assessment to ensure that the development of these resources speaks to the actual needs of the intended population in terms of content, culture and technical requirements. This is vital to informing the development of an effective resource.
