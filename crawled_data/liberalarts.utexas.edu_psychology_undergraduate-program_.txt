skip to content Menu x Undergraduate Program Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE) Students The Psychology Department at The University of Texas at Austin is devoted to expanding the horizons of our discipline and to educate our students and the public about behavior, thought processes, and emotion. Our department combines outstanding faculty, staff, graduate, and undergraduate students to break new ground in the study of the mind and behavior. As part of this mission, we are dedicated to building an environment that encourages a diversity of backgrounds and perspectives. At the undergraduate level, we provide students with a solid grounding in psychology by presenting historical and contemporary research on human and animal behavior. Students learn to think creatively and critically about human behavior across gender, culture, and age, and to relate psychological principles to everyday living. Students are also trained in experimental design and statistics, enabling them to evaluate new research findings and communicate their findings in writing and in oral presentations. There are over 1,500 undergraduate Psychology majors and double majors, with approximately 380 undergraduate Psychology degrees awarded per year. The five most common career fields for recent graduates are business, service (e.g., social work), health-related professions (e.g., medicine), education and law. In a survey, 64% of respondents indicated they have pursued or are planning to pursue further education after their Psychology undergraduate degree.
