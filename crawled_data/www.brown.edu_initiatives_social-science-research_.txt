The SSRI is built around one simple idea: that Brown's expanding reputation in the social sciences depends critically on the ability of faculty to focus their efforts on the research, teaching, and mentoring that they are uniquely qualified to do. In my eight years as chair of the Economics Department and five years as director of the Population Studies and Training Center, I have seen what a difference research support can make, particularly when tailored to the particular challenges of each researcher. But until now Brown has lacked a mechanism for providing such assistance across the social sciences. Thanks to the vision of President Paxson and the initiative of Provost Locke, the SSRI has been launched as a three-year pilot to fill that need. Our initial focus will be on grant, project, and budget planning support, but we also have some discretionary funds to help with time sensitive requests. With your input and in partnership with other units on campus, we also hope to develop workshops and computational support as new needs are identified. Please be in touch with me or one of the members of my steering committee if you see ways that we can help your research grow. — Andrew Foster Related Sites Population Studies and Training Center Also in Social Science Research Institute (SSRI) Home About People Services Funding Resources Funding Announcements and Opportunities Explore Brown University Explore Brown University Learn More Brown Homepage About Brown Academics Admission Research Campus Life Find A to Z Index People Directory Information for Students Faculty Staff Families Alumni Friends & Neighbors Top Destinations Global Brown Watson Institute Brown & Providence Graduate School Alpert Medical School School of Public Health School of Engineering Social Science Research Institute Social Science Research Institute Brown University Box 1881 68 Waterman Street Fones Alley Providence, RI 02912 Phone: 401-863-2668 Fax: 401-863-3351 Email [email protected] Giving to Brown Brown University Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA Phone: 401-863-1000 Maps & Directions / Contact Us / Accessibility © 2022 Brown University Connect: [email protected] Facebook Twitter YouTube Instagram iTunes U LinkedIn SnapChat
