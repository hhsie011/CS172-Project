Students listen to their faculty; they hear you when you say that international experience is an essential part of their education. Your regular reminders about study abroad will reinforce its importance. If there is anything that we can do to make sharing information easier, or resources you would like to have access to through our website, please let us know. Non-Brown Faculty & Staff If you are considering program promotion at Brown, we recommend the following: Attend Brown's fall study abroad fair. Meet with a Brown Study Abroad Advisor to share information on your programs. Offer an information session through Brown's OIP. Admit Brown students to your program. Brown's peer advising network directly influences students' academic choices. Word of mouth and student buzz will lead other students to investigate your program. If you have questions or would like to learn more about any of these opportunities, please email us.
