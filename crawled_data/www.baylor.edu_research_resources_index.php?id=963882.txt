Research & Development Technology Commercialization Corporate Philanthropy Technology Commercialization and Industry Engagement within the Office of the Vice Provost for Research assists Baylor faculty by: Identifying industry partners who seek the expertise of Baylor faculty researchers to solve problems related to their industry; and Encouraging collaboration between the researcher and the industry partner who may choose to support the research that could lead to a solution the industry partner seeks. When such collaborations or other funded research lead to technological discoveries or products that have potential for commercialization, the Technology Transfer Office in the Office of the Vice Provost for Research is charged with reviewing the technology with the responsibility for Assessing and evaluating the intellectual property for appropriate protection; and When appropriate, navigating the course toward patents and commercialization. As a matter of practice, faculty should consider their innovations and inventions potentially patentable and present them to the Assistant Vice Provost for an authoritative determination as early in the development process as is appropriate.
