BIG OPPORTUNITIES "Villanova's academics provide students with top-notch resources that result in guaranteed career outcomes. The countless study abroad opportunities across colleges also made Villanova stand out from other universities." –Katelyn Tsai, VSB, West Chester, PA VILLANOVANS ARE MOTIVATED "I came to Villanova because I wanted to help foster current and new communities here. When I visited and spoke to students, I found it attractive how open people with different backgrounds and interests were to continue to improve an already good environment here at Villanova. Whenever there are concerns, people are not afraid to address them and speak up for not only themselves but others. That is what being a community is all about, and I wanted to be a part of it. Villanova is full of leaders ready to take initiative, and it is certainly a pleasure to be surrounded by them." —Craig Newton, VSB, New York CONSTANT SUPPORT "I chose Villanova because I fell in love with the community of students, alumni and faculty here. When you become a Villanova student, you enter into a larger family of people who truly want to support and walk alongside you. I’m reminded every day of how special it is to be a Villanovan and to find a lifelong connection with this community." —Rachel Randall, FCN, Marcellus, NY CARING STUDENTS "I became interested in Villanova because of its high reputation in the business world. I ended up choosing Nova because the students I met before enrolling all cared about the university and each other so much which was something that made me want to be a part of the community." —Dan Pruitt, VSB, Mount Laurel, NJ A BLEND OF EVERYTHING "I chose Villanova because it felt like a perfect blend of everything I was looking for in a school. From the strong sense of community on campus, ample volunteer and extracurricular opportunities, small classroom sizes, engaged faculty, and involved alumni network I knew Villanova would be a place where I could thrive both inside and outside of the classroom." —Chiara Rego, CLAS, Glastonbury, CT COLLABORATION, NOT COMPETITION “Villanova students have a genuine love for each other, their school, and their larger community, which is reflected in a culture of collaboration, not competition. Both your professors and your classmates are supporting you and want to see you succeed.” —Olivia Pfeiffer, CLAS, Boulder, CO WE BECOME OUR BEST SELVES "I love how Villanova is competitive yet collaborative.
