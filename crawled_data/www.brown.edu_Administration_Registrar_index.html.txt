Welcome The Office of the Registrar is dedicated to providing service of the highest caliber to all of our constituents - current and former students, faculty, administrative staff, and the general public. The mission of the Office of the Registrar is to support the instructional activities of Brown University by providing essential enrollment, curricular, and student record services to the entire campus community with the highest degree of accuracy. We accomplish this by serving as custodian of all student records in accordance with university policies and government statutes as well as managing the student information system for all areas related to enrollment/registration, course information and scheduling, grading/transcript production, and ultimately degree clearance and certification. The Office of the Registrar strives to utilize technology-based solutions when possible to increase efficiencies and data integrity in these critical areas as well as support the overall needs of the academic community. The Registrar's Office is located on the third floor of Page-Robinson Hall, 69 Brown Street (on the corner of Brown and Waterman streets across from the Faunce House Arch). 2020-2021 Office of the Registrar Annual Report 2019-2020 Office of the Registrar Annual Report 2018-2019 Office of the Registrar Annual Report 2017-2018 Office of the Registrar Annual Report 2016-2017 Office of the Registrar Annual Report 2015-2016 Office of the Registrar Annual Report Related Files 2018-2019 Office of the Registrar Annual Report 2017-2018 Office of the Registrar Annual Report 2016-2017 Office of the Registrar Annual Report 2015-2016 Office of the Registrar Annual Report Academic Calendar Academic Records University Bulletin Course Enrollment Degree Guidelines Final Exams Faculty/Staff Resources University Scheduling Office Classroom Assignments & Locations Contact Us Gateways For Students For Faculty For Staff Print this Page Share this Page Office of the Registrar Brown University Box K 69 Brown Street Page-Robinson Hall, 3rd floor Providence, RI 02912 Phone 401-863-2500 Fax 401-863-7542 [email protected] Academic Calendar Jun 2 All Day Registration period for Summer courses for Brown undergraduates re-opens at 9:00 a.m.EDT and remains open until Wednesday June 22 at 5:00 p.m. EDT Jun 19 All Day Residence halls open.
