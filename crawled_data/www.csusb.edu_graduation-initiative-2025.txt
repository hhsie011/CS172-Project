To meet the workforce demands of Californiaâ€™s innovation economy in the years and decades to come, Graduation Initiative 2025 will add 100,000 more baccalaureate degree-educated citizens to California over the next 10 years. This would bring the total number of expected CSU graduates between 2015 and 2025 alone to more than one million. CSUSB is committed to the Graduation Initiative 2025 challenge to decrease time to degree and eliminate the achievement gap.
