The challenges are more complex, the stakes are higher, and the players are increasingly global. The only constant today is change, and Columbia Business School prepares its students not just to navigate change, but to use it to create new opportunities. Courses at Columbia Business School are taught both by the School’s stable of 150 full-time faculty members — thought leaders whose research is transforming the way business is conducted across the world — and by more than 100 adjuncts — practitioners from a wealth of industries who, because of the School’s symbiotic relationship with New York, can take the subway uptown to teach a class on their lunch break. The School’s comprehensive core curriculum builds the foundation necessary for success in any field, while electives offer insight into specialized areas of expertise. Versatile programs like Master Classes, the Individual, Business, and Society Curriculum, and Columbia CaseWorks all approach business education in new ways, and the School’s cluster system encourages students to learn not only with, but from, their peers. Beyond the classroom, the School’s more than 100 student organizations, its remarkably accessible alumni network, cutting-edge research centers, and countless events all work in tandem to help students rewire their brains for success amid uncertainty.
