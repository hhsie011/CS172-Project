To report an assault or another crime to the Georgia Tech Police Department (GTPD), please call (404) 894-2500.You can also contact GTPD via the LiveSafe app, which you can download for free from the App store or Google Play. If you are a victim-survivor of sexual violence and need the urgent support of a VOICE Advocate, call GTPD at (404) 894-2500 and ask to speak to the On-Call Advocate. You do not need to make a police report or provide any information other than your phone number. Reporting an assault to the Georgia Tech Police Department (GTPD) or other law enforcement or campus security authorities does not require filing criminal charges, but it does allow all support systems to be put in place for the survivor. Filing a police report will provide the opportunity for collection of evidence, which is helpful in prosecution and will allow the survivor to be connected with the appropriate support and medical resources. Reporting is best done as soon as possible after the assault, but it may be done at any time. Students, faculty and staff who choose to notify the police should be aware of the importance of the immediacy of reporting the incident and the importance of preserving physical evidence at the incident scene as well as on the person harmed. If possible, a victim of sexual assault should not wash, douche, use the toilet, or change clothing prior to a medical/legal examination. The gathering of physical evidence can provide important evidence and support of criminal charges leading to a successful prosecution. Photographing your injuries and saving relevant texts, emails, screenshots or other types of evidence may also be helpful if you choose to pursue a criminal or administrative investigation. Survivors who are reporting an immediate assault should be accompanied to a health care facility of their choice to allow for collection of evidence and treatment. If a sexual assault victim chooses to report the incident days, weeks, or even months after the assault, important support systems are still available and can be arranged; however, criminal investigations become much more difficult.
