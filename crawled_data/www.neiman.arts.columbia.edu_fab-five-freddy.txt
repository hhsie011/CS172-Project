The subjects as well as the technique - the prints are flocked with glitter - recall works on canvas from the artist’s 2009 Crystal Punch series which employ crystals to highlight his subjects’ boxing shorts or gloves. Fred Brathwaite (b. 1959), better known as Fab 5 Freddy, together with Lee Quiñones, Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat, was a seminal figure of New York City’s downtown graffiti scene in the 1970s and ultimately transitioned from making street art to exhibiting his work in galleries and museums around the world. Most notably, his work was featured in the groundbreaking exhibition Art in the Streets at The Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles in 2011. Beyond his art practice, Fab 5 directed Wild Style, a cult classic and the first film about Hip-Hop culture along with numerous music videos and commercials.
