Where will the International Studies Program take you? We can't wait to find out. Quick Links Read a welcome letter from our director, Erik Owens Keep in touch by subscribing to our weekly newsletter and following us on Instagram and Facebook. Meet our Peer Advisors, who help majors and minors understand grad requirements, course registration, study abroad, and more. Locate forms for course substitutions, withdrawals, or pre-approvals; internships, etc. on the Academic Forms page. Learn about the pathway through the major and minor, including admission, selecting courses, preparing for study abroad, writing a senior thesis, and thinking about post-grad opportunities. We have posted presentations, webinars (which inlude student testimonials), and a program flyer. Read reflections from students and alumni about their experience in the IS Program. Registration and Advising All IS majors should meet with their academic advisor before registering for next semester's courses. New majors (class of 2025) will be assigned an IS faculty advisor this summer, but can work with IS Peer Advisors until then. Please consult the IS Advising Handbook for detailed requirements for the IS major and minor. Approved Fall 2022 IS courses are listed on the Courses page, and on the Approved Fall 2022 Courses spreadsheet. A central list of *all* approved electives -- which does not indicate the semester offered, but gives students a sense of course options for the future -- is also available. Registration dates: Rising seniors (2023): April 6-7 Rising juniors (2024): April 8-11 Rising sophomores (2025): April 12-13 All courses taken abroad for IS credit must be pre-approved, using this form. Apply to be an IS major Please visit our Admission page for complete information about applying to the major or declaring a minor. Here are a few important details: BC students who wish to become IS majors should submit an application by 5pm on February 1 of their freshman year. Transfer students who will start their sophomore year at BC should contact the IS Program as soon as you are accepted to BC, and complete the same application as the BC students. Each year we accept a handful of transfer students into our program. Late applications may be accepted at the discretion of the director and associate director, when space allows. Please submit your application here and let us know (via isp@bc.edu) that you've filed an application. Please note that it is extremely rare for new majors to be accepted after the first week of their sophomore year.
