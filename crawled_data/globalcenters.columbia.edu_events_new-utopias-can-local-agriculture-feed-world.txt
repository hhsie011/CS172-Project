Share Add to Calendar: Google Yahoo December 14, 2021 12:30 PM - 1:45 PM Online VIRTUAL EVENT | 12:30 p.m. (New York) | 6:30 p.m. (Paris) From New York to Melbourne, from Paris to Cape Town, a growing number of cities worldwide are taking part in a global reflection on the future of local food and agriculture. The impact of climate change and rising socioeconomic inequalities is forcing municipalities to design their food systems around sustainability and solidarity. Additionally, the world trade disruption caused by the pandemic painfully revealed a heavy dependence on international food supply chains, underscoring the need for local food production. This first webinar in the New Utopias series will explore major trends in local food systems, the social, economic, and environmental challenges to consider, and the concept of “cities as laboratories of innovation,” foregrounding their impact on the present and future of urban life. Speakers: Liliana Annovazzi-Jakab, Chief of Section, UNECE/FAO Forestry and Timber Section - Forests, Land and Housing Division, United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Pamela Ann Koch, Mary Swartz Rose Associate Professor of Nutrition Education; Faculty Director, Laurie M.
