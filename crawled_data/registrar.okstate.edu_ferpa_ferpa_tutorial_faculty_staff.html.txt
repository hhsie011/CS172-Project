It contains 10 questions, including hypothetical scenarios that will allow you to test your understanding of FERPA and apply the information from the FERPA website. The tutorial is instructional in nature rather than strictly evaluative. Before you begin the tutorial please carefully review all of the topics in the OSU FERPA webpage - both the FERPA General Information section and the appropriate Faculty FAQ and Staff FAQ sections. You may enter the tutorial by using your O-Key e-mail address and password. If you do not have O-Key access, you may activate your account on the O-Key website.
