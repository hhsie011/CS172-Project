To the contemporary mind, a reference to 17th century France calls up images of decadence, pleasure, and luxury, embodied in the grand architecture of Versailles. But how was this world interpreted and experienced by the men and women who lived in it? Bringing together original texts by 17th century literary giants from Molière to Racine, visual representations of Versailles, and insights from scholarly works, this exhibit exposes the personal and political dilemmas that governed ambitions in the back corridors of the Sun-King's court.
