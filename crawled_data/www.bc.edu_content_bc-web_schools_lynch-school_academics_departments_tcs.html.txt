Our teacher education, special education, and curriculum and instruction programs employ this equitable approach to prepare leaders who combat marginalization in a range of scholastic environments. Explore TCS Programs How to Apply Teacher Education Program Themes All of our teacher education programs are grounded in four unifying themes that represent our shared values. Each theme describes our conceptualization of a key aspect of teaching, learning, and schooling. Although no single course or fieldwork experience takes up all of the themes fully, taken together, the elements of our programs are designed to provide multiple opportunities for teacher candidates to explore these themes in theory and practice. Theme 1: Advancing Equity and Justice We conceptualize teaching as an activity with political dimensions. We acknowledge that there are significant historical and ongoing disparities in the educational and social opportunities, resources, achievements, and outcomes between historically marginalized students and their more privileged counterparts. We see the purpose of teaching as enhancing the learning and life chances of the diverse student population by working with others to challenge the inequities of school and society. Our programs require teacher candidates to recognize and challenge inequities in educational opportunities and work with others to advance equity and a more just society. A major challenge for us as teacher educators is to understand both the potential and the limitations of our programs even as we acknowledge that teachers alone cannot eradicate societal and school inequities but they can work with others in larger social movements to do so. Theme 2: Promoting Knowledge Co-construction We believe that teachers and learners are active agents in their own learning who draw on prior knowledge and their cultural, linguistic and experiential resources to co-construct knowledge as they interact with texts, media, materials, technologies, and others. Our programs foster the capacity of teacher candidates to create learning environments that promote knowledge co-construction. Theme 3: Inquiring into Practice We conceptualize teaching as a reflective and recursive process of inquiry that occurs within socially, culturally, and historically situated learning environments with the purpose of providing all students with deep and authentic learning. Our programs advance an inquiry stance that positions practitioners in the center of educational transformation. Theme 4: Embracing an Ethic of Care Teaching is a reciprocal and relational activity that is grounded in respect for the dignity of all individuals. We are committed to cultivating a humanizing vision of teaching that recognizes the whole person, is inspired by an ethic of care and is committed to collective well-being. Our programs promote approaches that encourage all learners to build lives of meaning and purpose. programs Programs View All Program match your criteria Bachelor's Master's Doctoral Certificates Dual

The acceptance rate for the Class of 2025 was 19 percent, the lowest in recent school history. The Lynch School admits students to its graduate programs based on a number of factors, including outstanding academic performance in an undergraduate major related to their content area. All graduate applicants are carefully reviewed by the core graduate faculty in teacher education. Facts & Figures Strong Preparation in the Pedagogy & Practice of Teaching Our undergraduate and graduate students emerge from our programs well-rounded and career-ready. Under the direction of highly-qualified faculty, our students enroll in methods courses related to specific content areas and undergo extensive clinical preparation and evaluation in public and private schools. Over the course of their studies, undergraduate students complete three pre-practica and a full practicum in varied school settings, for a total of 675 hours. Graduate students complete 525 hours. In addition to rigorous preparation in the liberal arts and academic content areas related to teaching, all undergraduate candidates complete the full Boston College Core Curriculum. Secondary education majors also complete a second Arts and Sciences major in the content area of their certification, and elementary education majors complete a second major of their choosing.
