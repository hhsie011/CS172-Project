The Brown MPH is rooted in the University's tradition of academic excellence and interdisciplinary collaboration, much like the field of public health itself. In recent years, the dual pandemics of COVID-19 and racism have revealed deep disparities in health systems and outcomes, and the Health Equity Scholars program reflects Brown’s commitment to address these inequities. Eliminating health disparities requires leaders with bold ideas, diverse perspectives, and a commitment to serve the most vulnerable communities. Greater diversity in the workforce — and especially among the ranks of public health leadership — brings attention to inequities and leads to more just policies and practices. The Health Equity Scholars program was designed to help exceptional MPH candidates develop both their leadership skills and the technical skills needed to combat health inequities. The HES program aims to create a network of leaders who will use their training to transform public health research and practice. Ready to submit your application?
