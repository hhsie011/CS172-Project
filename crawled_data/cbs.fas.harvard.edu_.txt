We are determining the structure and function of neural circuits; investigating how these circuits govern behavior and vary between individuals; learning how they change during development and aging; and deepening our understanding of what is amiss in neurological and psychiatric disorders, and how to address these pathologies. To accomplish this mission, CBS brings neuroscientists together with physical scientists and engineers to develop and deploy new tools for neuroscience. Headquartered in the new Northwest Building on Oxford Street in Cambridge, CBS has strong links throughout the neuroscience community at Harvard University. Members are drawn from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the Harvard Medical School, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and the Harvard-affiliated hospitals.
