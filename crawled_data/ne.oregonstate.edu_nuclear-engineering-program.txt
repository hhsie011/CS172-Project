Within the School of Nuclear Science and Engineering there are numerous opportunities for students to gain practical knowledge and experience in many areas of the field. Research, development and testing are school hallmarks, and undergraduate students have numerous opportunities to participate in the research activities conducted by our faculty and graduate students. At Oregon State you can experience nuclear engineering like nowhere else in the world, as our large-scale test facilities, renowned faculty, and excellent student-to-faculty ratio make for a unique and rewarding experience. 1 of 24 University research and test reactors in the United States. $8M NSE Research expenditures in 2018-19. No. 11 U.S. News & World Report “Best Nuclear Engineering Program” Welcome, Izabela Gutowska This fall, Gutowska brings her fascination with fluid dynamics back to the College of Engineering’s School of Nuclear Science and Engineering, where she earned her doctorate in nuclear engineering in 2015. No looking back Juwan Johnson chose to attend Oregon State because of its nuclear engineering program — and because the university is one of only two in the nation with land, sea, space, and sun grant designations. Core concern Samuel Briggs, assistant professor of nuclear engineering, and Julie Tucker, associate professor of materials science, are developing materials that survive harsh conditions of nuclear reactors. Academics and Admission The Bachelor of Science and Honors Bachelor of Science degree programs in Nuclear Engineering are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org (view our accreditation information). For any questions about the program, please contact Joan Stueve, head undergraduate advisor. Transfer Students Transfer student information is available at the Office of Admissions. Navy Students Education through the Seaman-to-Admiral (STA-21) program provides you with the tools to succeed as a commissioned officer, and to later have a promising career as a civilian nuclear engineer or radiation health physicist. After completion of the Naval Nuclear Power School you can enroll in the STA-21 program to complete a three-year bachelor's of science degree at NSE. Engineering is an academically challenging field, and as a Navy student at Oregon State you’ll be held to a higher standard than traditional students. We want to see you make the grade: our world-class faculty, tutoring services and library are available to you. Because you have 36 months to complete your degree, it’s important to understand how your transcripts will transfer to Oregon State. Please review the Nuclear Engineering STA-21 Three-Year Program Guide below. You also need to be conscious of acceptance deadlines for the STA-21 program. Once your Oregon State application is completed, admissions decisions can be made in 2-4 weeks and sometimes in as little as one week. So please plan accordingly. For more specific information on the STA-21 program please visit the Oregon State Department of Naval Science.
