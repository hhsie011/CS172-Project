Program Information The Department of African American Studies offers the African American Studies concentration for undergraduates with a strong interest in studying the complex interplay between political, economic, and cultural forces shaping the historic achievements and struggles of African-descended people in the United States and their relationship to others around the world. Information and Departmental Plan of Study Students in this field are expected to understand the basic themes and ideas that structure interdisciplinary work in African American Studies. The concentration provides students an opportunity to focus their studies in one of three subfields: African American Culture and Life (AACL) In the African American Culture and Life subfield, students encounter the theoretical canon and keywords, which shape the contemporary discipline of African American Studies. Accessing a range of interdisciplinary areas, situated primarily in the United States, students will learn to take a critical posture in examining the patterns and practices that order and transform black subjects and black life. Global Race and Ethnicity (GRE) In the Global Race and Ethnicity subfield, students use the prevailing analytical tools and critical perspectives of African American studies to consider comparative approaches to groups, broadly defined. Students will examine the intellectual traditions, socio-political contexts, expressive forms, and modes of belonging of people who are understood to share common boundaries/experiences as either: Africans and the African Diaspora outside of the United States, and Non-African-descended people of color within the United States. Race and Public Policy (RPP) In the Race and Public Policy subfield, students use and interrogate social science methodologies in examining the condition of the American state and American institutions and practices. With an analysis of race and ethnicity at the center, students will examine the development of institutions and practices, with the growth and formation of racial and ethnic identities, including changing perceptions, measures, and reproduction of inequality. With a combination of courses and interdisciplinary research opportunities, students who complete the African American Studies concentration will be equipped with the critical and analytical skills that will prepare them for a range of professions. They will be highly qualified to pursue graduate work in the field or its cognate disciplines, and prepared to enter a society in which race continues to be salient. Early Concentration Early concentration is open to spring semester sophomores who have completed the prerequisite for entry into the department by the end of the fall semester of sophomore year. It allows students to get an early start on independent work, and is especially useful for students planning to study abroad in their junior year. Admission to the Program Prerequisite for entry into the African American Studies concentration is the successful completion on a graded basis of at least one core survey African American Studies (AAS) course. Program of Study Concentrators are required to complete nine (9) courses: two (2) core survey courses, AAS 300 Junior Seminar: Research and Writing in African American Studies, and six (6) additional African American Studies courses. In addition, all concentrators are required to participate in the senior colloquium. Students complete two (2) core survey courses listed below. At least one (1) of these must be a Pre-20th century course. Students are strongly encouraged to complete both survey courses by the end of junior year. Pre-20th Century AAS 244 Introduction to Pre-20th Century Black Diaspora Art (Pre-20th century) AAS 353 African American Literature: Origins to 1910 (Pre-20th century) AAS 366 African American History to 1863 (Pre-20th century) 20th Century and beyond AAS 245 Introduction to 20th Century African American Art AAS 359 African American Literature: Harlem Renaissance to Present AAS 367 African American History Since Emancipation At the end of their fall semester, juniors declare a subfield to pursue, selecting from the following courses: African American Culture and Life (AACL) Global Race and Ethnicity (GRE) Race and Public Policy (RPP) Four (4) courses must be taken in the chosen subfield, with two (2) additional courses as follows: If the chosen subfield is AACL or RPP, then the two (2) additional courses must be selected from the GRE courses. If the chosen subfield is GRE, then one (1) must be an AACL course, and one (1) must be an RPP course. Students are permitted to take up to two (2) approved cognate courses in other departments. See the departmental website for the lists of courses and approved cognates by subfield. Concentrators will complete junior and senior independent work, participate in a senior colloquium and a departmental comprehensive oral examination based on feedback from the senior thesis. Senior Colloquium Concentrators are required to participate in the Senior Colloquium, which seeks to provide a space for seniors concentrating in African American Studies to reflect upon their experiences within the Department, and upon how the understanding and insight they have gained here can and should influence their lives beyond graduation. The Senior Colloquium meets a total of six times per term. A member of the AAS core faculty leads each colloquium meeting, and senior thesis advisers are expected to attend at least one session at the invitation of their advisee. Independent Work Junior Year During the fall term all juniors must enroll in AAS 300 Junior Seminar: Research and Writing in African American Studies. This course introduces students to theories and methods of research design in African American Studies in preparation for the junior paper. In the spring term, juniors will complete independent work that includes independent reading and the writing of the junior paper working with a faculty adviser. Senior Year During the senior year concentrators are required to participate in a senior colloquium, which seeks to provide a space for seniors concentrating in African American Studies to reflect upon their experiences within the Department, and upon how the understanding and insight they have gained here can and should influence their lives beyond graduation. With the guidance of a faculty adviser, they must then complete independent work, which consists of writing a thesis. The senior thesis will then serve as the basis of the senior comprehensive exam. Senior Departmental Examination The comprehensive exam in the department consists of an oral examination based on the senior thesis. AAS Program Certificate The Department of African American Studies offers students concentrating in another department the opportunity to earn a certificate in African American Studies (AAS). Students who opt to pursue a certificate in AAS, gain access to an extraordinary bibliography that prepares them to think about difference in sophisticated ways. The Course of Study is directed in three distinct subfields; African American Culture and Life (AACL), Race and Public Policy (RPP), and Global Race and Ethnicity (GRE). Undergraduate students may apply for formal admission to the certificate program at any time once they have taken and achieved a satisfactory standing in any African American Studies course. Students must complete two AAS core survey courses from the list below: AAS 244 Introduction to Pre-20th Century Black Diaspora Art AAS 245 Introduction to 20th Century African American Art AAS 353 African American Literature: Origins to 1910 AAS 359 African American Literature: Harlem Renaissance to Present AAS 366 African American History to 1863 AAS 367 African American History Since Emancipation Students must take three additional courses in AAS, Cross-Listed by AAS, or from our approved cognates list. They are strongly urged to choose these additional courses from the RPP or GRE subfield, and at least one (1) of these MUST be in the GRE sub-field. Please consult the listing for the Program in African American Studies for additional information. Courses AAS 201 African American Studies and the Philosophy of Race (also PHI 291 ) Fall CDEC This course introduces students to the field of African American Studies through an examination of the complex experiences, both past and present, of Americans of African descent. Through a multidisciplinary perspective, it reveals the complicated ways we come to know and live race in the United States.
