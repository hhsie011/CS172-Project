Neurons and systems of neurons vary in their activity patterns on millisecond to second time scales, commonly referred to as "neural dynamics." This course addresses mechanisms underlying this flexibility and its potential meaning for information processing in the brain. The course integrates biophysical, computational, single neuron and human studies. In addition to lectures and readings, students will learn how to build computational models to simulate neural dynamics at various scales from single neurons to networks, using Matlab and the Human Neocortical Neurosolver. Computational modeling will be taught hands-on in an interactive lab session each week. Please request override through [email protected] NEUR 1440 S01 Primary Instructor Jones Communication In the Brain: What We Know and How We Know It Neurons communicate through the thousands of synapses they form. In this seminar-style course, we will explore the cellular and molecular underpinnings of synaptic transmission. We will then examine how synapse number and function can be modulated to shape circuit function during development, learning & memory formation, and in response to perturbations. We will develop scientific thinking skills and an understanding of experimental approaches in modern neuroscience by focusing on how the field investigates synaptic transmission and plasticity. All readings are from primary literature. Please request override through [email protected] NEUR 1530 S01 Primary Instructor O'Connor-Giles Structure of the Nervous System Combined lecture and laboratory course on the anatomy of the central nervous system. Lectures survey the circuitry of the major neural systems for sensation, movement, cognition, and emotion. Laboratory exercises (Mon. 10:30-12:30) include brain dissections, microscopy of neural tissue, and discussion of clinical cases. Prerequisites: NEUR 0010, NEUR 1020, and NEUR 1030. Please request an override through [email protected] Please keep in mind that decisions on overrides may not be made until the first meeting of the course. NEUR 1650 S01 Primary Instructor Berson Region of Interest: Amygdala An in-depth exploration of the amygdala. Topics will include: cell types and properties; synaptic properties; plasticity; connections to other brain areas; sub-divisions within the area; the region's role in sensation and perception; the region's role in action and behavior; the region's role in learning and memory; and diseases and disorders. Students will gain a deeper understanding of concepts and principles that apply throughout the brain. Students will gain experience with primary literature and learn about techniques for studying the area. NEUR 1930N S01 Please request the override during pre-registration. You will not be granted an override at this time, but students who request overrides will get additional information about how to gain a spot in this course by the end of August. Primary Instructor Linden Advanced Molecular and Cellular Neurobiology I Focuses on molecular and cellular approaches used to study the CNS at the level of single molecules, individual cells and single synapses by concentrating on fundamental mechanisms of CNS information transfer, integration, and storage. Topics include biophysics of single channels, neural transmission and synaptic function. Enrollment limited to graduate students. NEUR 2030 S01 Primary Instructor Hart Advanced Systems Neuroscience Focuses on systems approaches to study nervous system function. Lectures and discussions focus on neurophysiology, neuroimaging and lesion analysis in mammals, including humans. Cognitive neuroscience approaches will become integrated into the material.

NEUR 2050 S01 Primary Instructor Moore Statistical Neuroscience An introduction to the statistical modeling of multiscale neural dynamics in networks of neurons and large-scale brain networks with a focus on stochastic processes and random dynamical systems. Analysis of dynamical and statistical network properties: stationarity, directed transfer functions, stability and bifurcations, phase transitions. Related applications to prediction, control, low-dimensional representation, probabilistic neural population encoding and decoding are introduced as well. This is a course for senior undergraduate and graduate students with a background in systems/computational neuroscience and/or applied math/biomedical engineering. Lectures are accompanied by hands-on Python/Matlab-based applications to real and simulated neural data. Topics include: (1) Time and spectral domain models of network dynamics based on multivariate neural time series and point process observations with exogenous inputs; vector autoregressive processes, nonlinear Hawkes processes; stability, transfer functions; (2) Identification of directed interactions in networks of neurons and brain inter-areal communication (Granger causality, transfer entropy, ODE networks); (3) Collective dynamics and low-dimensional representations of network dynamics; (4) Prediction, neural population encoding and decoding for brain-computer interfaces: Bayesian probabilistic approaches based on linear/nonlinear state-space models, machine learning; (5) Data assimilation methods for modeling neural network dynamics. Example datasets include neuronal spike trains, local field potentials, ECoG/SEEG. PREREQUISITES: Introduction to statistics and probability, calculus and linear algebra; Python/Matlab programming language; familiarity with stochastic processes, difference/differential equations and related math background is helpful. Instructor permission required. NEUR 2110 S01 Primary Instructor Truccolo Behavioral Neurogenetics Laboratory Recent advances in molecular biology and molecular genetics have allowed researchers to test specific hypotheses concerning the genetic control of behavior and neurological disease. This course will familiarize you with the relatively new and exciting field of neurogenetics, and provide hands-on experience in developing and conducting behavioral neurogenetic experiments using the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. This course will be a laboratory course focused on reading and understanding the primary literature, gaining expertise in the design and implementation of basic fly genetics, behavioral testing and analysis of tracking data, and the preparation of research reports associated with laboratory work. Throughout the course we will discuss the appropriateness, use, and limitations of animal models and human models for studying pathology, run real experiments with live animals, and collect, analyze, interpret, and write up results associated with those experiments.
