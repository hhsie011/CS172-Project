" How We Support Texas Service to the State As a nationally ranked college of education at the state’s flagship institution, we are committed to leveraging the scale and reach of the university and all its resources and strengths to positively impact the educational outcomes in Texas. The College of Education is deeply concerned by the COVID-19 pandemic's negative and disparate impact on the educational and emotional well-being of Texas children. We are uniquely positioned to work collaboratively and collectively to develop evidence-based and scalable programs that will support the success and thriving of all children, families, educators, schools, and communities across Texas. In addition to our PreK-12 initiative, the College of Education is committed to promoting postsecondary equity and access across higher education through research programs and initiatives such as Project MALES and the L.E.A.P. Lab. We will continue our work throughout the state of Texas to push these and similar initiatives forward. The College of Education works collectively with university partners, systems, leaders, and “grassroots” constituents in the field, and the broader education and health ecosystems to design innovations that can drive transformation at scale and be sustained within existing educational and healthcare structures. Key Initiatives Texas Education Research-Practice-Policy Partnership (RP3) When university researchers, practitioners, and education stakeholders from across Texas came together to address the impact of COVID-19 on kids, schools, and learning, they recommended the establishment of a Research-Practice-Policy Partnership (RP3). The RP3 would provide a statewide mechanism to respond to urgent needs, and work to identify best practices and evidence-based solutions that can be evaluated, adapted, and scaled across the state to support the positive development of children, families, schools, and communities.
