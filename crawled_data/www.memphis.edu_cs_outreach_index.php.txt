As an official chapter of 100 Girls of Code, we have organized several free workshops to introduce girls ages 10-18 to coding. These workshops have covered various topics including Scratch, App Inventor, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Java. Workshops have been hosted at a number of different locations, including the UofM, Christian Brothers University, St. Mary's Episcopal School, and Hutchison School. Our faculty and students have helped teach several pre-college computer science courses with Memphis nonprofit CodeCrew. Funded collaborations have included the TigerCrew project, which involved having UofM undergraduates teach computer science using the Unity 3D game engine. TigerCrew was funded with an $18,500 Strengthening Communities grant from the UofM School of Urban Affairs and Public Policy. We have hosted numerous visits from pre-college students, and we have sent UofM faculty/student representatives to speak at a number of local schools. Please contact cs-info@memphis.edu to arrange a visit.
