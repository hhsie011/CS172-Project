What is part-time study at Cornell? Part-time study is a way for you to earn college credit at Cornell without enrolling in a degree program. Whether you want to explore a new interest, enhance your resume, or strengthen your professional skills, you can choose from thousands of regular university courses year-round. You'll study alongside Cornell undergraduate and graduate students and have access to university libraries and other campus facilities. Your grades and credits will be recorded on an official Cornell transcript. You can generally transfer these credits to a degree at Cornell or elsewhereâ€”but always check with your school or institution. Eligibility: Anyone high school age and older who is not currently a Cornell degree candidate is eligible for part-time study, including Cornell employees and retirees (tuition waivers may apply), Cornell alumni, executives and professionals, area residents, high school students, and international students.
