Because learning happens both inside and outside the classroom, co-curricular engagement is critical to the student experience and to student success. GobblerConnect is the place to start your search for where you’ll thrive. Search hundreds of campus organizations and use this central hub to find events and activities all year long. Gobblerfest kicks off each fall semester. The annual festival connects students with the wide array of campus activities and opportunities to engage the surrounding community. VT Engage is our service learning and civic engagement center. Our motto at Virginia Tech — Ut Prosim (That I May Serve) — is the foundation of the university, and we take it seriously. It means something unique to each person on campus, and VT Engage works to connect students, faculty, and communities together, allowing individuals to put our motto into action. Nearly 20 percent of the undergraduate population participates in one of our 55 chapter fraternity and sorority life communities. Sports are also a great way to connect with your fellow Hokies. From the variety of options in our Recreational Sports Department to signing up for the student ticket lottery to attend NCAA games, you’ll become immersed in Hokie Nation in no time.
