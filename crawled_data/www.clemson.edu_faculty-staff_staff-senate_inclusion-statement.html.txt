We are the voice for all classified and unclassified staff members. We promote an inclusive environment that values and respects others. We are committed to communicating ideas and concerns that affect all staff employees to University leadership. The tragic and senseless killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor, as well as past killings and violence, are clear evidence of the racial injustice experienced by countless Black people in this country. When we see the Black members of our Clemson community hurt and angered by violence and injustice, we want everyone to know we are also outraged and anguished by this senselessness. We join in solidarity with the University Leadership and our campus partners in condemning injustice, systemic racism, discrimination, violence, brutality, and hatred. We hear you, we see you, and we support you. We are dedicated to enhancing awareness about inclusion, equity, and diversity by committing to the following: Engage and encourage membership to participate in opportunities available for staff through the Office of Inclusion and Equity; Increase diversity within Staff Senate; Provide a supportive and safe environment. We stand together in calling for a Clemson community that is just and inclusive, where everyone is valued.
