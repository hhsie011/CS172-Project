What are poets allowed to say? What do they allow themselves? And who allows allowing? Do poets who, by virtue of writing, are called poets (Dichter) write under the dictate of a poetic law whose application and adherence to fulfillment or transgression in each poem emerges as an interpretation of the law? Or does the poem dictate (being called Gedicht for precisely that reason), almost in reverse, the law to which it corresponds in the first place? Do poems originate from laws or laws from poems? Unfolding these, and similar questions, the book offers readings of (poetic) license, in Horace, Dante, Kant, Hölderlin, Nietzsche, Benjamin, and Kafka. https://engeler-verlage.com/wordpress/product/thomas-schestag-erlaubt-entlaubt/ Brown University Providence RI 02912 401-863-1000 Quick Navigation Visit Brown Campus Map A to Z Contact Us Footer Navigation News Events Campus Safety Accessibility Careers at Brown The campaign for building on distinction Give To Brown © Brown University Brown University For You Search Menu Mobile Site Navigation Mobile Site Navigation Home Undergraduate Coursework Concentration Student Information Awards and Fellowships Study Abroad and Internships Graduate Admissions Requirements Resources Graduate Students Recent Ph.D Placement Courses Past Courses People News Events Past Events Contact This Site Only All of Brown.edu People Search Search people Advanced Search Search Close Search Faculty Publication from Thomas Schestag Open details for Faculty Publication from Thomas Schestag Bookmark this Page
