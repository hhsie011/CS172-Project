Applied Health and Recreation Overview Courses Undergraduate Programs Graduate Programs Minors Faculty Dr. Bert Jacobson, EdD—School Head, Regents Professor, Seretean Endowed Professor The School of Kinesiology, Applied Health and Recreation (KAHR) offers undergraduate and graduate programs in Applied Exercise Science, Recreation Management, Recreational Therapy, Health and Human Performance, and Leisure Studies. These programs provide excellence in graduate and undergraduate education through current academic relevance and proven standards. Candidates are encouraged to engage in scholarly inquiry and research productivity to benefit the people of Oklahoma and beyond. Areas of service extend through involvement with the university, community, state and nation. The commonality in programs within KAHR provides unique opportunities for program interaction and collaboration for both faculty and students. Course Prefixes Course prefixes in KAHR include HHP (Health and Human Performance); RMRT (Recreational Management and Recreational Therapy); and LEIS (Leisure Studies). Applied Exercise Science Jason Defreitas, PhD—Associate Professor and HHP Coordinator The program in Applied Exercise Science at OSU prepares students through coursework such as biomechanics, exercise physiology, exercise psychology, exercise testing, sports nutrition, cardiac rehabilitation, strength and conditioning, and overall fitness for both healthy individuals and those with special needs. The Degree offers two options: Pre-Professional and Strength and Conditioning. The Pre-Professional concentration is designed for undergraduates interested in careers in Clinical Exercise Physiology, Cardiac/Stroke Rehabilitation, Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Athletic Training, and graduate school. The Strength and Conditioning concentration is designed for students interested in careers in Strength and Conditioning, Personal Training, Fitness Instructor, Coaching, Fitness Facility Management, etc. The Strength and Conditioning concentration is recognized by the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) for our emphasis in strength and conditioning. The NSCA Education Recognition Program (ERP) recognizes and distinguishes schools with standardized, approved strength and conditioning or personal training curricula in undergraduate and graduate settings designed to prepare students for the NSCA-Certified Personal Trainer® (NSCA-CPT®) and NSCA Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist® (CSCS®) certifications. This degree would also serve to prepare the student not only for the NSCA-CPT and CSCS, but for professional certification examinations, such as Certified Special Population Specialist (CSPS), Certified Physical Therapist (CPT), Certified Health Fitness Specialist (HFS), Certified Exercise Physiologists (EP-C), etc. Recreation Management and Recreational Therapy Tim Passmore, EdD, CTRS/L, FDRT—Professor and Program Coordinator The program in Recreation Management and Recreational Therapy Program prepares students at the undergraduate and graduate levels for careers in recreation management and recreational therapy. The undergraduate program in Recreational Therapy is accredited through the Committee on Accreditation of Recreational Therapy Education by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Programs. Students completing the Recreational Therapy program are eligible to sit for the National Council for Therapeutic Recreation Certification (CTRS) and apply for Medical Licensure in the State of Oklahoma through the Oklahoma Medical Licensing Board. Recreational Therapy prepares students to work in a variety of settings including hospitals, rehabilitation centers, day programs, institutions and within the community. Recreational Therapy is a valued part of the health care and human services. Individuals with illness, disabilities or limitations are helped to restore, enhance or maintain their health, independence and well-being through recreational therapy. Those students completing the Recreation Management program are eligible to sit for the Certified Park and Recreation Professional. Recreation Management prepares students for employment in a variety of settings such as municipal, commercial, and corporate recreation; state and national park services; YMCAs and YWCAs; and armed services recreation. Recreation Management is a growing field and is a multi-billion dollar industry. Non-majors may complete a 21-credit minor in Recreation Management. Sports & Coaching Science Program Area Faculty: Jay Dawes, PhD The Sports & Coaching Science degree prepares students at the undergraduate level for careers in athletic coaching and ancillary fields. The curriculum prepares professionals for certification via various sports organizations relevant to their specific sport of interest (e.g., United States Tennis Association, National Football League, United States Volleyball Association), or prepares them to successfully achieve other sport and exercise-based certifications such as personal training. The degree will also prepare students for the many graduate programs available nationwide in coaching science and education. The Sports & Coaching Science Program prepares students for work and further study in a variety of settings including: professional, collegiate, or secondary school sport organizations; elite training facilities; athletic league officiating; small businesses (e.g., karate, cheer, gymnastics); sport psychology; athletic training; strength and conditioning; and sports management.
