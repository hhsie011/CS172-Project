Operations / Systems Mechanical, Operations & Systems Engineering Program Area The Mechanical, Operations & Systems Engineering (MOSE) Program Area leverages fundamental principles of physics, economics, human behavior and advanced computing to educate and innovate in a wide array of application domains — ranging from fluid and thermal systems, climate change, energy and infrastructure, to healthcare, cybersecurity and information systems. MOSE Program Area Lead: Vikrant Vaze On This Page The Student Experience Research Lab Spotlight Coursework Graduate Degrees Undergraduate Degrees The Student Experience As part of the MOSE Program Area, students receive individualized guidance within a stimulating and accessible intellectual community. We strive to help students develop communication skills and abilities as both collaborators and independent researchers and innovators. Students are expected to propose a plan of study that supports their interests, potentially including distinctive intellectual paths unconstrained by disciplinary boundaries and enriched by collaborative synergies. Our graduates are prepared for top positions in either industry or academia, or, with our emphasis on entrepreneurship, to launch a tech startup of their own. Research MOSE faculty work to address key challenges with human-centered impact and are leaders in their research fields, which include: Cybersecurity and information systems Energy systems and infrastructure Engineered systems for extreme and changing environments Fluid mechanics and thermal systems Operations analysis and management Systems modeling and optimization Learn more Lab Spotlight Dartmouth Engineering Receives $1.25M to Study Space Ice A Dartmouth ice mechanics lab has been awarded two grants totaling $1.25 million to conduct planetary science research relating to the geophysics and astrobiology of icy planets in our solar system. Learn more Coursework Students in the MOSE Program Area need not limit their academic interests. Many students and faculty move comfortably between traditional disciplines, working at the intersection of MOSE and biomedical, biochemical, electrical and computer, and materials engineering. Our flexible curriculum allows for a wide range of academic paths which students develop with guidance from their advisor to meet individual needs. Graduate Degrees Students interested in obtaining a PhD, MS, or MEng focused on MOSE are encouraged to contact faculty lead Vikrant Vaze or other individual faculty in their areas of interest. Applicants are also invited to visit campus and meet with engineering students and faculty. PhD MS MEng Undergraduate Degrees Students interested in the AB/BE, or Dual-Degree program with a focus on MOSE are encouraged to contact Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education Doug Van Citters. Applicants are also invited to visit campus and meet with engineering students and faculty. AB BE DUAL DEGREE Many of the systems we are building, the human user and social aspects of those systems are really critical. Being able to incorporate the human as part of the engineering system will be even more important as we move ahead.
