She is also the Daniel P.S. Paul Professor of Constitutional Law at Harvard Law School and a professor of history at Harvard University. An award-winning legal historian and an expert in constitutional law and education law and policy, she is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Law Institute, and the American Philosophical Society; a fellow of the American Bar Foundation; a distinguished lecturer for the Organization of American Historians; and a member of the board of directors of ProPublica. Brown-Nagin has published articles and book chapters on a wide range of topics, including the Supreme Court’s equal protection jurisprudence, civil rights law and history, the Affordable Care Act, and education reform. She is a contributing editor to POLITICO Magazine as well as a frequent lecturer and media commentator. Brown-Nagin’s latest book, Civil Rights Queen: Constance Baker Motley and the Struggle for Equality (Pantheon, 2022), explores the life and times of the pathbreaking lawyer, politician, and judge. Her book Courage to Dissent: Atlanta and the Long History of the Civil Rights Movement (Oxford University Press, 2011) won a 2012 Bancroft Prize in American History, among other honors. In 2019, Brown-Nagin was appointed chair of the Presidential Committee on Harvard and the Legacy of Slavery, which is anchored at the Radcliffe Institute. The Committee issued a landmark report detailing the University’s direct, financial, and intellectual ties to slavery, which resulted in Harvard’s commitment of $100 million to redress harms to descendant communities in the United States and in the Caribbean. __________________________________________________ For media inquiries, journalists should contact Mac Daniel, associate director of communications and senior editor, 617-495-8116, mac_daniel@radcliffe.harvard.edu __________________________________________________ The Transformative Power of Reason (Harvard Crimson, 5/26/22) Opinion: Ketanji Brown Jackson Is the Beginning, Not the End, of This Story (CNN, 4/6/22) Constance Baker Motley, Civil Rights Queen, Paved the Way for Ketanji Brown Jackson (Oprah Daily, 4/1/22) Examining 2 Days of Senate Confirmation Hearings for Biden's Supreme Court Nominee (NPR, 3/23/22) The Right to Counsel Shouldn’t Be Controversial (Slate, 3/21/22) This Black Woman Could Have Served on the Supreme Court Decades Ago.
