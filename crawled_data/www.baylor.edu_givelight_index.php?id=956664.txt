The most visible aspect of this impact is the remarkable range of capital projects that will continue to reshape the Baylor campus. These facilities will provide needed space for classrooms, faculty offices and collaboration areas, campus hospitality, and athletics programs. The Give Light Capital Fund will help to expand Baylor’s campus, providing exciting opportunities for the Baylor community to interact and forge the ties that bind alumni, students and the many members who make up the Baylor Family. Active Fundraising Current priority projects being funded through the Give Light Capital Fund include the Mark & Paula Hurd Welcome Center, the Paul & Alejandra Foster Pavilion and the Fudge Football Development Center. These spaces represent the front porch of Baylor University, through which fans and alumni engage with the institution. Mark & Paula Hurd Welcome Center The Mark & Paula Hurd Welcome Center will be a hub of engagement opportunities — from vibrant academic and student life activities to networking events that strengthen Baylor-Waco partnerships. Paul and Alejandra Foster Pavilion The Paul and Alejandra Foster Pavilion is a state-of-the-art facility that will become the new home of our men’s and women’s basketball teams. The pavilion will boast a capacity of 7,000+ fans. Fudge Football Development Center The Fudge Football Development Center will add more than 100,000 square feet of new space for the Baylor Football Program, creating space for greater use by the University's other 18 collegiate athletic programs. Recently Completed The Give Light Campaign has already funded the renovation of Baylor’s iconic Tidwell Bible Building. Reopened in the fall of 2021, Tidwell now houses faculty offices for the religion, history and sociology departments and features renovated technology-enabled classrooms for the thousands of students who walk the halls each day.
