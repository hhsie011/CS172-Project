As we move forward, it first seems right to return to our roots and examine where we came from. This exhibition celebrates the vision of Professor David Gordon Lyon (1852–1935), the museum’s founder and first director. Lyon assembled a rich collection of antiquities from what we now call the Middle East, including the Holy Land. (The term “Semitic” refers to the related languages and cultures of the Ancient Near East: Israelites, Phoenicians, Egyptians, Arameans, Babylonians, Arabs, and many others.)

The chair’s materials are based on the ancient original: cedar, bright blue faience tiles, gold foil, gesso, cordage seating, and copper. This experiment in archaeological visualization is a triumph of reconstruction because the only guidance came from thousands of tiny, jumbled fragments and 90-year old expedition records. The reproduction chair is the centerpiece of the new exhibit, Recreating the Throne of Egyptian Queen Hetepheres.

This first installment showcases newly fabricated casts from the ancient scenes that once adorned Mesopotamian palace walls. Learn More Dream Stela This exhibit displays a resin cast of the Dream Stela, the original can be found between the paws of the Great Sphinx. Using resin casting techniques he developed in 2013, Harvard Museum of the Ancient Near East assistant curator, Adam Aja, led the reproduction process with Harvard students.
