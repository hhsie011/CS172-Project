Each initial visit includes a one-hour appointment, an analysis of your current eating plan, and an action plan addressing your individual goals. Our dietitians see students who want to address disordered eating habits, change their eating habits, manage a medical diagnosis or concern, or learn how to stay nourished while following specific food restrictions or allergies. Our dietitians are also members of Georgia Tech's multidisciplinary Eating Disorder Treatment Team.
