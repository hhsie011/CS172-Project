Revenue from the charging stations is used by Georgia Tech to offset electrical and administrative costs, to maintain the chargers, and help expand the charging program to other locations. Rates, parking spaces, and conditions may be adjusted based on data received. Electric vehicle charging rules and regulations can be found here. EV charging customers may call PTS dispatch at 404-385-7275 to report vehicles that may be violating PTS charging rules and regulations.
