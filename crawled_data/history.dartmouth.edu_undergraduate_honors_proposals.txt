We define Dartmouth community broadly, including students and alumni, faculty and staff, parents and families, and Upper Valley residents. The DVP seeks diverse recollections of the Vietnam era, from military service to campus and anti-war activism, political campaigns, and everyday life. This project is a collaborative effort among current Dartmouth students, alumni and community members, and faculty and staff. Dartmouth alumni and community members volunteer to share their stories of the Vietnam War era at Dartmouth and beyond. Each summer, a new cohort of students is trained in the art of oral history interviewing by a team of faculty, staff, and experts. As part of Dartmouth's commitment to experiential learning, student participants then apply their skills by conducting oral history interviews with alumni and community volunteers. The DVP thereby fosters new connections across generations to record a vital era of Dartmouth's—and the nation's—history. The transcript and recording of each oral history interview is made available to the public through an online archive, and will be permanently catalogued at Rauner Special Collections Library as part of the Dartmouth College archives. In making these oral histories widely available, the Dartmouth Vietnam Project not only contributes to Dartmouth's own historical record, but also deepens the public history of the Vietnam era by providing unique and invaluable sources for scholars and the general public alike.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of History Undergraduate Overview History FAQs for First Year and Transfer Students How to Declare a Major or Minor in History Major Modified Major Minor Transfer Credit Policy Course Descriptions First-Year Seminars Introductory Africa, Asia, Latin America & The Caribbean (AALAC) Europe (EUR) Interregional & Comparative (INTER) United States (US) Seminars & Colloquia Independent Study & Honors Course Schedule 2021-2022 Schedule 2022-2023 Schedule 2023-2024 Schedule Course Syllabi Honors Thesis Program General Timeline Guidelines for the Class of 2022 Guidelines for the Class of 2023 Honors Theses By Year Phi Alpha Theta Honors Society Prizes After Graduation Alumni Update Research Overview Faculty Research Initiatives Dartmouth History Institute Student Research Initiatives and Resources The Dartmouth Vietnam Project History Librarian Research Funding Resources Undergraduate Research Database Student Class Projects Foreign Study News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
