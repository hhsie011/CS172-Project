The Maryland Agricultural College was established on ancestral land of the Piscataway tribe, which it purchased from a slaveholding farmer and agricultural education advocate, and three years later opened with 34 students. It eventually grew to encompass new disciplines in engineering, science and the liberal arts, welcomed trailblazing women and people of color, survived the Great Fire of 1912, re-emerged as a public college and boomed following World War II. Today, the university is a national powerhouse in research, academics, the arts and athletics; committed to embracing diversity in its campus community of 50,000; and tackling the grand challenges of our time. Mission The mission of the University of Maryland, College Park is to provide excellent teaching, research, and service. The University educates students and advances knowledge in areas of importance to the State, the nation, and the world. The University is committed to being a preeminent national center for research and for graduate education, and the institution of choice for Maryland’s undergraduates of exceptional ability and promise.

Values The University of Maryland is a community of individuals living and working together to support and advance the educational and research mission of the institution. We aspire to become a community that is: United We are diverse but have much in common. Members of the UMD community foster a sense of belonging based on acceptance and a unity of purpose. We strive toward overlapping goals, sharing resources, and spending some of the most significant and productive times of our lives together in a common space. To that extent we depend on one another and are our best selves when we support one another. Accordingly, our actions are guided not only by what is good for self but also by what is good for all. Respectful Members of the UMD community interact with others in ways that promote feelings of respect. All members of the UMD community are valued equally and deserving of respect without regard to their status, their educational attainment or their social position. We reject denigration of any member through words or actions and resist stereotyping of members that undermines personal dignity though slurs, slights, insults or other acts that disparage individuals or groups. Secure and Safe Members of the UMD community refrain from injustice, violence, harassment, intimidation, and aggression. We do all that is possible to protect and defend members of the UMD community from anyone who would harm them physically or psychologically. We promote individual agency and responsibility in contributing to personal safety, avoidance of harm and staving off the effects of insults, slander, intimidation, or symbolic intimation of violence. Inclusive The UMD community strives to achieve the highest levels of excellence in our work and our studies that accrue through inclusive practices. We recognize that as a thriving and striving community, the success of our institution and our members is dependent on how well we value, include, and engage all members. This belief must be actively and consistently embedded in every aspect and practice of the UMD community. Accountable All members of the UMD community are equally responsible and committed to uphold the University’s values to the best of their ability, as well as hold the rest of the UMD community to those responsibilities. We must be transparent in our mistakes, and learn to reflect and continue to strive toward inclusive excellence. Empowered and Open to Growth Members of the UMD community embrace learning as essential for bettering ourselves as individuals and as a community.
