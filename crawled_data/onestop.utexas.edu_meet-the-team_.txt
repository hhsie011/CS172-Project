In a newly remodeled location on the ground floor of the UT Tower, Texas One Stop will offer upgraded technology and professional staff who are cross-trained in registration and records, student accounts, and financial aid, and is expected to open in Fall 2020. Along with the new, integrated center, the virtual Texas One Stop website launched in November 2019 to help students find important information easily to complete important steps in the enrollment process. The launch of the website also included the new Bevo Bot automated chatbot to provide immediate answers to questions and connect students to the resources they’re looking for. Meet the Team Our team is departmentally cross-trained in the areas of registration, scholarships and financial aid, tuition payments, and student records. We are excited and prepared to help you get the information you need for enrollment and achieve a timely graduation!
