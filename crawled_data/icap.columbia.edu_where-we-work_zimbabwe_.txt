ICAP provides support to the Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Health and Child Care (MoHCC) in contact tracing for COVID-19 patients at sub-national level in prioritized provinces to follow up with suspected and confirmed COVID cases for line listing and daily monitoring. Strengthening of databases including procurement of tablets and airtime for data transmission for contact tracing using Open Data Kit (ODK) platform is conducted so that data from contact tracing is sent to the national database. ICAP also supports the MOHCC efforts of harmonizing data sources and flow in data management. In addition, the ICAP team has been supporting community events specifically in the rural areas by convening local government, community leaders, church leaders, chiefs and village heads and village health workers COVID-19 trainings. This project is funded by PEPFAR through the CDC.

The first ZIMPHIA survey was conducted in 2016. The ZIMPHIA 2020 survey includes household-based interviews and HIV counseling and testing for individuals 15 years and older. Survey findings will be used to assess the impact of Zimbabwe’s HIV response at the national level, and to help guide and target future investment and programs.

Its specific objectives are to: A. Enhance the ability of national institutions to plan and coordinate SI activities. B. Strengthen systems to monitor and evaluate the coverage, quality, and effectiveness of the national HIV response. C. Improve systems to plan, conduct and implement comprehensive, high-quality surveys and surveillance to quantify and characterize the HIV epidemic, and D. Strengthen human resources to support country ownership of sustainable SI activities. Project implementation is driven by the collaborative efforts of ICAP staff based in Zimbabwe country office, staff seconded to the Ministry of Health and Child Care (MoHCC) and ICAP’s headquarters team in New York working in close coordination with CDC in Zimbabwe and Atlanta. The scope of work also includes strengthening human resources to support country ownership of sustainable SI activities. (funded by PEPFAR through the CDC) Tracking with Recency Assays to Control the Epidemic (TRACE) Project Details With support from PEPFAR through the CDC, ICAP is supporting the roll-out of rapid recency testing that promises to advance efforts to characterize where and among whom new infections are Project Details With support from PEPFAR through the CDC, ICAP is supporting the roll-out of rapid recency testing that promises to advance efforts to characterize where and among whom new infections are occurring, and to inform prevention efforts to curb ongoing transmission. The five-year TRACE project aims to increase use of a new HIV-1 rapid recency assay, developed by CDC, that can distinguish a recent infection (acquired within the last 12 months) from a long-term one. ICAP will leverage its strong partnerships with civil society groups to inform the public about recency testing and help garner community support. Trainings, supportive supervision, and continuous quality improvement during health information system development will enable the Ministry of Health to capture data and conduct epidemiological analysis and characterization to support robust surveillance and targeted interventions for recent HIV infections. In addition to Zimbabwe, ICAP is supporting TRACE in five other sub-Saharan African countries—in close collaboration with CDC, ministries of health, and local organizations—to guide program design and allocate resources effectively and efficiently. Zimbabwe 3HP Rollout in Fast Track ModelDistricts (or national):Harare Project Details Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Health and Child Care (MoHCC) plans to implement 3HP within Zimbabwe in 2020. Identifying a feasible and acceptable implementation strategy to scale up TPT with 3HP for Project Details Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Health and Child Care (MoHCC) plans to implement 3HP within Zimbabwe in 2020. Identifying a feasible and acceptable implementation strategy to scale up TPT with 3HP for PLHIV in Zimbabwe is an urgent priority. MoHCC has strongly endorsed the use of differentiated service delivery (DSD) for HIV treatment, and has scaled up multiple DSD models, including facility-based services for individual patients such as fast-track (FT), which reduces time spent at the facility during visits. The scale up of 3HP has the potential to miss the large number of PLHIV who are already enrolled in DSD models. Integrating TPT into one of the most utilized DSD models, the FT model, could ensure PLHIV enrolled in FT are included in the rollout of 3HP and leverage the convenience of multi-month dispensing of both ART and TPT. This may increase demand for TPT among recipients of care, leading to enhanced coverage and completion of TPT. Therefore, ICAP at Columbia University (ICAP) is partnering with MoHCC, the Zimbabwe National Network for People Living with HIV (ZNNP+), the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to conduct a pilot project to integrate 3HP into FT models.
