Establishing Risk in Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome Brown Center for the Study of Children At Risk Establishing Risk in Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome What does this study entail? The purpose of this research study is to find better ways to treat and diagnose infants with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) and improve long-term outcome. Certain genetic markers in adults who need narcotics to control pain or withdrawal are associated with more severe withdrawal and need for more medicine to control symptoms. This is research study is designed to find out if this is also true in babies, so doctors will know which infants are at highest risk for complications from NAS. Additionally, excessive crying and a high pitch cry are a sign and symptom of NAS. In this study we will investigate both genetic markers and cry acoustics in babies exposed to narcotics during pregnancy. You may be eligible to participate if you: Deliver after at least 37 weeks of pregnancy Received methadone, buprenorphine or another daily pain medication from a licensed physician or drug treatment program during pregnancy Received adequate prenatal care For more information, contact us at (401) 430-8984 or [email protected].
