The Office of Career Strategies gives students the tools and knowledge to take charge of their careers. Students can sign up for career coaching sessions, get one-on-one help creating such career-building materials as CVs and resumes, attend seminars on career-related issues, access job banks, and more. Lectures and workshops take place throughout the year and have featured guest speakers including Yale alumni and faculty members. Recent lectures have addressed such topics as personal finances and marketing and networking for musicians. Event dates are sent to students through the YSM Student Newsletter email. Students can also enroll in Careers in Music: Creating Value through Innovative Artistic Projects, a class in which entrepreneurial skills are taught through real-world, collaborative long-term artistic projects. Career Resources Career Coaching view form Toggle YSM students have the opportunity to participate in small career-coaching groups through the Office of Career Strategies, which meet every other week.

Career Events + Workshops Toggle Events are hosted throughout the academic year highlighting aspects of career strategies. Upcoming events and workshops will be sent out through the YSM student newsletter.
