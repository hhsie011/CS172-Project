Faculty and students develop and apply remote sensing, computational, sedimentological, geochemical, organic geochemical, and microfossil proxies to investigate climate and environmental change on time scales ranging from seasons to millions of years, including modern climate and environmental systems and their alteration by human activity, working with Brown's Institute at Brown for Environment and Society. The "GMP" group investigates a wide variety of geological problems centered on the properties and processes of geologic materials. They utilize observational, analytical, and experimental approaches, including geochronological and isotope tracer studies of tectonic processes in orogenic belts, and time-dependent aspects of a number of major long and short-term geological processes. The Geophysics group combines research strengths in rock and mineral physics, seismological imaging, and geodynamical modeling to address exciting questions regarding the structure, dynamics and evolution of Earth and other planetary bodies. We employ experimental, theoretical, and field studies, and enjoy collaborating with each other and our colleagues from across the department. The Planetary Geosciences group is involved in a variety of research programs and actively participates in planetary missions. Using diverse approaches, they study surface processes and their role in the overall evolution of planetary geologic history and internal evolution.
