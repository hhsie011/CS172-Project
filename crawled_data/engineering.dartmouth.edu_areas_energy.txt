Addressing the relevant challenges and opportunities requires not only application of the full spectrum of engineering disciplines but also recognition of the social, political, and economic contexts. The Energy Engineering Program Area puts a particular emphasis on intellectual paths with human-centered impact. Energy Engineering Program Area Lead: Lee Lynd On This Page The Student Experience Research Coursework Student Spotlight Graduate Degrees Undergraduate Degrees The Student Experience The Energy Engineering Program Area provides individualized mentoring of our students' professional development toward becoming enabled, independent professionals, and prioritizes the quality our students' experience through scholarship, coursework, and community. We are committed to fostering a stimulating and accessible intellectual community for students and faculty interested in energy engineering within Thayer, across Dartmouth, and among researchers and practitioners from the US and around the world. "We believe that technological innovation is enriched by a needs-driven perspective and that needs-driven work is enriched by exposure to technological innovation." —Lee Lynd, Energy Program Area Lead All students are expected to propose a plan of study that supports their interests, potentially including distinctive intellectual paths unconstrained by disciplinary boundaries and enriched by interdisciplinary synergies. Most graduate study is advanced through the research thesis and disseminated through contributions to peer-reviewed literature, presentations at professional meetings, and in some cases patents and entrepreneurial ventures. Research Energy engineering research at Dartmouth addresses key strategic challenges informed by awareness of societal needs and opportunities. Efforts are supported by leading engineering faculty in their fields, as well as interdepartmental collaborations including with The Arthur L. Irving Institute for Energy and Society. Ongoing investigations include: Biomass energy Energy materials Energy systems Power electronics Sustainable design Learn more Coursework Individualized plans of study are developed by each student with their faculty mentors pursuant to gaining not only a broad understanding of energy technologies, systems, challenges, and opportunities, but also depth in one or more technical areas relevant to the student's interests. For graduate-level students, a foundation of broad understanding is achieved through this three-course sequence: Energy Conversion — addressing conversion of primary resources into electricity, fuel, and heat; Energy Utilization — addressing utilization of electricity, fuel, and heat for energy services (work, light, mobility, space heat and air conditioning, process heating and cooling); Energy Systems — addressing integrated analysis of single and interdependent energy service supply chains. Technical depth is addressed through courses of study often related to the research areas listed above. Student Spotlight PhD Candidate Named IAEA Net Zero Challenge Finalist Prabhat Hegde and team was named a finalist of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Net Zero Challenge. The team's paper, "Zero-emission credits to support nuclear energy's role in the decarbonization of the electric power industry," proposes using clear and concise policy recommendations to help achieve net zero targets, or the balancing of greenhouse gas emissions through their removal or elimination from society. Learn more Graduate Degrees Students interested in obtaining a PhD, MS, or MEng focused on energy engineering are encouraged to contact faculty lead Lee Lynd or other individual faculty in their areas of interest. Applicants are also invited to visit campus and meet with engineering students and faculty. PhD MS MEng Undergraduate Degrees Students interested in the AB/BE, or Dual-Degree program with a focus on energy engineering are encouraged to contact Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education Doug Van Citters. Applicants are also invited to visit campus and meet with engineering students and faculty. AB BE DUAL DEGREE We put human well-being and global societal needs and opportunities at the heart of our engineering education, research, and practice.
