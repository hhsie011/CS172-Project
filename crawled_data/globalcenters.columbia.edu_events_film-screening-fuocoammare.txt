Italian-French co-production. Filmed in: Italy. Language: Italian, with English subtitles. Samuele is 12 years old and lives on an Italian island. He likes land games, shooting his slingshot and going hunting, even though everything around him speaks of the sea and of the men, women and children who try to cross it to get to his island. His is not an island like the others: Lampedusa, situated 150 miles south of Sicily, has hit the headlines in the last 20 years because it has been the first port of call for 400.000 African and Middle Eastern refugees hoping to start a new life in Europe. Winner of the Golden Bear for Best Film at the Berlin Film Festival 2016, and nominated as Oscars’ Italy entry, Gianfranco Rosi’s Fire At Sea is an incisive, poignant and deeply moving portrait of Lampedusa and the humanitarian crisis occurring in the seas around it. Long-métrage documentaire écrit et réalisé par Gianfranco Rosi. 109 minutes, 2016. Production: France - Italie. Filmé en Italie. Langue: italien, sous-titré en anglais. Projection suivie d'un débat avec Olivier Favier. Auteur, traducteur et militant, Olivier Favier est aussi l’interprète de Gianfranco Rosi lors des tournées du réalisateur en France. Il a notamment publié en 2016 l’ouvrage Chroniques d’exil et d’hospitalité (2016) et de nombreux articles dans la presse sur l’accueil des migrants en France.
