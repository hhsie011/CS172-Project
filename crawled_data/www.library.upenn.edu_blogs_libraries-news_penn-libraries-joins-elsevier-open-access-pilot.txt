The agreement was negotiated by a committee made up of representatives of NERL consortium members, including Katie Brady, the Penn Libraries’ Head of E-Resources and Licensing. “I’m delighted by this innovative agreement, which takes a completely novel approach to open access,” says Brigitte Weinsteiger, Gershwind and Bennett Family Associate Vice Provost for Collections and Scholarly Communications, who serves on the NERL Program Council. As part of this three-year pilot, authors who have published with many Elsevier journals and who were affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania at the time of publication will retroactively have their articles made open access. For each year of the agreement, Elsevier will flip five years of publications; that means that by the end of the pilot, 15 years of published work, constituting tens of thousands of articles authored by leading researchers, will be newly available to everyone at no cost to them and regardless of institutional affiliation. This new agreement is only one of the many ways that the Penn Libraries has expanded its support for open access in recent years. Just a few months ago, the Libraries signed an agreement with Cambridge University Press that allows anyone associated with the University of Pennsylvania to publish articles with Cambridge without paying article processing charges. The Libraries also supports new open access journals like Glossa Psycholinguistics, provides the Penn community with access to a variety of open access resources, and maintains Penn’s own open access repository, Scholarly Commons.
