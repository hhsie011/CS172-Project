Coursework Previously Completed Coursework Certificate in Premedical Sciences Print Options Postbaccalaureate Premedical Program Curriculum and Courses The academic curriculum of the Postbaccalaureate Premedical Program is designed to fulfill the prerequisites for medical school admission. Because course requirements for medical school can vary, our premedical curriculum is designed to prepare Postbac Premed students to train anywhere in the nation. For the sequencing of the following required courses, please review the program timetables: traditional, part-time, or accelerated. While enrolled in the program, students must fulfill all requirements with courses offered by Columbia's Faculty of Arts & Sciences. It is possible to complete some requirements with Barnard College course offerings, but students considering this option should discuss it with their advisors and understand the implications of this choice (see below under Biology and Organic Chemistry). All students are expected to have their advisors approve their programs of study. In addition to the following courses, students must gain at least 120 hours of health care experience. English One year of college English or the equivalent is required. Most Postbac Premed students have completed this requirement as undergraduates and do not need to complete course work in English at Columbia. Students should inform their advisors early on when they are especially interested in particular medical school programs (linkage or non-linkage), since some may have specific requirements for this subject of study. Mathematics Students are required to complete one year (6 points) of college mathematics beyond pre-calculus, consisting of one term of calculus and one term of statistics. (Some students elect to take a second semester of calculus instead of statistics.) If a student has not already successfully completed Calculus I, it may be taken as a co-requisite of Physics I or General Chemistry I. Courses MATH UN1101 CALCULUS I. 3.00 points. Prerequisites: (see Courses for First-Year Students). Functions, limits, derivatives, introduction to integrals, or an understanding of pre-calculus will be assumed.

Students may take the laboratory course in either the fall or spring semester or in the first summer session after the completion of the year of biology. Notes about Barnard College’s biology courses: Students considering taking the biology course sequence at Barnard College (BIOL X1500-1502) are advised that enrollment in it is subject to the availability of space. Further, enrollment in Barnard’s biology courses disqualifies postbacs for linkage. While the Barnard course generally covers the same subject matter as the corresponding Columbia sequence, it does not emphasize biochemistry. Also, content corresponding to Columbia’s fall semester course is offered at Barnard in the spring; and content corresponding to Columbia’s spring semester course is offered at Barnard in the fall. These courses can be taken in either order. Barnard’s biology lab is a two-semester sequence of 2-credit lab courses; however, students who take the Barnard biology lecture sequence are welcome to complete the lab requirement with the Columbia lab course.

Corequisites: Organic Chemistry. Primarily aimed at nontraditional students and undergraduates who have course conflicts with BIOC UN3501. Biochemistry is the study of the chemical processes within organisms that give rise to the immense complexity of life. This complexity emerges from a highly regulated and coordinated flow of chemical energy from one biomolecule to another. This course serves to familiarize students with the spectrum of biomolecules (carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, nucleic acids, etc.) as well as the fundamental chemical processes (glycolysis, citric acid cycle, fatty acid metabolism, etc.) that allow life to happen. In particular, this course will employ active learning techniques and critical thinking problem-solving to engage students in answering the question: how is the complexity of life possible? NOTE: While Organic Chemistry is listed as a corequisite, it is highly recommended that you take Organic Chemistry beforehand.

Corequisites: CHEM W2444. Please note that you must complete CHEM W2493 before you register for CHEM W2494. This lab introduces students to experimental design and trains students in the execution and evaluation of scientific data. The technique experiments in the first half of the course (CHEM W2493) teach students to develop and master the required experimental skills to perform the challenging synthesis experiments in the second semester. The learning outcomes for this lab are the knowledge and experimental skills associated with the most important synthetic routes widely used in industrial and research environments. Attendance at the first lab lecture and laboratory session is mandatory. Please note that CHEM W2494 is the second part of a full year organic chemistry laboratory course. Students must register for the lab lecture section (CHEM W2496) which corresponds to their lab section. Students must attend ONE lab lecture and ONE lab section every other week.
