The term 'ombudsman' has origins in Sweden and varying types of Ombudsman with different roles, functional responsibilities, and standards of practice. At Columbia, we are organizational ombuds who are independent, informal, impartial and confidential. We provide a confidential resource for our students, faculty, staff and alumni to discuss their workplace or academic issues and/or concerns. Established in 1991 The Columbia University Ombuds Office was established in 1991 on the recommendation of the President's Committee for the Promotion of Mutual Understanding and Civility. The Ombuds Office takes concerns about discrimination and harassment very seriously and can offer options for informal resolutions and identify University resources for formal review of concerns. However, the Ombuds Office was established to address situations that involve insensitivity, unfairness or miscommunication that may not necessarily constitute harassment or discrimination. Marsha Wagner, PhD. (1991 - 2013) Dr. Wagner served as the first University Ombuds Officer and held this position for 22 years, until her retirement in October 2013. Marsha was well-known as a leader within the Organizational Ombuds profession. She served three terms on the Board of Directors of The Ombudsman Association (TOA) and one year on the Board of Directors of the International Ombudsman Association (IOA). Additionally, Marsha chaired the TOA Professional Development Committee and the IOA Committee on Ethics, Standards of Practice and Best Practices. The IOA's Certified Organizational Ombudsman Practitioner (CO-OP), the only certification credential available for the ombuds profession, was established through Dr. Wagner's tireless efforts. She served as the inaugural President of the IOA Board of Certification. After Dr. Wagner's retirement, the office was vacant for five (5) months while a national search for her successor followed. In March 2014, President Lee C. Bollinger announced Joan C. Waters as the next University Ombuds Officer. Joan C.
