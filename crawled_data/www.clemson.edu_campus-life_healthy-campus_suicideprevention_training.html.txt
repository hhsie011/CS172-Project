Clemson University has developed our Suicide Prevention Advocate Training based on Campus Connect, an experiential training that enhances advocates' knowledge, awareness, and skills concerning college student suicide. Emphasis is placed on developing empathic listening skills, communication skills and the ability to compassionately and directly ask students about suicidal thoughts. Through increased awareness of their own emotional reactions, advocates are able to more effectively respond to students’ emotional needs and increase the likelihood of a meaningful connection with appropriate professional resources. Suicide Prevention Advocate Training includes: Review of college student suicide statistics and facts Discussion of suicide myths and warning signs Instruction on how to ask students if they are thinking about suicide and how to refer students to mental health professionals Review of effective communication and relationship-building skills Discussion of typical emotional reactions experienced both by students in crisis and responding gatekeepers Participation in experiential exercises and a guided group role play Workshops typically last an hour. Please request a workshop at least one week in advance of your preferred date.
