Expert Faculty Our faculty members help people grow healthy and productive crops, develop and maintain beautiful and functional landscapes, and manage world-class golf courses and athletic fields. They work to breed new varieties of vegetables and fruit, explore new production practices, and develop new pest and weed management strategies. They also research the basic biology of horticultural crop plants, explore the ecology of horticultural systems, and work to develop productive and sustainable food systems. Diverse Community Our students come from all over Oregon, the United States and the world. Some have grown up in horticulture as part of family farms or horticultural businesses; others simply know they enjoy working with plants and want to build a career in horticulture. Some are recent high school graduates and some began their studies at a community college. Others are returning to school later in life to pursue a new career. They come together as a vibrant and supportive student community in the Department of Horticulture.
