Our work is focused in two of our research centers and labs: The Robotics and Intelligent Machines (RIM) Center at Georgia Tech and the Computational Perception Lab (CPL). RIM leverages the Institute’s strengths and resources by reaching across traditional boundaries to embrace a multidisciplinary approach. The College of Computing, College of Engineering and the Georgia Tech Research Institute play key, complementary roles through Tech's traditional expertise in interactive and intelligent computing, control and mechanical engineering. Emphasizing personal and everyday robotics, as well as the future of automation, RIM faculty help students understand and define the future role of robotics in society. CPL was developed to explore and develop the next generation of intelligent machines, interfaces and environments for modeling, perceiving, recognizing, and interacting with humans. CPL domains of interest include computer vision/perception, computer graphics, computer animation, human-computer interaction, digital special effects, artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, machine learning, robotics, aware home/environments, audio processing, ubiquitous computing/sensing, eldercare technologies, motion analysis, and computational music.
