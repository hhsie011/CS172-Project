Although five of our other master's degrees in counseling have been reviewed and are accredited, the Marriage, Couple, and Family Counseling programs has yet to undergo the accreditation process.

The Marriage, Couple, and Family Counseling program is a clinically-focused and prepares students to engage in Marriage, Couple and Family therapy practice with theoretical, clinical competence, and research-informed competence. The course requirements will allow graduates of the program to meet the educational requirements of the Tennessee License of Marital and Family Therapist offered by the Tennessee Board for Licensed Professional Counselors, Licensed Marital and Family Therapists, and Licensed Clinical Pastoral Therapists.

According to the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (see www.bls.gov), the profession is expected to grow 22% by 2029, adding some 14,800 new jobs.
