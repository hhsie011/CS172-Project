The task force was established to support Asian and Asian American students and scholars on campus. Penn's New Task Force Diversity in the (Virtual) Stacks: Antiracism Resources Diversity in the Stacks aims to build library collections that represent and reflect the University’s diverse population. The Penn Libraries hosts a wide and up-to-date range of antiracism literature, and we have compiled a list of many of these resources for access and use by the Penn community. Subjects include implicit bias, structural oppression, systematic violence against people of color, and the history of racism.
