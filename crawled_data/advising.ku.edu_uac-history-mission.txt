The Undergraduate Advising Center operates within the Appreciative Advising model of advising. Appreciative Advising is the intentional collaborative practice of asking positive, open-ended questions that help students optimize their educational experiences and achieve their dreams, goals, and potential (Bloom, Hutson & He, 2008). Mission The UAC empowers all students to take ownership of their education by providing personalized, comprehensive academic advising in a supportive environment. Diversity Statement The UAC is committed to respecting and valuing the diversity of KU students, their perspectives, life experiences, interests, world views and cultures. We seek to foster an environment in which the dignity and unique characteristics of each individual are recognized and respected. To that end, the UAC's goal is to help all students realize their academic potential regardless of race, religion, color, sex, disability, national origin, ancestry, age, veteran status, sexual orientation, marital status or parental status. UAC History The Undergraduate Advising Center was created 1997 under the direction of Kathryn Nemeth Tuttle. Initially called the Freshman-Sophomore Advising Center, advisors saw about 1,200 students in its first year. In 2007, the name changed to reflect the mission and objectives of the center. Today, the UAC assists nearly 13,500 students in choosing a major, making schedule plans, supervising probation cases, finding academic and professional resources, and successfully advancing to a college degree. The UAC is a division of Academic Success.
