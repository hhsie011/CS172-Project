To maintain your CPACC, WAS, or CPWA certification, you must: Earn the required number of continuing accessibility education credits (CAEC). Renew your certification with IAAP every three years. Your department should pay for renewal. What counts as a CAEC? You can earn CAECs in two ways: either by attending professional development activities, or by sharing your accessibility expertise outside your current job function through formal presentations or trainings. You must keep some proof of your attendance and submit your hours to the IAAP.
