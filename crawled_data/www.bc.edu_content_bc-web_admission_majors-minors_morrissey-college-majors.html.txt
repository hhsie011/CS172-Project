Not only is the Theology department in itself one of the foremost such departments in the country, but the city of Boston is one of the richest environments in the world for the study of theology. The major in Theology has proven to be excellent preparation for careers and professions requiring careful reasoning, close reading, clarity in written expression, the ability to make ethical decisions, and a broad understanding of cultures. It provides a solid background for graduate study in the humanities and for such professional schools as medicine, business, and law. Many students now also elect theology as a second major or as minor to balance and broaden their education and to provide perspective on other disciplines in the natural or social sciences and the humanities.</p> <h4>SAMPLE COURSES</h4> <p>Law, Medicine, and Ethics<br> Buddhist Ethics<br> Mystery of God<br> God and Science<br> Belief in Modernity<br> Bible and Ecology</p> <h4>DEGREES AND CONCENTRATIONS</h4> <p><b>Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in Theology</b>&nbsp;- The Theology major currently offers two different curricular tracks:</p> <p>The&nbsp;<b>Standard Theology&nbsp;</b>major is relatively unstructured and flexible, easily tailored to various motivations and goals for theological study and adaptable to the diverse paths and timetables by which students come to the major.

Both rigorous and comprehensive, it provides an integrated introduction to the discipline and a broad foundation for post-graduate study. With its comprehensive distribution requirements across all areas it exposes students to the entire breadth of the theological discipline. With more credit hours and an optional thesis, it allows students to focus on a particular sub-discipline in which to pursue and demonstrate scholarly excellence.
