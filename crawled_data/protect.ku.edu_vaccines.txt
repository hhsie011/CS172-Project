KS Vaccine Website KS Vaccine Website Federal Vaccine Website Federal Vaccine Website General Information The best way each of us can do our part to protect ourselves and each other and fight the pandemic is to get vaccinated. While the COVID-19 vaccine is not required, KU strongly recommends that everyone get vaccinated and boosted as soon as possible if they have not already done so. Current research shows the vaccines are safe and effective at preventing severe illness from COVID-19. Vaccines are widely available at no cost for those 5 and older in Douglas County and elsewhere. Information about upcoming clinics is available through Lawrence-Douglas County Public Health, which will begin offering walk-in appointments next week. The federal government has established a Vaccine website that also can help you find a vaccine location near you. Members of the KU community may also set a vaccine appointment through Watkins Health Services, which has both Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson doses available. Students may call 785-864-9507 or schedule an appointment through their secure patient portal. KU encourages students who have completed their vaccination series to upload their information to the Watkins Patient Portal. You can learn more about the Student Vaccine Incentive Program on this site. Booster Shots Booster shots are widely available for anyone who meets the CDC's eligibility requirements. KU employees who meet this criteria and completed their initial Pfizer or Modera series at least six months ago, or their initial one-dose J&J shot at least two months ago, may schedule an appointment to receive a booster at Watkins Health Services: KU students may call 785-864-9507 Faculty and staff may call 785-864-9565 Additional drive-through appointments and information about eligibility is available through Lawrence-Douglas County The CDC is also permitting a "mix-and-match" booster approach.
