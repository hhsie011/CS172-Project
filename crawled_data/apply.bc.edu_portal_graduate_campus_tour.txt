Each tour lasts approximately 1 hour and is led by a current graduate student. This tour is a great introduction to Boston College and gives you a chance to see and experience campus and begin asking questions. Virtual Tours Our virtual tours are live—you'll join a Zoom chatroom with a current graduate student hosting the tour just for you! Each tour lasts approximately 30 minutes. This tour includes a video preview of campus and allows you the opportunity to connect with a current student and begin asking questions. Summer 2022 During June 2022, we'll offer virtual tour appointments each weekday. You can use the calendar below to choose a date and time to join us. We'll begin hosting in-person tours again in August. The schedule for tour times will be available in mid-July. Fall 2022 Fall tours will begin in mid-September. Appointments will be posted on the calendar below by late August. Generally, during the academic year, in-person tours are held on Mondays and Fridays. Virtual tours are held Tuesday-Thursday. We look forward to hosting you!
