We are beginning with an environmental analysis that will identify programs and initiatives within colleges, schools, departments and student organizations. Also, we will begin working with students in Central Texas schools to encourage interest in the health care professions before college and develop a student-led collaborative that we hope to extend to other area colleges and universities. A UT forum will kick off the student-led collaborative during the 2019-2020 academic year.
