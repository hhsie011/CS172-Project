Home / NTC Equity, Diversity and Inclusion NTC Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Here at Newcomb-Tulane College we are committed to ensuring that our students thrive in a welcoming, inclusive environment. Our students must have equity of access to opportunities to excel academically and to the resources they need to take full advantage of those opportunities. Our operating principles of embracing diversity and fostering equity are the bedrock of each office and initiative at Newcomb-Tulane College. We promote and support our diverse and multifaceted staff who in turn support, guide and mentor all students, particularly BIPOC, LGBTQ, first-generation, and other underrepresented undergraduates. Our academic community is strongest when each member is empowered to thrive and we grow together.
