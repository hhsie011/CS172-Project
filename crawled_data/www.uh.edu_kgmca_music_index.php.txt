I moved to Houston from a small town in Alabama to start work on my masters degree, and although it was overwhelming at first, I quickly found a new home through the community at MSM. Not only have I been able to pursue many different musical and academic interests, I worked with a diverse collection of supportive, high-level faculty members. My career since graduation has taken me all over the country and abroad”—Justin Langham (MM '15, DMA '21)About Justin Langham 3700 Cullen Blvd, Room E128 Houston, TX 77204-4039 713-743-3019 Contact Us Moores School of Music 713-743-3009 moores@uh.edu KGMCA Box Office 713-743-3388 Music Admissions 713-743-5934 musicadmissions@uh.edu Schools and Centers Moores School of Music 713-743-3009 School of Art 713-743-3001 School of Theatre & Dance 713-743-3003 M.A. in Arts Leadership 713-743-4817 Blaffer Art Museum 713-743-9521 Cynthia Woods Mitchell Center for the Arts 713-743-7008 ©2022 University of Houston.
