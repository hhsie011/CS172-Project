In The Sustainable City, Steven Cohen surveys policies and projects around the world that strive to align urban life and sustainability. Cohen, executive director of the Earth Institute, discusses the sustainable city and the transition to a green economy from an organizational-management and public-policy perspective. He emphasizes the local level, examining programs and publicprivate partnerships that include waste management in Beijing, energy infrastructure in Africa and public space in Washington, D.C. By offering concrete examples, Cohen synthesizes the disparate strands of sustainable city planning in a guide that highlights everyday issues, including transportation choices, energy sources and food waste disposal. The book provides recommendations and insights, linking public policy to the promotion of a sustainable lifestyle. 212-854-5573 [email protected] Genre Nonfiction Topic Climate Contact Us [email protected] Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
