Contact Us Online Giving Red White Club Brochure (PDF) Red White Club St. John’s has always been proud of our strong athletic tradition. With 17 Division I sports programs, all competing in the BIG EAST Conference, our student-athletes have the opportunity to play some of the most challenging teams in the nation. We believe that their continued success—both on the playing field and in the classroom—is directly related to the support our alumni and friends provide each year. That is why the Red White Club is such an important organization. Its members contribute gifts that have an immediate and tangible impact on our athletic programs. Donors can direct their gift to a specific sport or request that contributions be used for the Athletic Department’s most-needed priorities. These gifts provide our student-athletes with equipment, travel expense coverage, field and arena renovations, academic support, and much more. A contribution of $100 or more grants you access into one of our 11 membership levels, entitling you to a host of exclusive privileges and amenities only available to club members. Join today and help our student-athletes continue in our proud athletic tradition!

Online Giving Gifts can be made online through www.stjohns.edu/giveredwhite. To designate your gift, select your program of choice in the “designation” drop-down box or choose “Other” and type in the desired program. By choosing the “Athletics General Fund,” your gift goes towards Athletics’ most-needed priorities. Matching Gifts You can double or even triple your gift by obtaining a matching gift from your company. To learn if your company has a matching gift program, contact your Human Resources office or visit www.stjohns.edu/giveredwhite. Appreciated Securities Gifts of appreciated stocks or bonds are another way to support your favorite team and receive a greater tax benefit than you would receive from an equivalent gift of cash. Gift-In-Kind The University also welcomes gifts-in-kind (non-monetary items of tangible personal property). These gifts typically require a considerable amount of attention and should be discussed with an Athletic Development Office representative before the donation is made. Call the Red White Club at 718-990-6147 in advance to discuss a possible gift. Endowed Gifts/The McCallen Society Establishing an endowment in your name or in the name of a loved one is an excellent way to help ensure continuous support of St. John’s Athletics. Endowment gifts are invested donations whose earned interest is used to support our student-athletes. Benefactors can choose to designate their gift toward a specific program.
