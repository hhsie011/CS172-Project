Truett Seminary>Students>Academic Services>Registration Registration REGISTRATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR CURRENT STUDENTS For instructions on how to register, click here. To find your registration time and date: Students' specific registration times will be available via BearWeb registration under 'registration status' or on the Office of the Registrar website To find your registration dates, login to Bearweb > Student Academic Services > Registration > Registration Status Students are encouraged to register at the designated time and date they are assigned. Registration times are assigned according to how many Seminary hours you have completed. Students who have completed more coursework are able to register earlier. WAITLIST On occasion, classes at Baylor will fill up to capacity. Therefore, Baylor utilizes the waitlist system. This means that students may not petition faculty or administrators for a seat in a closed class. The Office of Academic Services and the Academic Dean's Office monitor the waitlist for seminary classes and make adjustments as needed. If you need to register for a class that is full, you must add yourself to the waitlist. If a student attempts to enroll in a closed class, the student will receive a "Closed - # Waitlist" message. Students have the option to place themselves on the waitlist. Instructions regarding the Waitlist can be found here. VARIABLE HOUR COURSES Any course with a "V" in the title (for example, MENT 7V00, THEO 7V48, etc.) is a variable hour course. These courses default to one hour in the registration system - you must manually select the number of hours for which you intend to register. View instructions for changing variable hours here. HOLDS Holds will prevent you from registering. If you are unable to register due to holds, you must resolve these holds with the Registrar’s Office or the Cashier’s Office before proceeding: Registrar's Office Registrar@baylor.edu 254-710-1181 Cashier's Office 254-710-2311 Students Academic Services Registration Advising Degree Planning Substitutions & Waivers Graduation Transfer Students Advanced Standing Look Up Classes Academic Complaints Scholarship Services Mentoring Program How Do I Begin Handbook Opportunities Professors of Record Deadlines FAQs Mentoring Program Application Mentoring Resources Currently Mentoring Mentoring Resources Mentoring Notebook Submission Form Financial Wellness Resources Online Tools Final Exam Schedule Lifelong Formation Truett Student Employment Code of Conduct Student Organizations Campus Resources Need Help?
