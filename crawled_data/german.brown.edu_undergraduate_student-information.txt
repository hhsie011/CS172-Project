Under the supervision of a faculty member, these students are responsible for teaching small conversation sections three times per week. These Teaching Apprentices will normally have studied abroad in Germany, and they should be able to transmit their enthusiasm for learning German to their students. Contact German_Studies@brown.edu.

The tutors meet with individual students who would like extra help with conversation or any other aspect of language learning. Contact German_Studies@brown.edu. Summer English Teaching in Germany Occasionally the department is able to facilitate one or two opportunities to teach English in a rural setting in one of the new German states for a month in the summer.
