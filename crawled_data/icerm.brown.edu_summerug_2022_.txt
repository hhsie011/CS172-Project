Harris Williams College Gordon Rojas Kirby University of California, Santa Barbara Abstract The Summer@ICERM faculty advisers will present a variety of research projects on the combinatorics of parking functions. This overarching theme will allow participants to study and analyze parking functions by leveraging computational techniques and theory. Faculty will also guide the development of open-source computational tools for analyzing parking functions and their statistics, with time devoted to creating a database of parking functions and their generalizations. Throughout the eight-week program, 18-22 students will work on their projects in groups of two to four, supervised by faculty advisors and aided by teaching assistants. Students will meet daily, give regular talks about their findings, attend mini-courses, guest talks, and professional development seminars, and will acquire skills in free software development. Students will learn how to collaborate mathematically, working closely in their teams to write up their research into a paper.
