Yale students enroll in four or five courses each semester to complete a total of thirty-six courses while earning a degree. With roughly 2,000 courses offered every year, it would take more than 200 years to experience the full breadth of the undergraduate curriculum! About three-quarters of all courses enroll fewer than twenty students, and hundreds enroll fewer than ten. The student-to-faculty ratio is 6:1. Most majors include a senior requirement (essay, research project, or portfolio) that allows students to work one-on-one with a professor for one or two semesters. Whether you are certain of your academic focus or have dozens of possibilities in mind, you will have plenty of time to explore the options. Yale students have until the end of sophomore year to declare a major. Yale graduates in all majors are prepared to serve in positions of leadership in every imaginable field.
