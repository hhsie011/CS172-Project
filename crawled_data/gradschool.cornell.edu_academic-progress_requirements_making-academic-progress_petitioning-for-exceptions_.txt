At times, you might find that your circumstances merit an exception to a policy described in the Code. To request an exemption, you may use the General Petition form and submit supporting documentation, for example, a letter from your committee chair or a detailed academic plan. Prior to submitting the petition, you should review the Code thoroughly to make sure you understand the regulation. You will need to submit convincing evidence that your exception is required and warranted. Petition forms may be sent to the Graduate School’s Student Services office (143 Caldwell Hall or gradstudserv@cornell.edu). If your petition is denied, you may appeal that decision to the General Committee, the governing body of the Graduate School. Examples of typical petitions: Extending the deadline to select a special committee Extending the deadline to take an A, M, or B exam Seeking additional time to complete a degree Registering in absentia while away from campus Many petitions have specialized forms to guide you through the process. Others may require you to submit a general petition form.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
