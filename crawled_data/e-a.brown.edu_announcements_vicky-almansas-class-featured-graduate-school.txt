She was motivated by an interest in continuing to participate in archaeological excavations at the MenkaureValley Temple in Giza, Egypt, while also working to fulfill her teaching responsibility to undergraduates at Brown. Thus EGYT 0500, The Pyramids in Context: Archaeology of Life and Religion of Death in Old Kingdom Egypt, became an online course from the start.
