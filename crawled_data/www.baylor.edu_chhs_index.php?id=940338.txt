David Garrett, Ph.D. CCC/SLP Associate Professor of Communication Sciences and Disorders Email David_Garrett@baylor.edu Office Suite 110.14 Phone (254) 710-0105 High Res Photo CV Associate Professor of Communication Sciences and Disorders Dr. Garrett currently serves as Associate Professor in the Communication Sciences & Disorders Department. He was a former Department Chair and Graduate Program Director of Communication Sciences & Disorders for about 15 years. Dr. Garrett’s recent courses include Medical Speech Pathology, Technology & Science in Communication Sciences & Disorders, Voice Pathology, Advanced Instrumentation, Neurology, and Anatomy & Physiology. Dr. Garrett is proud to be associated with the exceptional faculty and students in the Communication Sciences & Disorders Department at Baylor. Dr. Garrett came to the field of Speech Pathology in an unusual way. He began his undergraduate education as a dual major in Biology & Neuroscience (previously called Physiological Psychology). He learned about Speech Pathology late in his undergraduate training by reading a friend's Aphasia textbook. He fell in love with the field, and found his calling. The field incorporates all aspects of science (anatomy, physiology, neurology, acoustics, etc.) yet applies the science to helping people in a very real and personal way. Dr. Garrett completed his Masters Degree at Baylor and his Ph.D. at University of Iowa. After a Post-Doctoral Fellowship at Haskins Laboratories, he taught at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. Returning to Texas, his home state, he was an Asst. Professor at Baylor College of Medicine - Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, a Voice Scientist at the Texas Voice Center in Houston, and an Adjunct Professor at Rice University. For over two decades, Dr. Garrett has enjoyed his time at Baylor University. He and his family have a long history at Baylor and were awarded the Baylor Alumni - First Family Award in 2003 (along with the other 53 family members and 4 generations of family who have attended Baylor). Dr. Garrett is married to the lovely and talented Ruth Garrett. They live at Serenity Ranch in China Spring and have a River House on the Brazos. Dr. Garrett enjoys teaching the bright enthusiastic students at Baylor, kayaking, canoeing, working on his tractor, and creating a beautiful nature preserve with his wife and dog G.G. at Serenity Ranch and the Brazos River House.
