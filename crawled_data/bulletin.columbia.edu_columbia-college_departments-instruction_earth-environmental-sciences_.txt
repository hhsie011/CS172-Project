Our program for majors aims to convey an understanding of how the complex Earth system works at a level that encourages students to think creatively about the Earth system processes and how to address multidisciplinary environmental problems. The breadth of material covered provides an excellent background for those planning to enter the professions of law, business, diplomacy, public policy, teaching, journalism, etc. At the same time, the program provides sufficient depth so that our graduates are prepared for graduate school in one of the Earth sciences. The program can be adjusted to accommodate students with particular career goals in mind. The department’s close affiliations with the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), the Earth Institute at Columbia (EI), and several departments within the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Sciences afford opportunities for student participation in a wide variety of current research programs. Summer employment, research, and additional educational opportunities are available at Lamont and GISS. The department encourages majors to become involved in a research project by their junior year. All majors and concentrators, when planning their programs of study, should regularly consult the directors of undergraduate studies and make themselves aware of the requirements for their particular program. Programs of Study Environmental Science Major The environmental science major curriculum provides an introduction to a variety of fields of study relevant to the environment. Environmental science majors are required to take three semesters of introductory courses and to develop a grounding in basic physics, chemistry, biology, and mathematics. Here, students may select courses depending on their interest. With this introduction to the Earth’s environment and equipped with a knowledge of the basic sciences, students are prepared to choose a set of upper-level courses in consultation with an undergraduate adviser. All environmental science majors are required to complete a research project, providing a practical application of mastered course work. This research culminates in a senior thesis. The research and the thesis are usually done at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory with guidance from a faculty member or a research scientist. However, other options are also possible. Environmental science majors have an option to complete the special concentration in environmental biology for environmental science majors. Earth Science Major The major in Earth science follows a similar rationale but is designed to allow students to pursue particular fields of the Earth sciences in greater depth. Compared with the environmental science major, one fewer introductory course is required, while one additional advanced course should be part of the plan of study. The Earth science major also offers the possibility of in-depth field experience through a six- to eight-week geology summer field course, arrangements for which are made through another university. The research and senior thesis capstone requirements are the same as for the environmental science major. The geology summer field course may be used as an alternative means of fulfilling the capstone requirement in the Earth science major. Concentrations The program for concentrators serves students who want more exposure to Earth and environmental science than is provided by introductory-level courses. The program aims to provide concentrators with experience in data analysis and a thorough introduction to the Earth's systems. The concentrations in environmental science and in Earth science are designed to give students an understanding of how the Earth works and an introduction to the methods used to investigate Earth processes, including their capabilities and limitations. Concentrators often join the social professions (e.g., business, law, medicine, etc.) and take with them a strong scientific background. They take the same introductory courses as the majors, but fewer basic science and upper-level courses are required. In addition to the environmental science and Earth science concentrations, the department sponsors a special concentration which must be done in conjunction with the environmental biology major. Students should be aware that they must complete the environmental biology major in order to receive credit for the special concentration. There is also a special concentration in environmental biology for environmental science majors sponsored by the Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Environmental Biology. Departmental Honors The Department of Earth and Environmental Science awards departmental honors to the major or majors in Earth science or environmental science judged to have the best overall academic record. The award is accorded to no more than 10% of the graduating class, or one student in the case of a class smaller than 10. A grade point average of at least 3.6 in the major and a senior thesis or equivalent research of high quality are required. Students who wish to be considered should contact the director of undergraduate studies early in their senior year. Professors Nicholas Christie-Blick Joel E.

The requirements are different for each major and concentration and must be met in conjunction with the general requirements for the bachelor's degree. Declaration of the major must be approved by the department and filed in the departmental office. Substitutions and Exceptions Higher-level courses may be used to satisfy supporting mathematics and science requirements for students with Advanced Placement preparation with the permission of the major adviser. In addition to the courses listed for the depth, and breadth and related courses requirements, several graduate-level courses offered in the department as well as several advanced courses offered at Barnard may be substituted with the permission of the major adviser. 1000-level courses in the Earth and Environmental Sciences Department can not be used toward meeting the requirements of any of the majors, concentrations, or special concentrations. The following course is not suitable for undergraduates and can not be used toward meeting any of the requirements for the majors, concentrations, or special concentrations: EESC GU4930 Earth's Oceans and Atmosphere. Grading A grade of C- or better must be obtained for a course to count toward the majors, concentrations, or special concentrations. The grade of P is not acceptable, but a course taken Pass/D/Fail may be counted if and only if the P is uncovered by the Registrar's deadline.

Prerequisites: introductory geology or the equivalent, elementary college physics and chemistry, or the instructors permission. Minerals come in dazzling colors, amazing shapes and with interesting optical effects. But mineralogy is also an essential tool for the understanding of Earth evolution. Minerals represent fundamental building blocks of the Earth system and planetary bodies. Minerals form through geological and biological processes such as igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary from high to low temperatures, from the deep interior to the Earth’s surface and related to volcanism, tectonics, weathering, climate and life. Minerals are one of our most important sources of information on such processes through Earth’s history. Minerals also represent important natural resources and are fundamental to the global economy and modern technology as we know it. The goal of this class is to (1) understand the physical and chemical properties of minerals, (2) learn techniques of mineral identification with an emphasis on optical mineralogy, (3) understand the relationship between minerals and the broader geological context Fall 2022: EESC GU4113 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment EESC 4113 001/11586 T 2:40pm - 4:40pm 506 Schermerhorn Hall Yves Moussallam 4.00 9/12 EESC 4113 001/11586 T Th 8:40am - 9:55am 506 Schermerhorn Hall Yves Moussallam 4.00 9/12 EESC GU4330 Introduction to Terrestrial Paleoclimate. 3 points.

How has climate shaped the history and development of NYC? How do climate and climate change affect our lives today? How will climate change affect our lives tomorrow? Variations in climate and weather have been major sources of risk and opportunity for humanity long before the industrial revolution began warming the planet. The growing impacts of climate change on human civilization over recent decades have turned attention from the future of our climate to the present. In this course, we investigate how the climate system intersects and interacts with the complex human system of NYC. The trajectory of this course will be set by the drafting of a final paper which will be done in small pieces throughout the semester. The first few weeks of the course will include lectures, activities, and assignments that will guide the selection of a specific climate impact for NYC and the formation of a research question for your final paper. This initial research question will then guide the majority of your assignments for the rest of the semester.
