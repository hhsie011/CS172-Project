Organizations have an opportunity to connect with students through in-person and/or virtual events, or a hybrid combination during career fairs, information sessions, interviews, etc.. As university guidance evolves, guidelines for on-campus visitors (employers and graduate/professional school partners are considered invited guests) will adjust accordingly. Look for up-to-date visitor and events information on the university’s COVID-19 website. Cornell Career Services works closely with employer and graduate/professional school partners to provide optimal engagement opportunities with Cornell students (see the schedule in Handshake). Are services such as resume review, coaching and job preparation still available? Career services staff are available by Zoom, phone, or in person (as guidelines allow). We offer dozens of upcoming career-related workshops and workshop recordings in the Media Library. Students can visit the Career Development Toolkit in Canvas for comprehensive career resources and tips. We encourage you to connect with alumni using CUeLINKS and use Handshake to find opportunities. Will I have access to career services if I take a leave of absence? Any restrictions of your leave of absence will determine what services are available. Generally speaking, you should have access to Handshake, job postings (without campus interviews) and the Career Fair, but you will not be eligible to participate in virtual campus recruiting. Individual appointments and attendance at some programs (even virtual ones) may be limited, depending on capacity in your college career office. What is the guidance for student organizations that typically host recruiters on campus? Recruiter visits will be virtual until travel and visitor restrictions have been lifted. Student organization leaders should work with their career services contacts to develop a strategy for helping employers create opportunities to meet and engage with students virtually. This coordination is crucial to be sure that events are advertised on Handshake and that all students have access to them.
