It was nice to make Clemson my home over the summer and learn what study methods work, where is the best spot to be, and what are some hidden things that will help me along the way.” Thaddeus Major computer science ’23 Contact Summer Start First-Year Academic Programs Phone: 864-656-6902 Email: summerstart@clemson.edu Clemson Office of Admissions Phone: 864-656-2287 Email: apply@admission.clemson.edu Clemson University Facebook Instagram Twitter Linkedin Youtube Tiktok Policy/Terms of Use Web Accessibility Ethics/Safety Hotline Privacy Policy Copyright © 2022 Clemson University • Clemson, South Carolina 29634 Clemson University Facebook Instagram Twitter Linkedin Youtube Tiktok Resources A-Z Index Campus Map CU Safety Directory Webcams Apply to Clemson
