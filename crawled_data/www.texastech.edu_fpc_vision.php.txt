The Texas Tech University System and its five universities operate on a dozen campuses throughout the state of Texas, as well as one location internationally. With 1,839 acres, the largest campus is in Lubbock, Texas and is home to the Texas Tech University System and two of its components—Texas Tech University, the flagship institution, and Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, a separate, comprehensive health university. The first Master Plan for the Lubbock campus was adopted in 1997 to establish a vision for growth and continued excellence throughout the Texas Tech University System. Since then, there have been two updates to the plan with the most recent being adopted in 2014. On the Horizon To accommodate the tremendous growth of the Texas Tech University System, Facilities Planning & Construction works closely with each component university in the identification of both current and future facility and infrastructure needs. Over the next 10 years, planning and development on each campus will be focused toward shared-facility academic partnerships with private industry, research facilities, mixed-use student life development and student residential spaces.
