Reserve lists typically include required and recommended reading for Princeton courses. Firestone and most PUL branches provide course reserves services; see guidelines on placing reserves requests. Students Access your instructor's physical course reserve list as well as the electronic reserve readings by using the buttons to the right. Physical items placed on reserve at any of the PUL locations circulate for a much shorter period of time and incur heavier fines if returned late. Materials available through the e-reserves system are password protected and are to be used only by enrolled students in connection with the course for which the materials have been assigned. These materials must not be copied or distributed for other purposes except as permitted under copyright law. For more information, see the copyright page.
