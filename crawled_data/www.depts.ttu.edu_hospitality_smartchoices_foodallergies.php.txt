Allergic reactions to food can sometimes cause serious illness and death. Individuals can be allergic to any food, but 90% of all reactions are due to eight foods. These include: milk, egg, peanut, tree nut (walnuts, almonds, etc.), fish, shellfish, soy, and wheat. Even a tiny amount of an allergy-causing food can trigger a reaction in susceptible individuals. These can include digestive problems, hives, and swollen airways. In extremely sensitive individuals, a serious allergic reaction called anaphylaxis can result, leading to death. Therefore, it is important for students with food allergies to contact Hospitality Services or speak with a manager to ensure they take the proper precautions to avoid an allergic reaction.
