You, or the person who may claim you as a dependent, may be able to take the tuition and fees deduction or claim an education credit on form 1040 or 1040A for the qualified tuition and related financial transactions that were timestamped during the calendar year. The IRS 1098-T form is an informational document and does not need to be attached to your tax return. There is no IRS or UC requirement that you claim a tuition and fees deduction or an education credit. Beginning with tax year 2018, new legislation requires that UC reports payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses in Box 1 on the IRS Form 1098-T, rather than the historical reporting of the amount billed in Box 2. While the resources below may provide some guidance, please note that the University of Cincinnati cannot provide tax filing advice regarding Form 1098-T or your eligibility for tax credits/deductions. Please visit irs.gov or contact your tax professional for filing assistance.
