H. Hill Jr. Library Floor: First Floor, East Wing Rooms: 1133 The Digital Media Lab (DML) has workstations with audiovisual editing software, scanners, video and audio editing decks, an enclosed studio with a green screen, and four music booths. Reservable spaces require an orientation, which can be taken by simply stopping by the space at any point and meeting with the on-duty consultant. The DML is staffed whenever it is open, meaning you can find drop-in consultation assistance for projects, technology, and more just by stopping by. Reserve a media studio Fill out the Media Studio Request Form to reserve a media studio in the Digital Media Lab. How do I reserve and access this space? Who can use this space? Only currently affiliated students, faculty, and staff of NC State may gain access to the Media Spaces. To access reservable spaces, you must first attend an orientation session, which will introduce you to the resources and staff in the space to help you use the room more effectively. Orientations are available on a walk-up basis any time the Digital Media Lab is open. Media Spaces are intended for those creating, editing, or transferring media. You will be asked to forfeit your reservation if you are using them for reasons other than these. For more information on reservable study rooms please see room use guidelines or reserve an appropriate study room. Requesting a Reservation The Digital Media Lab has computer workstations in the main room that do not require a reservation. The Music Booths and Digital Media Lab Studio are available by request for the 2021-2022 school year. Once you have submitted your requested date, time, and media space through the media space request form, the Make Media team will contact you to confirm availability. Checking in You must check in at the Digital Media Lab at the time of your reservation to gain admission to the room. Make sure you bring your Wolfpack One card to check out materials necessary for completing the reservation. What's inside?
