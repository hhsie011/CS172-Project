There are more than 100 different Learning Communities for students to choose from at UC. During Bearcats Bound Orientation, incoming freshmen have the opportunity to join a Learning Community based upon their major or area of academic interest. The partnerships that first-year students form with faculty, staff, and other students in Learning Communities provides a cohesive learning experience centered around courses that fulfill core requirements. To learn more about Learning Communities in your college, ask your advisor today! The Learning Community experience helps students: Establish close relationships with professors Explore areas of academic interest Build friendships with classmates Achieve their academic goals Experience the feel of a small college with the benefits of a major university Obtain reserved seats in popular, difficult to-get-into courses First-Year Student Reflections It was awesome! I loved my LC and have made life long friends while being in class with the people I love! My Learning Community this year helped me transition to college and understand how I work best in the university academic setting. I was able to learn about resources available for students to be successful and different opportunities for engineering students to take advantage of at UC. My Learning Community experience not only helped better my academic experience at UC, but also helped me form friendships with people in my major! [My LC] helped me get involved. Due to my Peer Leader’s help in getting involved and answering my questions, I was put into the position to get an unofficial co-op for the summer which will help me get more experience within my engineering field.
