The Atlanta Gay Men’s Chorus is proud to present the world premiere of Julian Hornik’s “@QueerZ,” a new choral theatre work musing on the joys and challenges unique to Gen Z. Ranging from the power of texting to the prevalence of school shootings, the songs explore what matters to a generation that came of age in a time of relative acceptance and support. It is a coming-of-age story of first kisses, family acceptance and betrayal, and ultimately self-acceptance and pride.
