This year's speaker is Monica Rivera. Given the rates and gendered nature of interpersonal violence, we must start talking about consent as early as possible if we hope to shift the trajectory of young adults before they reach campus. The Jeanne Clery Lecture Series was established by Constance Clery BC ’53 and Howard Clery, Jr. in memory of their daughter, Jeanne Clery.
