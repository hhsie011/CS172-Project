It is a non-selective, choice PreK-8 public elementary school that gives priority to families residing in Community School Districts 5 and 6. The school adds a grade each year, and at full capacity TCCS will serve students in grades Pre-K through 8. Teachers College regards TCCS as central to its founding mission to bring educational opportunities to all members of society. TC’s guiding principle in creating the school is to deliver exemplary, comprehensive educational opportunities to children in West Harlem, including best educational practices for teaching and learning, early childhood education so that children get a good start, out-of-school time learning opportunities such as after school programs, and social and health services that support children’s ability to learn. The partners have been able to lay a solid foundation thanks to the commitment and hard work of the school’s administration, instructional staff and parents, along with Teachers College faculty and students and community partners.
