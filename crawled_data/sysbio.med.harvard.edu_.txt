Location, Location, Location We're located in the heart of the Longwood Medical Area, one of the greatest concentrations of biomedical science in the world. Measure twice. Model once. Quantitative measurements are essential to build and test worthwhile models. Systems Biology Retreat in Beautiful Maine! Our 2019 department retreat was held at Sebasco Harbor in Maine. Welcome to the Department of Systems Biology Our department aims to identify the quantitative principles that govern complex interactions across all areas of biology and medicine. Our goal is to develop a conceptual and predictive understanding of the living world, to enable the design and control of biological systems and the advancement of human health and welfare.
