The Rules were revised in May 2015, to strengthen the right of freedom of expression for every member of the University and the ability to openly demonstrate, rally, picket, and circulate petitions, while still protecting the rights of others and allowing the University to continue to function normally. Download a reader-friendly guide to the Rules of University Conduct here (pictured below), and find the full set of rules here.
