Print Degree Planner (opens a new window) | Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Facebook this Page (opens a new window) Tweet this Page (opens a new window) Master of Fine Arts in Theatre Arts (60 UNITS) This degree is for students who desire a professionally oriented education and training in design and technical production, acting and directing. Based on a student’s previous undergraduate or professional experience, substitutions or revisions in the study plan might be appropriate. Average length of time to complete the program is three years. At the end of each semester, M.F.A. candidates shall be evaluated by a faculty committee. The committee, by recommendation to the Associate Vice President for Academic Programs, has the authority to retain, dismiss or place candidates on probation. To be retained in the M.F.A. Acting program, students must prepare an acting demonstration (jury) at the end of each semester. The performance faculty will assess each student at this time and determine if the student warrants retention or dismissal from the program based on a set of predetermined criteria. In addition to the acting jury, each student will be assessed on professionalism, collegiality and progress in coursework and departmental productions. Application Deadlines Applications for the Directing and Acting Concentrations are accepted in the fall semester only in odd-numbered years (i.e., Fall 2009, 2011, etc.) for admission in even-numbered years (i.e. Fall 2010, 2012, etc.) Applications for the Design/Technical Production Concentration are accepted every fall semester. The deadline for completing online applications is March 1 for the following fall semester; mailed applications also need to be postmarked by March 1.
