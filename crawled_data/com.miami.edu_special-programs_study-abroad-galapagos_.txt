At the same time, the communication of environmental ideas is central to many forms of work and activism in the environmental field. This course explores using communication and media to shape awareness for pressing environmental issues facing the Galapagos Islands and the possibilities for cultivating a “greener” environmental culture in our lives and in the world at large. Through various readings as well as visual materials, this three-credit course focuses specifically on environmental issues and ideas using communication and media to craft messages that bring awareness to the unique biodiversity and ecosystems of the Galapagos and perhaps as a catalyst for change. It is paired with another three-credit course, The Galapagos Islands: Writing for Social Change, to form the six-credit Galapagos Summer program. This six-credit program Galapagos Summer, is a hands-on experiential learning experience for any student with the heart and passion for environmental protection. Whether you are a longtime student of the environment or new to environmental advocacy, it is imperative that you take this course to become more aware of what is happening in our environment and how each of us can contribute in our own little ways toward environmental protection and conservation. View Study Abroad Website Courses STC 493 or STC 629 The Galapagos Islands: Writing for Social Change CIM 594 or CIM 795 The Galapagos Islands: Media for Social Good 6 Credits Total The separate courses are led by Professor Michelle Seelig, who teaches classes on visual communication, interactive media as well as internet and media activism, and has recently published Communicating the Environment Beyond Photography, which is a modern look at how photographers visualize what is happening to people and places on a changing planet; and Professor Heidi Carr, who teaches classes in writing, design and social media and is a former reporter and editor for the Miami Herald. The distinctly different courses work closely together to provide a stronger learning experience than either course alone. Both courses have a central focus on the environment and culture of the Galapagos. Each class requires its own assignments that help students create their capstone project.
