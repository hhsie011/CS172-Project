The Helene and Cecile Rübel Asiatic Research Bureau was established in 1927 with the opening of the Fogg Art Museum. Langdon Warner, class of 1903, donated the original volumes in the collection to provide research materials for students of Asian art. In 1932 the collection was strengthened by C. Adrian Rübel, class of 1926, an enthusiastic collector and student of Asian art, who established a fund to be used for the purchase of books and photographs. The Rübel Collection originally operated as the curatorial library of the Oriental Art Department of Harvard University. In 1978 it was integrated into the Fine Arts Library and its official name changed to the Rübel Asiatic Research Collection. Accessing These Materials Collection holdings are represented in HOLLIS. Most East Asian language entries contain both Asian characters and Romanized titles. For more on using this collection see the Research Guide on East Asian Art.
