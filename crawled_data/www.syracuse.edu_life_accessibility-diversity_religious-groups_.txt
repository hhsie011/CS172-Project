These groups span a wide diversity of religious traditions and spiritual interests. Participation is open to all students. While each religious group serves a particular faith constituency, the groups work together as part of S.A.I.L. (Student Assembly of Interfaith Leaders) on issues of interfaith engagement, student welfare, and spiritual programming. All religious groups support and live out the Hendricks Chapel Ethical Framework that calls upon each chaplaincy and religious group to honor the religious freedom, human dignity, conscience, personal spiritual welfare, and the religious tradition of every person to whom they minister. For more information, visit the Dean’s Suite in the lower level of Hendricks Chapel or visit hendricks.syr.edu.
