Col. James Hamilton built his house here in 1835. He named it Nevis, after the birthplace of his father. The original house was square, in the style of a Greek temple. In 1851, he added a south wing.

In 1915, the house passed out of the Hamilton/Schuyler family. It was purchased by Thomas Coleman du Pont in 1920; he was the U.S. Senator from Delaware in 1921-1922 and 1924-1928. In 1934, du Pont's widow, Alice, donated the Nevis estate to Columbia University. East side West side 1938 1938 During WWII, Prof. Hugh Findley used the estate to teach classes on victory gardens. After the war, Columbia decided to use the property for scientific research. Construction of physics facilities at Nevis began in 1947. In 1950 Dwight D. Eisenhower, then President of the University, inaugurated what was then the world's most powerful cyclotron, which was eventually retired in 1978. The Hamilton House is still located on the Nevis Labs property. It's used for physics conferences and temporary housing for researchers working at Nevis. East side West side 2014 2014 WEBMASTER
