In this charged, polarized climate, those intersections can be hard to find. Enter Power of WE - a historic student-led initiative under the Office of the President. Our agenda? Forging those intersections. WE curate spaces where people spanning the spectrum of politics and life experience can convene and collaborate rather than separate and isolate. WE aim to connect insights to divine answers to the pressing questions our society faces. WE aspire to co-create a culture of collaboration to stem the tides of polarization and bridge our deepening divides. CAMPUS INSTIGATION Public spaces are innately shared spaces. Our campus instigations tap into this overlooked venue for organic engagement across differences. CAMPUS INSPIRATION Our self-designed programs are powered by an ambitious formula: ideologically diverse participants + big-picture questions = dynamic discourse that inspires CAMPUS CO-CREATION Power of WE is more than an initiative. It's an idea. An idea that can be internalized by anyone, anywhere. The only way to ensure sustainable change is to co-create it. © Florida State University Tallahassee, FL 32306 FSU Directory Assistance Questions or Comments Privacy Policy Copyright Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube LinkedIn More FSU Social Media
