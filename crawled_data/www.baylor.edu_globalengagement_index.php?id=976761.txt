Make sure you have followed our Steps to Study Abroad before doing so. We offer 2 types of appointments: Meet with a Peer Adviser Peer advisers are Baylor Study Abroad returnees who have enjoyed their experiences so much that they have come back to advise other students on Study Abroad opportunities at Baylor. Each peer adviser can explain program options, give an overview of the study abroad process, as well as provide information about their experience abroad. Click here to schedule your appointment with a Peer Advisor. Meet with a Study Abroad Adviser Study Abroad advisers work with a specific portfolio of programs and can help answer questions about your program of interest including how other programs compare, the application process, pre-departure processes, and cultural preparation. You cannot schedule an appointment with a Study Abroad advisor if you haven't already met with a Peer Advisor. Do you have general questions or need help choosing a program?
