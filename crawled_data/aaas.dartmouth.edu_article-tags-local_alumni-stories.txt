While at Dartmouth, I majored in African & African American Studies and served as the President of the Afro-American Society. My senior year, I was awarded a Senior Fellowship to produce a thirty-minute documentary film on the complexity of black male identity. I also received the Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellowship, William Cook-Louise Cook Jacobs Award, and Dean's Plate Award. Now, I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of African American Studies at Northwestern University. [more] Alumni Story: Whitney P. Foster '64 March 17, 2016 I wrote my senior thesis on Nigeria: The Emerging Giant (or something like that). On graduation all I wanted to do was to go to Nigeria, and the Peace Corps became my vehicle for doing just that @ St. Michaels College in Oleh via Ughelli in what was then the Mid West State of Nigeria. For 2 years I was the history teacher, coach (soccer, bball, athletics etc.), and general gadfly breaking old Brit rules of education along with my PC roommate for about 300 mostly quite motivated but poorly "educated" male Nigerian primary school teachers.

While working at the Brooklyn Museum, my previous background in African and African American Art from courses I took at Dartmouth and professors I worked closely with was incredibly useful. Now I am currently in my second year of a PhD program in Communications, where I am studying African futurism and environmental sustainability whilst furthering myself as a designer.

Brown '13 March 16, 2016 After graduating from Dartmouth with the class of 2013, I began working with the SEAD, stepping into their new College Pathway Coordinator role. As my first full-time position, it was a great opportunity to build the foundation for us to meet the students' needs around college access and success. Seven years of Hanover, however will make you restless. I decided to move back to my hometown of Harlem, NYC as a college and career advisor for KIPP NYC charter school network.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College African and African American Studies Program Undergraduate Overview Major Minor Courses Summer 2022 Fall 2022 Winter 2023 Spring 2023 Forms Honors Student Prizes Careers Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Foreign Study Overview Ghana Foreign Study Program Paris Foreign Study Program Research Overview Thurgood Marshall Dissertation Fellowship Previous Thurgood Marshall Fellows Africa-Related Research African American-Related Research '82 Racial Justice Initiative About the Class of 1982 Racial Justice Initiative Support the Class of 1982 Enrichment Fund Events and Initiatives News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
