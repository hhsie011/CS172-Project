View All Events Sport Clubs in Solidarity Women's Basketball Statement of Solidarity In light of recent events, Women‚Äôs Club Basketball would like to express its solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. We condemn the ongoing racism that threatens people just because of the color of their skin. Basketball and other team sports have the power to unite people from all different backgrounds and cultures. We believe it is necessary to be a team player at all times. Part of being a team player is standing up for one another, both on and off the court. We hope to foster a supportive and welcoming community for anyone who is willing to put in the time and effort. We will also work to promote a safe and comfortable environment for people of all backgrounds. No one should ever feel unwelcome doing something they love. More than ever, a team-oriented mindset is necessary. Together, we must support one another, fight and work together in pursuit of growth and community. We also think it is important to learn about the role of race within basketball and the contributions that Black players have made to basketball. Even though basketball today is enjoyed and played by a diverse range of individuals, the sport has been historically marred by segregation. Until the 1950s, no black players were allowed to play in the National Basketball Association. The sport has come a long way since its racist past thanks to the bravery of Early Lloyd, Nat Clifton, and Chuck Cooper who paved the way for inclusivity. Because of them, we have grown up marveling at the basketball wizardry displayed by Michael Jordan, Maya Moore, Kobe Bryant, Tamika Catchings, Sheryl Swoopes and LeBron James. There is still more progress to be made for racial equality within basketball. At the professional level, efforts to promote equity at the executive level in the NBA have been undertaken, changing words such as ‚Äúowner‚Äù to more neutral terms and working for greater diversity within executive positions. Our team is committed to continuing to educate ourselves about ways in which a legacy of racism still exists within the sport we all love to play. We are committed to battling all forms of racism, and we will continue to uphold an inclusive and welcoming environment to all players. We encourage you to explore the resources listed below. Together, we can make a difference.

READ MORE > Rugby Princeton Rugby stands strongly with the Black Community against racism and inequality. We have teamed up with the Rugby Programs at Penn, Dartmouth, Brown, Yale, and Harvard to raise funds and awareness. Over the next week, Princeton Rugby Players will be running to help Ivy Rugby achieve their goal of running 846 miles in representation of the 8 minutes and 46 seconds that Officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on George Floyd‚Äôs neck, killing him. This running will be done in tandem with an Ivy Rugby Fundraiser, which will be conducted through a GoFundMe Campaign. We have attached a link to the GoFundMe Page at the bottom of this post, and it will be linked in our bio. It includes links to the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People), the Black Lives Matter Foundation, and the ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union). As per Ivy Rugby instructions ‚Äúonce you have completed a donation, please send a screenshot through the GoFundMe contact option at the bottom of the page so we can log your donation here.‚Äù You can find templates for your own personal stories to raise awareness under the "846" highlight on our page. We will be posting mileage on our story every day, so stay tuned! Help us exceed our goals here! You all have helped us go above our fundraising goals for our Bike to Oxford, our Hike to Haiti Project, and our efforts for COVID Relief. We want to do more. We want to use this platform to do the most we can. The team as individuals has also decided to donate the remainder of our social funds to the Equal Justice Initiative, the Legal Defense Fund, and Black Owned Businesses damaged in the past weeks. Please let us know what else you think Princeton Rugby can do and how we can use our platform to assist in the fight against the perpetuation of racism in America as well as in the sport of rugby. Always forward. #bettertogether Hyperlink in bio! https://www.gofundme.com/f/ivy-league-rugby-fund?fbclid=IwAR0nglLfyK0WZp...
