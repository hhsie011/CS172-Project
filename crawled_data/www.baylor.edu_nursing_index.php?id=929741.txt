A U.S. Fulbright Faculty Scholar, Dr. Hastings-Tolsma spent 2012-13 in South Africa, teaching and conducting research with colleagues at the University of Johannesburg where she continues collaboration as a Visiting Professor (2014-17; 2017-20). Dr. Hastings-Tolsma's research examines nurse midwifery outcomes with an interest in midwifery care practices during labor and birth and maternal-infant outcomes. This work is being collaboratively conducted with colleagues from the University of Johannesburg. Dr. Hastings-Tolsma is also working with U.S. colleagues to examine cervical remodeling for parturition. An interdisciplinary team is working to identify mechanisms underlying the onset of labor by examining metabolomic and microbiota data at term and other less desirable endpoints in varied populations. She has particular interest in study of novel interventions influencing cervical change across gestation and with the onset of labor, such as with use of rubus ideaus. This botanical - with potent antioxidant properties, influences parturition when used during pregnancy though the mechanism of action is unknown. Dr. Hastings-Tolsma has published on best nurse midwifery practices, perineal trauma, and various safe and efficacious methods for promoting pre-induction favorability of the cervix, among other areas. She has also published on the nature and scope of midwifery practice following workforce studies, and has written on research methods, including a nursing research textbook.
