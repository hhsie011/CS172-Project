The student's consent should be obtained before submitting the request. Curriculum change requests will go through a series of checks and approvals before being routed to the Office of the Registrar for processing, and students will receive an email confirming the change request details.

If you must use Internet Explorer, please contact tech-registrar@okstate.edu for the appropriate browser settings to ensure the system works properly. Student Emails from Online Major Change The student will receive two emails from the Online Major Change application during the process. The Online Major Change application will send an email to the student at the point an initial request is submitted on their behalf to let the student know the major change process has been started. This email also provides the student with the opportunity to review the change and contact their advisor if there is any discrepancy. The student will also receive an email at the point all approvals are received and the Registrar’s office completes the major changes in Banner. This email message lets the student know the process is complete and they can confirm the changes in their Student Profile. Access to the Online Major Change Application Access to the Online Major Change Application for advisors is automatically granted based on the Academic Advisor Query security group in Banner. As an advisor, you will find the link to access the new Online Curriculum/Major Change system under the Advisor tab of the portal as well as in the menu of the student profile. You can find additional information for requesting Banner Access on our website here. College Coordinators, Athletics and University College Advising are special roles within the application that are set up by the Registrar’s office. Additional questions on this access should directed to tech-registrar@okstate.edu. Menu Items Submit New Request – Use this menu item to create a new major change request for a student.

Changes to the primary advisor in Banner made after the initial request is submitted will not update in the major change request application. However, it is also important to note the Online Major Change application will not update the student’s advisor either thus advisor changes should not be included in an Online Major Change request as they will not be processed.
