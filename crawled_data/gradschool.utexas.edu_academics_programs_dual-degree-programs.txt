In programs leading to two master’s degrees, the degrees are awarded simultaneously. To enter a dual degree program, the student must first be accepted by both of the individual programs before admission can be granted to the dual degree program. Applicants to dual degree programs should observe the application deadlines of both programs. Applicants to dual degree programs—or to more than one graduate program—will pay only the higher of the application fees. Contact the admission coordinator, graduate adviser or graduate coordinator in each individual program before submitting the application for admission.
