Contact UW-IT About UW-IT Clearing your browser’s cache All browsers have a space called a cache where they keep copies of recently viewed graphics, pages, and scripts. By keeping local copies of files likely to be needed again, the cache helps your pages load faster. Sometimes, when you want the very latest files from their original site, those local files in the cache get in the way and it becomes necessary to clear your browser’s cache. Your browser also accumulates cookies, small pieces of data from the sites you visit that help the site recognize you as someone who has been there before. You also may want to delete your cookies sometimes. In most browsers, you can invoke the menu for clearing the cache and deleting cookies by pressing Ctrl-Shift-Delete (Windows) or Command-Shift-Delete (Mac). If that does not work for your browser, go to the vendor’s instructions for your browser listed below.
