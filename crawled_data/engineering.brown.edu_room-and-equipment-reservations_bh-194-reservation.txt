Capacity: 16 people Equipment: Barus and Holley Room 194 includes a projector, screen, and whiteboard. Procedures: To request a reservation of Room 194 for a single event, please fill in the information requested on the Reservation Form. Confirmation is subject to change based on the scheduling guidelines outlined below. If you have any questions, please email soe-reservations@brown.edu. Rules/Restrictions No food or drinks are allowed in Room 194. Scheduling Guidelines: As a first step in minimizing scheduling conflicts, users of Room 194 are asked to book only for those times for which there is a very high likelihood that the planned activity will take place and to release the scheduled time as soon as it is known that a scheduled activity will not take place. Secondly, users reserving Room 194 should also understand that there may be times when they will be asked to reschedule or relocate their activity because the room is needed for another activity that is regarded as having higher priority. If scheduling conflicts arise that cannot readily be resolved to the satisfaction of the users involved, then these conflicts will be referred to the Dean of Engineering who, in consultation with the chairs of the departments with competing claims, will make the final decision.
