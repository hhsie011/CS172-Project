Everybody struggles with something. I wish more than anything that I could tell my former self, ‘Breathe. It’s going to be ok.’ But as weird as it is, I’m thankful for the challenges I faced, and I think I’m the person I am today because of them.” - Jordan Richards Graphic design major Technologies Within the Bartlett Center for the Visual Arts, students have 24-hour access to two design studios and three computer lab spaces, enhancing their education with cutting-edge technology.
