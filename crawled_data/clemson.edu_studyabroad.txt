These programs have been opened for application based on the curriculum, health, safety, and student support measures offered on site. At this time, participation in these programs cannot be guaranteed, however, the Pam Hendrix Center for Education Abroad will be constantly monitoring the covid-19 rates and responses of these host locations and programs. We advise that students consult with their academic advisor on a back-up plan, and educate themselves on the covid-19 rates at the program destination and the safety protocols being implemented by their program and local authorities. Our office will remain in communication with you throughout the semester to update you on any changes to your program, Clemson’s International Travel Directive, or CDC and US Department of State travel advisories and recommendations.
