All students are expected to acquire a basic background in the behavioral sciences and to master a broad base of knowledge of human development in the context of family and society.

Students may also become involved in research or demonstration projects in the Family Life Development Center (child maltreatment and families under stress) and the Bronfenbrenner Life Course Center (adulthood and aging).
