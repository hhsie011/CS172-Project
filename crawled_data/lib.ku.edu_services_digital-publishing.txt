Digital Publishing Systems & Services We support a variety of software platforms to publish content in different formats, and can assist with moving traditional print journal and monograph content to an online environment, as well as with publishing "born-digital" scholarship designed specifically for online publication. We also offer tools to help manage and streamline the production and editorial work involved in producing scholarly journals. KU ScholarWorks is a digital repository for scholarly work created by the faculty, staff and students of the University of Kansas. KU ScholarWorks makes important research available to a wider audience and helps assure its long-term preservation. Journals@KU supports the publication of scholarly journals online, and assists journal editors with the management, editorial work, and production work involved in producing scholarly journals. Our online guide, Resources for Editors of Scholarly Journals, is a good starting point for those who are considering starting a journal or who are looking for information about managing an existing journal. Our journal services are built on the Open Journal Systems (OJS) journal management software designed to facilitate online peer-reviewed publishing.
