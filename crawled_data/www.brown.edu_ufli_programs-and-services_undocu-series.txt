The series, therefore, acknowledges the existence of multiple undocumented narratives by amplifying the voices and work of those who are often further marginalized within their own communities and excluded from the dominant discourse surrounding (im)migration. Through public lectures, performances, and workshops, the series provides opportunities for participants to reimagine dignity, joy, and liberation across various social movements.
