May 16, 2022 // Posted In Academics, Alumni, Photo Galleries, Student life, Videos More than 3,000 new Baylor alumni crossed the Ferrell Center stage over the weekend as Baylor celebrated Commencement for the Class of 2022! If you missed out — or you just want to watch your graduate’s big moment again — complete video of all four ceremonies is archived on both the Baylor Facebook page (Fri. morning, afternoon, Sat. morning, afternoon) and the Baylor website. Baylor social media was on top of the whole weekend, from sharing graduates’ senior portraits and covering Baylor’s Kente ceremony to talking to grads about where they’re going next and celebrating with photos from the weekend.

Update your alumni contact information so that wherever your future takes you, you’ll know what’s going on with your alma mater and can connect with fellow grads. If you don’t already, follow Baylor on social media to watch how your alma mater grows and develops. And finally, even as your friends scatter all over the world, make an effort to get together on a regular basis. Maybe that’s for Baylor Homecoming, a group vacation, or just weekly game night — but keep those friendships going. College is a special time, and you likely won’t ever again have this much time available to build such deep friendships. Best of luck, new Baylor graduates. Or, as we Bears say: Sic ’em, #BU22!
