Following acceptance by IRHA, the proposed rates are presented for approval to the Board of Regents, State of Iowa at their February/March meeting; final approval is made at the April/May meetings. Prior to the time that rates are approved, posted rates are for illustrative purposes only and are subject to change. After initial approval, the Board reserves the right to change rates during the term of the contract by giving 30 days advance notice. If rates increase during the term of the contract, an e-mail notice will be sent to all impacted residents informing them of the change. Residents have 20 days from the date of notification to cancel their contracts without penalty. Once rates are approved, the “proposed” language will be removed from this website.
