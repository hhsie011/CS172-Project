The Center is an energetic generator, synthesizer, and supporter of rigorous and accessible research, scholarship, education, performance, and art that helps build greater understanding and a more equitable world. "Respect for diversity is a fundamental pillar in the eradication of racism, xenophobia, and intolerance." — Rigoberta Menchu “ At the heart of the possibility for creating a just world lies the quality and depth of our understanding about the histories and present-day formations of race, ethnicity and indigenous communities. ” Tricia Rose Chancellor's Professor of Africana Studies, Director of the Center for the Study of Race and Ethnicity in America CSREA fosters creative approaches to entrenched problems such as social inequality, police profiling, implicit bias, ethnic stereotyping, and immigration policies. Because race, bias, and ethnicity issues touch people from all walks of life, the Center focuses on partnering with colleagues from across many disciplines, including the sciences, economics, public health, and the arts. CSREA's signature programming is fueled by its mission to facilitate generative and transformative conversations, always with an eye toward creating a more peaceful, just, and prosperous society. In our increasingly diverse world, it is more important than ever that we engage in meaningful exchange on these critical and complex issues so that we can better prepare our students to navigate the terrain of a rapidly changing world. With investments from BrownTogether, CSREA will become a more powerful force in fueling the discovery of new modes of thinking by faculty, artists, and community leaders on the most pressing social, political, and cultural concerns in contemporary society. Increased support for CSREA's research, education, and programming will further position the Center as a preeminent contributor to the national conversation on race and ethnicity that informs pathways forward for the country.
