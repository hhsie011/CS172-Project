In 2021, the 3 finalists split a cash prize of $125,000. The contest rewards founders who are creating commercially viable ventures through breaking down an idea into a key business model hypothesis, who have tested their assumptions with customers and who have applied Customer Development/Lean Startup principles to refine the model for improved success. This is our premier annual event to identify, promote and support new companies. Every year I’m amazed at the talented student entrepreneurs who present their ventures, and I look forward to meeting this year’s applicants. - Rob Lalka, executive director of the Lepage Center Following the initial application, judges select six ventures to compete in the competition’s semi-final round. Judges then choose three finalists to pitch their business models in the final round of the competition to determine the first, second and third place prize winners who will share a cash prize. Applications for the 2022 Tulane Business Model Competition have closed. Applications for the 2023 Tulane Business Model Competition will open in November 2022.
