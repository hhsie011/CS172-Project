Students must complete upper level courses, conduct research alongside a faculty mentor, prepare a written thesis, and present their work as a seminar for the final defense. ScM Requirements A minimum of 8 tuition units are required. At least five of the required eight courses must be structured, advanced level courses in biology or the sciences. Must receive a grade of B or better, courses must be taken for a grade rather than credit/no credit. No more than three of the required eight courses are to be used for thesis research (Graduate Independent Study). Program Director endorses the student’s proposed curriculum. Must identify Brown faculty member willing to host student in lab. Students do research for the duration of the time in the Program. Student and faculty mentor select Thesis Committee. Submit final thesis, present work as a seminar and pass final oral examination by Thesis Committee. Approved ScM Courses Students may choose from any of the courses below.
