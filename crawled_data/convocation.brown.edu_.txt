We hail thee with loyal devotion And bring to thine altar our off’ring of praise; Our hearts swell within us with joyful emotion As the name of Old Brown in loud chorus we raise. The happiest moments of youth’s fleeting hours We’ve passed ’neath the shade of these time-honored walls; And sorrows as transient as April’s brief showers Have clouded our life in Brunonia’s halls.
