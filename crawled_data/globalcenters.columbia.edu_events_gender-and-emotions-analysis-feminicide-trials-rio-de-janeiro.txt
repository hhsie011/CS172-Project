Its purpose is, from the analyzes of a public jury of femicide in Rio de Janeiro, in 2019, to analyze how different notions of gender and emotions permeate the speeches of both the defendant’s defense and the accusation. This paper aims to contribute to studies on violence against women focusing on the analysis of the role of emotions mobilized by the actors involved. The article discusses the place of emotions in the debate on violence and state, as opposed to the idea that emotions would be present only in the private sphere (or that it could be separated from the public sphere). It also seeks to reflect on the mutual construction of gender and state and the role of violence in this process. Bio: I’m a Phd student at the Museu Nacional from the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro and a visiting scholar at the anthropology department at Columbia University. I work with gender and sexuality and my dissertation is about gender and domestic violence in Rio de Janeiro, where I did my field work during at the feminicide trials during the years of 2017, 2018 and up to June 2019. My undergrad major is in social sciences also at UFRJ and my master is in public health at the Universidade Estadual do Rio de Janeiro, where I worked at the Centro Latinoamericano de Sexualidade e Direitos Humanos.
