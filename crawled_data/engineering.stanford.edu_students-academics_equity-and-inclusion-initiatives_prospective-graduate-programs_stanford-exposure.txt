The visit includes introductions to faculty, students, research labs, and campus life, as well as workshops on application preparation. SERGE gives prospective graduate students the opportunity to learn about finding and conducting research, as well as a better understanding of the day-to-day realities of doctoral student life. Through workshops and application prep, participants can take actionable steps toward pursuing an advanced degree. Competitive rising juniors and seniors from public and private accredited colleges and universities who show great potential in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) are encouraged to apply! For the 2021 offering of SERGE, funds provided by a generous gift from the Minority Television Project allow us to expand this program and improve the support for program activities. MTP is also generously providing scholarships for MS student applicants who are African American or of African descent. All students considering participation in the SERGE program should also consider applying to the Wade Scholarship Program. Program Details Selected scholars will gain exposure to life as a graduate student at Stanford University through laboratory tours as well as student and faculty engagements. Academic workshops and panels during the visit will help prepare scholars to apply to Stanford University, other top-tier graduate programs, and fellowship programs. Due to the COVID-19 guidelines for Stanford campus, SERGE will be held remotely this year. All associated materials and details will be sent to participating students. Program Dates: October 14- 15, 2021 (Over Zoom) Apply Here! Questions? Check out our Frequently Asked Questions, or email us at sergeprogram@stanford.edu for more information!
