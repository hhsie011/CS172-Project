Financial need is not a factor. Only expenses directly related to the legal adoption of a child are valid. This plan cannot be used to cover adoption of your spouse's/partner's child. To find out more or to get an application, please email childcare_scholarships@harvard.edu. Harvard’s Employee Assistance Program also offers a collection of adoption information and resources.

Others may wish to add a "waiting child"—including a relative's or partner's—to their family. In increasing numbers, gay couples and single adults are turning to adoption as a way to fulfill the dream of raising a child.
