Human-caused global climate change is first and foremost a problem of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Scientists predict that the world’s current emissions trajectory, absent a rapid switch to renewable electricity and elimination of fossil fuel combustion by mid-century, will almost certainly result in global average temperatures that will have devastating effects on the environment and society. The consequences will be severe even assuming middle-of-the-road emissions scenarios that result in 2-3°C (3.6 - 5.4°F) global average temperature increase. To have a reasonable chance of averting catastrophic climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) asserts that global emissions of greenhouse gases must peak now, and reach zero by midcentury (around the year 2050). To this end, Brown has identified aggressive GHG emissions reduction goals as a primary focus to align efforts with the IPCC. Brown’s new emissions goal, approved in 2019, is to reach net-zero emissions by 2040 with an interim goal of reducing emissions by 75% by 2025 from a baseline of 2018. Decarbonization Plan In 2019, Brown committed to eliminating our campus GHG emissions on a timeframe aligned with the 2050 target established by international scientific consensus. Brown pledged that campus emissions (Scopes 1 + 2) will reach net-zero by 2040, with a 75% reduction by 2025 relative to the fiscal year 2018 baseline. This effort is likely to cost the university around $200 million over that time, and as such represents Brown’s largest ever investment in sustainability. It’s indicative of Brown’s belief, based on scientific consensus, that climate change is the greatest threat to sustainability in the 21st century. In order to meet these goals, the University has identified a net-zero roadmap and financial plan that focuses on investing in renewable energy, retrofitting our campus buildings and central heat plant, and ensuring all renovations and new construction are net-zero or net-zero ready. Energy Conservation Initiative Brown’s Energy Conservation Initiative has resulted in significant financial, energy and emissions savings.
