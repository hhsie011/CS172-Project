History of Inclusive Public Safety In 2020, Columbia’s Working Group on Inclusive Public Safety began its work, focusing on creating an inclusive and equitable campus community. As an extension of Columbia's work to fulfill its commitment on anti-racism, the group’s charge was to recommend concrete strategies for ensuring we have inclusive safety for all on Columbia’s campuses. The working group was comprised of students, staff and faculty from both the Morningside and Medical Center campuses who collaborated with leadership from the Department of Public Safety. Throughout Fall 2020, the working group diligently engaged the community, examined existing trainings and practices, and made recommendations, shared in a December 2020 Report. To learn more about the group, read the initial announcement.
