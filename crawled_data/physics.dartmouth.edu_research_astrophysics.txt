Keck Observatory Share Astrophysics Dartmouth's research in astrophysics is carried out by Professors Brian Chaboyer, Robert Fesen, Ryan Hickox, Elisabeth Newton, and John Thorstensen. Professor Chaboyer is mainly a theorist, and the other five astronomers are primarily observers at radio, optical, infrared, X-ray and gamma-ray wavelengths. Including adjunct faculty, long-term visitors, postdocs, and graduate students, we have a strong research group focused on a variety of fundamental questions about the Universe. Research in astrophysics Research areas in astrophysics include the following: Theoretical models of stellar evolution; globular clusters, helio and astro-seismology, and galaxy formation (Brian Chaboyer). Infrared, optical, UV and X-ray studies of supernovae and supernova remnants (Robert Fesen - emeritus). The cosmological evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes, through X-ray, optical, and infrared observations (Ryan Hickox). Spin-down and the magnetic dynamo in low mass stars through spectroscopy and photometry; the evolution of hot, gaseous exoplanets using transit and radial velocity observations (Elisabeth Newton). Optical studies of close binary stars; spectroscopic studies of cataclysmic variable stars (John Thorstensen). Dartmouth's major ground-based facility is the 11m Southern African Large Telescope in Sutherland, South Africa, which is used remotely via queue scheduling. Our other observing facilities are located at the MDM Observatory situation on Kitt Peak located 50 miles southwest of Tucson Arizona. MDM is operated jointly by Dartmouth, the University of Michigan, Ohio State University, Ohio University, and Columbia University. MDM has 2.4-m and 1.3-m telescopes and a suite of state-of-the-art optical and infrared instruments. For teaching purposes, the Department has one 12 inch and one 14 inch Meade. These telescopes are located on the roof of Wilder Laboratory. In addition to SALT and MDM, Dartmouth astronomers, faculty, and students make use of many more of the world's leading space- and ground-based observational facilities, including the Hubble, Spitzer, Herschel, and TESS space observatories, Chandra, XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and Suzaku X-ray satellites, the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer, W.M. Keck Observatory, MMT Observatory, and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, as well as being involved in the planning of upcoming and proposed missions including NASA's Lynx X-ray mission concept.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Physics and Astronomy Undergraduate Overview Information for New Students Physics Major Astronomy Major Engineering Physics Major Undergraduate Awards Honors Recent Senior Theses Undergraduate Requirements Physics and Astronomy Course Offerings Physics Society Student Research Opportunities Careers in Physics and Astronomy Astronomy and Your Career Undergraduate Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Graduate Overview Graduate Awards Apply Financial Aid Degree Requirements Courses Recent PhD Graduates Graduate Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Foreign Study Overview Astronomy FSP in South Africa Research Overview All Projects Astrophysics Current Projects Particles, Fields, Gravitation, and Cosmology Current Projects Gravitational Quantum Physics Quantum and Condensed Matter Current Projects Plasma and Space Physics Current Projects Resources Overview Weather Archive News & Events News & Events Colloquia Physics and Astronomy Colloquia Colloquium Archives (before 2017) Symposiums Symposium on Charles Young's 1869 Discovery of Coronium Jay Lawrence Symposium Archive Pressure of Light Symposium Public Lecture Archives Public Observing People Faculty & Staff Students Alumni Advisory Board Membership Directory Committee Assignments Department Chair Diversity Statement Graduate Advisor Undergraduate Advisor My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
