Semester of Travel: Fall (September - December) Deadline to apply for funding around September 15th Semester of Travel: Spring (January - April) Deadline to apply for funding around February 1st Semester of Travel: Summer (May - August) Deadline to apply for funding around May 1st Students are typically provided funding for up to three conferences per year. You can apply for travel funding even if you are only attending the conference and not presenting research. Funding amount is based upon whether a student is presenting research and the number of student applications per semester. We encourage students to apply for outside travel funding if possible and specify this on their application. GSCC Travel Funds Guidelines Student Government Association Travel Funding The Student Government Association (SGA) is an additional source of potential funding for student travel to professional conferences. Students can receive a maximum of one such award per fiscal year. See the SGA Web page for additional guidelines at https://www.memphis.edu/sga/travel Deadlines are not posted other than that there shall be no retroactive funding. Note that the SGA does not meet in the summer. Thus, if you plan on traveling in the summer, be sure to submit your application the preceding spring semester. College of Arts and Sciences Travel Enrichment Fund A limited number of student travel awards are made available each term through the College of Arts and Sciences. One advantage of this type of award is that you are not required to be making an academic presentation at the proposed meeting to be eligible for an award. Note that deadlines for this type of award fall one semester prior to the proposed travel.
