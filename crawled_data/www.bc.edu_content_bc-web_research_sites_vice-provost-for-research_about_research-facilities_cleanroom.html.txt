Why BCISCRNF State of the art facility and equipment Perfect for small start-up companies and colleges Easy set-up for new users Cost effective/affordable rates One-on-one training Laboratory + - Standard Operating Procedures STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES New users must run equipment at least 3 times during daytime operation (9-5). Where applicable, reserve equipment before use. Use equipment only as it is intended to be used. Report any problems to a staff member. Orientation and Training ORIENTATION & TRAINING Before orientation, Non-BC users must complete the Facilities Use Agreement for External Users. Boston College users must complete the Authorization Request form. After approval, new users must undergo a training and orientation program before use of the facility. Please contact Steve Shepard to schedule a time for training. Billing BILLING Non-BC Users must complete and submit this PO form. Please note that Boston College’s terms are NET 30. All facility invoices must be paid within 30 days of invoice date. Invoices that are past due over 60 days will result in suspension of user access until all outstanding invoices are paid in full. Gowning GOWNING Gowning must take place from the top down. Users are required to put on their cap, hood, suit, boots, and gloves in that order. Buddy System BUDDY SYSTEM For safety reasons, we ask that users utilize the buddy system when working in the lab. When performing potentially hazardous/dangerous operations always make sure someone is in the laboratory with you. When a user is only in the lab observing—as part of the buddy system—that user will not be charged clean room usage fee. Cancellation Policy CANCELLATION POLICY The Integrated Sciences Cleanroom and Nanofabrication Facility has a 24-hour cancellation policy. Please notify the Manager at least 24 hours in advance if you can not honor your reservation. We realized that all projects require a certain process flow between tools, so one problem may throw off your entire schedule. Under these circumstances, the 24 hour cancellation policy would not apply.

A Class 1,000 cleanroom means that you would find fewer than 1,000 particles greater than 0.5 micrometer in size per square foot. A class 10,000 clean room would have fewer than 10,000 particles greater than 0.5 in size per square foot. The lab is supported by an air handling unit that completely filters and renews the air in the facility every 45 seconds. Who can use this space for research? Usage is open to Boston College faculty and students, as well as external users. You do not have to be part of the Boston College community to rent equipment in this space. How can I reserve space for usage? Contact Steve Shepard, the Nanofabrication Facility Manager and he can get you scheduled. How can I become a new user? Contact Steve Shepard, the Nanofabrication Facility Manager and he can get you started. What are the Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) requirements?

Born and raised in Massachusetts, he received a B.S. degree in Biology from Framingham State College. After college he entered the high technology industry, working 10+ years at the Raytheon Corporation- Research Division, GTE Laboratories- Research Division, and the Adams-Russell Company- Semiconductor Center. Work included semiconductor characterization, semiconductor device fabrication R & D, integrated circuit manufacturing, and facility management. Steve then moved into academia where, for 30+ years, he worked at MIT, Harvard University, and Boston College in the areas of semiconductor and superconductor micro- and nanotechnology and cleanroom management. Outside interests include early New England history, guitar, and running/racing.
