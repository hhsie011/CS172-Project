The annual Harvard Heroes program recognizes staff Harvard-wide for their outstanding workplace achievements at a ceremony hosted by the President, and attended by hundreds of family member and coworkers, held each June. In addition, employees are recognized through many local programs, each with its own special character and customs. Here's a sampling: At FAS, the Dean's Distinction program recognizes outstanding staff members each year. At HMS and the Dental School, the Dean's Community Service award recognizes individuals whose dedication and commitment to community service have made a positive impact. Visit the HMS/HSDM employee recognition page to learn more. At the Harvard Chan School of Public Health, employee recognition takes many forms, including an annual Celebration with the Stars to honor faculty and staff celebrating service milestones. At Harvard Law School, the Dean's Award for Excellence works alongside a peer-to-peer recognition program that makes it easy for co-workers to formally express appreciation for those who make a difference in their day-to-day work. At the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the Venkatesh "Venky" Narayanamurti Award for Mentoring and Community Building is given, made possible by a generous gift from the former dean and award namesake.
