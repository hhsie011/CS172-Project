Please consult with your concentration advisor to see if a paper you have written qualifies you for one of these awards. Nominations are submitted by faculty members to the Chair. Honor Society As a Political Science concentrator, you are invited to apply for membership in Pi Sigma Alpha, the National Political Science Honor Society. The requirement for membership is a G.P.A. of 3.6 in a minimum of 8 graded PS courses going into your 8th semester (with the expectation that you will complete the required 10 for a Political Science concentration). An NC in any Political Science course automatically disqualifies you from applying. Information for membership will be sent to all concentrators in the spring of your senior year. We will verify your eligibility and submit your name for membership to the National PSA. Recognition in PSA will be acknowledged at Commencement.
