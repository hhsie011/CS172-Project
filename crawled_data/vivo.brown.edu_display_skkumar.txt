While there, he co-invented a new generation of aluminum-copper-lithium alloys for aerospace cryogenic fuel tank applications. The fuel tank for the Space Shuttle launched on June 2, 1998 was built out of this family of alloys. He received the Outstanding Technical Paper Award at the First and Third International Symposia on Structural Intermetallics in 1993 and 2002, the Maryland Distinguished Young Scientist Award in 1994, participated as a member of National Academies Committee for "Alternative Technologies to Anti-Personnel Landmines" from 1999 to 2001 and was made a Fellow of ASM International in 2003. In 2015, he received the Alexander von Humboldt Research Award. Brown Affiliations Engineering Research Areas defects and deformation | electron microscopy | Intermetallics | nanocrystalline materials | refractory metals and alloys Research Research Overview Professor Kumar's research interests include experimental characterization and analysis of defects, deformation and fracture in structural metals and alloys, and intermetallic and metal-matrix composites. Current research activities focus primarily on various intermetallics, novel high-strength, high-toughness steels, nanocrystalline metals and alloys, and refractory alloys for aerospace and defense applications. Research Statement Professor Kumar's research interests include structure-property relationships in structural metals and alloys, intermetallics, metal-matrix composites, physical metallurgy, phase transformations in metallic materials, and deformation behavior. Current research activities focus primarily on intermetallic materials, nanocrystalline metals and alloys, refractory alloys of Molybdenum, and high-strength steels. Professor Kumar has researched the structure of Laves phases in Cr-based alloys and their stability as a function of temperature and composition. In this, he has collaborated with scientists from Oak Ridge National Laboratory to understand the atomic structure in the core of dislocations and how the local structure may facilitate the motion of dislocations. In the projects on nanocrystalline metals and alloys, he collaborated with faculty members at MIT to understand the deformation mechanisms in these materials by employing in-situ straining techniques in the transmission electron microscope. In the project related to Molybdenum alloys (alloys for the next generation aircraft engine components), strength and crack growth resistance in monotonic and cyclic loading over the temperature range from room temperature to 1400C have been measured and the role of the underlying microstructure on the properties were understood. In addition, dominant deformation mechanisms are being elucidated using a combination of experiments and computations. In yet another project, the basllistic penetration responses of novel high strength steels are being assessed and the evolution of microstructure in the dynamic deformation regime is being characterized using a range of state-of-the-art experimental techniques that include Focussed Ion Beam and high resolution transmission electron microscopy. These techniques enable detailed characterization of microstructure within the narrow adaibatic shear bands and provide evidence for features that were until now hypothesized. More recently he has been using new micro-mechanical testing techniques to characterize the mechanical properties of individual phases in multiphase alloys and has worked with researchers in computational mechanics to model the behavior of complex sheet steels for automotive applications; he is also examining the deformation behavior of metallic materials (shape memory alloys and MP35N) used in medical devices.

EN1480 includes physical metallurgy and processing of metals and alloys whereas EN0144 deals with the elastic and plastic response of materials. At the graduate level, EN2430 deals in detail with defromation behavior, the emphasis in this course being more on underlying theory. A substantial portion of this course is devoted to dislocation theory and a description of dislocations in specific crystal structures. This course is often taken by first and second year graduate students pursuing degrees in Materials Science and Solid Mechanics.
