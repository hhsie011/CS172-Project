The department strives to interrogate the historical meanings and dimensions of slavery, colonialism, resistance, and freedom, and to explore their implications for contemporary political, social, and cultural expressions of black identity. In addition to analyzing the impact of slavery and freedom on Black life in the Americas, we also examine the issues that continue to shape and define Black communities in the post-Civil Rights Era United States and the contemporary Africa diaspora, including: Black intra-racial dynamics, gender relations, marriage and family patterns, mixed raced identities, sexuality, expressive forms, and hip-hop culture.
