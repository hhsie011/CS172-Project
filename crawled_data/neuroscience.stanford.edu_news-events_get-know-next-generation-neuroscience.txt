To celebrate the accomplishments of our innovative trainees, we're launching a series of profiles to introduce some of our past and present scholars. How wearable tech can teach and heal with the power of touch In our first profile, get to know Caitlyn Seim, PhD, a Wu Tsai Neuro interdisciplinary postdoctoral scholar who designs wearable devices that stimulate the sense of touch. She has designed technology to teach piano and the braille alphabet and is now conducting clinical trials for devices to promote healing in stroke survivors. Read more The tip of the iceberg - Building the next generation of neural prosthetics Former Wu Tsai Neuro interdisciplinary postdoctoral scholar Sergey Stavisky discusses his passion for developing brain computer interfaces to restore speech and movement to people with paralysis, and his plans for his new laboratory at UC Davis. Read more High-throughput brain mapping – a barcode for every synapse Interdisciplinary scholar Boxuan Zhao tells us about designing new tools to create a 'blueprint' for the brain and and the surprising common ground between his passions for chemical biology, triathlon and scuba diving. Read more Secrets of brain health may be hidden in nerve cells’ insulation Interdisciplinary scholars Tal Iram and Miguel Garcia have been working to fill in gaps in neuroscience’s understanding of the development, function, and disease-impact of the brain's long-overlooked oligodendrocytes, which produce nerve-wrapping myelin. Read more Stay tuned for more profiles of our trainees to come.
