The city-state of Sparta, which played a leading role in the Greek world for centuries, attracted a great deal of attention in ancient times and continues to exercise a hold on the imagination of scholars and non-scholars alike. This course explores the birth, rise, and fall of the Spartan state, from its foundation c. 1000 BCE to 371 BCE and the disastrous defeat at Leuctra, which effectively ended Spartan hegemony. We will pay careful attention to both the relevant literary sources and to the extant remains of Spartan material culture, such as pottery and figurines; hence this course draws on the subject matter and methodologies typically associated with both history and archaeology. SOC, W. CLST 11.06 Sex, Celibacy, and the Problem of Purity: Asceticism and the Human Body in Late Antiquity Examines the changing understanding of the body, marriage, sexuality, and gender within Christianity through reading saints' lives, letters, polemical essays, and legal texts. TMV, W.

Texts include Homer, Odyssey; Remarque, The Road Back; Tim O'Brien, The Things They Carried; Kevin Powers, The Yellow Birds; Phil Klay, Redeployment. SOC, W CLST 11.17 Greek Athletics Athletics played a pivotal role in the ancient Greek world, and the history of athletics offers insight some of the basic forces shaping ancient Greek society. The topics we will cover include the origins of Greek athletics; the ancient Olympics; the reasons why the Greeks chose to compete in the nude; the connections between athletics and war, athletics and sex, and athletics and art; and the participation of women in athletics. SOC, W CLST 14 Greek History: Archaic and Classical Greece Surveys the major events in the history of ancient Greece from the emergence of Mycenaean palace culture to the end of the Peloponnesian War. During this period, the Greeks spread their culture, language, and religion throughout the Mediterranean, invented democracy, and enshrined their values in art and literature. Includes the origins, economy, institutions, and warfare of the classical city-state, the public and private lives of citizens, women, children, and slaves. SOC, W CLST 15 Alexander the Great and the Macedonian Kings Examines the history of Alexander the Great and of Greek-speaking peoples in the eastern Mediterranean during the 4th-1st centuries BCE, together with the remarkable cultural, military, political, and economic innovations of this period of history. SOC, W CLST 17 Roman History: The Republic Surveys the history of the Roman people from 753 (traditional date of the founding of Rome) to 44 B.C. (the assassination of Julius Caesar). Topics include the development of Roman law, the conquest of all lands bordering on the Mediterranean, and the civil wars that destroyed Republican government. Particular emphasis is placed on the Roman political community: the political, religious and social factors that influenced the definition of the Roman aristocracy in the fourth century, the institutions that maintained the ascendancy of the elite, the military and political values inherent in the citizenship, the social and political mechanisms that militated against civil dissent, and the role of political values in the eventual destruction of Republican government from within. SOC, W CLST 18 History of the Roman Empire: Roman Principate to Christian Empire Surveys the major events from Octavian's victory at Actium in 31 B.C. through the rule of Septimius Severus. This course considers the logic of the Roman system, including such topics as the reasoning that favored the leadership of a single individual, the evolving relationship between the princeps and the senatorial aristocracy, and the role of the army in the assimilation of non-Roman peoples. SOC, W CLST 19 Methods and Theory in Ancient History Introduces the various types of documentary evidence available to the ancient historian as well as various perspectives for framing and answering historical questions. We consider the interpretive methodologies for each type of document (coin, inscription, papyrus) as well as the particular historical context in which these documents were produced. Topics include the function of coinage and economic thinking in the ancient world and the political significance of the publication of law. The final weeks of the term allow for in-depth consideration of a specific problem in ancient history.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Classics Curriculum Overview Course Offerings by Term Fall 2021 Winter 2022 Spring 2022 Summer 2022 Fall 2022 Winter 2023 Spring 2023 2023-24 Classical Studies Courses Entry points for Classical Studies Literature, Philosophy, Religion Ancient History Classical Archaeology Language Study -- Latin Latin Classes Placement in Latin Language Study -- Ancient Greek Courses in Ancient Greek Placement in Ancient Greek Majors and Minors Classical Studies track Ancient History track Classical Archaeology track Classical Languages and Literature track Culminating Experience Foreign Study NEW Classics FSP in Spring 2022 Greece Foreign Study Program Rome Foreign Study Program Projects & Awards Classics-Related Projects and Awards Student Research Archaeological Fieldwork Reid/Wiencke Funding for Research Senior Honors Projects Awards & Prizes Faculty Media Projects Annual Lecture Programs Faculty Books Inclusivity News & Events People Our graduates Graduating with a Classics Degree Alumni Support Tell Us Your Story Alumni Stories My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
