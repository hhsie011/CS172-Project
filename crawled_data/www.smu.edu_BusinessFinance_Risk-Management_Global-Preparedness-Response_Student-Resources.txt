These programs may be faculty-led, SMU approved affiliated, or hybrid programs. If you are an undergraduate student interested in one of the many SMU study abroad programs, you can explore those programs, speak with an advisor, and complete an application by visiting the SMU Abroad website. Individual Student Travel: Conferences, Research, Engaged Learning, and Athletes Step 1: If you are attending an international conference, traveling internationally to conduct research or an engaged learning project, or competing internationally, please complete the Risk Management Travel Authorization and Registration process by going to the Terra Dotta Enterprise Travel Registry. You do not have to complete the entire profile in one sitting; be sure to save your progress and simply log back in to pick up where you left off. You might receive email reminders about your profile status if sections are left incomplete. Step 2: Once your profile is complete in Terra Dotta, the Travel Oversight Committee (TOC) will review all aspects of the trip information you submitted and will either approve or deny your travel. If it is approved, you will receive an email notification and you will be able to continue with booking your travel. If your travel is denied, you will have the opportunity to appeal based on policy 11.4. The chair of the TOC will follow up with you on the steps involved in the appeal process. Step 3: Completion and approval of your trip in the Terra Dotta Enterprise Travel Registry automatically enrolls you in the new SMU location-specific notification system for international travel known as Alert Traveler. You’re required to download the App to receive important emergency notifications from SMU and to be able to check-in during an emergency abroad.
