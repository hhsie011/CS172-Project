We will need at least three days’ notice prior to submitting samples. Please plan accordingly. Thank you. MRL welcomes a new mass spectrometer! More Information for: On Campus Users Off Campus Users The W. M. Keck Metabolomics Research Laboratory houses equipment with many different analytical platforms. Analysis of samples for external researchers is offered for a fee. After training, internal researchers may choose to analyze their own samples. Agilent gas chromatography instruments with EI and CI ionization methods Agilent GC-TOF Agilent ion-trap LC/MS instrument with ESI, APCI and APPI ionization capabilities Agilent LC-TOF mass spectrometer Agilent Triple Quadrupole mass spectrometer (QQQ) Agilent 1100 and 1260 HPLC systems with UV-DAD, fluorescence and ELSD detectors Synergy Two multi-mode microplate reader with the ability to assay optically-active molecules via luminescence, fluorescence, fluorescence polarization, and UV-Vis absorbance (monochromator-based) Bruker Solarix FT-ICR instrument, located in 101 Molecular Biology Building. FT-ICR is a high-end mass spectrometer that provides ultra-high-accuracy mass measurements to sub-ppm levels. The laboratory is now capable of providing MALDI-mass spec imaging. W. M.
