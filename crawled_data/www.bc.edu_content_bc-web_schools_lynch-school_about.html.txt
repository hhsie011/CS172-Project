We put our mission into action through teaching, research, and service—informing policy, improving practice, and preparing students to serve diverse populations in a variety of roles. Our Mission Enhancing the Human Condition We recognize that people develop and flourish across many interrelated dimensions: cognitively, emotionally, morally, socially, and spiritually. We prepare our students to transform others’ lives across each of these dimensions and at their intersections. Formative Education Initiatives Expanding the Human Imagination By providing us with new paradigms and new information, universities have the capacity to spur people to think differently, expanding our approaches to problems and potential solutions. Through education, we progress beyond conventional ways for understanding the world and discover unexpected patterns. Research in Action Academic Programs Making the World More Just As a community of scholars and practitioners, we have an obligation to help people realize their aspirations, increase access to societal opportunities, and lift up those who have fewer advantages. We engage in individuals’ lives and build social contexts that promote justice, equality, and a sense of community. Equity & Inclusion The Campus School Formative Education We define education expansively—as an opportunity to shape the future of humanity and our society. Toward that end, the Lynch School employs the Jesuit, Catholic holistic approach to student formation: educating our students as whole people so they, in turn, can empower others to prosper and lead full lives. Formative Education at LSOEHD Shaping Purposeful Lives Dean Stanton E. F. Wortham talks about how the Lynch School prepares students to lead lives of meaning and purpose.

Academics Learn more Our curriculum combines practical experiences with rigorous classroom inquiry, priming students to thrive as transformative educators and professionals. “Education understood broadly, not narrowly just as schooling, is perhaps the most important thing that society does. And it means more than just passing on knowledge or skills—we are also forming students as human beings and preparing young people to carry on our most cherished values and practices after we are gone.” Stanton E.
