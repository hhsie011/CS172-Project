This does not mean a student must enroll in the UNC System Student Health Insurance Plan, it means a student must provide proof of active, creditable health insurance. Enrolling in the UNC System Student Health Insurance Plan called Student Blue (administered by BCBS of NC) is one means to meet that requirement. A student is encouraged to compare the UNC System plan against other options, e.g., being a dependent on a parent’s health insurance plan, having an employer’s health insurance plan, having individual plan coverage through another source. Each semester the Student Health Insurance premium is added to all eligible students’ University accounts. Eligible students must enroll to activate their insurance or complete the online waiver process with their own creditable insurance coverage before the deadline each semester. Once the waiver is verified and approved, the premium will be removed from the student’s account. SEMESTER DEADLINES for WAIVE and ENROLL: FALL – SEPTEMBER 10 SPRING – JANUARY 31 A completed, verified and approved waiver is required each semester if you do not wish to participate in the UNC System Student Health Insurance Plan. Helping UNC Students and Post-Docs THRIVE through expert, patient-centered and inclusive care.
