COLLABORATION | We encourage our students and colleagues to value other perspectives, build healthy mutual relationships, and seek out opportunities to partner across differences. EMPATHY | We create a culture of care for our students and colleagues by seeking to understand their perspectives, needs, and experiences and acting with generosity and compassion. EQUITY | We identify and work to remove barriers impeding the success and wellbeing of students and colleagues and we challenge power and resource imbalances to create more just outcomes. INCLUSION | We create communities that affirm our students and colleagues by empowering them to be their full, authentic selves and encouraging open and free inquiry.
