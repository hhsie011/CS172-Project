Then, we do. Our discovery process begins with listening to our colleagues and documenting their goals and objectives. Then we analyze peer websites and conduct focus groups. Armed with this data, the team builds an Information Architecture based on site goals and crafts a content strategy to guide content development and page building efforts. Pages are meticulously planned in collaborative sessions where we map out page structure and interactively create wireframes. Everyone is hands-on. Using our rich, custom-built toolset of more than 10 templates and 35 components, we are able to build engaging pages quickly and efficiently. We relentlessly reduce page count and words on page to streamline the site visitor experience, which aids SEO and enhances site effectiveless. Continuous improvement The web is not a project, and our work never ends. We analyze data to resolve user challenges and address content gaps. And when new ideas emergy, we act: improving the toolset, building new components, enhancing usability, and adding design themes.
