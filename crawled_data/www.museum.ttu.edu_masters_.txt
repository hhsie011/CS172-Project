The Museum of Texas Tech University is unusual in its breadth with collections in anthropology, fine arts, clothing and textiles, history, natural sciences, and paleontology. These collections and the Museum's facilities become your classrooms as you work with our curators, faculty, and staff to put the theory you learn into practice. Museums are evolving and increasing in numbers. Audiences also are changing, becoming more diverse with different expectations. Our graduates have jobs in museums all over the world. You will leave the program with real world, hands on experience that has prepared you to become one of the next generation of museum leaders.
