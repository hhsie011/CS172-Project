Have questions? Check out our FAQs, pre-departure information, and safety information. You may also find it helpful to speak to a student who has recently returned from studying abroad; our global ambassadors have a fresh perspective and some great tips to prepare you for your time abroad. What Happens Now? The first and most important piece of advice we can offer is to read your email. Your study abroad advisor will be sending you a lot of vital information and reminders. It is essential that you follow their instructions and complete your post-acceptance information. There’s a lot of information about to head your way: questions about your passport, paperwork for your student visa, and reminders about post-acceptance forms. Some of the tasks ahead might seem tedious, but trust us when we say that we’re working to help you get everything done as quickly as we can – we want you to have the time of your life abroad, too! The Study Abroad Guide and Workbook can help keep you organized as you head toward your time abroad.
