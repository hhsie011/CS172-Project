Students learn both traditional techniques and cutting-edge digital practice and theory in jewelry, metals and computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM, one of several technologies pioneered for use in metals at Tyler). Students have access to the resources of Temple, a large, public research university, and Philadelphia, a premier center of jewelry making and a home base for exploring museums and galleries. Leveraging the expertise and professional networks of Tyler faculty—all practicing artists and leaders in the field—students find internships and connect with the regional and national metals and jewelry community. Tyler students graduate with a broad base of knowledge, critical thinking skills and the technological proficiency needed for success in the jewelry industry, artistic practice or top graduate schools. The proof is in the long list of Tyler MJCC alumni who are thriving at employers ranging from David Yurman to Tiffany & Co. Designed to complement the studio experience with tools to support a studio practice or pursue graduate studies, the Entrepreneurship coursework enhances students' career options. Graduates of this degree program will possess requisite business skills to support themselves as visual artists or entrepreneurs in art and related fields. Degree Requirements The Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Metals/Jewelry/CAD-CAM with Entrepreneurial Studies may be conferred upon a student by recommendation of the faculty and upon the satisfactory completion of a minimum of 126 semester hours of credit with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.00. All Metals/Jewelry/CAD-CAM with Entrepreneurial Studies majors must complete the General Education requirements. Students must earn a C- or better in ART 2401, and ART 2402 or ART 3402 to enter the Metals/Jewelry/CAD-CAM with Entrepreneurial Studies major. The required Junior/Senior studio courses and ART 4096 (capstone) must be completed with a C- or better to fulfill major requirements. The faculty encourages taking Metals/Jewelry/CAD-CAM courses in excess of the minimum required. These additional courses count towards required studio electives.

Please Note: An approved study abroad program waives the GenEd Global/World Society (GG) requirement; however, these credits must be made up with academic coursework taken outside of Tyler departments to be in compliance with BFA accreditation. BFA majors interested in studying abroad should consult with an academic advisor to determine if a semester (generally spring semester of second year) or a summer program would be the best option to remain on track for graduation.
