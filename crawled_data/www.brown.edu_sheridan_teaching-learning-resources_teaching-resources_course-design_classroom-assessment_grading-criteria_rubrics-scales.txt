As you develop your rubric, decide how many different levels it should have. For example, you may choose a rubric with three or four levels for an essay assignment, while a one-level rubric (or credit/no credit) may be useful for smaller assignments and save you time when grading. You may also consider whether to list the highest possible level of achievement first or last. Be mindful with your word choice when labeling your rating scales, especially if the grading rubric will be shared with the student. As Stevens & Levi note, “labeling the levels on the scale can be a delicate matter. We need to be clear about expectations and about failures as well as successes, yet we also try to avoid overly negative or competitive labels. These can discourage students" (pg 41).
