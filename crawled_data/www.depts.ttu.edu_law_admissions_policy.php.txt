Consistent with this mission, Texas Tech Law seeks to enhance the educational experience of all students by admitting diverse and talented applicants who bring a wide range of experiences, backgrounds, and perspectives to the Law School and the legal profession. Applicants are advised that Texas Tech Law periodically reassesses its admission policy, and therefore this policy is subject to change through appropriate TTU System processes. Application Requirements Applicants who will possess a U.S. baccalaureate degree from an accredited college or university prior to the start of the first-year orientation in August may apply for admission. To apply to Texas Tech Law, applicants must apply online via the Law School Admission Council (LSAC) website. An applicant's file will be complete and ready for review only when all of the following information has been successfully submitted to LSAC: Completed electronic application for admission Valid LSAT score(s) All post-secondary transcripts Two letters of recommendation Resume Personal statement Addenda (as required or prompted by the application) Application Review Process The Office of Admissions typically begins reviewing completed files in November and continues to review files on a rolling basis. Applicants are considered for merit-based scholarships at the time of the initial application review. Admission files are reviewed holistically. Substantial weight is placed on an applicant's highest Law School Admission Test (LSAT) score and cumulative undergraduate grade point average (GPA). While these measures of academic ability figure prominently during the review, as part of the holistic review, the Office of Admissions will evaluate other factors that may indicate academic promise or promote equity and inclusion (consistent with applicable state and federal law). Thus, when reviewing files, the Office of Admissions may consider a variety of factors, including but not limited to the following: Academic rigor of undergraduate institution and difficulty of the course of undergraduate study Other academic achievement such as graduate study Extracurricular activities Leadership experience Demonstrated commitment to community and public service Work experience and career achievements Overcoming personal or professional challenges Other diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and life experiences Two letters of recommendation Personal statement Addenda Character and Fitness Requirements In addition to a bar examination, there are character, fitness, and other qualifications for admission to the bar in every U.S. jurisdiction. Applicants are encouraged to determine the requirements for any jurisdiction in which they intend to seek admission by contacting the jurisdiction. Addresses for all relevant agencies are available through the National Conference of Bar Examiners. Texas Tech Law reserves the right to deny admission to applicants who, in the judgment of the Office of Admissions, appear to be unfit in character to engage in the study or practice of law. In this regard, applicants must fully disclose certain prior academic information and legal offenses that may reflect on character and fitness to practice law. Law schools are required to provide bar examiners in every state with an assessment of the student's character and fitness for the practice of law. This requirement includes information you provided on your law school application. Failure to fully disclose criminal proceedings or other disciplinary action can result in revocation of the admission offer, disenrollment after matriculation, or other disciplinary action such as expulsion from the law school. Furthermore, applicants have a duty to promptly advise the Office of Admissions of any changes to the disclosure information presented in the application once it has been submitted, leading up to matriculation, and post-matriculation. Non-Discrimination Policy Based upon Texas Tech OP 40.01 and AALS By-Laws, the Law School will not tolerate discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, color, ethnicity, religion, genetic information, protected veteran status, military status, national origin, sex, gender (including identity and expression), sexual orientation, age, or disability. Deferment Requests An admitted applicant can request a deferral of enrollment, and each deferral request will be considered on a case-by-case basis. All deferral requests submitted to the Office of Admissions must be made in writing with an explanatory statement. Detailed information for deferment will be provided at the time the deferral request is granted. If a deferral request is not granted, the applicant may reapply for admission in the subsequent year(s).
