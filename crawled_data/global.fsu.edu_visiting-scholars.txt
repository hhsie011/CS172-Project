Visiting scholars may come to Florida State University for set periods of time at the invitation of an FSU faculty or staff member working in their field. Visiting scholars work collaboratively with the faculty or staff member in areas of research and creative activity. These activities should be of mutual benefit to the scholar and to FSU. These activities help keep the faculty current with a wide range of innovations from around the world, build linkages for further research collaboration, enhance the reach and recognition of our university and its programs, and allow FSU students to learn about other cultures and different approaches to common challenges. If you are an FSU faculty member or staff who would like to host a visiting scholar to engage in collaborative research for a limited time please follow the steps outlined below. If you are interested in coming to FSU as a domestic or international visiting scholar, the first step is to identify a faculty member and a common research interest in which you will collaborate during your visit and who will serve as your host. You will need to contact that faculty member directly and discuss whether coming to FSU as a visiting scholar would be of mutual benefit to you and the FSU faculty member. The invitation process is initiated by the FSU host. Inviting a Visiting Scholar/Researcher Following the FSU Visiting Scholar/Researcher Policy FSU Policy 3-100 all visiting scholars/researchers, whether foreign national or U.S. persons, may only be invited to campus for more than 14 consecutive days with prior approval of department chair/director, dean, and Director of Research Compliance Programs in the Office of Research. For an overview of the changes in revised Visiting Scholar/Researcher Policy of December 2020, please see overview memo. These include items such as types of visiting scholars, time limits for visits, payments, and receipt of bench fees The steps to invite a domestic or international Visiting Scholar are listed in linked pages below: Domestic and international visiting scholars with a paid appointment from FSU Domestic and international visiting scholars not paid by FSU The Office of Research houses the RAMP portal for the initial export control review. The FSU Center for Global Engagement provides the immigration documents needed for a visiting scholar to apply for a J-1 visa. The CGE also provides orientation for visiting scholars, and immigration advising and support through-out their stay. The Office of Human Resources processes courtesy appointments required for all unpaid visiting scholars/researchers to access facilities and resources on campus. An OPS or other paid appointment is required for visiting scholars receiving payment from FSU. Visiting scholars/researchers may not begin program activity until on or after the start date on the appointment entered into OMNI or remain longer than the end date of the appointment. Faculty hosts should contact Assistant Provost Stephen McDowell for additional information and with questions about required steps. Registering Short-Term International Visitors The hosts of all international short-term guests (visits 14 days or less) must register these visits with the Office of Research Compliance Programs (ORCP), subject to the exceptions noted in the Short-Term International Visitor Registration Policy The registration form for short-term international visitors is found under the "Visitors" module at the export control portal. Extension Requests for Visiting Scholars The Visiting Scholar/ Researcher program supports limited duration collaborations and visits, and invitations are for one to two years. The time periods for different types of visiting scholars are outlined in the Visiting Scholar/Researcher Policy. Any request to extend visits beyond these periods should be sent to Assistant Provost Stephen McDowell. The request should provide an explanation of the collaborative project and the need for the extended time under the visiting scholar/researcher program. This request will be reviewed by the Visiting Scholar Oversight Committee and may require a completion of a new RAMP Export Control form with the Office of Research.
