Encryption helps protect data on tablets, laptops, and desktop PCs to prevent the loss of university data, especially from lost or stolen equipment. It is designed to make all data on a system drive unintelligible to unauthorized persons, which in turn helps meet compliance requirements. Encryption Services Email Encryption Email encryption is a secure method of transmitting information so only the intended recipient can read the contents of an encrypted email. This helps to ensure the confidentiality of the email and protects information from being stolen or accidentally accessed by unintended recipients. Please visit the the UCIT KB article for the most up to date email encrytion information. https://ituc.service-now.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0010827 Drive Encryption Full disk encryption encrypts all data on a system, including files, folders and the operating system. This is most appropriate when the physical security of the system is not assured. Examples include traveling laptops or desktops that are not in a physically secured area. Apple and Microsoft offer built-in encryption software designed to make data on a system drive unintelligible to unauthorized persons. Apple FileVault comes standard with Mac OS X and Microsoft BitLocker is included with business versions of Windows. McAfee provides Management of Native Encryption, a software component available in several data and endpoint protection suites, to manage any combination of FileVault- and BitLocker-enabled endpoints through the McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator (McAfee ePO) management console. Contact Information Security at infosec@uc.uc.edu for more informaiton or to install encyrption on a university owned machine. File and Removable Media Encryption File and removable media protection is encryption software that helps protect data stored on file shares, removable media, and cloud storage services such as Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, and Microsoft OneDrive. It uses policy-enforced, transparent encryption to prevent unauthorized access to your information across removable media, network servers, and computer hard drives. The software is available for Microsoft Windows tablets, laptops, desktop PCs and workstations, and Mac OS X endpoints.
