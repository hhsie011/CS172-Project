How does it help? For eligible students, these need-based grants reduce the need to work for pay so students are more fully able to focus on their studies. And, the best part, this aid does not need to be paid back. We award up to 500 need-based grants of $4,000 per entering class. The grant renews each year—if you continue to be eligible, you’d receive $4,000 per year. Read about our other grants and opportunities in our cost, aid and scholarships section. How to Qualify Eligibility is determined by a student’s Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA); no separate application is needed. Complete the following steps to be considered for one of 500 Fly in 4 grants. Complete the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) form. Grant recipients must meet all federal Title IV aid eligibility requirements. Students ineligible for Title IV aid are not eligible for Fly in 4 grants. Apply and commit to Temple. Sign and submit the Fly in 4 agreement, accessible via TUportal. Students receive access to the agreement once Temple receives their enrollment deposits. Once you sign up for Fly in 4, you’ll be considered for one of the 500 need-based grants awarded to new students. /costs-aid-scholarships/financial-aid-scholarships Financial aid opportunities Learn more about cost, aid and scholarships.
