S. Department of State require all J-1 Exchange Visitors and their accompanying dependents to enroll in health insurance coverage. Program participants and their dependents are required to have medical insurance coverage with the following minimum benefits [22 CFR 62.14]. Medical benefits of at least $100,000 per accident or illness Repatriation of remains in the amount of $25,000 Expenses associated with the medical evacuation of the exchange visitor to his or her home country in the amount of $50,000 A deductible not to exceed $500 per accident or illness. All J-1 scholars at Baylor must purchase Baylor's J-1 Scholar health insurance policy for themselves and all accompanying dependents. The only exceptions to this are scholars who are considered full-time Baylor employees with benefits and Fulbright Scholars whose insurance is covered by the Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. If your program is less than one year, you and your dependents are required to purchase insurance, in full, for the entire duration of your program (as indicated on your DS-2019). If your program will continue for more than one year, you may purchase insurance for the first year and renew your policy in yearly increments. These exchange visitors, and their accompanying dependents are required to purchase Baylor's J-1 health insurance policy and provide proof of purchase to International Student and Scholar Services (ISSS) 10 days before your arrival, or your SEVIS record will be terminated. If you willfully fail to maintain the insurance coverage as set forth or make a material misrepresentation to your J-1 sponsor regarding the coverage, you will be considered to be in violation of the Exchange Visitor Program regulations and will be subject to termination as an Exchange Visitor participant. It is your responsibility, not Baylor's, to obtain and maintain health insurance coverage. Willful failure to meet the insurance requirements will result in termination of the J-I program participation.
