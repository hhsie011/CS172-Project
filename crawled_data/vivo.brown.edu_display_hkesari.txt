Full Text Research Research Overview Professor Kesari's research is focused on applying the tools and techniques of Solid Mechanics to understand the deformation and failure of engineering, biological materials and structures. He studies structure-property connections - how small-scale structure in materials gives rise to effective properties at the large-scale and has investigated this structure-property and structure-phenomenon connections in a number of engineering and biological systems using tools from the field of computational and experimental mechanics.
