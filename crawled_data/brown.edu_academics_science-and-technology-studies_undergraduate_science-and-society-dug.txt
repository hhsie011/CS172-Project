The Science, Technology, and Society Departmental Undergraduate Group (DUG) exists to build a community among Science, Technology, and Society concentrators, faculty, and alumni. The DUG holds a variety of events each year, including a dinner for concentrators, a holiday party for the department, and an information session for potential concentrators. The year culminates with a Degree Day featuring alumni who represent the wide variety of career paths available to Science, Technology, and Society concentrators after graduation. All events are open to both concentrators and non-concentrators! The DUG was created in the Fall of 2012 by Aneesha Mehta '14 and Jessica Brodsky '14, and is currently led by Maya Azrieli, Acadia Rubin, Alex Seemar, and Ronald Yuan. If you have any suggestions for future DUG events or interested in attending DUG events, please email any of the current DUG leaders listed above.
