TULANE BRAIN INSTITUTE Tulane Brain Institute The Tulane Brain Institute, founded in 2016, builds upon the over 30 years of success of the Tulane Neuroscience Program. The University-wide Brain Institute was created as a transdisciplinary entity to coordinate and oversee neuroscience-related endeavors at Tulane and brings together faculty from across the University including from the Main Campus, the Health Sciences Campus, and the Tulane National Primate Research Center. The three pillars of the Tulane Brain Institute are research, education and training, and community outreach and engagement. Research at the Tulane Brain Institute is centered on the creation of neuroscience research groups or communities developed around four key research themes that are based on current and emerging research strengths of our faculty. Each research group, made up of faculty, postdocs, and students from the undergraduate to PhD levels, is supported by the Brain Institute through investment in programmatic initiatives and physical infrastructure.
