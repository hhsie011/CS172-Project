Students pursue unique educational opportunities in 60 different countries each year, and on every continent, gaining valuable experience and perspective as they prepare to work in a global marketplace. Faculty and staff routinely share their expertise with colleagues around the world, as well as facilitate student exchanges, and host colleagues from other countries in Ames. Learn more about opportunities at the Study Abroad Center. Education Program Agreements with International Institutions In support of global academic programs, Iowa State University supports a number of agreements with higher education institutions around the world to establish dual degree programs, facilitated student transfer programs and student exchanges. The process and resources to establish such agreements are outlined on the ISU Office of University Counsel website under the Education Program Agreements heading. The site includes the Education Program Agreements Instructions (DOC, 17KB), the required university templates and an updated Academic Agreement Routing Form (PDF). The Academic Agreement Routing Form must be completed with each agreement including renewals of existing agreements and new agreements.
