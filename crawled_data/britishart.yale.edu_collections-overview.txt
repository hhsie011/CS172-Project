The Center’s collections of paintings, sculpture, drawings, prints, photographs, rare books, and manuscripts present the story of British art and culture, and its global contexts, from the fifteenth century to today. Together with the Reference Library and Archives, the collections are an exceptional resource for anyone interested in British art and its histories. Paul Mellon, Founder Located in a building designed by architect Louis I. Kahn, the Center’s collections were the gift of Paul Mellon (1907–1999), a graduate of Yale College (Class of 1929). The particular strength in the collection in the art and books of the long eighteenth century reflect the taste and enthusiasms of Paul Mellon.

Kahn and a reimagined installation of the Center’s collections. Nearly four hundred works, largely the gift of the institution’s founder, Paul Mellon (Yale College, Class of 1929), and augmented by other gifts, loans, and purchases, are on display in the restored galleries on the fourth and second floor. Learn more New light on a portrait of Elihu Yale, his family, and an enslaved child A curatorial team at the Center was formed to work on a problematic eighteenth-century group portrait that depicts Yale University’s early benefactor Elihu Yale and an enslaved child of African descent. The goal of this ongoing research project, instigated by Paul Mellon Director Courtney J. Martin, is to make transparent the history of the painting in Center’s collection and the multiple ways in which it has been explored in the past.
