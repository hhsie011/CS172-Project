Students can apply for funding for anything related to student historical research connected to the Department of History (for honors thesis research funding information, please refer to the Honors Research Funding Sources section on this website). Funding is available up to $1000 but is often in the range of $200-500. A student can apply more than once but only one grant is available per research project. Applications should be for specific costs for identifiable projects and are not meant to defray general course expenses. Eligible students include history majors and minors, or any student pursuing work related to a history course taught by a regular (not affiliated) member of the history faculty. Grants can support any type of historical work pursued under the aegis of its faculty. The history department particularly welcomes the invitation to support student research on the histories of diversity, equity, inequity, justice, and injustice. To apply, simply fill out the form here. Although a formal letter of recommendation from a faculty member is not needed, applications need to list a faculty reference. Generally, this should be the faculty mentor most involved in the project. If the request is related to an independent study project (HIST 97), the student should list the independent study faculty adviser. Grant applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis. Award notifications will be sent via email within two weeks of submission of the application form. If you are an international student (not a U.S. citizen or permanent U.S. resident), please contact OVIS prior to submitting your application to make sure you are eligible to receive this type of grant under your visa. All students who receive a grant must submit a final report detailing how the grant helped them accomplish their research goals. To submit the final report, click here. The final report must be submitted by the last day of final exams in the term in which the grant was issued. Questions? Send an email to history@dartmouth.edu.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of History Undergraduate Overview History FAQs for First Year and Transfer Students How to Declare a Major or Minor in History Major Modified Major Minor Transfer Credit Policy Course Descriptions First-Year Seminars Introductory Africa, Asia, Latin America & The Caribbean (AALAC) Europe (EUR) Interregional & Comparative (INTER) United States (US) Seminars & Colloquia Independent Study & Honors Course Schedule 2021-2022 Schedule 2022-2023 Schedule 2023-2024 Schedule Course Syllabi Honors Thesis Program General Timeline Guidelines for the Class of 2022 Guidelines for the Class of 2023 Honors Theses By Year Phi Alpha Theta Honors Society Prizes After Graduation Alumni Update Research Overview Faculty Research Initiatives Dartmouth History Institute Student Research Initiatives and Resources The Dartmouth Vietnam Project History Librarian Research Funding Resources Undergraduate Research Database Student Class Projects Foreign Study News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
