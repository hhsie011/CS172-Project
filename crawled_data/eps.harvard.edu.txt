Impact Through Research EPS faculty, fellows, and students work to answer challenging questions about our world. Undergraduate Study Learning experiences outside of the classroom are an integral and exciting component of the undergraduate experience. Welcome The Earth and Planetary Sciences field encompasses a broad range of science disciplines and applications to environmental and economic endeavors. EPS students at Harvard are involved in the development and application of new tools and technologies such as space probes and sophisticated instruments, as well as field work in remote and challenging settings. In an unparalleled research environment, Faculty and students are addressing fundamental questions about our world, from prehistoric geological processes to understanding weather patterns. Featured Research Earthquake Science and Active Tectonics A simple truth is that the devastating effects of seismic events are likely to become more frequent not because of an increase in earthquakes occurrence, but rather as a consequence of human population growth, which places more people in harm’s way. Thus the societal impacts from these seismic events should not be seen as unique but rather as ever more characteristic of the challenge of living on a tectonically active planet. Our department has a particular interest in understanding how active geological processes shape the Earth’s surface, and make our planet hazardous yet habitable. Over the last twenty years, the disciplines of Earthquake Science and Active Tectonics have emerged as collaborative, quantitative and interdisciplinary fields linked by the connections between earth structure and earthquake processes....
