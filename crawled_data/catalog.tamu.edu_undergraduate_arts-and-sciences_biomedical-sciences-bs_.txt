Freshman - Admissions Transfer admissions to the Biomedical Sciences Program is administered through the Office of Admissions at Texas A&M University. Transfer Students - Admissions Biomedical Sciences is a broad field of applied biology that is directed toward understanding health and disease. This degree is offered on both the College Station campus and at the Texas A&M Higher Education Center in McAllen, TX. Our mission is to educate students who will create a healthier future for humans and animals through the medical professions, biomedical innovation and discovery, global service and outreach. The program both emphasizes versatility in the biological and medical sciences, and prioritizes a One Health approach to education through courses that emphasize the interconnectedness of animal, human, and environmental health; while bringing together students with interest in medical careers that impact all three. A highly effective counseling program assists the students with the development of an individualized approach and course package that orients and prepares the students for entry into the medical, allied health field or graduate program of their choice. Such an approach enhances their educational experiences, improves their placement in professional and graduate programs, and facilitates their entry into the biomedical science job market. Biomedical Sciences graduates enter professional programs in human medicine, veterinary medicine, dentistry, osteopathy, podiatry, optometry, and pharmacy. Some become medical technologists, physician assistants, nurses, and laboratory and research technicians. Others pursue radiation technology, hospital administration, and a wide variety of health-related fields. Many Biomedical Sciences students continue their education in graduate schools and specialize in various biology- and medicine-related disciplines. Other graduates are employed by clinical practices, industrial companies, government agencies, private foundations, public schools, colleges and certain aspects of business. Positions are available in pharmaceutical and drug marketing, research equipment manufacture and sales, food safety, biomedical research, disease control, zoonoses and epidemiology, laboratory animal care, zoo and aquatic animal supervision, health-related inspection and regulatory work. The BS in Biomedical Sciences is also awarded to students who complete the three year Early Admission Option to Professional Schools and one year of professional school.
