Universities and colleges are in a unique leadership position to help encourage and enable people of all ages—especially young adults—to adopt healthy, sustainable habits that can benefit them throughout their lives.” Texas A&M garnered the Bike Friendly University designation in 2015. Since that time, Texas A&M Transportation Services has worked to enhance their programs, policies and campus projects, such as the bike share program, the introduction of the Dutch Junction intersection and the bike registration program, for example, resulting in the upgraded Silver designation. “More than 3.8 million students now attend Bicycle Friendly Universities in 46 states and Washington, D.C.,” says BFU Director Amelia Neptune. “From large to small, urban to rural, these educational institutions are creating a powerful community of college campuses that model and support the use of bicycles for improving health, sustainability, and transportation options.” Moving forward, Texas A&M Transportation Services will have access to a variety of free tools and technical assistance from the League to become even more bicycle friendly.
