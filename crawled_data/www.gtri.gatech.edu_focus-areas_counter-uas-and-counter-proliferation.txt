ACL is committed to solving problems such as WMD pathway defeat, countering unmanned aircraft systems, countering improvised threats, applying technology to improve warfighter capabilities, and mitigating other technology-driven emerging threats. ACL leverages a strong mix of technology-focused researchers coupled with researchers who have significant operational warfighting experience. This unique blend of skillsets positions us to bring meaningful value to some of the nation’s most pressing problems. Have a question?
