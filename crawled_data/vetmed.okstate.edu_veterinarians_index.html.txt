Veterinary Medical Extension works in conjunction with their Extension colleagues throughout the state to acquaint owners of food producing and companion animals to current medical services and principles of preventive medicine. Information regarding disease problems is presented to animal owners and allied interest groups in several ways, including phone consultation, seminars, and newsletters. Group meetings on general subjects are requested by, or scheduled through, area and state extension specialists. We invite local practicing veterinarians to attend and participate in these programs. Veterinary Medical Extension strives to provide the practicing veterinarian and general public with the latest information available. Veterinary extension services are provided through the Oklahoma State Cooperative Extension. Please contact your local extension office to request assistance and/or additional information.
