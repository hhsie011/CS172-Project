A series of initiatives will take the school even further to become the best school of communication in the country. The funding priorities below, enabled by supporters of the school, will make a fantastic school even better. We invite you to learn more about these priorities below and to contact us for more information. Interactive Media Center The Koenigsberg & Nadal Interactive Media Center at the University of Miami School of Communication will serve as a multimedia collaborative workspace for students across all disciplines in the School. The Koenigsberg & Nadal Interactive Media Center will occupy the space currently known as the Reading Room, and effectively serving as the “front door” to the School in the Frances L. Wolfson Building. As part of the strategic direction for the School in “breaking down walls” and cross-training students to be proficient across a wide array of communication fields, the Koenigsberg & Nadal Interactive Media Center will bring students together to work on coursework as well as freelance projects for clients served by the School’s student-run agency. The Koenigsberg & Nadal Interactive Media Center will feature modern workstations designed to facilitate team activity, as well as state-of-the-art technology and software. Orange Umbrella The University of Miami School of Communication seeks to reestablish its student-run agency. The agency formerly known as PRADUM is a student-run, full-service agency that serves to bridge the gap between classroom and professional experience at the University. The re-established agency will be housed in the Koenigsberg & Nadal Interactive Media Center, where students will strengthen and stretch the skills they have acquired in the classroom, build their portfolios and improve campus and community relations, all while developing the skills necessary to lead and succeed beyond the classroom through real-world, hands-on experience. Students will also have the opportunity to work their way into management positions, which will provide valuable experience upon graduation. The rebirth of the student-run agency will incorporate virtually all School of Communication fields, including advertising and public relations, broadcasting production, motion pictures and digital media. Serving clients internal and external to the University, products and campaigns will yield impressive results produced by talented communication students, at prices more competitive than what can be found at local professional agencies. Greg and Mary Shepherd Experiental Learning Endowed Fund Experiential learning is critical to student success post-graduation, particularly in the field of communication. University of Miami School of Communication students benefit from internship experiences, putting into practice the skills they’ve learned in the classroom. But, the costs for participation in internships can be high, especially in cities such as New York and Los Angeles. The School of Communication Internship Scholarship Fund enables donors to support these life-changing experiences by providing financial assistance for students to pay for internship credit, living expenses and other related costs associated with pursuing internships. Technology Fund Technology is constantly changing, especially in the field of communication. For students to be successful when they enter the profession, they need to be thoroughly trained with expertise on current technology and equipment. The University of Miami School of Communication established a Technology Fund to assist with procurement and maintenance of the latest equipment necessary for all of the fields in the School. Critical support for the Technology Fund will ensure that students are proficient with state-of-the-art equipment that they will use in the workplace when they graduate. “First Feature Film” Fund Cinema students benefit from shooting school-related projects and films off-campus and in locations that best fit the stories they want to tell. The University of Miami School of Communication established a “First Feature Film” Fund to support students creating their first theatrical feature film. Grants from the fund will help offset costs in filming on location, editing and distribution for students producing their first feature film. By giving students the support and resources to make feature films, we give them the opportunity to work just like professionals. Semester in Los Angeles Program The Semester in Los Angeles program hosts a mix of graduate and advanced undergraduate students and offers a blend of classroom, experiential, and project-based learning opportunities. Students take industry-related courses not offered on the Gables campus and participate in a six-credit industry-related internship (or a series of internships). These internships are key to ensuring that students receive the necessary hands-on, experiential educational opportunities to prepare them for success beyond graduation.
