Erik Jonsson Ethics Award is named in honor of the public-spirited former mayor of Dallas. It is given to individuals who epitomize the spirit of moral leadership and public virtue. The founders of our nation foresaw that the ideal of liberty alone would not sustain our country unless accompanied by the concept of "public virtue," a sacrifice of self and resources for the public good. The Maguire Center is proud to present this award to people whose careers should be recognized, honored, and modeled. 2021 J. Erik Jonsson Ethics Award Luncheon - Cary M. Maguire 2020 J.

May Delta Gamma Lectureship In 1992, Lectureships in Values and Ethics, a Delta Gamma program sponsored by the Delta Gamma Foundation, was established by Dr. Paul Martin honoring his wife Dorothy Garrett Martin (Dotty), Eta-Akron in celebration of their 50th wedding anniversary. The initial home of the lectureship was Paul and Dotty’s alma mater and the site of Delta Gamma’s oldest active collegiate chapter, the University of Akron. Though Dorothy is deceased, the lectureships immortalized her selfless spirit and love for Delta Gamma. Today 14 campuses have established Lectureships in Values and Ethics, with 4 more in progress, and 2 others in the planning stages. These lectureships are always free of charge to collegians. University volunteers and employees, as well as, invited individuals in surrounding areas. The Delta Gamma Foundation has great pride in this unique program, which is a prime example of its mission “The Delta Gamma Foundation provides resources for educational growth and philanthropic service for all members.” DG Lectureship with Lauren Bush Lauren - September 23, 2019 DG Lectureship with Nastia Liukin - September 19, 2017 DG Lectureship with Piper Kerman - September 13, 2016 DG Lectureship with Jerry Greenfield - September 15, 2015 DG Lectureship with Larry Brown - September 30, 2014 DG Lectureship with Travis Tygart - August 27, 2013 Public Scholar Lectures From the center's earliest years, we have showcased the university's most exciting scholars in our Public Scholar lecture series.
