On the surface these actions appear to mirror those of the mainstream environmental movement. But something more is occurring. Indigenous women and Two Spirit peoples are tapping into a long-held desire to decolonize and Indigenize their relationship to the Earth. Indigenous environmental protests become places of ritual, prayer, song, dance, and even pilgrimage. Indigenous activists do not view themselves as protesters but as protectors and healers of the Earth, while working to revitalize women and Two Spirit centered religious practices.
