Baylor University is a designated sponsor of the J-1 Exchange Visitor Program which allows scholars to participate in academic research, teaching, and observation at Baylor, in official appointments such as temporary faculty, research, postdoctoral or post graduate fellows, as well as other temporary academic appointments. The J-1 visa cannot be used for ladder-track or tenured appointments. International Student and Scholar Services (ISSS) facilitates bringing Exchange Visitors to Baylor by issuing the immigration documents required for the visa application and subsequent entry into the U.S. Below is a summary of the regulations and procedures. This information is in no way complete. If you have any questions, please contact Grace Semple-Paul via email @Grace_Semple-Paul@baylor.edu or by phone at 254-710-1461. Guidelines 1. The host department at Baylor must determine that the individual has the appropriate academic credentials, as well as English Language Proficiency. For information on the English Language Proficiency Test, Click HERE. 2. The host department at Baylor or the Scholar must provide evidence of financial support (either Baylor funds or external funding) for all expenses, including additional financial support for any accompanying family member. Click HERE if the scholar will be Baylor-funded, OR click HERE if the scholar will be funded externally. 3.The Exchange Visitor and his/her accompanying family members must maintain Baylor’s health insurance policy which provides coverage for sicknesses or accidents during the entire period of stay in J-1 status. ISSS will provide the scholar with login access to request and upload documents for the DS-2019. This is the immigration document that the Scholar needs to present at the Consulate when requesting the J visa. English Language Support The Baylor Graduate School offers a free English for Academic Purposes course for all international graduate students, visiting scholars and their spouses.
