The elegant brick tower with its clock face and intricate stonework, was a gift from Paul Bajnotti in honor of his late wife, Caroline Mathilde Brown, granddaughter of Nicholas Brown, for whom the University is named. Above the entrance door, an inscription reads: “Love is as Strong as Death.” For many years, a set of carillon bells in the tower's dome would chime on the hour.
