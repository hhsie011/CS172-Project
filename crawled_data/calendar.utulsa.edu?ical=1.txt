No previous archaeological experience is necessary\, but students with an interest in history\, racial justice and/or the material remains of the past are preferred. \nThe Mapping Historical Trauma in Tulsa from 1921-2021 project will be conducting an archaeological survey in select locations within Greenwood June 13-24\, seeking to document the remains of historic structures in the district. To expand the impact of our program\, we are excited to provide free archaeological skills training to college and high school students in the greater Tulsa area. In total\, we have 15 spaces available for student volunteers. Over the course of the program\, students will learn about best practices for archaeological data recording\, field survey using high resolution GPS\, the history of Greenwood and approaches in archaeology to highlight both the documentation of anti-Black violence and Black resilience in the 20th century. Students who are unable to participate in the full program are welcome to join us for shorter portions of the research program\, but the orientation is required. Spaces are open to all but preference will be given to students from historically underrepresented groups\, those with ancestral ties to the Greenwood community and students with previous experience in archaeology. \nProject schedule \n\nJune 9-10: Virtual orientation\nJune 13: Tour of Black Wall Street\nJune 13-17: Archaeological survey field research\nJune 18: Trip to Juneteenth Festival in Greenwood\nJune 19-24: Artifact documentation and laboratory work\n\nIf you are interested in participating\, please fill out the student interest form by Friday\, May 20.

The symposium convenes scholars\, educators\, cultural workers\, Tribal Historic Preservation Officers and Cultural Resource Managers for conversations on maps and mapmaking. \nWhile maps can function to support imperial expansion\, settler colonialism and Indigenous dispossession\, maps and mapping technologies can also protect ancestral knowledge\, resist colonialism and defend Indigenous sovereignty. This virtual symposium takes Gilcrease Museum’s collection of maps from across the Americas as a jumping-off point. Over the long term\, it aims to foster collaborative relationships across many areas of practice. \nMishuana Goeman\, Ph.D. (Tonawanda Band of Seneca\, UCLA)\, and respondent Professor Norman Akers (Osage Nation\, University of Kansas) will give a keynote address. Roundtable discussions will present highlights from ongoing conversations on the history of maps and mapmaking\, Indigenous cartographies and the present-day stakes of mapmaking for Indigenous communities. These topics have been explored more fully in professional field or “stream” workshops occurring from January through May 2022. Stream leaders are Dr. Star Yellowfish\, Ph.D. (Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians)\, Matt Reed (Pawnee Nation) and Deondre Smiles\, Ph.D. (Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe\, Settler\, and Black). \nFor more about this unique event\, please visit https://gilcrease.org/helmerich-center/symposia/ \nThis virtual symposium is free to the public.
