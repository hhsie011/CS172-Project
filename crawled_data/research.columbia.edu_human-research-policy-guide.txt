As with all research procedures, the dignity of human subjects should be respected. Therefore, only what is necessary for the purpose of the study should be recorded. Research subjects must be informed prospectively that such recording will occur, and be provided with information about the storage, confidentiality, and future use of the resulting tape.

(Updated Nov/Dec 2015) Surrogate Consent Obtaining consent for research purposes from a representative of an adult subject rather than directly from the subject (“surrogate consent”) requires the prior approval of the IRB. The IRB may allow use of surrogate consent in accordance with Columbia’s policy only for subjects who lack the capacity to provide their own consent. More details on surrogate consent can be found in the Informed Consent Policy. (Updated May/June 2015) Consent Form Template for Minimal Risk Research The minimal risk consent form template was developed as a tool to facilitate the development of consent forms that include elements required by federal regulation. It is a guide but the language that is provided can and should be customized to apply to your study. You are not required to use this template or consent format, however readability and health literacy factors have been considered and incorporated into this template. Visit the IRB Protocol Resources page for the templates. (Updated Jan/Feb 2014) Radiation Risk Calculator and Consent Form Language for Radiation Risk 10 Data and Safety Monitoring Cancer Center Data Safety Monitoring Plan 11 Data Security Data Security Plans Involving the Use, Storage or Transmission of Electronic Research Data Constituting Sensitive Data This Policy provides standards for IRB review and approval of data security plans involving the storage of electronic research data constituting Sensitive Data in human subjects research conducted at Columbia University, including Columbia University Medical Center (“CUMC”), or by Columbia University researchers. The intent of this Policy is to ensure that the protection of the privacy of research subjects and the confidentiality of identifiable research data is in accord with the requirements of HHS, NIH and FDA regulations and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Superceded Policy on Data Security Plans Involving the Use, Storage or Transmission of Electronic Research Data Constituting Sensitive Data 12 Disclosure of SSNs Disclosure of Social Security Numbers Outside of Columbia for Research Purposes Disclosure of Social Security Numbers (SSNs) to entities outside of Columbia for research purposes requires authorization from institutional officials and high level security precautions, in addition to approval by the IRB. (Updated Sep/Oct 2015) Privacy and Security Agreement 13 Enrollment of Non-English Speaking Subjects Enrollment of Non-English Speaking Subjects This Policy sets forth the IRB requirements for recruitment and informed consent of human subjects who are not fluent in English (“Non-English Speaking Subjects”) in all research studies conducted by Columbia faculty, employees, and students. This Policy is intended to ensure that Non-English Speaking Subjects are (a) included in research studies with accommodations for their lack of fluency in English and (b) adequately provided with the information necessary to exercise informed consent.

These requirements are in addition to the requirements for approval of research that the IRB considers for all research involving human subjects.

The Columbia University FDA Compliance Program for FDA-regulated Human Subjects Research outlines the institutional oversight of S-I research. (Updated Jan/Feb 2016) Sponsor-Investigator Notice of IND/IDE Holder Form (click to download) Withdrawal of Subjects from FDA-Regulated Studies This guidance provides insights on how to best handle subjects who voluntarily drop-out from a clinical trial or are withdrawn from the study by the clinical investigator. It also helps to clarify FDA’s longstanding policy that data that has already been collected from subjects must be retained in the study data for the given clinical trial even if the subject voluntarily drops-out of the study. Based on the FDA’s October 2008 “Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, and IRBs – Data Retention When Subjects Withdraw from FDA-Regulated Clinical Trials”, it provides additional guidance to the Columbia University “Informed Consent Policy”.

It is recognized, however, that pregnant women, fetuses, and neonates should not be denied the benefits of participating in research. Distinction must be made between studies for which the reproductive status of the pregnant woman or the unique characteristics of fetuses and neonates are criteria for inclusion in the research, and studies for which the pregnancy status of the woman is incidental. (Updated April 2013) 26 Principal Investigator Eligibility Principal Investigator Eligibility The principal investigator normally must be an officer of instruction with a full-time appointment in the rank of professor, associate professor, assistant professor, or instructor or an officer of research with a full-time appointment as a senior research scientist/scholar or a research scientist/scholar, with certain exceptions described in the Faculty Handbook. Persons with appointments carrying other instructional or research titles, including those in a visiting or adjunct grade, may act as co-principal investigators with officers in one of the instructional or research grades cited above. However, they may not serve as the sole principal investigator without the approval of their department chair, director, dean or vice president, and the Provost. (Updated Sep/Oct 2014) 27 Protocol Violations Protocol Deviations and Violations All deviations from and violations of Columbia IRB policies or IRB determinations, including departures from the requirement for adherence to the approved protocol, must be reported to the IRB.

In many cases, such visitors are appointed as officers of research or instruction or designated as visiting scholars or visiting scientists, as set forth in the Columbia University Faculty Handbook. (Updated June 2013) 34 Skin Biopsies Guidance on Risk to Subjects from Skin Biopsies When research involves skin biopsies, sufficient information such as: description of the procedure, number of biopsies to be performed, the site and size of biopsies, the collection method, and the subject’s underlying condition, should be included in the protocol so that the IRB can evaluate its risk for the targeted population. The consent form should provide enough details about the procedures, its risks, discomforts and post-biopsy care instructions. 35 Students as Researchers Students as Researchers Policy Students as Researchers Guidance 36 Students as Subjects in Research Students as Study Subjects in Research Policy 37 Training Human Subjects Protection Training Before a protocol will be approved by a CU IRB, the PI must review the Human Subjects Protection Training course and receive a passing score of 80 or greater on the relevant exams. Research personnel other than the PI who have contact with subjects, contact with confidential study data, or are otherwise engaged in the research (i.e., key personnel) must also complete training in the protection of human subjects prior to participation in the research. Effective October 20, 2010, there is a requirement for refresher training to be completed every 3 years. In addition, all research personnel who have previously completed the CUMC Good Clinical Practices Courses or the Morningside Human Subjects Training Course must complete the CITI Human Subjects Protection Training Program no later than March 31, 2011. For more information on the Human Subjects Protection training requirements, please see the Human Subjects Protection Training Program page. (Updated Mar/Apr 2015) 38 Unanticipated Problems Reporting to the IRB of Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks This Policy sets forth Columbia's requirements for the reporting of unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others that arise in the course of conducting such research. 39 Use of Publicly Available Datasets Use of Publicly Available Datasets This guidance identifies a specific set of conditions under which research involving the analysis of de-identified data in publicly available datasets is considered to not qualify as "research" with "human subjects" (per applicable federal regulation) and therefore does not need to be submitted to the IRB for review.
