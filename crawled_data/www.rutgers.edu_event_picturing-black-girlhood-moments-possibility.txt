The Exhibition Location: Express Newark, 54 Halsey Street Newark, NJ 07102 Comprising all three main exhibition floors of Express Newark at Rutgers University-Newark, this international exhibition restages intimate Black girl coming-of-age narratives made in the reifying lens of Black women and genderqueer artists and the real-time experiences and perspectives of Black girls themselves. The images made by Black women photographers and filmmakers are placed alongside those made by Black girls. The result is a disruption of traditional art world hierarchies and a centering of Black girls as subjects, artists, and agents of their own lives. Doris Derby: Member of the Southern Media Doris Derby The event features over 180 works by over 72 Black women, girls, and genderqueer artists - ranging in age from 8 to 94 - who work in the mediums of photography and film and are exploring the concept of Black girlhood. Among the 30 artists are Carrie Mae Weems, Latoya Ruby Frazier, Lorraine O’Grady, Lola Flash, Sophia Nahli Allison, Deborah Roberts, and Tawny Chatmon. Picturing Black Girlhood: Moments of Possibility was curated by Scheherazade Tillet and Zoraida Lopez-Diago.
