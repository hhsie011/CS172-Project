Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Disability Resources Diversity Matters at UT Transition Plan Background The University of Texas at Austin is actively working to improve accessibility across campus. University stakeholders developed updates to the University’s ADA transition plan to provide a framework for achieving equal access to the University’s programs, activities, and services within a reasonable timeframe. It should be noted that as a blueprint for optimal future diversity and inclusion efforts, successful implementation depends upon a number of factors including adequate budget and personnel. This document will help University stakeholders and campus leadership prioritize investments in upgrading campus spaces and facilities to align with federal and state accessibility standards. The transition plan is considered an evolving document and progress updates will be shared annually. Access to this document requires that you authenticate with your UT EID.
