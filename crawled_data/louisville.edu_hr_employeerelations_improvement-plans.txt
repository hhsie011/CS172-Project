Performance Improvement Plan The Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) is issued by the supervisor when an employee’s performance is recognized as not meeting expectations and informal discussion has not brought resolution; or, when an employee receives a “needs improvement” on a written performance evaluation. The PIP begins with an official memorandum that is designed to facilitate constructive discussion between the supervisor and his or her staff member, with a follow up to occur at least once every 30 calendar days up to a maximum of 90 calendar days. Supervisors should write a letter, which will: Define those areas of performance to be improved with cited examples; State the level of expectation that must be performed on a consistent basis; Outline activities that will assist the employee in attaining the desired level of performance; Communicate a plan for providing feedback, with dates and times of future meetings; and, Specify consequences if performance standards are not met. **A template memorandum can be obtained from the Employee Relations and Compliance Office. A copy of the initial memorandum letter and each subsequent follow up should be sent to the Employee Relations and Compliance Office. Supervisors can track an employee’s progress and receive guidance as to next steps by utilizing the Supervisor’s Checklist. II. Attendance Improvement Plan The Attendance Improvement Plan (AIP) is an official memorandum issued by the supervisor when an employee’s reduced attendance and/or tardiness adversely affect the business needs of the department, and informal discussion has not brought resolution. Supervisors should write a letter, which will: define how the employee's absenteeism or tardiness is negatively affecting the unit; State designated work time expectations; and, Specify consequence and/or tardiness is not addressed. **A template memorandum can be obtained from the Employee Relations and Compliance Office. A copy of the initial memorandum letter and each subsequent follow up should be sent to the Employee Relations and Compliance Office. Supervisors can track an employee's progress and receive guidance as to next steps by utilizing the Supervisor's Checklist. If you have an employee who is on protected leave, such as FML, please contact the Employee Relations and Compliance Office to discuss before placing an employee on an Improvement Plan.
