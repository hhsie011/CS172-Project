As a provider of educational services, the university is increasingly reliant on digital forms of communication to conduct its business. This includes Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) covered under the American with Disabilities Act (ADA). In designing, procuring, and maintaining EIT for all members of our university community it is essential that we partner together to ensure digital spaces are as accessible as our brick and mortar spaces. This includes accessible: web, software, media, and communication.

Use existing and available tools to self-evaluate your current materials. These tools will help you determine if your documents are accessible to all of your students, inform you why the documents are not accessible, and provide instructions on how to modify your documents to provide accessibility.

Learning Management System (LMS) – a software application or Web-based technology used to plan, implement, and assess a specific learning process. Typically, a learning management system provides an instructor with a way to create and deliver content, monitor student participation, and assess student performance. A LMS may also provide students with the ability to use interactive features such as threaded discussions, video conferencing, and discussion forums.
