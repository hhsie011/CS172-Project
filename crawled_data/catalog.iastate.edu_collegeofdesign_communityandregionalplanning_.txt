Planners evaluate and seize opportunities to solve problems. Planners work at multiple levels of government, as well as the private sector, and they are concerned with issues that affect every corner of the world: the preservation and enhancement of the quality of life in a community, the protection of the environment, the promotion of equitable economic opportunities; and the management of growth and change of all kinds. Graduates of the Community and Regional Planning department are able to integrate planning knowledge and skills in a variety of practical applications, and can communicate effectively in written and oral form. Graduates will be qualified for a variety of entry-level positions in the public, private, and not-for-profit sectors. They will also be well prepared for graduate study in a variety of fields, including urban planning, law, public policy, public health, environmental science, geography, sociology, urban design, historic preservation, data science, and architecture. Graduates of the Community and Regional Planning department are expected to understand the structure and functions of urban settlements, including the history of planning and urban development and the processes for plan and policy making. Graduates should have skills in problem formulation, quantitative analysis, written/oral and graphic communications, and collaboration, and in synthesizing and applying knowledge to practice. Graduates are expected to be able to assess the impact of plans and alternatives based on principles of equity and social justice, economic welfare and efficiency, environmental sustainability, and cultural heritage in the context of citizen involvement in decision making. The department is a member of the Association of Collegiate Schools of Planning. The curriculum is accredited by the Planning Accreditation Board of the American Institute of Certified Planners. Our students gain an education that, when combined with experience, supports eligibility for membership in the American Institute of Certified Planners. The department administers two undergraduate minors: Urban Studies and Geographic Information Science (GISC). The department cooperates in the undergraduate minors in Design Studies, Digital Media, Critical Studies in Design, Environmental Studies, and Sustainability. Degree Requirements The Department of Community and Regional Planning administers the 128-credit-hour undergraduate program leading to the Bachelor of Science. Students have the opportunity to work with their faculty advisors to define their own areas of interest, which may include a minor. The BS in Community and Regional Planning program can be completed in two to four years. Students can declare a major in CRP at any time during their enrollment at Iowa State University. If applying by transfer from another program or institution, admission is based on the student's cumulative GPA and a departmental review of course work. Transfer applications from students in programs in anthropology, sociology, political science, history, geography, engineering, and other related disciplines are encouraged. Community and Regional Planning emphasizes responsibility and citizenship, writing and analytical ability, and critical thinking.
