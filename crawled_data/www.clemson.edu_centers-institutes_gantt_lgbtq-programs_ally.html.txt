Ally Training aims to increase awareness and understanding of LGBTQ issues and to train allies to stand with, and advocate for, LGBTQ people. Ally Training: Awareness and Empathy Awareness and Empathy is the beginner training for faculty, staff, and students who are interested in becoming allies to the LGBTQ+ community. In this training, participants will: Explore and understand their own social conditioning when it comes to the LGBTQ+ community Have a basic understanding of sex, sexuality, and gender Understand LGBTQ+ experiences more thoroughly Begin to explore allyship to the LGBTQ+ community For more advanced training, participants are also encouraged to go through the LGBTQ+ Action and Advocacy training to learn advanced skills on how to interrupt biased behavior, ensure LGBTQ+ inclusivity in professional settings, and continue to grow as an action-oriented ally to the LGBTQ+ community. Ally Training: Action and Advocacy Action and Advocacy Training is the portion of ally training dedicated to developing hard skills to practice allyship to the LGBTQ+ community. Though it is not necessary to complete the Awareness and Empathy ally training before attending the Action and Advocacy training, participants are expected to come into the Action and Advocacy training with a working knowledge of sex, gender, and sexuality and basic understanding of the LGBTQ+ community. If interested participants do not have this foundational knowledge, they are encouraged to attend the Awareness and Empathy training before registering for the Action and Advocacy training. Through the Action and Advocacy training, participants will: Gain a working understanding of allyship, equity, and intersectionality when it comes to the LGBTQ+ community. Learn how to interrupt homophobic and transphobic behavior Begin to assess their professional environments and highlight areas which are LGBTQ+ inclusive and areas which can be improved Registration If you are interested in learning more about the LGBTQ community and how to better serve as an Ally, we invite you to register for Ally Training.
