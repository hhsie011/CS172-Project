When a waiting list exists, a faculty or staff member must go to the Parking Services portal and place his/her name on the list. Designated affiliates will work with parking staff to add their name to a list, when appropriate. When a space becomes available in the parking facility, the first individual on that list will be notified either by phone or in writing. Individuals who do not respond within the set period of time will be removed from the list. It is the responsibility of the individual to update contact information on file. The university reserves the right to move individuals outside of the waitlist policy when it is in the best interest of the university. Approval for exceptions will be made by the vice president responsible for parking services.
