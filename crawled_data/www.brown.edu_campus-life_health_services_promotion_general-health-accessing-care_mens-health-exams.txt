Several professional groups including the National Academy of Sciences, the American Medical Association and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, have determined that routine annual physicals for healthy adults are unnecessary. Rather, healthy people are better served by seeing medical providers for specific age and risk-related screening tests, designed to detect medical conditions that are treatable when discovered early. What screening tests do I need? For healthy people under age 40, the current guidelines recommend the following: Testicular exam by a medical provider every 1 to 2 years. Testicular cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer in men age 18 to 35. Testicular self exam every month Blood pressure screening every 2 years Blood test for cholesterol every 5 years Please note that these guidelines are intended for people without symptoms. Specific risk factors or your previous history may lead your medical provider to request testing and visits at more frequent intervals. Who performs the screening tests? You can request a specific medical provider at Health Services by name or by gender. How much do the screening tests cost? These screenings are free for all Brown students as part of your Health Services fee. Who will see the results? All of your medical records are confidential by state law. Health Services cannot release any of your medical information to anyone-including your parents or any other department at Brown-without your written consent. There are a very few exceptions when information is required to be released without your written consent in the cases of emergencies or when required by law. Your medical provider will address any concerns you have during your visit. What can I do to keep myself healthy? If you are sexually active, use condoms and get tested for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). If you have sex with women, understand the risks of pregnancy and the contraceptive options that are available. Be an active partner in pregnancy prevention and STI prevention. Begin healthy eating habits now to reduce your risk of heart disease and prostate cancer. Limit your consumption of alcohol and other drugs. If you smoke cigarettes or chew tobacco, click here for information on how to quit or cut down. Practice monthly testicular self-exams to detect testicular cancer. Recognize the importance of support. Everyone's well-being depends on a supportive network of family and friends. Asking for help from those people and from resources at Brown is a sign of strength. What else does Health Services have to offer? Dermatology appointments Appointments with the Health Services nutritionist. Pharmacy services, including over-the-counter medications that are cheaper than local pharmacies. Confidential STI testing Condoms and dental dams are available in the bathrooms on the 1st and 3rd floors of Health Services. FC2 condoms, non-latex condoms and lube can be purchased at Health Promotion, Room 310. Allergy injections and immunizations What if I have a form that I need completed and it requires a general physical exam? Health Services will provide routine physical exams if you need a form completed for a sports team, travel abroad, pre-employment requirements or any other reason.
