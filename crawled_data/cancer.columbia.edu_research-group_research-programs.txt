The HICCC has four formal research programs that organize our membership: Cancer Genomics and Epigenomics The Cancer Genomics and Epigenomics Program at HICCC studies the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that control genome stability, drive genome rearrangements, and promote mutations in cancer cells. Cancer Genomics and Epigenomics Cancer Population Science The Cancer Population Science Program conducts observational and interventional studies that focus on prevention, early detection, health outcomes and cancer care delivery to diverse communities. Cancer Population Science Precision Oncology and Systems Biology The Precision Oncology and Systems Biology Program leverages a model-based view of cancer biology to embrace the complexity of cancer mechanisms. Precision Oncology and Systems Biology Tumor Biology and Microenvironment The Tumor Biology & Microenvironment Program aims to understand the immunological, stromal, and cell-intrinsic mechanisms that regulate tumor initiation and cancer progression.
