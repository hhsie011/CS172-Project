By 2050, they will house about 70 percent of all people. Princeton engineers bring together expertise in the environment, infrastructure, climate, data science, sensors, privacy, security, public policy, and many other fields to make cities, towns and suburbs resilient and enjoyable places for people to flourish sustainably.
