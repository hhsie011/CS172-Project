The combination of artificial intelligence and biotechnology will enable us to efficiently manage our health and cure diseases, and even reshape life as we know and meet up with the huge demand for health, longevity, youth and beauty. How should human beings act when they face this? This requires experts from all concerned fields to come and think together. The Xiong'An International Health Forum, also referred to as the “Xiong'An Forum”, co-founded by the Shenzhen World Health Foundation, China Association of Chinese Medicine, and China Institute of Strategy and Management, has received recognition and strong support from the People's Government of Hebei Province and the Administrative Committee of Xiong'An New Area. The Forum also has powerful support from UNICEF, Columbia University, Columbia Global Centers | Beijing, the Kofi Annan Foundation, the Hebei Provincial Development and Reform Commission and the Hebei Provincial Health and Family Planning Commission. It will be a summit, cross-sector and international forum for world health. The forum will be held biannually as a platform for summit-level dialogues and opinion exchanges among top professionals and experts from medical sciences, global health-relating industries, finance and concerned research institutions. The purpose is to analyse development trends, give policy suggestions, explore the industrial regulations and criteria, build cross-sector connections, accelerate pragmatic cooperation throughout the global health chain, and promote the full implementation of the UN 2030 agenda. All of these are aiming at the benefits of people. The Xiong'An Forum will make efforts to be a global independent influential force for global health based on the potential advantages of the Xiong'An New Area.
