Register INTENTIONAL JOURNALING FOR ANXIETY & STRESS RELIEF Tue., Jun. 21-Jul. 5, 6-8 pm / $129 / Three Classes Journal included in class fee ($45 value). Instructor: Julie Barlow In-person at VPC Campus Research has found journaling can boost your mood and sense of well-being, as well as reduce the impacts of stress and symptoms of depression. However, it is important to use appropriate methods for journaling to be effective and helpful. In this course we will explore different journaling techniques for handling feelings of inadequacy, lack of clarity, overwhelm, anxiety, and tackling life's more challenging issues in general. We will say hello to our inner critic, get clarity through alignment of actions with values, and use journaling prompts to understand the real roots of the stress in our lives. Included with this course is the summer issue of the JMB Living Journal. Well wrap up the course with a vision boarding session to get our summer off to an empowering start. Julie Barlow Julie is the founder of JMB Living and co-founder of Travel to Transform International Yoga Alliance. She has trained in multiple personal consciousness courses; practicing yoga, meditation, and mindfulness for over 20 years.
