This talk reads in and around Farrokhzad’s work, in translation and in relation to some personal family histories, as a way of thinking about diaspora, displacement, and the uses of intimate knowledge for literary criticism. Marquis Bey Wednesday, February 2, 2022 5:30pm - 7:00pm Department of English, Post-45 and Contemporary Working Group virtual event The Story of a Theory: Coming to Black and Trans Thought This talk will concern not so much a conveyance of the speaker’s theorizing in black studies, trans studies, and black feminism; rather, it will share the surrounding narrative journey of how such theorizing emerged at the personal, epistemological, and relational level. In short, this talk will tell the story of how the speaker came to think and theorize the radical nexus of blackness, black feminism, and transness. Dora Zhang lecture Monday, December 6, 2021 5:30pm - 7:00pm Department of English Zoom lecture Reading in Detail: Type and Difference in Unmarked Texts This talk examines what happens to the detail in texts that refuse certain norms of specification. My focus will be on Anne F. Garréta’s experimental novel, Sphinx (1986), and Toni Morrison’s short story “Recitatif” (1983). Drawing on Lukács’s discussion of realism and typicality, I consider the ways that these unmarked texts mediate between individual and type, as well their approaches to the representation of difference.

Yogita Goyal: “Runaway Genres: The Global Afterlives of Slavery” Tuesday, March 19, 2019 5:30pm - 7:30pm Department of English Brown/RISD Hillel Winnick Chapel, 80 Brown St. This talk tracks the emergence of slavery as the defining template through which current forms of human rights abuses are understood. To fathom forms of freedom and bondage today–from unlawful detention to sex trafficking to the refugee crisis to conscription in war–Professor Goyal shows how contemporary literature draws on the antebellum genre of the slave narrative, reinventing such key genres as sentimentalism, the gothic, satire, ventriloquism, and the bildungsroman.
