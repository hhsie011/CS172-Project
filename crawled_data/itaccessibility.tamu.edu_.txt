IT Accessibility at Texas A&M Texas A&M University is committed to making information resources developed, maintained, distributed and procured by our institution accessible to everyone, including those with disabilities. There are three simple reasons for this commitment: It's the right thing to do. It's the smart thing to do. It's the law. Incorporating accessibility into our everyday lives at Texas A&M ensures that valuable information acquired through teaching, learning and discovery is made available to the widest possible audience. To further this initiative, the Division of Information Technology accessibility team strives to educate faculty, staff and students by providing accessibility resources, training and assistance. As a campus community, accepting the responsibility for making resources accessible will serve to advance our valued tradition of diversity and inclusiveness.
