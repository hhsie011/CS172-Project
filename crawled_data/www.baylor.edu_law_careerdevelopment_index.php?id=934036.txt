As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, bar admission exams were canceled or delayed in many jurisdictions, thus making it more challenging for graduates to secure employment by the annual Graduate Employment Status Date of March 15. Please reference the 3 years of employment outcome data posted on the ABA Required Disclosures webpage of each ABA-Approved Law School or at www.abarequireddisclosures.org.

Important Factors There are several important factors you should keep in mind as you review these statistics: Baylor Law has four graduating classes each year. For any single year, the statistics include those students who earned degrees in November of the preceding year, and February, May, and July of the current year. These statistics are compiled based upon forms completed by graduating students, and based upon email and telephone contacts in cases where we have been successful in reaching the graduate to learn about his or her employment status. Not all graduates choose to report salary information, and some salary information, particularly that of smaller private employers, is not independently accessible. The percentage of graduates who do report salary information varies from year to year. The salary information contained in the attachments represents the statistical range, average, median, and percentage of those students who choose to report that information. When examining salary information, you should be mindful of the fact that it may not be based on salary information from all graduates. You should also consider the high and low ranges of reported salaries for each category of employment, in addition to the average and mean reported salaries. Baylor Law makes every effort to ensure that all employment statistics and salary information are presented in appropriate context, and are a true representation of our graduates' positioning in the legal marketplace. Please be aware that the ABA and NALP use different definitions for various categories, which may account for differences in the reports. If you have any questions about this information, please contact the Career Development Office. If you are a prospective student, we encourage you to review other resources concerning future demand in the legal marketplace, such as those produced by NALP.
