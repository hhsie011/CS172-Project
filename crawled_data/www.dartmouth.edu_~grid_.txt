As an institute GRID was a meeting ground where researchers, teachers, students, outreach professionals, and scholar-activists from across the globe came together to study, debate, and translate intellectual discussion and practical experience into projects of social justice on a multitude of local, national, and international scales. For the future GRID has been provided an avenue raising the scholarship and engagement around these special issues. The Gender Research Institute at Dartmouth would like to thank the Provosts office for their foundational and continuous support and funding of GRID's vision. Special thanks to the Dean of Faculty Office , The Montgomery Fellows Program, The John Sloan Dickey Center, The Leslie Center, The Nelson A. Rockefeller Center for Public Policy, The Hopkins Center for the Arts, and the many Departments, Programs, Faculty, Staff, Students and Upper Valley residents who supported our work along the way! With our sincerest thanks to our beloved community.

Gender Research Institute at Dartmouth Publication Gender in Times of Crisis: A Multidisciplinary Conversation Gender in Times of Crisis: A Multidisciplinary Conversation, is a special issue of the journal Humanities (http://www.mdpi.com/journal/humanities/special_issues/multidisciplinary_conversation)dedicated to feminist methodologies that highlight the productive outcomes of crisis, contradiction, and fracture. Taken together, the essays model a type of "disaggregate thinking"(Angela Davis 2011) whereby things that appear to be separate are thought together and where natural, common-sense connections are made uncomfortably less so. The essays deal with the struggles of social change in a wide array of areas that range from higher education to welfare activists, from queer gardens of memory to new models of citizenship, from gender violence to the school-to-prison pipeline, from community activism to the brutal effects of neoliberal economic policies on dignity and quality of life. These articles offer an imaginary for change that is multidimensional and based on a tense dialogue between the different axes that mold the strands of experiences that structure our lives, knowledge that crosses and questions facile identity lines, that unites and disaggregates in a contestatory and transformative fashion. The ten essays were authored by the faculty and student GRID fellows in the 2014 seminar Times of Crisis (http://www.dartmouth.edu/grid/events/2013_2014/times_of_crisis_2014.html) directed by GRID founding director Annabel Martín: Txetxu Aguado, Jennifer Fluri, Jennifer Gargano, Annabel Martín, Christine Miguel, Sara Muñoz, Allison Puglisi, Kristina Wolff, and Melissa Zeiger. Essays also include work by three of the seminar's distinguished speakers: John Berger, Nancy Fraser (print version), and Denis Goldberg. **************************************************************************************************************************************************************************** **************************************************************************************************************************************************************************** The Gender Research Institute at Dartmouth 2017 Spring Seminar Radical Unlearning: Feminist Reflections on Transgression, Humility, and Chaos Directed by Professors Ivy Schweitzer (English) and Pati Hernandez (WGSS). "Radical Unlearning" acknowledges, in the words of bell hooks, that "our ways of knowing are forged in history and relations of power." This recognition shapes social experiences, our academic approaches, and our performance of community. The seminar will facilitate critical thinking about the entanglements of power and knowledge through stimulating interactions among participants and guest speakers. **************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************** Director Annabel Martín was interviewed for Canal Europa on the importance of gender-related teaching and scholarship.
