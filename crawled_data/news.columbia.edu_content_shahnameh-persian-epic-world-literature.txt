It has profoundly shaped Persian culture, society, and politics as Iranian and Persians peaking people worldwide read, memorized, discussed, performed, adapted, and loved the poem. Hamid Dabashi, the Hagop Kevorkian Professor of Iranian Studies and Comparative Literature, traces the epic’s history, authorship, poetic significance, its complicated legacy of political uses and abuses, and enduring significance. He also considers the poem in the context of other epics, such as The Aeneid and The Odyssey, and the concept of world literature. 212-854-5573 [email protected] Genre Nonfiction Topic Literature Contact Us [email protected] Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
