As daughters, whether we like it or not, become our mothers, and their stories become our stories, as much of a part of us as having our mother’s eyes or her ear for music. As writers we sometimes write their matriarchal stories, and sometimes we transform and fictionalize our mothers into characters about whom we write, but the role our mothers played in our writing life is more significant that what happens on the page. That is, we are writers because our mothers inspired us to be writers. Inspiration comes in many guises and from myriad impulses. We will discuss the roles our mothers have played in our writing and our becoming writers under the shadows of our mothers. To attend the event, please RSVP here.
