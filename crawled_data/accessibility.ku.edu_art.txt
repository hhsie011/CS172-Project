Through this program we will highlight various artists with disabilities and showcase their work in our digital art exhibit. Artists can submit visual or performative arts ranging from creative writing, to dance, to sculpture and all things in between. Our archive of artists serves as a growing archive of artists with disabilities, their work, and their stories. Explore our page to find our artist’s biographies, their work, and panel discussions and interviews with the artists on what their work means to them and how disability intertwines in their artistic endeavors.
