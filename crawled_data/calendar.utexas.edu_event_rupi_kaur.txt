Audiences are taken on a journey of personal loss and love, growth, mental health, community, friendship, and strength. These universal themes take center stage as original music scores the show and projections immerse audiences. Performing new unpublished pieces, poems from ‘home body’ and greatest hits from her iconic books ‘milk and honey’ and ‘the sun and her flowers’ - join Rupi on her World Tour as we reconnect with each other and most importantly, ourselves.
