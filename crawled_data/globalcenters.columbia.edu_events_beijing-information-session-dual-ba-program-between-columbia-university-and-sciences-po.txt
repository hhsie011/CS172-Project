4:00 PM Columbia Global Centers | Beijing, No. 26, 1F Core Plaza, 1 Shanyuan Street, Zhongguancun, Haidian District, Beijing On October 14, Columbia Global Centers | Beijing invites you to the Beijing Information Session for the Dual BA Program between Columbia University and Sciences Po. Led by a Columbia University School of General Studies admissions representative, this small-group information session will cover important details about the Dual BA Program. About the Program The Dual BA Program Between Columbia University and Sciences Po offers a global undergraduate educational experience—a program with an international character not only in its academic coursework but also in its practical application. The Program builds upon a decade-long partnership between Sciences Po and Columbia University through the Alliance Program, a joint venture between Columbia, Sciences Po, the École Polytechnique, and the Université Paris 1 Panthéon Sorbonne that aims to develop new initiatives in the fields of education cooperation, research collaboration, and policy outreach. Students will begin their studies by spending two years at one of three Sciences Po campuses—Le Havre, Menton, or Reims—each devoted to a specific cultural focus. After two years, students will matriculate at Columbia University School of General Studies in New York City to complete the interdisciplinary social sciences curriculum. Upon successful completion of the program, students earn two bachelor's degrees in four years, one from Sciences Po and one from the Columbia University School of General Studies, and will be guaranteed admission to a graduate program at the flagship Sciences Po campus in Paris.
