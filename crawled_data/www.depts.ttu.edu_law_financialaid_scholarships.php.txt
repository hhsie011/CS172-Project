Texas Tech University Directory Raiderlink A-Z Index School of Law Menu Search TTU School of Law Financial Aid Scholarships First-Year Student Scholarships Texas Tech Law awards merit-based scholarships to incoming students. The law school uses the same factors considered in evaluating the applicant for admissions. All admitted students are automatically considered for any scholarship funds for which they are eligible. Scholarship recipients are typically notified of their awards at the time of acceptance or shortly thereafter, but awards are made on a rolling basis and notification could come at any time prior to enrollment. Advanced Student Scholarships These scholarships are available to students in their second or third year of law school and are awarded on the basis of academic performance and financial need. To apply for scholarships, please visit scholarship.app.texastech.edu. The application is open from October 1 to February 1. ABA Standard 509 Scholarship Retention Information The American Bar Association requires all law schools that offer renewable scholarships that are conditioned upon maintaining a minimum grade point average or class standing other than what is required to remain in good standing to disclose the retention rate of those scholarships. The table below does not include scholarships that required merely good standing for renewal.

For the 2018, 2019, and 2021 entering classes, all scholarships of more than $10,000 require recipients to rank in the top 50% of their class to qualify for full renewal. Please note that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Texas Tech Law did not eliminate or reduce conditional scholarships following the Spring 2020 semester. Texas Tech Law resumed reviewing conditional scholarships following the Spring 2021 semester.
