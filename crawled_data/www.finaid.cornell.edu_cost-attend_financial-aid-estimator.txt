Before entering your income and asset information, please keep in mind: The calculator is intended for undergraduate applicants living and working in the U.S. All estimated financial aid is based on demonstrated financial need; there are no merit-based awards available from Cornell. The resulting information is only as reliable as the data you provide. These are estimates only; the Office of Financial Aid and Student Employment is the final authority on your calculated family contribution. If parents are divorced, separated or were never married, both households (including stepparents) should run separate calculations and the combined results are the estimated expected family contribution. Cornell applies a proportional methodology to remarried parents.
