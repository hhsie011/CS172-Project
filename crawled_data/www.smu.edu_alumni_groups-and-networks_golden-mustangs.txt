Golden Mustangs, alumni who are celebrating more than 50 years since their SMU graduation, hold a special place on the Hilltop. Golden Mustangs gather to celebrate unique bonds, reminisce on cherished memories and learn about the future of the institution they helped shape. Golden Mustangs enjoy regular luncheons, receptions, exclusive campus tours and distinct experiences with current faculty, staff and students. They also continue to serve as advocates for SMU in a variety of ways, such as providing career advice to current students or recent alumni or sharing their expertise on a variety of boards and committees. Golden Mustangs also honor their connection to SMU in their philanthropy. Annual and planned gifts made by this special group of alumni support the work happening on the Hilltop today and for generations to come.
