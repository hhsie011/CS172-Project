The primary focus of the Initiative is on mentorship—a close, personal relationship between instructor and student—and active music-making—creating, performing, and responding to music. The Initiative enhances music opportunities for students and music educators in New Haven while simultaneously preparing students from YSM to be teaching artists. We all share this really great passion for music, which is an amazing thing to have in common.

Music educators are invited to request Teaching Artists from the Yale School of Music to support their students’ learning during the school day through the In-School Mentorship program. Music educators can also expand their students’ experiences by encouraging them to participate in the All-City Ensembles and the Morse Summer Music Academy.
