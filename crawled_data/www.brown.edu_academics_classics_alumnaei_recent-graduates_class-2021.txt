Bachelor Degree Recipients Johanna Appleton, A.B. Latin; A.B. Biology Home: Massachusetts, USA Bio: I am originally from Mattapoisett, Massachusetts, but went to high school in Portsmouth, Rhode Island. At Brown, I studied Classics (Latin) and Biology. Outside of class, I did research on maternal mental health and volunteered at the Rhode Island Free Clinic. After graduation, I am going to start work at a neuroimaging lab in Texas Medical Center. Juan (Jack) Antonio Briano, A.B. Classics; Neuroscience Home: New York, USA Achievements: Sigma Xi (2021) Hassenfeld Summer Scholar (2020) Completed an Honors Thesis in Neuroscience (2021) Sigma Xi Associate Membership Nomination (2021) Extra-Curricular Activities: Brown University Sailing Team (2017-2019) Technology House Member (2018-2021) BCJ Contributor (volumes 30 and 32) Undergraduate Research Assistant in the Morrow Lab (2019-2021) Rhode Island Free Clinic Volunteer (2020-2021) Bio: Jack came to Brown with the intention of pursuing a premedical track, while also pursuing his love of classics. He did both throughout his four years here, and will be graduating with a double concentration in Classics and Neuroscience. He greatly enjoyed both learning classical history and reading a diverse set of classical authors, but has developed a special appreciation for lyric poets such as Horace and Fortunatus. He has also enjoyed reading the works of classical playwrights, especially Plautus and Aristophanes. In addition to Latin, Jack also used his time at Brown to learn Ancient Greek, and took introductory Sumerian in his final semester. Outside of the classroom, Jack researched autism-linked genetic disorders in the Morrow lab, volunteered at the Rhode Island Free Clinic, is a member of Technology House, and is a former member of the Brown sailing team. After graduating, he will be moving to New York City to research the gut-brain axis in Parkinson's disease at Weill Cornell before applying to medical schools. Justin Chiang, A.B. Greek & Latin; Applied Mathematics Home: New York, USA Thesis: The Science of Lucretius Achievements: Phi Beta Kappa (2020) Lyon Thesis Prize (2021) Extra-Curricular Activities: Brown Sailing Team (2017-2021) Brown Sports Analytics Club (2017-2019) Bio: While Justin's Classics journey did begin before Brown, he spent four wonderful years here interacting with and learning from the Classics department, now graduating from the Latin and Greek track. He will also be graduating with a degree in Applied Math and as a member of the varsity sailing team. While he has enjoyed most works he has read over the years here, if he had to choose, he would pick Lucretius and Xenophon as his favorite Latin and Greek authors. In fact, he liked Lucretius so much he took the time to write a whole honors thesis on him, giving an analysis of the science in Lucretius's work. While his post-grad plans may not directly include Classics, he hopes that the organizational, analytical, and writing skills he has honed in the department over the past four years will be put to great use going forward, and of course he will keep his books around to revisit in his down time!

Doctoral Degree Recipients Stephany “Stevie” Hull, Ph.D., Classics Home: Pennsylvania, USA Dissertation: Education in the Cosmos: Augustine’s Platonic Curriculum of Philosophy and Rhetoric Dissertation Advisor: Joe Pucci Bio: Stevie’s academic research focuses on the fields of ancient education, late antiquity, and natural philosophy. Her dissertation, entitled “Education in the Cosmos: Augustine’s Platonic Curriculum of Philosophy and Rhetoric” integrates these three areas of interest.
