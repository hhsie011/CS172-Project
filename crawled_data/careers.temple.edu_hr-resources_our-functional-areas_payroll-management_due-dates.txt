Adhering to the payment schedule is critical for timely processing. Forms and sign-offs completed and received after the posted due dates will result in nonpayment for the expected pay period. Payroll Due Dates for Departments Monthly Payroll The 10th of every month is the deadline for all input. We cannot guarantee processing of paperwork received after that deadline. Since terminations and reductions in pay cannot always be planned, to avoid overpayments we will accept these up to the day before the payroll runs. However please submit them as soon as possible. Biweekly Payroll The deadline for all input is every other Friday by the end of the business day. Kronos sign-off Every other Monday by 10 a.m. unless otherwise instructed. Payroll Schedules Below are the payroll schedules for the year. Dates may be subject to change at the discretion of the Payroll Department. For questions regarding the payroll schedules, contact us at 215-926-2244 or via email hrpayroll@temple.edu.
