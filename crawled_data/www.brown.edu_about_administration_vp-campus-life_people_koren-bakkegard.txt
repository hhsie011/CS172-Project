In her role she oversees four important departments (Residential Life, Student Conduct and Community Standards, Student Support Services, and Stephen Robert ’62 Campus Center and Student Activities) for building community with students as well as many of the resources and processes that support students in need and crisis. She also joins an experienced senior leadership team in the division and the Executive Committee of the University. Koren Bakkegard was previously interim associate vice provost and dean of residential education at Stanford University where she oversaw an annual operating budget of $20 million and supervised 40 professional staff, 72 live-in faculty and academic staff, and more than 500 student staff. She was called on to guide her part of the division through a series of significant transitions including changes in the division and department leadership team and aligning department functions with priorities related to equity and inclusion, mental and emotional well-being, and community and belonging. As one of the longest serving senior leaders in the division, she had the opportunity to lead and reshape a number of units across the divisions of student affairs and undergraduate education. Her previous roles at Stanford University include associate dean and executive director of residential education (2014-2018), associate dean and director of community standards (2012-2014), associate dean of undergraduate advising and research (2009-2012), assistant dean of freshmen (2008-2009), and director of new student programs (2007-2008). Her many accomplishments in those roles include, but are not limited to: leading the development of the First-Year Reflections Seminar – a credit bearing course facilitated by faculty, staff, and more experienced students; co-leading the launch of the Gender Inclusive Stanford Initiative to improve the support for and experience of trans and gender non-binary students, faculty, and staff; developing emergency response protocols for residential professional and student staff; leading the shift in approach of the Office of Community Standards to emphasize education and outreach related to academic integrity and ethical behavior; leading the merger of the Freshman Dean’s Office with Undergraduate Advising and Research that included changes in structure and personnel; overseeing a 50% increase in the number of faculty and staff volunteering to be pre-major advisors; and restructuring academic advising of varsity athletes. Bakkegard also provided significant service to the Stanford community with initiatives focused on holistic student learning and resilience, several iterations of campus alcohol advisory groups, as a Title IX investigator and appeals officer, and as a founding member of the First-Generation/Low-Income Students Advisory Group. On several occasions over the last decade, when Stanford has needed an administrator to provide vision and direction to strengthen organizational structures and teams, the division’s leadership has looked to her. Each time, her work has resulted in structures, systems, and processes that are more responsive to student needs and strengthen their educational experience. Koren Bakkegard finished the course work for the Ph.D. in English at the University of Rochester, earned a M.A. in English at Wake Forest University, and a B.A. in literature and language at the University of North Carolina – Asheville Division of Campus Life Division of Campus Life Brown University Box 1896 20 Benevolent Street Providence, RI 02912 Phone: 401-863-1800 Email [email protected] Instagram Instagram Brown University Giving to Brown Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA 401-863-1000 Contact Us Maps Directions Career Opportunities Campus Safety Accessibility All Social Media © 2022 Brown University | Back to top
