"I am so thankful for CUBS as it provided me with academic, professional and social opportunities. Coming from out of state, I was worried that the transition would be difficult, but CUBS hosted events starting day 1, which allowed me to connect with new people who possess similar passions. My favorite part of CUBS was all the supplemental academic support I was provided. Not only was one of my classes held in the building where we lived, but my advisor was right downstairs. I loved that as CUBS members, we had sections of classes blocked off just for us. This meant we knew everyone in our class and could easily meet up on our hall for the best study sessions." - Emmala Alfaro, Management major CUBS Activities The CUBS living-learning community provides the following services to students: Additional availability of faculty (Periodically, faculty members are available in the hall, as well as during workshops and social events) Workshops on topics such as time management, study skills, professionalism, effects of alcohol, test-taking, résumé building, stress management, study abroad, etc. Various guest speakers who are experts in their fields Mentors (Consists of upperclassmen who have completed the program) CUBS Events Fall Semester: Retreat Seminars on adjusting to college Workshops to learn about Clemson resources Bonding opportunities through social events Community service Major specific information sessions Spring Semester: Professional meet and greet with the Dean Professional seminars Resume review sessions Professional etiquette dinner Technical skills workshops Community service Guest speakers CUBS Outcomes CUBS students who engage in the living-learning community will be able to identify resources on campus that will enable students to achieve academic goals. personal and professional goals. leadership skills. broadened global perspective. increased community involvement. increased self-awareness. increased academic standing within their chosen major. involvement in other organizations on campus.
