All faculty, staff, and students are provisioned with licenses that allow them to conduct meetings with up to 300 participants. Zoom Webinars support up to 500 attendees in a “listen only” mode. During webinars, only the host and panelists can use their microphones and cameras or share their screens. Polling and Q&A features are available as well as registration and post-webinar reporting. To use OSU's Zoom web collaboration platform to host webinars, faculty and staff can request a webinar license from the OSU Zoom administrators. Webinar License Request Form Important Note: Due to the limited number of webinar licenses available, OSU Zoom administrators must consider requests on a case-by-case basis. Zoom administrators will grant licenses to individuals as needed to accommodate one-time events or facilitate webinar co-hosting. Submit your request at least 48 hours in advance. Need a dedicated webinar license? OSU is not able to cover the cost associated with dedicated webinar licenses. Dedicated webinar license can be purchased through OSU's software distribution.
