It is the only off campus program in the South Pacific, and is held during winter term in Hanover, which is of course summer in New Zealand. Themed around an exploration of "Colonialism and its Legacies," the program offers students intensive introductions to anthropology of the region, and to Maori studies, the Maori being the indigenous people of New Zealand.

Curriculum The academic program is nine weeks long and comprises the following: (a) various excursions in the Auckland area; (b) seven weeks of classes in Maori studies and Anthropology at the University; (c) a four-day tour of significant Maori and colonial historical sites north of Auckland; (d) a four-day cultural immersion at a Maori meeting house on the Eastern Cape, including instruction in Kapa-Haka, Maori song and dance; and (e) a three-day stay at a Maori meeting house on the coast north of Auckland. The program begins the first of January and finishes in early March. Anthropology students must complete a prerequisite of two courses in Anthropology, one of which must be a course in cultural anthropology, before the program begins. Linguistics students must take Linguistics 1 and one linguistics course in the 20's. Anthropology students need not meet the Linguistics prerequisites or vice versa, although Linguistics students might well consider taking a course in cultural anthropology before going to New Zealand. Students may apply for the program before the prerequisites are completed. All participants take the Dartmouth course, Anthropology 51, "Colonialism and Its Legacies in Anthropological Perspective," which is taught by a member of the Dartmouth faculty. In addition, those students concentrating in anthropology take two courses from local faculty, Anthropology 52, "Introduction to Maori Society," and Anthropology 54, "Foreign Study in Anthropology." Those concentrating in linguistics take, in addition to Anthropology 51, Linguistics 8, "The Structure of Maori," and an additional course in linguistics or Maori Studies.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Anthropology Undergraduate Overview Major Modified Major Minor Global Health Minor How to Declare an Anthropology Major or Minor Courses Introductory Courses Archaeology Biological Anthropology Cultural Anthropology Independent Study Culminating Seminars Past Teaching Schedules Honors Program Honors Proposal Submission Form Transfer Credits Careers Alumni: Where Are They Now?
