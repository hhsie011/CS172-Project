The dean articulates the school’s vision and goals and reports on progress at council meetings twice a year. Established in 1982, the council provides a forum for the dean to discuss the school’s vision with an informed group of outside supporters who contribute non-academic experiences and points of view. Members come from the business, civic, arts, philanthropic, and academic communities and bring special expertise and interest in areas of priority for the leadership of H&S. The dean relies on the council’s support for the school’s highest priorities. The council consists of two dozen members who serve three-year terms.
