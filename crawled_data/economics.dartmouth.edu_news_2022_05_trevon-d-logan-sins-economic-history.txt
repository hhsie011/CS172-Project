Logan: The Sins of Economic History Department of Economics Lecture Series on Inequality, Discrimination, and Opportunity. Wednesday, May 18, 2022, 5:30-6:30PM (ET), Filene Auditorium. PreviousNext Lecture Recording: The recording of Professor Logan's lecture is currently available to the Dartmouth community through this link: The Sins of Economic History Abstract: How and why does economic history miss the mark when discussing the history of racial economic inequality? And what do we miss when failing to account for the historical process of racialization, capitalism, and racial oppression? The use of traditional economic theory to describe racism and anti-Blackness has left us with an incomplete account of the dynamics of economic racial oppression. This lecture will discuss three sins of economic history, covering the economic history of enslavement, the economics and politics of Jim Crow segregation, and the economics of the Civil Rights Movement. At each turn, traditional economic history sins in describing racial economic inequality. This lecture will review the sins of economic history and highlight a generative path forward for social scientists seeking to explain the economics of our nation's continuing race problem.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Economics About Why Econ?
