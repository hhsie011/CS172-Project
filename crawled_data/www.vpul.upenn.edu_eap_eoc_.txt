PENN’s federally funded Educational Opportunity Center (EOC) is a place where West Philadelphia residents, especially those from low-income families, can begin to realize their dreams for a brighter future. EOC serves 1,000 participants each year, age 19 or older. Its primary goal is to motivate participants by reminding them that they can achieve their educational goals regardless of their age and whether they have dropped out of high school or even if they are young mothers. EOC’s one-on-one counseling and motivational seminars coach participants in vital areas such as how to finance higher education, understand the college admissions process, and improve academic skills.
