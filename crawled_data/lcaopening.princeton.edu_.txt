Home Festival Schedule Visitor Info Media Kit Thank you! A Festival of the Arts at Princeton / Oct 5 - 8, 2017 Thank you to the thousands who joined us as the first audiences to experience every venue and corner of the new Lewis Arts complex during A Festival of the Arts last weekend. The arts complex and venues across campus were activated by a range of exciting events by professional guest, faculty, alumni and student artists. If you missed the Festival or could not get to all the events, check out a photo gallery and curated collection of social media highlights from throughout the weekend. The events of the Festival are indicative of the programming presented all year long by the Lewis Center for the Arts and the Department of Music, most of it free, so please come back for more! The Lewis Center for the Arts is designed to put the creative and performing arts at the heart of the Princeton experience. This mission is based on the conviction that exposure to the arts helps each of us to make sense of our lives and the lives of our neighbors. The Lewis Center includes the University's Programs in Creative Writing, Dance, Music Theater, Theater, and Visual Arts, as well as the interdisciplinary Princeton Atelier.

Connect w/ @PrincetonArts Since 1935, Princeton University's Department of Music has offered courses in composition, music history, and related areas to students at the graduate and undergraduate levels. The Department of Music is at the epicenter of a musical culture that is broad and deep, reaching from edge to edge of the campus, from the classroom to the concert hall, and from faculty-led groups to those run exclusively by students.
