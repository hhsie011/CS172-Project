And did you know that volunteering for a Brown Club can be as flexible as you'd like? Your participation can range from helping out at a single event to taking the lead in planning the club's future. And volunteering does much more than expand your social network. It's a career networking activity too—and, a great opportunity to gain leadership experience. No matter your level of participation, volunteering for a club is a chance to go beyond Facebook friendships and deepen your connection to Brown, and to your fellow Brunonians. p.s.
