Sponsored by the Leadership Alliance, a consortium of 31 institutions of higher education, SR-EIP allows students to work for eight to ten weeks under the guidance of a faculty or research mentor at a participating Alliance institution. Previous research experience is preferred but not required. SR-EIP encourages students from groups traditionally underrepresented in the sciences, social sciences, and humanities to consider research careers in the academic, public, or private sectors. Award recipients present a written report and/or abstract at the end of their summer research activity and present their research at the Leadership Alliance’s annual national symposium.
