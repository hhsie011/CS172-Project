A beloved teacher, mentor, and colleague, Sid passed away on August 5, 2019. Through Sid’s vision and dedication, the Population Studies and Training Center was formally established at Brown in 1965. Since its founding, the PSTC has been known in the U.S. and around the world for its decisively interdisciplinary, globally-focused population studies research, and for its outstanding training program in demography. We remember Sid as a pioneering and visionary population scientist and celebrate his enduring contributions. Read more about Sid’s life and exemplary career. Remembrances We invite remembrances of Sid from Brown friends and the population community, which we will compile and share with Sid’s family and all those who contribute reflections.
