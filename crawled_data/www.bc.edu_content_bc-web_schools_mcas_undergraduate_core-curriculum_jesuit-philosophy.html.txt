In earlier centuries, Jesuit education was based on the Ratio Studiorum—a developmental plan for humanistic education that moved from Latin and Greek to classical authors, rhetoric, and poetry to mathematics, physics, and philosophy to theology. In the twenty-first century, students no longer are required to take Greek and Latin, and theology is not something to study only in one’s senior year. Nevertheless, a commitment to rigor, integration, and education of the whole person remain essential to the Boston College Core Curriculum. The Core rests at the heart of a liberal arts education in our Jesuit, Catholic context. It connects intellectual rigor with student development and formation, engaging students’ minds, hearts, and imaginations. The Core thus provides an integrative foundation oriented by the traditions of the past, engaged with the realities of our present, and open to the possibilities of the future. Play Jesuit Philosophy and the Core Associate Dean for the Core Brian Gareau and students discuss Boston College's unique approach to the Core.
