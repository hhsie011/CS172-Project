The Graduate Student Housing Community consists of two Baylor owned apartment complexes: Browning Square and The Quadrangle. Our single bedroom units at Browning Square and two bedroom units at The Quadrangle can accommodate singles, families, children, and pets. Our housing is affordable and well-maintained. We are privately managed by Brothers Management to allow the greater personal freedoms which graduate students expect. Community Life The Graduate Student Housing Community provides a quiet, adult residence with a living area suitable to the professional and family lives that are unique to graduate students. The community also serves as medium for scholars and families to gather for social, spiritual, and academic pursuits. To this end, we encourage residents to attend community hosted events that provide occasions for the community to come together and share in fellowship, friendship, and ideas. Past programming includes social events, such as holiday dinners, lectures, games, and cookouts. Community Garden Residents at The Quadrangle and Browning Square have access to the Baylor Community Garden, located adjacent to Browning Square. The garden offers a pleasant green space, benches, a pergola, and a grill. In addition, GSHC residents can apply for small individual plots in the garden's raised beds. Plots are assigned on a yearly basis every January.
