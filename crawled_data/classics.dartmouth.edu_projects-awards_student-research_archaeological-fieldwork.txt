While you may think first of archaeological projects in the Mediterranean, there are other great opportunities that will enable you to gain fieldwork experience. If considering future work in archaeology, be aware that many Mediterranean sites actually like to hire people who have initially worked in the U.S., because of the meticulous training provided. Finding a project A few places to look for projects are The Archaeological Institute of America's Archaeological Fieldwork Opportunities Bulletin Earthwatch (but note that these can be expensive) The Agora in Athens is an excellent place to dig, in part because they excavate well, they don't charge, they cover most expenses, and it's a good way to meet lots of other people with similar interests. However, getting onto it is competitive, and while they do accept undergraduates and have accepted Dartmouth students in the past, they prioritize accepting graduate students (they interview potential excavators). For more information, go to the American School of Classical Studies in Athens site. The deadline is typically mid-December. The Passport in Time program of the USDA Forest Service The Vermont Archaeological Society keeps a list of projects in Vermont The New Hampshire State Conservation and Rescue Archaeology Program runs low-cost historical and prehistoric field schools Dartmouth Archaeology Working Group field school and internships page Professor Hruby's office door, Reed 314, where she posts opportunities that she hears about You may also wish to consider internships with archaeological laboratories, museums, and other relevant organizations. Check these sites and locations early and often; many are updated periodically. Finding funds for your project A few places to look are The Jane C. Waldbaum Archaeological Field School Scholarship; the application deadline is usually at the beginning of March. It is available to students who have never participated in an archaeological project before. Dartmouth students have been quite successful at obtaining Waldbaum Scholarships in the past. If you're excavating in the Near East (which includes both Cyprus and Israel), the American Schools of Oriental Research have a variety of archaeology fellowships; deadlines this year are typically in early February. If your heritage is Native American or another historically underrepresented group, the Society for American Archaeology sometimes has funding available. IFR Global has a website that lists scholarships to their own projects and, at the bottom of the page, links to fellowships offered by other funders. Most deadlines are January through March. Dartmouth College offers a range of programs through the office of Undergraduate Advising and Research The Classics Department has substantial funding available through both the Reid and the Wiencke fund, currently up to $4,000.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Classics Curriculum Overview Course Offerings by Term Fall 2021 Winter 2022 Spring 2022 Summer 2022 Fall 2022 Winter 2023 Spring 2023 2023-24 Classical Studies Courses Entry points for Classical Studies Literature, Philosophy, Religion Ancient History Classical Archaeology Language Study -- Latin Latin Classes Placement in Latin Language Study -- Ancient Greek Courses in Ancient Greek Placement in Ancient Greek Majors and Minors Classical Studies track Ancient History track Classical Archaeology track Classical Languages and Literature track Culminating Experience Foreign Study NEW Classics FSP in Spring 2022 Greece Foreign Study Program Rome Foreign Study Program Projects & Awards Classics-Related Projects and Awards Student Research Archaeological Fieldwork Reid/Wiencke Funding for Research Senior Honors Projects Awards & Prizes Faculty Media Projects Annual Lecture Programs Faculty Books Inclusivity News & Events People Our graduates Graduating with a Classics Degree Alumni Support Tell Us Your Story Alumni Stories My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
