Report to the Title IX Office Contact: Skip Bishop, Title IX and Gender Equity Officer at titleix@sjsu.edu or 408-924-7290 (M-F, 8AM-5PM). If you need to report after-hours or on the weekend, please call/text 669-877-0620 and the office will respond the next business day. Report: Alternatively, you may also report an incident using the online Incident Reporting Form. Submit an Incident Reporting Form Submissions using this form will be reviewed by the Title IX Office staff and someone will reach out to you during business hours. The Title IX Office can assist with academic and workplace supportive measures and investigate allegations of sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence, stalking, and discrimination within the campus community. Report to Law Enforcement Students, faculty and staff have the right to pursue criminal charges whether or not they report to the University. If an incident occurred on campus, you can report to San José State University Police Department. UPD Dispatch: 408-924-2222 If an incident occurred off campus, you can report to local law enforcement, such as San José Police Department or Santa Clara County Sheriff's Department. If you are in immediate danger, call 408-924-2222 (on-campus) or dial 911 (off-campus). You can also alert UPD from one of the many Blue Lights around campus. Report to Confidential Support We encourage survivors of Sexual Assault, Rape, Dating/Domestic Violence, and Stalking (collectively Sexual Misconduct) to talk with someone about what happened, discuss reporting options, and to help connect you with support services. SJSU's Confidential Survivor Advocate provides confidential individual and group sessions for people impacted by sexual violence, intimate partner violence, stalking & harassment. If you would like to schedule an appointment, please call (408) 924-5021 or email survivoradvocate@sjsu.edu. SJSU’s Counseling & Psychological Services (CAPS) is a confidential resource - you can discuss what happened without notifying the Title IX Office or law enforcement. Please visit sjsu.edu/counseling for more information regarding CAPS' services. The YWCA Golden Gate Silicon Valley is a non-profit organization that can provide confidential support to survivors of sexual assault, dating/domestic violence, and human trafficking. The YWCA will not report information to the Title IX Office or law enforcement without your consent. For more information about the YWCA, please visit yourywca.org.
