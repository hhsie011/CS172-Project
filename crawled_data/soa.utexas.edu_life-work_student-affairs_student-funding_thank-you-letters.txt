We hold School of Architecture scholarship recipients to a high standard for thank-you letters. Recipients will upload thank-you letter drafts to the Scholarship Coordinator to review for content and adherence to the university writing guidelines. The Scholarship Coordinator may return your letter(s) and ask you to resubmit with corrections. Scholarship funds will not release if you do not submit thank-you letters that meet these expectations. Thank-you letter guidelines Letters must be typed and include a clear, COLOR image of your signature. Typically, these letters are about 1 page (2-3 paragraphs) in length. Review our example thank-you letter. You are not writing to the person who selected you for this scholarship, so do not write, "Thank you for choosing me for this scholarship." Determine whether you are writing to a donor or representative and appropriately convey your gratitude. You may thank a donor for their generosity and for supporting the School of Architecture and its students. When thanking the honoree who the scholarship is named for, it might be appropriate to say something like “I am honored to receive the scholarship created in your name.” When thanking the honoree's family, it becomes "I am honored to receive the scholarship created in his/her name." When thanking a representative, you may express your thanks for the scholarship more generally: "I am thankful for this scholarship and the support it will provide". Include the full name of your scholarship. Include information about your academics. You may also include information about your career goals, activities, organizations, or leadership roles. The donors provided this money because they support UT Austin, SOA, and our students. They love to hear how this scholarship will help you. Be professional, but be yourself. Use your own voice and words when writing your letter. If you try to sound like someone else or use fancy words that aren't in your usual vocabulary, the end result is an awkward-sounding letter that the reader most likely won't understand. Just be yourself at your best. Keep in mind that you don't know your audience, so use humor and wit cautiously and with a critical eye. We encourage you to write with personality, but the written word is much more literal than the spoken word and these techniques can be easily misinterpreted and could lead a letter recipient to think that you aren't being genuine. When crafting your letter, remember that you are writing for a professional audience. If you're not sure about a particular phrase, err on the side of caution. Proof your work! It is important to present yourself, and the SOA, well. Check for grammatical and spelling errors before you turn in your letters. Check your draft in an editor such as Grammarly before submitting it. If we find any errors in grammar or content, we will return your letters to you to revise. Upload a Word document with a clear, COLOR image of your signature. Do NOT mail the letter(s) to the address on your scholarship notification.
