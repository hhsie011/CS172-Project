This page, containing narrative guidelines and a chart with prerequisites for every level, will help you decide where to begin! If you’re interested in our language program, we want you to know that we recognize that proficiency is multifaceted, encompassing different types of knowledge and skills depending on students’ individual backgrounds and experiences. You will find a place in our Spanish program whether you have little or no familiarity with the language, took several years of it in high school, spoke Spanish at home but haven’t studied it formally, or otherwise have had extensive experience with Spanish outside of an academic setting. Please see the guidelines below for more details about language course levels. All our courses, from HISP0100, encompass authentic Spanish-language texts, music, and films, though our primary literature and culture curriculum begins with HISP0650, “Advanced Spanish through Literature and Film,” and continues into the 700- and 1000-levels; prerequisites are indicated in the chart below, but please see our concentration requirements and overview of the curriculum for more on the differences between 700- and 1000-level courses. These language placement guidelines will help you find the right class for your level and determine whether or not you need to take Brown’s Spanish placement exam, so please follow them closely: If you have no experience with Spanish or knowledge of another Romance language, you should sign up for HISP 0100, Basic Spanish I. Students who have an AP score of less than 3, whose AP or SAT II scores are older than 18 months, or who have no AP or SAT II scores should take the placement exam and pre-register or shop for the course indicated when they receive their scores. We realize that placement tests do not capture all aspects of proficiency and may not be fully accurate, but they provide an important baseline. If you have any familiarity with Spanish or other Romance languages and got a placement score between 240 and 340, you may be eligible to enroll in HISP 0110, Intensive Basic Spanish. If you have an AP Spanish score of 4 or 5, or an SAT II exam score, please see the chart below to determine your level. If after reviewing this information you determine that a placement exam is required, please complete the placement exam online. Note that you must take this exam without outside help, in whatever form, as this may skew your results, and you might end up in the wrong course. If you’re not sure what category you fit in or have any questions or concerns regarding your placement, please contact our language faculty as follows: for HISP 0100 & 0200, Silvia Sobral; for HISP 0110, 0300 & 0400, Nidia Schuhmacher; for HISP 0500, 0550 & 0600, Eva Gómez García.
