Request a Tutor The Format Tutoring takes place in small groups, consisting of 2 to 5 students. Students can request a tutor in any undergraduate course they are currently enrolled in at Iowa State. Group tutoring sessions cost $5 per session. Groups meet at a consistent day and time twice a week during the academic year and three times per week during the summer. Sessions are 50 minutes. Groups are interactive and led by a qualified peer tutor. Tutoring Services is a centralized academic support service consisting of peer-facilitated learning experiences for undergraduate students interested in requesting or becoming a tutor at Iowa State. We work with students to identify and mobilize resources that facilitate learning and promote success.
