In these cases, you may apply for a course load reduction or a semester withdrawal. All requests for current semester withdrawal will be processed by the office of the academic dean of your school/college until the mid semester withdrawal deadline. After that date, requests for a semester withdrawal for medical reasons will be processed by University Health Services; and requests for a semester withdrawal for mental health reasons will be processed by Counseling and Mental Health Center. Before you apply, consider viewing this link about resources available to you for the most common reasons students withdraw. These resources might help you such that you can avoid withdrawal, or if withdrawal is necessary, they can be helpful to you to address the concern that you have, setting you up for success subsequent to your withdrawal. See Helpful Links for instructions describing the application process. Read them carefully. In some instances, approval can affect your financial aid, housing, student academic employment (TA, AI, GRA, fellowship, etc.) and/or immigration status and/or veteran benefits. To proceed: Read the application process instructions and download the application. Complete steps 1, 2, and 3 of the application.
