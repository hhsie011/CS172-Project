Brown Chemistry Anonymous Climate Form The Department has created an Anonymous Climate Form designed to gather anonymous feedback from the broader Chemistry Department community regarding incidents of bias within the department, including but not limited to microaggressions and other behaviors perceived to be demeaning to others on the basis of gender, race, or sexual identity or unwanted sexual advances. Responses will be used to gauge the climate within the department and to shape department policy. To view this form or provide feedback, please follow the above link.
