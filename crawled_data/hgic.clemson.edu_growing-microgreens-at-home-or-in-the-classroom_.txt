Microgreens or “vegetable confetti” taste delicious and can be added to sandwiches, wraps, or salads! You can even add microgreens to smoothies for an extra serving of vegetables! What kind of seeds are used for microgreens? Peas, broccoli, kale, radish, sunflowers, basil, popcorn- just to name a few! Seed companies offer prepackaged microgreen mixes. They are grouped by flavor profile such as spicy or mild. Gather Supplies you Will Need Potting soil, microgreen seeds, clean shallow containers, plastic wrap or clear lids, adjustable grow light (optional), clean sharp scissors for harvesting, spray bottle (for misting). Choose a clean shallow container. Create drainage holes in the bottom. Fill container with 1 – 2 inches of moist potting soil. Sow seeds thickly over the surface of the soil and gently press down. Cover large seeds with a little more soil. TIP: Soak seeds with hard seed coats, like peas, in water overnight first. After sowing seeds, cover tray with clear cover or plastic wrap to create a mini greenhouse. Place the trays under an adjustable grow light or a sunny windowsill. Check on them daily so they will not dry out! Keep microgreens moist by spraying with water. To harvest, snip above the soil with clean, sharp scissors. Store in fridge until ready to eat. Wash microgreens just before eating. Use a salad spinner to remove excess water. Add to your favorite dish and enjoy!
