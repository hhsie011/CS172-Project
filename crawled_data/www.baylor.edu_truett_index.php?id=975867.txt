He is one of the founding pastors of Cornerstone Church and co-founder of Portrait Coffee—both in the Historic West End of Atlanta. These endeavors are ways in which he hopes to restore a sense of family, dignity, and hope to their neighborhood. John is also a Baylor University graduate who served as a student manager for Scott Drew’s basketball program in 2005. He holds a master's degree in Christian Education from Dallas Theological Seminary and is currently pursuing a Doctorate in Church Leadership & Community Witness from Emory’s Candler School of Theology.

She holds a PhD in Counseling Psychology from Tennessee State University, as well as a master's degree in Family Therapy from the University of Rochester and a bachelor's degree in Sociology from Hampton University. As a Certified Cultural Intelligence facilitator and mental health therapist, Dr. Edmondson frequently consults with and serves churches, universities, and other organizations seeking assistance with leadership development, anti-racism, and mental health issues.
