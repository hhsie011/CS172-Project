Magazine Outreach Ways to Give Clemson Home College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences Students Current: Recognition Recognition Awarding Excellence The College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences has the good fortune to have many faculty, staff, and students who make extraordinary contributions that help Clemson University work towards its strategic plan, ClemsonForward. intro-arrow Honors & Awards Student Awards Every spring, CECAS recognizes outstanding students for academics, service, research, teaching, and leadership. These awards showcase the impressive achievements of some of our undergraduate and graduate students. Student Recognition Faculty Awards The college faculty awards honor outstanding faculty members in eight categories. They are recognized for performance, achievements, or accomplishments that are exemplary and contribute to the college's success. Faculty Achievement Staff Awards At the end of every year, we gather to honor our employees and recognize some of the outstanding staff in the college. The college staff awards consist of six awards within three categories. Staff Excellence Traditions Inspired by Thomas Green Clemson's dream to create a "high seminary of learning to benefit the agricultural and mechanical arts," engineering and sciences have been an integral part of the University's development. Order of the Engineer The Order of the Engineer is an association of engineers who pledge to uphold the ethics and excellence of the engineering profession. New members take the Obligation of the Engineer, a declaration similar to the Hippocratic Oath. Along with the stainless ring, the creed reminds them of their oaths and responsibilities to the engineering profession. About the Order In its 50th year, the Order of the Engineer is symbolized by a stainless silver ring. Clemson University established a local chapter in 2015. “ “You have your class ring which shows how hard you've worked at Clemson, but this is something special to also remind you of how hard you've worked to get your engineering degree. ” Lindsey Bidwick Industrial Engineering '19 College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences Copyright © Clemson University College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences | Riggs Hall 864-656-3000 | Directory intro-arrow Engage With Us Through Facebook Twitter Instagram YouTube Clemson University Facebook Instagram Twitter Linkedin Youtube Tiktok Policy/Terms of Use Web Accessibility Ethics/Safety Hotline Privacy Policy Copyright © 2022 Clemson University • Clemson, South Carolina 29634 Clemson University Facebook Instagram Twitter Linkedin Youtube Tiktok Resources A-Z Index Campus Map CU Safety Directory Webcams Apply to Clemson
