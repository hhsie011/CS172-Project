Holzinger is an assistant professor in the School of Aerospace Engineering. Marcus received his B.S. and M.S. degrees in aeronautics & astronautics at the University of Washington and his Ph.D. in aerospace engineering sciences at the University of Colorado at Boulder. He began his faculty career at Georgia Tech in the Fall 2012 semester, and has since constructed a rigorous, externally funded, high-impact research program. His lab research draws from dynamics, controls, and estimation disciplines, focusing on space situational awareness, distributed spacecraft formation flight, proximity operations & rendezvous, and optimal reachability theory applications. Holzinger has completed installation of the Georgia Tech Space Object Research Telescope (GT-SORT), a 0.5m Raven-class telescope to experimentally validate space situational awareness research. He also serves as the principal investigator for the RECONnaissance of Space Objects (RECONSO) cubesat, which will launch in the vicinity of 2017 and provide persistent on-orbit space situational awareness data.
