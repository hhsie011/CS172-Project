Over a hundred new rock art sites were recorded during the 3-week trip, from a wide variety of time periods. The oldest rock art found by the Dartmouth team was from the Archaic Period, and likely represents the ritual activities of hunting and gathering peoples over 2,000 years ago. Some of the more recent religious iconography included Christian crosses from the colonial era, probably made by people of mixed Spanish and Indigenous ancestry. The team recorded the rock art using a range of methods, including drawing, photography and GPS mapping. In addition to their survey work, the crew visited several major historical and archaeological sites throughout New Mexico. These included the important Ancestral Puebloan sites of Chaco Canyon, Aztec Ruins and Bandelier National Monument. There were also field trips to Chimayó, the most visited Roman Catholic sanctuary in the United States, and El Morro National Monument, which includes the oldest known inscriptions left by Spanish colonists in New Mexico, dating from 1605 onwards. Prof. Wilkinson regularly carries out fieldwork in New Mexico during the summer term, and will continue to provide opportunities for Dartmouth students to participate in future years. nm_trip_2021_02.png nm_trip_2021_01.png Tags: Darryl WIlkinson , Department of Religion Related DepartmentClassicsRelated DepartmentFilm and Media Departments African and African American Studies Anthropology Art History Asian Societies, Cultures, and Languages Program Biological Sciences Chemistry Classics Cognitive Science Comparative Literature Computer Science Earth Sciences Economics Education Engineering Sciences English Environmental Studies Film and Media Studies French and Italian Geography German Studies Government History Humanities 1 & 2 Institute for Writing and Rhetoric Jewish Studies Latin American, Latino and Caribbean Studies Linguistics Mathematics Medieval and Renaissance Studies Music Native American Studies Philosophy Physics and Astronomy Psychological and Brain Sciences Religion Russian Sociology Spanish and Portuguese Studio Art Theater Women’s and Gender Studies Inclusivity “Dartmouth’s capacity to advance its dual mission of education and research depends upon the full diversity and inclusivity of this community…Diversity and inclusivity are necessary partners. Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Religion Undergraduate Overview Major and Minor Curriculum Course Schedule Dickinson Seminar Focus on Race Non-Western Courses Honors Program Sperry Fellows Program Past Honors Theses Career Information Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Awards and Prizes The Charles Howard Dudley Prize The Dickinson Senior Writing Prize in Religion The Hans Penner Prize The Religion Department Faculty Award The Sperry Writing Prize in Religion Foreign Study Program News & Events Overview Dickinson Distinguished Lecture Forum on Race & Religion Hardigg Family Fund Lecture Past Fellows Orr Lecture on Culture & Religion Past Lectures People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
