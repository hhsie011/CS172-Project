The Brown family lived in this house for five generations and then donated the house (and many of its historic furnishings) to Brown University in 1995. Today the faculty, students, and staff of the John Nicholas Brown Center for Public Humanities and Cultural Heritage use and enjoy this beautiful building. You can see how public humanities works in the way this tour links experimental, place-based interpretation, a focus on digital public humanities, and interdisciplinary research and curation. We hope we provide a model for other historic house tours. Take a digital tour! Learn more about this project! Proudly powered by Omeka. Back to top
