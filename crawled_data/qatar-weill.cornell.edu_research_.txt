This portal provides you with the latest developments regarding our rapidly growing research program. Our goal is to establish a state-of-the-art biomedical research program focused on tackling the most pressing health needs in Qatar and the region. Our vision is to undertake biomedical research at the basic, translational and community levels, with the expectation that such a combinatorial approach will have a dramatic impact in addressing complex multifactorial diseases such as diabetes Excellence and professionalism are our most prominent themes, and we strive to adhere to them in all aspects of our operations, from the science we are producing, to our core facilities, administrative services, and training programs. The WCM-Q research program is already contributing to building both biomedical research and human capacity in Qatar, and will continue to do so in the future. We employ a multi-pronged approach focused on recruiting exceptional scientists, delivering robust training programs, ensuring advanced infrastructure within the core laboratories, and a collaborative approach to produce cutting-edge knowledge. These are exciting times for our research program as it matures and contributes to the establishment of a knowledge based society in Qatar. I hope that browsing this site will convey the excitement and commitment of the entire WCM-Q research team as we endeavor to build a unique biomedical research center.
