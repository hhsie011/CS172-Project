MAC is a graduate student organization focused on ensuring that doctoral students, especially those from backgrounds historically excluded and underrepresented in academia, can connect with peer mentors and develop positive strategies for excelling academically and personally throughout their graduate career and beyond. MAC mentors and mentees participate in large group mentoring activities and are assigned to M&M (mentors & mentees) Pods that bring small groups of mentees together with more advanced graduate students. All mentors and mentees participate in monthly discussion sessions focused on common issues faced by early-career graduate students and participate in smaller group discussions and activities with their assigned M&M Pods. Peer Mentors MAC invites doctoral students going into their second year or beyond, as well as postdoctoral fellows and associates, to apply to serve as peer mentors to support the success and professional development of first-year doctoral students. Eligibility Currently-enrolled, full-time doctoral student or employed postdoctoral fellow/associate Must have completed at least one year in a doctoral program Mentees MAC invites first-year doctoral students to apply to participate in the MAC Mentoring Program as mentees, which brings more advanced graduate students and postdocs together with beginning graduate students for monthly discussion sessions focused on common issues faced by early-career graduate students.

The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America.
