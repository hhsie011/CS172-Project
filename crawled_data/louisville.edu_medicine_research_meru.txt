We are rapidly expanding our infrastructure and programming with the goal of developing multiple medical education scholars at the University of Louisville School of Medicine. Our faculty and staff are engaged and committed to learning specific research skills and our scholarship is increasing at a swift pace. Medical education scholarship is of utmost importance at the University of Louisville School of Medicine because it is through scholarship that we generate new knowledge, exchange ideas, understand educational outcomes, promote innovation in medical education, as well as enable and evaluate breakthrough advances across the medical education continuum.
