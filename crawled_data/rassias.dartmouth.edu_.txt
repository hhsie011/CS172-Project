Virtual Classes The Rassias Method® is a unique approach that speeds language learning, increases language retention and has you speaking and understanding in "Ten days that make a difference." Originally developed for Peace Corps training, it has been adapted by language teachers in North America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. Vision & Mission Our purpose is to share, to serve, to stimulate. Aware of the crucial need for understanding today within and without our borders, we are committed to the improvement of communication through effective instruction of language and culture. We are committed to the premise that language instruction is a humanistic pursuit intended to sensitize individuals to other cultures, to the relativity of values, to share our resources for the betterment of national and international understanding; to the appreciation of similarities and respect for differences among peoples. We are committed to communicate at all levels with the widest audience through every means possible; to render service to individuals with particular needs to know languages in the fields of medicine, law enforcement, business and other critical sectors in our society; to instruction that is dynamic, durable, and dedicated to changing attitudes toward learning and teaching languages. The Rassias Center is committed to the effective instruction of language and culture: to the premise that language instruction is a humanistic pursuit intended to sensitize individuals to other cultures, to the relativity of values, to the appreciation of similarities and respect for differences among peoples; to service in the field of communication and to the belief that understanding comes through sharing of ideas, of aspirations, of convictions, of problems, and of humanity; to instruction in languages in the private, public, and federal sectors of our society; OR: to render service in the acquisition of languages in the private, public, and federal sectors of our society; to instruction that is dynamic, durable, and dedicated to changing attitudes toward learning and the teaching of language and culture; to the demystification of language and elimination of the word "foreign" as an alienating sign Contact Us Top of page | Privacy | Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College Last Updated: 5/20/20
