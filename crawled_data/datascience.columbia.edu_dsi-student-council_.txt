Over the years, it has evolved into a community, working towards improving DSI students’ experience at Columbia. Now, the agenda of the council is multifold: (i) to serve as representatives of DSI students by gauging their needs and addressing them and/or bringing them to the attention of those who can, (ii) encourage a sense of community among the students through social mixers and/or technical events, (iii) support the technical advancement of students by providing necessary resources, (iv) build a stronger and better connected alumni network.
