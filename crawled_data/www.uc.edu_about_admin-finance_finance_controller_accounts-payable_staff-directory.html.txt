All form must be completed by the vendor/payee. If a vendor wants to set up banking with the university, then the Direct Deposit Banking Form can be used in lieu of the W9 or contract. Please ensure to include a voided check or bank verification letter. Any changes to an existing vendor account/information, such as change of last name, address or bank account requires a new direct deposit form to be completed. Remember to reference the old account information on the form. Please ensure a voided check or bank verification letter is included with the new banking information.
