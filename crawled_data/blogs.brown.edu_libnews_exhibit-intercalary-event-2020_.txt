The freedom through which artists pursue research allows their inquiries to breed multivalent results, often seemingly unconnected results which can then act as springboards to new ways of seeing and communicating with the world. Bullock, Prince and Salstrom’s artistic practices cultivate curiosity that interposes surprising elements into the narrative of objectivity and data, and in doing so, invite intercalary events in the vitrines of the Hay Library. Intercalary Event 2020 exhibition locations include the John Hay Library, Chazan Gallery at The Wheeler School and Ladd Observatory. Opening reception: Thursday, February 13th, 2020, 5 – 7PM Exhibit Dates: January 21, 2020 – December 1, 2021 Exhibit Time: John Hay Library Hours Exhibit Location: Willis Reading Room, John Hay Library, 20 Prospect Street, Providence This entry was posted in Collections, Exhibits & Events, Exhibits & Events, Featured Resources, General Interest, Hay, Home Page, Josiah Carberry, Special Collections, Spotlights, Uncategorized, Uncategorized by [email protected].
