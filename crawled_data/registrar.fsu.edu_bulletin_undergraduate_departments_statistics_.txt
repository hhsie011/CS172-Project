Statistics is the science of analyzing random events and their associated data. The goals of the analysis are to describe the properties and characteristics of the data visually and numerically, to provide a model for the underlying events which considers the randomness of the phenomena, and to make accurate predictions of future events. In the study of statistics, students use and enrich their mathematical expertise and orient their study of the statistical methodology toward useful and relevant purposes in society. Significant opportunities for well-trained persons in statistics arise in many career environments, such as the social sciences, the natural sciences, business, industry, the health services, and government services. Flexible, individually planned programs of study for minors or majors, including an honors option, are available. Interested students should contact the director of the undergraduate program for more information. The Department of Statistics offers a wide selection of undergraduate courses in statistical methods for nonmajors with minimal background in mathematics. One of STA 2023, 2122, 2171, or 3032 is a prerequisite for the remaining courses in the series, which are STA 3024, 4202, 4203, 4222, 4502, 4634, 4664, 4702, and 4853. The department offers a combined bachelor’s/master’s pathway designed for academically gifted students who wish to pursue an accelerated program culminating in a BS degree in Statistics and an MS degree in Statistics, Statistical Data Science, or Biostatistics. This pathway allows up to twelve semester hours of coursework to be dually counted toward both the BS and MS degrees. The Department of Statistics provides facilities for computation in connection with coursework and research. The Department has a local area network of workstations and PCs running Linux and Windows operating systems, as well as networked printers. Linked to the campus-wide network, these workstations may be used to access the University-operated clusters for computationally intensive projects. Computer Skills Competency All undergraduates at Florida State University must demonstrate basic computer skills competency prior to graduation. As necessary computer competency skills vary from discipline to discipline, each major determines the courses needed to satisfy this requirement. Undergraduate majors in statistics satisfy this requirement by earning a grade of “C–” or higher in STA 3024.
