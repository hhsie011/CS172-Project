However, safety is ultimately the responsibility of each individual. Use your own common sense and good judgment in assessing risks and taking appropriate action. The information provided in this guide is exactly that, a guide for actions to take in a crisis. You are responsible for your own safety. In any emergency, dial 911 for immediate assistance. If you dial 911 from your cell phone, even if on campus, you may reach the Stillwater Police. Tell the dispatcher your location and s/he will direct your call to the proper authorities. Dialing 744-6523 will always reach the OSU Police but it is a non-emergency number. A variety of resources are utilized to disseminate critical information in the case of an emergency. Cowboy Alerts are available to all campus faculty, staff and students. Register your phone to receive a text message and/or voicemail through your O-key account at www.okey.okstate.edu.
