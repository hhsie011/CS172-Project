Get tested every day that you have a scheduled event even if you are not experiencing symptoms. Rapid antigen tests are widely available at area pharmacies. Harvard’s Color PCR testing is still available. We encourage those enrolled in this program to continue using it, in addition to rapid tests. If you test positive, do not attend commencement events or come to campus during your isolation period. After testing positive, adhere to the 5-day home isolation guidance. For the full 10 days, follow strict masking and do not drink or dine in proximity to other people. Visit the Keep Harvard Healthy website for more information. For indoor and crowded outdoor events, wear a high-quality mask that fits securely without air gaps around your nose and mouth. See mask guidance here. If attending events that involve unmasking to eat or drink, minimize any unmasked mingling and mask up when you are not actively eating or drinking. Understand that the University has a vaccination and booster requirement in place for its community members and strongly encourages all guests to also be fully vaccinated and boosted (if eligible). Commencement Week COVID Protocols (May 22–29) Effective May 22–29, 2022 For more information on Harvard’s COVID-19 practices, visit Harvard.edu/coronavirus. During Commencement Week, the Central Quad buildings will be open to all visitors without prior notice or approval, expecting that the Commencement COVID protocols will be followed.  While almost all Commencement activities will be outdoors, we strongly recommend the use of well-fitting masks for those who desire added protection. The Class Day Awards Ceremony, Graduation Address, 2022 HKS Diploma Ceremony, and 2020-2021 HKS Diploma Ceremony will be livestreamed for those who wish to view virtually due to health concerns. General COVID-19 Protocols Testing The following guidelines will be updated soon to follow the University’s new protocols for Commencement week and forthcoming HKS guidance for the rest of June. Per University protocols, HKS community members are no longer required to test for COVID except if they are experiencing any COVID symptoms or if they are a close contacts of someone who has tested positive.  What happens if I test positive? If you test positive through Color, you will receive an email from HUHS with guidance on isolation procedures and instructions to identify and notify your close contacts.  If you test positive through a non-Harvard test (outside of Color), please report it to HUHS via Crimson Clear to receive email instructions from HUHS.  Rapid antigen tests are accepted by HUHS as proof of positive status. However, note that for travel some countries still require a PCR test as proof. Please review this document with more information on what to do after testing positive.  Isolation If you test positive for COVID-19, please see HUHS guidelines for the latest information on isolation requirements. Contact Tracing When HUHS emails individuals who have tested positive, the message includes instructions for how to identify and communicate with close contacts.  It is important as a community that we do our best to follow these instructions closely. Masks Masks are strongly encouraged in both indoor and outdoor gatherings. Masks are required at the Kennedy School:   for individuals completing isolation or quarantine;   in classes and seminars where mask-wearing is required by the instructors; and   in small meetings where one of the participants asks other participants to wear masks.   Everyone should carry a mask for when you find yourself in situations where mask-wearing is required. We should all respect and support a range of individual approaches to mask-wearing.  Boosters Per University policy, all community members must have gotten a booster shot and have submitted documentation to HUHS. Students must also satisfy Harvard’s other vaccination requirements.   Visitor Policy: Who can visit HKS? Please see the visitor policy below. Support Resources If you have concerns related to risk or care responsibilities, please talk with your program director (for students), your manager or Human Resources representative (for staff, including fellows), or the academic deans (for faculty). For more general support, please reach out to Harvard’s Counseling and Mental Health Services (for students), the Employee Assistance Program (for staff and faculty), and the Harvard chaplains (for everyone). Everyone should be prepared to make adjustments and to demonstrate empathy, respect, and flexibility. Information for DEGREE PROGRAM STUDENTS Information, updates, and FAQs for students. Students Faculty, Staff, and Resident Fellows Find information about operations on campus, health protocols, and how to stay informed. Faculty, Staff and Resident Fellows EXECUTIVE EDUCATION PARTICIPANTS See updates and resources related to our executive education programs. Exec Ed Policies To be updated as state, local, or university requirements change Visitor Policy Who can visit? Because COVID-19 continues to pose a public health concern, we will keep HKS buildings closed to the general public and allow invited visitors only, where a visitor is anyone who does not hold a Harvard University ID or “person of interest” designation (such as someone working for a contractor, like Securitas). What procedures apply to visits? All visitors must have a designated HKS staff, student, or faculty member to serve as a host. The host is responsible for the visitor’s compliance with HKS’s health protocols and visitor procedures, including notifying the visitor of the University’s Health and Wellbeing Guidelines and its Post-travel-Covid-testing policy. All visitors must attest to their host in advance of their visit that they have been fully vaccinated and boosted with a vaccine approved by the FDA or WHO, or that they claim a medical or religious exemption; exceptions will be granted only to immediate family members coming on an emergency basis. A Vaccination Attestation Form is available on our website. As soon as possible prior to a visitor’s arrival, the host must send a brief email to Brian Conroy (Director of Security) indicating: the host, the visitor’s name, the date and time of arrival Visitors staying more than four hours on campus must receive a negative result from a COVID-19 test taken within 48 hours prior to their arrival. Visitors must attest to their negative result and that they are not feeling ill or exhibiting symptoms associated with COVID-19 to their host prior to arrival. A Negative Test and Wellness Attestation form is available on our website. Health and Safety Accountability and Compliance We each must play a role in ensuring the health, safety, and well-being of everyone in our community. Adherence to Harvard University, local, state, and federal guidelines is critical to protect our community members. Everyone who comes to campus must abide by our Norms and Expectations for Keeping HKS Healthy. COVID vaccinations and booster shots are required by Harvard University for all students, staff, faculty, and researchers who have a regular presence on campus, with exemptions allowed for medical or religious reasons. Harvard University Health Services (HUHS) is managing the vaccination reporting process and coordinating with school leaders on any needed follow up actions. More information about the vaccination and booster requirements can be found here. Masks  are generally not required; however they are still required in certain settings (see above). Anyone who wishes to wear a mask should feel free to do so in any setting.. And it is important that anyone feeling unwell stay home and not come to campus and should report symptoms through Crimson Clear. Community-Based Monitoring All community members model and self-regulate. Gently remind each other of the protocols. Community members may share concerns or report a potential issue by sending an email to covidinfo@hks.harvard.edu. Reported compliance issues will be categorized into 1 of 3 levels and will be treated in a sensitive and private manner. Compliance Categories – three levels Compliance issues are categorized into 1 of 3 levels: 1. MINOR OVERSIGHT / ACCIDENTAL Administrative Oversight (campus security, CPO, HR, DPSA) or fellow colleagues/students should provide gentle policy reminders. 2. REPEATED / SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS Administrative Oversight & Coaching: Program Director (students), Manager/HR (staff), Academic Deans’ Office (faculty) Review policies, including Norms and Expectations for Keeping HKS Healthy, and retake online University training. Significant concerns could result in loss of some campus access privileges (case-by-case basis). Individuals will be provided reminders, offered resources, and have a chance to have their questions answered. 3. REFUSAL TO COMPLY / SERIOUS CONCERNS Serious concerns will be reviewed by the COVID Health and Safety Committee. Committee members include Debbie Isaacson (students), Pam Cozza (staff and fellows), Suzanne Cooper (faculty). If appropriate, existing disciplinary processes for students, staff, and faculty will be followed: Harvard Kennedy School Student Handbook Harvard Kennedy School Faculty Handbook Harvard Union for Clerical and Technical Workers Personnel Manual Staff Personnel Manual for non-union staff Building Access Entering/Exiting Central Quad Campus Central quad perimeter and courtyard doors will be accessible via HU ID card (tap ID on reader to unlock doors) Monday-Friday, 7am-7pm for HU ID Holders ONLY.
