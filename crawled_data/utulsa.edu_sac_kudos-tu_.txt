Close Search / Staff Advisory Council / Kudos TU Kudos TU STAFF ADVISORY COUNCIL Staff Commitment Awards Kudos TU Contact SAC In 2019, the Employee Recognition Subcommittee of the Staff Advisory Council at The University of Tulsa recognized a need to acknowledge and reward people who work at the university for going the extra mile. As a special thank you, these people are invited to a monthly appreciation reception hosted by the TU Staff Advisory Council. Due to the move to remote work in 2020, the Kudos TU program transformed quickly into a Kwik-Kudos app that allows employees to recognize each other publicly while working on or off campus. Employees can log in to access the app at https://utulsa.edu/kwik-kudos.
