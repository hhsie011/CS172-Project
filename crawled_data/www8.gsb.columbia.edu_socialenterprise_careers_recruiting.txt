This network, a diverse group of social enterprise students, practitioners, and business leaders, continues to grow in numbers and in the variety of industries, organizations, and functional areas it represents. Organizations looking to recruit MBA students and alumni for summer internships or full-time positions can submit job postings online with the Career Management Center, or contact the Tamer Center for Social Enterprise. The Tamer Center for Social Enterprise encourages Columbia Business School alumni and students—whether they are looking for the best-qualified job candidates or for the best avenues for furthering their careers in social enterprise areas —to access these online resources. In addition, we recommend that alumni update their profile and upload their resume in BANC, which can be searched by interest area and provides access to a broad range of business and nonprofit job postings.
