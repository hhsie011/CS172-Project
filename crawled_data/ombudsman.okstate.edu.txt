The OSU Ombuds Office was established by the Office of the President to promote a supportive learning and working environment at OSU. The office serves as a resource for all members of the OSU community on the Stillwater, OSU-Tulsa and OSU-IT in Okmulgee campuses. Services are provided for faculty, students, and staff, and offer a safe, CONFIDENTIAL, place to talk about campus-related problems and concerns, between or among individuals and/or with organizations.
