The Uniform Guidance (UG) streamlines and supersedes guidance previously contained in eight separate OMB Circulars. For Institutions of Higher Education, like the University of Miami, the UG supersedes OMB Circulars A-110, A-21 and A-133. Included in the guidance are uniform administrative requirements (pre and post award), cost principles, audit requirements and definitions. Below are links to the Uniform Guidiance Part Title 2 last amended 10/18/2021. Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards The Uniform Guidance is broken down into Subparts. Subpart A - Acronyms and Definitions Subpart B - General Provisions Subpart C - Pre Award Requirements Subpart D - Post Award Requirements Subpart E - Cost Principles Subpart F - Audit Requirements Appendices - Some of the rules were not incorporated into the consolidated set of guidance, but rather remained applicable only to a specific type of entity. These rules are incorporated into the appendices. Appendix III is applicable to Institutions of Higher Education. There is a Compliance Supplement and an Award Term and Condition for Recipient Integrity and Performance Matters.
