Our place in the industry is sacred, because we operate as an independent entity dedicated to identifying viable research endeavors that will serve, first and foremost, humanity. At the Moulder Center, graduate and undergraduate students work alongside experienced drug discovery scientists, learn modern techniques required for the successful identification of the next generation of therapies, and play key roles in research collaborations. As members of the team, students gain expertise in using research tools, including parallel synthesis, high throughput screening, molecular biology, and pharmacokinetics. The Moulder Center was established in 2009 with a donation from Lonnie and Sharon Moulder, alumni of the Temple University School of Pharmacy. Their intention was to support the creation of a multidisciplinary research hub for the development of scientific discoveries identified by Temple University faculty and scientists. Today’s Moulder Center, the manifestation of this intention, attracts funding from a variety of sources, including the U.S. government, private foundations, alumni, industry partners, and other advocates.
