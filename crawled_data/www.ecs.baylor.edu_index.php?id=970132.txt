He was drawn to Baylor through his high school best friend, who encouraged him to apply. From his first steps on the campus, Tullis learned that the Baylor experience wasn’t just about what happened in the classroom. It was also a great time to grow his leadership skills and further his walk with Christ. Kimmie Sandusky Kimmie Sandusky was the first Baylor engineering student to graduate with a concentration in Humanitarian Engineering. When she was in high school, Kimmie went on a mission trip to Jamaica and helped build a church. She said she fell in love with doing things cross-culturally and being able to do something physically that helped people and gave God’s glory on Earth. That's where her story began at Baylor. Mario Lopez Mario Lopez, a senior computer science major, took a long and winding road to Baylor. Read his story to learn more about how his experience at Baylor prepared him to succeed.
