The concentration provides students with a broad-based understanding in fundamental molecular sciences, as well as a background for graduate studies in physical chemistry, chemical physics, or molecular engineering. Concentrators are required to take twenty courses in chemistry, physics, and mathematics, although approved courses in applied mathematics, biology, computer science, geological sciences, or engineering may be substitutes. Chemical Physics concentrators are also advised to take at least six courses in the humanities and social sciences. Chemical Physics concentrators at all levels (first-year through seniors) are actively involved in research with faculty members in both departments. Here's what concentrators from the classes of 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020, reported they were doing in their first year after graduation. 2020 Graduate School Yale University, PhD, Physics 2019 Employment Junior Software Developer, Stellar Science 2017 Graduate School PhD PhD 2015 Graduate School University of California, Berkeley, PhD, Chemistry 2014 Graduate School University of South Carolina, PhD, Chemical Engineering and Business 2013 Graduate School Johns Hopkins University - Arts, Sciences and Engineering, PhD, Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering Fellowships European ScienceFoundation 2012 Employment Scientific Associate, D.
