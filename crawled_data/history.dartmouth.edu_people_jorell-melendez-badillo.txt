Melendez-Badillo |Assistant Professor Academic Appointments Assistant Professor of History Mellon Faculty Fellow, Dartmouth College, 2018-20 Jorell A. Meléndez-Badillo is a historian of Latin America and the Caribbean with a particular focus on the global circulation of radical ideas from the standpoint of working-class intellectual communities. His book, The Lettered Barriada: Workers and the Politics of Knowledge in Early Twentieth-Century Puerto Rico (Duke UP, 2021), tells the story of how a cluster of self-educated workers burst into Puerto Rico’s world of letters at the turn of the twentieth century. These workers navigated the polity that emerged from the 1898 U.S. occupation by asserting themselves as citizens, as producers of their own historical narratives, and, ultimately, as learned minds. His book shifts the historiographical focus from class-based analyses towards the study of workers’ intellectual yearnings, aesthetic sensibilities, and radical desires. Dr. Meléndez-Badillo is currently writing a trade book titled Puerto Rico: A National History (under contract with Princeton University Press). The book offers an accessible introduction to Puerto Rico, its history, and the contemporary political moment. It is a national history of a country without a nation-state. It tells the story of how Puerto Rico has been colonized for more than five centuries. However, it also documents how the people have resisted colonial domination. Ultimately, the book will provide unfamiliar readers with an informed argument of how and why Puerto Rico arrived at its current juncture, as well as how Puerto Ricans are imagining possible futures in the face of austerity, failing infrastructures, and the rubble left behind by colonial neglect He is also working on another monograph-length research project, tentatively titled Following the Revolution: Juan Francisco and Blanca Moncaleano's Transnational Militancy, 1910-1916. It explores the materiality of working-class intellectual communities in Latin America, the Caribbean, and the U.S. borderlands by rethinking the role of anarchist newspaper production. Beyond their propagandistic ethos, newspapers served as nodes that facilitated the creation of transregional anarchist cartographies. Meléndez-Badillo holds a Ph.D. in Latin American History from the University of Connecticut, where he was a Ford Foundation Fellow and a Humanities Institute Fellow. He is the author of Voces libertarias: Los orígenes del anarquismo en Puerto Rico (Secret Sailor Books, 2013; Fundación Anselmo Lorenzo-CNT, 2014; Editorial Akelarre/CEISO, 2015), editor of Páginas libres: Breve antología del pensamiento anarquista en Puerto Rico, 1900-1919 (Editora Educación Emergente, 2021), and the co-editor of Without Borders or Limits: An Interdisciplinary Approach to Anarchist Studies (Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2013). His work on the histories of anarchism, labor, and radical politics has also been published in book chapters, as well as journal and newspaper articles in Puerto Rico and Latin America. His work has appeared in Caribbean Studies Journal, Latin American Perspectives, and Theory in Action, among others. He is a co-founder (2018), co-chair (2018-20), and chair (2020-21) of the Latin American Studies Association’s Puerto Rico Section. He is also a member of the Executive Committee for the New England Humanities Consortium's Faculty of Color Working Group. + View more View Curriculum Vitae Personal Website Contact Jorell.A.Melendez-Badillo@Dartmouth.edu 201 Carson Hall HB 6107 Education Ph.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of History Undergraduate Overview History FAQs for First Year and Transfer Students How to Declare a Major or Minor in History Major Modified Major Minor Transfer Credit Policy Course Descriptions First-Year Seminars Introductory Africa, Asia, Latin America & The Caribbean (AALAC) Europe (EUR) Interregional & Comparative (INTER) United States (US) Seminars & Colloquia Independent Study & Honors Course Schedule 2021-2022 Schedule 2022-2023 Schedule 2023-2024 Schedule Course Syllabi Honors Thesis Program General Timeline Guidelines for the Class of 2022 Guidelines for the Class of 2023 Honors Theses By Year Phi Alpha Theta Honors Society Prizes After Graduation Alumni Update Research Overview Faculty Research Initiatives Dartmouth History Institute Student Research Initiatives and Resources The Dartmouth Vietnam Project History Librarian Research Funding Resources Undergraduate Research Database Student Class Projects Foreign Study News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
