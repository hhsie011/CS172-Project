Federal agencies such as the NIH, NSF, DOE, DOD, NASA, and others with extramural research and development budgets set aside funds for contracts and grant awards to small businesses with the goal of stimulating technological innovation and developing products with commercial value. Each year, eleven government agencies distribute over $3.5 billion to small businesses through SBIR and STTR programs. SBIR/STTR grants may exceed $1 million, and are typically provided over two distinct phases (note: varies by funding agency): Phase I awards: typically provide about $150,000 for feasibility studies and proof-of-concept experimentation. Phase II awards: if Phase I proves successful, the company may apply for a Phase II award providing upwards of $1.5 million over multiple years. Phase II expands upon the initial Phase I results and further develops the concept, usually to the prototype stage. Only Phase I awardees are eligible to participate.
