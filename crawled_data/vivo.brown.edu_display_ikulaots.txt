In 1997, he enrolled in the Ph.D. program of the School of Engineering at Brown University, where he received an MS degree in Applied Mathematics in 2000 and a Ph.D. degree in Chemical Engineering in 2001. After receiving his Ph.D., Dr. Külaots continued his research and teaching career at his alma mater first as a Senior Research Engineer then as a Lecturer and in 2017 he was appointed to a Senior Lecturer position.

Full Text PubMed Research Research Overview Dr. Külaots' research involves several research branches with a unifying theme: energy and its impact on the environment. Research Statement Dr. Külaots is actively involved in thermal exfoliation of graphene oxide projects with the aim to synthesize multiple graphene-based materials for environmental applications. For example, his team has synthesized graphene-based materials that interact with Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). Monolayer graphene with a theoretical surface area of 2600 m2/g, has great potential in the fields of catalysis, separation, adsorption, and gas storage if properly converted into bulk materials. Processing graphene often leads to the stacking of graphene layers. As the number of graphene sheets per stack increases and if the layers interlayer spaces (gallery) is not accessible, the surface area will drop according to the power-law: Area ~ (Number of graphene sheets)-1. The 0.335 nm inter-planar spaces of crystalline graphite are not accessible to N2 at 77K or CO2 at 273K, but the potential accessibility of enlarged spaces in reassembled and deformed graphene, graphene oxide, or pillared materials provide opportunities to create high-area bulk materials. With current graphene manufacturing technology, it is hard to believe that graphene will be a viable candidate as a sorbent material any time soon Dr. Külaots' research team investigates bio-wastes, which clearly pose a risk to the environment if disposed of in open dumps. These carbonized biomaterials, with a high network of super-micropores, micropores, and mesopores offer great opportunities for use in various environmental applications. Our early results suggest that these bio-waste chars are likely candidates for sorbent materials for few EPA top list pollutants. Dr. Külaots collaborates with Dr. Suuberg in his research on oil shale byproduct semi-coke, coal combustion, and coal byproduct fly ash. The majority of oil shale literature focuses on oil shale retorting processes, quantifying extractable oil, and general characteristics of the oil derived from shale. Only a scant amount of the oil shale literature focuses on the characterization of oil shale semicokes, and even less investigates semicoke organic char. The current widely used technology for oil shale oil retorting process negatively impacts the environment, since it produces vast amounts of organic-rich oil shale semi-coke. Most of this semi-coke ends up in open dumps and therefore poses threat to the environment. The organic matter of this semi-coke can be as high as 18 wt-%, and the specific surface area around 550 m2/g. The question is, what can be done with this organic-rich semi-coke material besides just blending it with other fuels and feeding it to municipal scale boiler systems? In addition, we are looking into oil shale semi-coke contamination with significant levels of phenols, PAHs, or harmful heavy metals.
