There’s no better time to be a Louisville Cardinal, and visiting campus through one of our unique programs is a great way to do so! Year-round opportunities: Campus Visit Program In-person and virtual opportunities are now available. Are you interested in coming to visit the campus individually or with your family? Our campus visit program allows you to choose the day that best works for your schedule. Come hear an admissions presentation, tour campus, and meet with an academic department representative. Up Close and Personal (UCP) 1-on-1 Shadow Visit Shadow visitors will join us on campus, and portions of their visit may be virtual. It’s time for you to get "Up Close and Personal" with UofL, through our 1 on 1 shadow visit program, where you can become a college student for a day! Spend the morning or afternoon with a current UofL student and participate in activities with him/her such as sitting in on a class, grabbing a bite to eat at one of our on-campus eateries and conversing with your guide about their personal UofL experience. You’ll also have a chance to meet with an Admissions counselor about scholarship opportunities. OYES (Order Your Educational Steps) In-person and virtual opportunities are available. Interested in showing your student group why it really is happening here at UofL? Then our OYES Group Visits are just what you're looking for!
