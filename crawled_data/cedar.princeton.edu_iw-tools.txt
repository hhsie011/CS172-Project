There are currently more than 30 individual data marts in the Warehouse, including those focusing on graduate and undergraduate admission, student records, human resources, facilities and finance. Data in the Warehouse are loaded on a nightly basis from the various source transactional systems and are made available through the use of both the IBM/COGNOS and Tableau Business Intelligence tools. Approximately two million reports (~8000 unique) are run from the Warehouse annually, touching almost all Princeton administrative offices and departments. The Warehouse resides behind PUaccess, requires a Princeton NetID and password, and is available from 8AM to midnight. Individual Data Marts in the Warehouse are loaded during the time when the system is unavailable.
