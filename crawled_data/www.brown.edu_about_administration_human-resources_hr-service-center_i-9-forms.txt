Student Employees All students who work on campus must complete an I-9 Form prior to starting work. The I-9 Form is completed electronically in Workday. Please click here to view the student instructions for completing the I-9 in Workday. An important part of the process is presenting the proper documentation for the I-9 at the HR Service Center. Students can submit the I-9 Form in Workday prior to bringing their I-9 documentation to the HR Service Center. Please refer to The List of Acceptable Documents for guidance on the types of documents required, and please note that all documents presented must be original and unexpired.
