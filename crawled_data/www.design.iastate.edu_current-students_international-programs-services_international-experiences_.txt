International Programs & Services Welcome The Office of International Programs and Services in the College of Design is made up of several essential services and special programming including international student support, a robust portfolio of study abroad offerings and our flagship Rome Program. There is also a section dedicated to provide information for faculty-led initiatives abroad. Local + Global + Design= “Glocal” Solutions & Sustainable Futures As designers, we are creating the interface through which people interact with the world. The power we have in our hands is to shape and evoke emotional and intellectual responses in people- Noteh Krauss, designer Global leadership is defined as leading people who are based in multiple regions of the world. They need to engage very diverse and distributed groups of stakeholders and colleagues to get things done. In a global economy, it is becoming increasingly more important to understand the wants and needs of those we serve, that is, the internal and external stakeholders. Having awareness of this need means that leaders must be able to shape the culture of their organizations to address changing stakeholder needs. Today’s greatest opportunities, and also the greatest challenges we face, are global in nature and therefore demand designers as leaders who are also global. But what does “global” really mean? The old mantra “think global, act local” is woefully inadequate to describe the complex realities global leaders face. Truly global leaders act as bridge builders, connectors of resources and talent across cultural and political boundaries — relentlessly dedicated to finding new ways of creating value. They don’t just think and act global, they are global.
