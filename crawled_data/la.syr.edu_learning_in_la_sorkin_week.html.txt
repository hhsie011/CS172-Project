Since its establishment in 2006, the highly successful learning practicum has remained the cornerstone of Syracuse University's immersion experience. Based in the College of Visual and Performing Arts and supported by Sorkin, the practicum provides students with a week-long "hit the studios running" immersion in the heart of America's film and television industries. Students vie for a Sorkin Week spot and the chance to meet and learn from a growing number of well-placed industry alumni. Students also hear from young alumni living and working in Los Angeles who discuss their personal experiences, insight into establishing a career in the entertainment industry, and adjusting to life in Southern California.
