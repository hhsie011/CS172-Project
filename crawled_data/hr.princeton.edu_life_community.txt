Diversity, equity, and inclusion are central to who we are and how we impact society. We seek individuals who bring curiosity and a diversity of viewpoints and cultures, and who can share their exceptional ability and promise with those they serve. No matter where you reside within the University, we encourage you to bring your whole self to Princeton, which enables Princeton to achieve its mission and reach its true potential. For learning opportunities and other resources to support employees, refer to Inclusivity Resources for Employees. Employee Resource Groups Nearly half of Princeton University employees engage in one or more of Princeton’s employee resource groups (ERGs). These volunteer, employee-led organizations are comprised of professionals from across the University who come together based on shared interests, experiences, and/or identities. ERGs work to create a more inclusive environment and sense of belonging within the University while also remaining engaged with external communities. Read the ERGs' joint statement in support of racial equity and inclusion. Membership and participation in all ERGs are open to all employees, regardless of identity. Participating is an excellent way to connect, learn, build ally-ship, and grow at work. The ERGs work closely with Human Resources to develop annual work plans, creating value in the following ways: Create community for enhanced employee engagement and retention through networking, knowledge sharing, and increased cultural understanding and connection. Leverage both campus resources and external professional networks for personal and professional growth and development. Share employee experiences with prospective candidates and collaborate in the hiring process to foster positive candidate and onboarding experiences. Engage in local community outreach and partnerships. Email us for more information.
