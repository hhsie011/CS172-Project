Education of students within the context of these standards (which include honesty and personal integrity, respect for others, assumption of appropriate responsibility for oneâ€™s own behavior) occurs both preventatively (publications, presentations, interaction) and reflectively (through the judicial process). Corollary to the education of students is the protection of the University community. Standards of student conduct ensure respect for all members of the community and maintenance of an environment conductive to learning and personal growth. Protection of the community occurs initially through educating students about appropriate behavior and decision-making and subsequently through adjudication of inappropriate behavior when education has not enabled students to live within University standards.
