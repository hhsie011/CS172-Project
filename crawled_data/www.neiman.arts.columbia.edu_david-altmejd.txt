The portfolio is composed of a series of portraits based on photographs Altmejd took of studio assistants as well as the staff and students working at the Neiman Center. He inverted and embellished each photograph to obscure and transform his subjects into otherworldly creatures. Ringers debuted at the E/AB Fair in November 2014. Faye Hirsch reviewed Ringers in the March/April 2015 issue of Art in Print. David Altmejd (b. 1974, Montreal, Canada) is a sculptor who lives and works in New York. He received an MFA from Columbia University in 2001. Altmejd’s work has been the subject of a major retrospective at the Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, which travelled to the Mudam Luxembourg and the Museée d'art contemporain de Montréal and is in numerous public collections including the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Dallas Museum of Art, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and the Whitney Museum of American Art.
