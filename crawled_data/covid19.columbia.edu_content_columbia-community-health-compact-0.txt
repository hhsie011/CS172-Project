While we have successfully emerged from a period of over one year during which we minimized the risk of COVID-19 transmission on campus, we must remain vigilant. This compact is our community’s continued commitment to recognize our shared responsibility for community health, informed by science and founded on mutual respect. All of us at Columbia—students, faculty, and staff—commit to doing what we can to reduce and stop transmission of COVID-19 within and around the University community. The University commits to doing the same. As Members of This Compact, Each of Us Commits to: Get vaccinated (excluding those with an approved medical or religious exemption) Complete Columbia’s symptom tracker app every day before coming to campus or leaving a campus residence hall, and stay home when sick Continue to follow basic health precautions including frequent hand-washing/sanitizing Comply with any requirements to use face coverings or physical distancing Respect that there may be Columbia affiliates who choose to wear face coverings when not required and that no judgments or assumptions should be made with respect to these individuals Follow signs and guidance posted throughout campus spaces and buildings Participate in testing, contact tracing, and isolation and quarantine protocols, when required Follow all University policies and procedures At all times, including when off campus, all Columbia community members are expected to follow city and state public health requirements. The University Pledges to Do Its Part, by: Providing proper air circulation and maximum air filtration in Columbia buildings Employing rigorous cleaning and sanitizing throughout all campuses Developing and carrying out symptom tracking Training all community members on Columbia’s health policy and guidance Supporting COVID-19 vaccination, testing, contact tracing, quarantine, and isolation Sharing information in a prompt and consistent manner Providing other health and well-being supports for the University community (e.g., face coverings, hand sanitizer, flu shots) Each of us has the responsibility to follow through on these commitments and the right to expect the same from others and from the University. The University’s expectation is that all students, faculty, and staff will adhere to these commitments. ;In the interest of supporting community health and safety, anyone who does not adhere to these commitments after being asked to do so by an appropriate authority will be asked to leave Columbia’s campus. These commitments are essential to protecting the public’s health, and to protecting ourselves, our neighbors, and each other. Each of us has an important a role to play, and together, we can do what it takes to reduce and stop COVID-19 transmission in our shared Columbia community.
