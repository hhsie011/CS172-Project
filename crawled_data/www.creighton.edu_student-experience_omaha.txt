You’re a perfect fit. Maybe you’re looking for a college in a friendly, easy-to-live place with lively neighborhoods where you can really feel like part of the community. Or maybe you’re looking to find a city with culture to spare, good food, plenty of live music—and access to nature, too. In Omaha, you get both. It won’t take you long to feel like you’re at home here; we can’t wait to show you around! Students Explain: What is Omaha Like? Watch Video In the Middle of It All Step off campus, and you’ll be in the middle of historic, revitalized neighborhoods — each with plenty of dining, live music, shopping and entertainment.

You can stand in two states at the same time! Stroll Over “The Bob” Get your culture on. Go to a museum in one of the most admired art deco buildings in the world during the day then turn up to a Broadway show or stand-up performance at night. Living in one of the Midwest’s biggest cities means there’s always something to see. Explore the Joslyn Art Museum’s Collection See a Show at Omaha Performing Arts Take a Class at the Hot Shops Art Center Image Turn it up! Omaha’s both an incubator for homegrown music and a regular tour stop for international acts. Whether you’re looking for rock, country and folk, jazz, hip-hop or something else, you’ll hear it here. Slowdown: This popular indie music venue is operated by Saddle Creek Records, home to artists such as Big Thief, Bright Eyes and Black Belt Eagle Scout. Maha Festival: This multi-day summertime staple brings big-name acts and speakers. Midtown Crossing: More outdoor concerts! Jazz on the Green and Playing with Fire, a blues fest. CHI Health Center Omaha: Catch some of the biggest acts in the business at this 18,000-seat arena just a mile from campus. Image Bluejays, and a lot more. Creighton fields 14 NCAA Division I teams in eight sports. Our men’s basketball team, which plays in the 18,000-seat CHI Health Center Omaha, earns regular bids to the Big Dance — the NCAA Tournament. Our men’s and women’s soccer teams, which both play in the 7,500-seat Morrison Stadium, have also been to the NCAA Tournament several times, and our volleyball team is routinely ranked among the best in the nation. Omaha has plenty of action outside of Bluejay athletics, too. Every year, the College World Series plays in downtown’s TD Ameritrade Park, and we’re the home of the U.S. Olympic Swim Trials. And you can check out future stars watching the Omaha Storm Chasers, the Triple-A affiliate of the Kansas City Royals, and the Omaha Lancers USHL hockey team.
