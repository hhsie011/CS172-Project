In the event of a campus emergency, it is vital that SMU students, faculty and staff know what to do. Common sense, opportunity, and personal experience all play a part in responding to emergencies. But whether the threat is fire, a weather emergency or an active shooter, preparation for an evacuation, shelter, or lockdown will be applicable in most emergency situations.
