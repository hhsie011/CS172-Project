We, humans, are relatives of one another, and we are relatives with the rest of Creation. This Lecture on Identity and Equity is grounded on the view, that we humans are brothers and sisters, whoever we happen to be, wherever we happen to live, wherever we happen to have come from, and whatever our means of livelihood. Among the primates, we humans have the greatest brain capacity. We use it for both self-enhancement and also self-annihilation. Despite their big brains, their limbs are too weak and small in contrast with the herbivores and carnivores on land, and the big fish in the oceans. To survive, humans invented Culture, through which to regulate the conduct of all sectors of human identity. Humans have manipulated and annihilated each other. Civilizations have risen and fallen through internal decay and also through conquest by invaders. Humans have destroyed their habitat with disastrous consequences. Migrations have often resulted from the destruction of habitats at home. Humans leave their artifacts behind as they migrate. Archeologists have given us insights into our past civilizations and migrations reminding us how closely related we are. Expand all Collapse all Moderator Bio Prof. Jesse N.K.
