Unlike a term paper written as a course assignment, the thesis is the product of an effort equivalent to two courses taken over two semesters on a global issue of your choosing. The thesis also differs from a term paper in its depth and breadth. It is an original work of research and writing that is conceptualized within, and makes some contribution to, scholarly and policy debates in international relations. As such, the thesis deals with more complex ideas or problems, asks more probing questions, presents more detailed evidence, and generates more insightful conclusions than a typical term paper. Students must demonstrate mastery of a comprehensive body of academic literature, formulate a significant research problem, use research methods in an appropriate manner, analyze evidence, and produce original conclusions. For most students, the thesis is the first real attempt at scholarly research and writing. The length of the thesis varies depending on the topic and approach, but the average is 130 double-spaced pages using standard font (12 point) and margins. The IR Honors Program is interdisciplinary, enabling students to conduct research on a wide variety of topics and from many perspectives including historical and comparative work. IR Honors students have written theses on topics such as: femicide humanitarian intervention democratic transitions regional integration international aid ethnic conflict energy security statehood migration human security international trade human rights international governance media extradition environmental issues democracy promotion international political economy international education border violence refugees terrorism emerging markets human smuggling soft power Note: An honors thesis done in IR may not be used as a senior thesis in another department or program, nor may a senior thesis written for another concentration be submitted as an IR thesis.
