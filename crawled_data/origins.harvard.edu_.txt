Welcome to the Origins of Life Initiative, a biochemical journey through the Universe. The Origins of Life Initiative supports multi-disciplinary research aimed at revealing if life is abundant in the Universe.

Using this knowledge, it will eventually be possible to study the atmospheres of far distant planets for signs of life, including planets that might be Earth twins.
