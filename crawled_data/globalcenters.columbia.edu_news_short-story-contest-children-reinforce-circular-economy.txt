Children can help to raise awareness of the worldwide environmental situation and mobilize adults to rethink their consumption habits and their relationship with the planet,” said the Santiago Center Director, Karen Poniachik. The contest, entitled “Chile Circular sin Basura en 360 Palabras” (Circular Chile without Trash in 360 Words), will run through September 20. There are three categories for girls and boys residing in Chile: 7-10 years old, 11-14 years old and 15-18 years old. Each category is named according to native species in Chile: Chungungo (marine otter), Chinchilla (chinchilla, a crepuscular rodent) and Lagarto Gruñidor (grunter lizard), respectively. “This contest provides children and youth the opportunity to tell us from their viewpoint, and from the power of their pen, how they see the circular economy in 360 words,” noted Environment Minister Carolina Schmidt. “Reduce, Reuse and Recycle is the message with which we hope to reach every home.” The place chosen for the launch was the Jorge Hunneus school in the borough of La Pintana. The school, which has 3500 students, is Level of Excellence certified by the Environment Ministry, the highest such ranking, thanks to its work in waste management, water and energy efficiency, and because it has transversally reinforced environmental content in all subjects. The contest rules and instructions to upload the written stories can be found at this link and the results will be published on October 2 – Chile’s National Environment Day.
