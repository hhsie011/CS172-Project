Yet evaluation is difficult and also very costly, so it’s critically important to do it right—picking the right outcomes, measuring them properly, and using the results to improve the quality of education. In this half-day meeting, we brought together educational leaders from New York City’s public, private, and nonprofit sectors for an exchange of ideas on how to apply evaluation effectively.
