Swearer Engaged Faculty Awards The Howard R. Swearer Engaged Faculty Awards are annual awards that recognize and celebrate excellence in community-engaged scholarship by Brown University faculty. The Engaged Faculty Awards for Research and Teaching may also serve as a springboard for nominations to national awards such as the Ernest A. Lynton Award for the Scholarship of Engagement for Early Career Faculty and the Thomas Ehrlich Civically Engaged Faculty Award. Structure Two awards are presented annually: The Engaged Faculty Award for Teaching recognizes innovative pedagogy that produces high-impact learning experiences and collaborative educational partnerships that address major social challenges and contribute to tangible public benefit. The Engaged Faculty Award for Research honors faculty whose research engages community partners in reciprocal relationships to co-produce knowledge, resulting in public value and recognizable scholarly impacts in their field(s) of inquiry. Each faculty award carries a $5,000 total prize, $3,000 of which goes to the faculty recipient’s department for their professional development, research, or other appropriate uses, and $2,000 to their designated community partner(s). Eligibility All regular faculty (including tenure-track and tenured), medical faculty, and term faculty (adjuncts, lecturers, visiting faculty, postdoctoral fellows) are eligible to apply for the Engaged Faculty Award for Research. All regular faculty and term faculty who teach undergraduate students are eligible to apply for the Engaged Faculty Award for Teaching.
