Out of a desire to enhance exposure to breadth of topics in global health, to further development of a learning community amongst residents, and to foster mentoring relationships between residents and faculty active in global health, a residency pathway was developed and approved in the fall of 2009. The first group of scholars entered in July of 2010. Goals The goal of the BRIGHT pathway is to allow scholars to: Deepen their understanding of global healthcare, as it pertains to patients both within Rhode Island and abroad with a particular emphasis on historically resource-poor nations and ethnic groups Obtain experience in the practice of medicine in these settings and Pursue scholarly projects in preparation for long-term involvement in global health following post-graduate training. Eligibility Applications are considered from PGY1 residents from internal medicine, pediatrics, combined internal medicine-pediatrics, triple board, and obstetrics and gynecology programs at Brown. Enrollment in the pathway is contingent upon good academic standing verified by the program director. Support The BRIGHT Pathway was founded with generous support of the Departments of Medicine and Pediatrics as well as a Framework Grant from the Brown Global Health Initiative.
