The NAS was signed into being by President Abraham Lincoln on March 3, 1863, at the height of the Civil War. As mandated in its Act of Incorporation, the NAS has, since 1863, served to “investigate, examine, experiment, and report upon any subject of science or art” whenever called upon to do so by any department of the government. 2022 – Elizabeth Buffalo, Physiology and Biophysics 2022 – Joseph Mougous, Microbiology 2022 – Jay Shendure, Genome Sciences 2022 – James Truman, Biology 2021 – Rachel Wong, Biological Structure 2021 – Rachel Klevit, Biochemistry 2021 – Julie Theriot, Biology 2021 – Anna Karlin, Computer Science and Engineering 2021 – Randy LeVeque, Applied Mathematics 2019 – Chris Bretherton, Atmospheric Sciences and Applied Mathematics 2017 – John E.
