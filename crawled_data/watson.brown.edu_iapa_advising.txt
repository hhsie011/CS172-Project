The IAPA concentration seeks to match students to the faculty advisors that they (the students) request. In many cases, the concentration is able to honor the students’ first preferences. In some cases, however, students will not be matched with the faculty advisors that they request. This generally happens if and when a given faculty member already has a very high number of advisees. Spreading advising responsibilities across the faculty ensures that students will receive the attention they deserve. At the same time, regardless of particular advisor assignments, students are encouraged to reach out to any faculty member they would like to discuss scholarly issues or other topics of interest. This is best done by requesting an office hours appointment with the relevant professor. All of these advisors should be seen as mentors, people who are willing to meet, share their knowledge, direct students to additional advising resources if their own knowledge doesn’t cover the issue at hand, and generally lend a sympathetic ear.
