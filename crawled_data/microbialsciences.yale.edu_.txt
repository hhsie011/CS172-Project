We live in a world of bacteria, viruses, and other microbes. Infectious diseases shape human history and present critical challenges around the world. We’re beginning to appreciate how the enormous microbial communities in our gut microbiome and elsewhere can determine our health, susceptibility to disease, and response to treatment. Microbes provide the chemical diversity that is the foundation of modern medicine and many industrial processes, control the world’s climate and food supply, and continue to reveal fundamental processes in molecular biology, ecology, and evolution. The MSI, located at Yale West Campus, provides a central hub where students and faculty bring diverse perspectives and expertise to push the boundaries of microbiology. The institute promotes interaction and collaboration through regular seminars from lab members and international leaders in microbiology, off-site retreats, and informal discussions among evolutionary biologists, biophysicists, chemists, geneticists, and others focused on understanding the microbial world. I hope you enjoy our website. Please explore MSI research and MSI news and visit often for updates. Sincerely, Andy Andrew Goodman, PhD Director, Microbial Sciences Institute C.N.H.
