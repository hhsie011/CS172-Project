Our world has evolved and we have kept pace, preparing practical leaders with the scientific and technical skills, and ethical and moral grounding, to drive positive change in business, government, health care, academia, and allied sectors. As the College of Engineering approaches its 75th year (2022), and the University its centennial (2025), our faculty, staff and students will help in solving pressing problems at the convergence of the physical, chemical, biological and digital worlds: in healthcare engineering, information security, sustainability and resilience, advanced materials and fabrication, energy and environment, outer space exploration and habitation. Through the confluence of industry partnership, specialized research, and a thriving South Florida entrepreneurial ecosystem, the CoE is well positioned to drive innovation in South Florida and in the hemisphere, collaborate with industry to solve real-world problems in South Florida and around the world, and to educate the next generation of engineers to solve existing and as-yet-unimagined problems. We collectively embrace the challenge and promise of “Engineering Miami for the Future” – a future we have only begun to imagine. The University of Miami is a Research R1 (highest research activity) University as defined by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. Its research budget is over $300 million annually resulting in incredible research opportunities for faculty and students. The College of Engineering (CoE) benefits immensely from the extensive collaborations with units across the University of Miami.
