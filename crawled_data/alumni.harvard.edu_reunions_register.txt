We are thrilled to have you back on campus for the 2022 Harvard and Radcliffe College Reunions! No matter where your life has taken you since you last walked through the Harvard Yard gates, every reunion is an opportunity; a chance to have all of your College friends in one place, to see classmates with whom you’ve lost touch, and to share and celebrate together as a community. The Harvard alumni community is your community—and we are all excited to welcome you home to Cambridge! Throughout this website, you will find useful information regarding your reunion, including class schedules, reunion headquarter locations, transportation and other general information, and answers to questions you may have. If you can’t find what you are looking for, feel free to reach out to us at collegereunions_haa@harvard.edu. While you’re on campus, we also hope you’ll share your favorite moments with us on social media using the #HarvardReunions hashtag and tagging @harvardalumni. We’re excited to celebrate with you and can’t wait to see your photos, videos, selfies, and more. You can see what others are posting below!
