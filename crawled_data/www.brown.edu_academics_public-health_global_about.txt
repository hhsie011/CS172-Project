Instead, see our Global Health MPH concentration: Global Health MPH concentration Brown's Master’s in Global Public Health program embodies Brown’s educational philosophy of strong academic preparation within a framework of global community engagement. We make a commitment to the communities we serve, with continuous long-term engagement to ensure that we are making a difference! While emphasizing public health in low- and middle-income countries, we provide students with rigorous training in methods and practice, including global health theory and interventions, socio-cultural awareness and competence, global health epidemiology and disparities, and international project implementation and evaluation. We aim to train the next generation of global health innovators and leaders by preparing students to understand the major global health challenges of today, complemented with the requisite analytical skills to formulate relevant scientific questions. This student-driven program emphasizes experiential learning and interdisciplinary collaboration across campus and in our global sites. The Master’s in Global Public Health differs from a biomedical degree or general public health degree, such as the MPH, because of the program's emphasis on social-behavioral influences and global health disparities, implementation science, and community-based interventions in global settings. Our graduates join the growing global workforce in academic, government, non-government, private, clinical, and research sectors addressing the global disparities in distribution of health, disease, and wellness. Brown University School of Public Health is a member institution of the Consortium of Universities for Global Health (CUGH) and accredited by the Council on Education for Public Health (CEPH).
