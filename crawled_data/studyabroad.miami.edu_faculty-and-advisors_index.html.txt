Faculty are key to the sustainable success of study abroad at the University of Miami. Faculty have tremendous influence on students' learning and development. In addition to their interaction with students in the classroom where we encourage them to promote study abroad, faculty also have the opportunity to work with the Study Abroad Office to plan, create, and teach on a study abroad program. The Study Abroad Office provides administrative and logistical support for all faculty-directed study abroad programs, which offer a great variety of educational opportunities to many students every year. UMiami Faculty-Led programs are designed to encourage a diverse variety of students to study abroad, and these opportunities would not be possible without the dedication and effort of the faculty who direct these programs.
