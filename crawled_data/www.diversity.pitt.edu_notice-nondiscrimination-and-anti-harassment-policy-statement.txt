The University does not tolerate discrimination, harassment, or retaliation on these bases and takes steps to ensure that students, employees, and third parties are not subject to a hostile environment in University programs or activities. The University responds promptly and equitably to allegations of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. It promptly conducts investigations and takes appropriate action, including disciplinary action, against individuals found to have violated its policies, as well as provides appropriate remedies to complainants and the campus community. The University is committed to taking prompt action to end a hostile environment if one has been created, prevent its recurrence, and remedy the effects of any hostile environment on affected members of the campus community. Please note that the University’s Nondiscrimination, Equal Opportunity, and Affirmative Action Policy also covers discrimination based on ethnicity. Although not listed explicitly, the University interprets discrimination based on ethnicity as being prohibited based on the policy’s inclusion of race, color, national origin, and ancestry as prohibited bases for discrimination. If you experience any discrimination on the basis of ethnicity, you should report such discrimination and it will be investigated in accordance with University policy and procedure. For complete details on the University’s Nondiscrimination, Equal Opportunity, and Affirmative Action Policy (07-01-03) and Sexual Misconduct Policy (06-05-01), please visit the Policies, Procedures, and Practices page.
