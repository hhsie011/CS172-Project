The Academic HR team serves all 3 University of Washington campuses as a central resource for the recruitment, hiring, retention and promotion of faculty, librarians and academic staff. The web section is designed to provide administrators, current and prospective faculty, librarians and academic staff with a wide range of information and guidance on University policies. Our Vision… To be recognized and respected as a provider of superior services and a high level resource regarding academic personnel practices and institutional policies for faculty, librarians and academic staff. Workday and the Integrated Service Center (ISC) Workday is the centralized, cloud-based software program the UW uses to manage human resources, time-tracking, payroll, benefits processes across the University, the Medical Centers* and other off-site facilities. The Integrated Service Center (ISC) works closely with UW-HR, Office of Academic Personnel (OAP), UW-IT, other central business units, University leadership, departments and HR administrators to support faculty, staff and students with their payroll/HR-impacting information in Workday. Visit the ISC website to access Workday, view instructional videos and user guides, or to contact ISC representatives. *Please note: The Medical Centers continue to use Kronos for time-tracking and payroll.
