CCIT is dedicated to supporting research and high performance computing for university members, but also for non-university users for varied fees. HPC and Storage High-performance computing (HPC) is the use of parallel processing for running advanced application programs efficiently, reliably and quickly. Research Computing Assistance and Support The Palmetto Cluster is Clemson University's primary high-performance computing (HPC) resource. It is heavily utilized by researchers, students, faculty, and staff from a very broad range of disciplines. External users from other universities, government agencies, and from Clemson's private-sector partners also play significant roles in supporting and using this rapidly growing resource.
