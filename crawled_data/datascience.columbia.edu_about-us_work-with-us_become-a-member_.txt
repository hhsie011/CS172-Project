Terminology: We distinguish between a member and an affiliate of the Data Science Institute and use the term “membership” for members and “affiliation” for affiliate. Guiding Principle: To open membership or affiliation to anyone in the Columbia community who is actively engaged in DSI, energetically and enthusiastically supports the mission of the Institute, and contributes to its activities and program. Who: By “faculty”, we mean full-time officers of instruction and officers of research. Postdocs and students are not eligible to be members or affiliates of DSI. Process: Any interested faculty member at Columbia may apply to be a member or affiliate of DSI. A DSI membership committee will determine membership. A member will have a three-year renewable term. We encourage any interested faculty to talk first to the chair of the DSI membership committee before officially applying, to get a sense of the expectations of being a DSI member. When applying, an applicant may include these ways of contributing to DSI: Teach regularly (once a year) a data science related course. Teach for bootcamps, training workshops, executive education, etc. Regularly run data science relevant grants (including industry-funded research) through DSI Sponsor postdocs and/or Ph.D. students doing work in data science Serve on a DSI standing committee, e.g., Leadership Team, Executive Committee, Education Committee, Membership Committee Serve as a chair/co-chair of DSI center Support engagements with industry Participate in multiple industry meetings Formal presentations to industry at their facilities These examples are typical of current members/affiliates. Applicants are encouraged to suggest ideas not on this list in their application. We are always open to new and creative ways to enrich DSI’s impact at Columbia and beyond.
