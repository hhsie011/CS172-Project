Since December 2016, I have been playing the vibrations between student and Library Circulation Assistant.

To learn and get experience with writing a finding aid, I’m working with materials that already have a finding aid, “The Chinese Church of Christ in Korea papers 1908-1975.” Some of what needed to be done was basic copy editing and formatting the […] Read More… Posted in Student EntryTagged Chinese Church of Christ in Korea, Collections, interns, Korea, library science, Missionaries, MRL, MRL8, Processing, studentsLeave a comment You Say Goodbye, and I Say Hello Posted on May 6, 2014 by Sarah Davis This week is the last week of my Spring Internship at the Burke Library. It has been such a great experience! I’ve received hands-on training on the entire archival experience: the initial processing, creating the finding aid, managing it in its digital form, and broadcasting it for all the world to see.
