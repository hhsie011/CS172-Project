Join co-hosts Daniel Balsam and Chris Stacey for an evening of their interpretation of the "essential" moments of the opera. Join us for a discussion and audience participation about key passages in Verdi’s innovative opera that takes Lady Macbeth’s “bloodthirst to a new level” (Verdi expanded her role in the opera beyond the original Shakespeare). We will show clips from the Metropolitan Opera’s 2014 production featuring star soprano Anna Netrebko who created a sensation with her riveting performance as the malevolent Lady Macbeth.
