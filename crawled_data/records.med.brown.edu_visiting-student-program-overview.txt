Participation Requirements We expect visiting students to honor their commitment once they have been accepted to participate in an elective.

If you are a medical student from an international medical school seeking to do a clinical rotation at the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, we can only consider your request if your home institution has a bilateral exchange agreement with Brown. If you are a student at an international medical school with whom Brown has a bilateral exchange agreement, please note that there are limited openings and you must be nominated by your medical school.
