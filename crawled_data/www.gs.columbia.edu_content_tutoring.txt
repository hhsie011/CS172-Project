Wherever you are on the road to mastery—whether you’re confused by one or two concepts, feeling overwhelmed by a class, or looking to move from “pretty good” to “great”—our tutors are here to help. In addition to tutoring, the ARC also offers Reading & Argument Coaching to support coursework in social science and humanities disciplines.

Each session lasts 50 minutes. Tutoring is conducted in pairs (two students per tutor) for math and science courses, and one-on-one for foreign languages and economics. For paired appointments, the first student to register for the appointment chooses the course and professor; any student enrolled in the same course can sign up for the second slot. Each student is permitted up to two traditional appointments per week. (Use of group tutoring and walk-in tutoring hours do not count towards the two-appointment allowance). To help everyone get the most out of this resource, we ask that students do the following: Arrive on time and be prepared with relevant notes, textbooks, assignments, and specific questions and goals for the tutoring session Provide their tutor with a copy of the course syllabus Actively engage in each session—ask questions, take notes, and take charge Make an Appointment Cancellations Students who are unable to make their appointment must cancel at least 12 hours in advance. Students who miss three scheduled appointments (either by not showing up or by canceling with less than 12 hours notice) may lose access to tutoring for the semester. Homework Policy Please note that it is the ARC’s policy not to go over homework problems during tutoring sessions. Instead, tutors will review concepts and provide practice problems that are similar to those commonly assigned as homework and on exams. Tutor-Led Study Groups Tutor-led study groups provide the opportunity to increase mastery of course material in a facilitated, group-learning environment. Peer tutors lead groups through review of key concepts, and provide opportunities to hone problem-solving skills. Above all, these groups are designed to provide the opportunity for students to teach and learn from one another, recognizing that a student's peers at Columbia are one of the most valuable resources available. Tutor-led study groups are especially helpful for students who have a good general understanding of a subject but are struggling with particulars. They're also a great opportunity to increase mastery in a subject where a student is already feeling confident.

Reading and Argument Coaching Speaking the language of a text doesn't always guarantee you'll understand what it says. And even when you do understand what it says, that doesn't necessarily mean you know how to craft an argument in response. The ARC's reading and argument coaches are trained peer facilitators who can help students make sense of what they're looking at and come up with a plan for what to do with it—without doing the work for them, and while respecting the Columbia University Code of Honor. Reading and argument coaches can help students: Learn to pre-read more effectively Learn to identify the different types of demands made by different types of texts (i.e., how to approach a textbook versus a literary text versus a critical article) Learn to efficiently manage large volumes of text Learn to critically approach a text about which you will be writing a paper Better understand what makes a good argument, and how to make a good argument Admissions Undergraduate Admissions Postbac Premed Admissions Newly Admitted Students U.S. Military Veterans International Dual Degree Programs Educational Financing Types of Financial Aid Financial Aid for Military Veterans Cost of Attendance Applying for Financial Aid Counseling Appointments Enrollment Update Form Student Account Refunds Academics Undergraduate Postbac Premed Program Applying to Medical School Academic Policies Faculty of Arts and Sciences Student Services Undergraduate Announcements Postbac Premed Announcements Academic Advising Academic Resource Center Campus Services Forms and Guides Graduation Health and Wellness Housing International Students Medical School Fair Planning Your Future Premedical Clinical and Research Positions Student Life Veterans Resources and Initiatives About Leadership Mission History Statistics and Facts Notable Alumni University Policies Events Staff Directory Faculty News Press Coverage Media Inquiries Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
