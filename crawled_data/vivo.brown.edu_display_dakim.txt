Kim's primary research field is post-1945 U. S. literature with a particular focus on the Asian American and African American traditions, Korean/American Studies, Ethnic Studies, Gender Studies, and the Cold War. He is the author of Reading Manhood in Black and Yellow: Ralph Ellison, Frank Chin and the Literary Politics of Identity (Stanford University Press, 2005) and . This book examines literary representations of racialized masculinity, and it is the first study to do so in a comparative African-American and Asian-American context. Through detailed analyses of two exemplary figures, it identifies a gendered and sexualized rhetoric that both black and Asian male writers have drawn upon to depict the violent psychic effects of white racism on men of color; it also brings into focus the persistent and seductive belief that the domain of literature provides a measure of mobility from the repressive constructions of minority identity that prevail in a racist order. This study like much recent work that has been generated at the intersections of feminist, gender, gay/lesbian and ethnic studies illuminates the intimate relationship between the various modalities of identity that exert an essentializing power in the production of modern subjectivity: race, gender and sexuality. Its particular contributions to this body of work stem from its comparative scope and the specific emphasis it places on literary ideology—on how a sexual and racial politics of identity becomes articulated as a literary politics. The Intimacies of Conflict: Cultural Memory and the Korean War (NYU Press, 2020), his second book, adopts a more historical approach. Drawing on both the affective and historiographical resonances of the term "intimacies," it illuminates how the so-called “forgotten war” was a watershed event that fundamentally reshaped both domestic conceptions of race and the interracial dimensions of the global empire that the United States would go on to establish. Addressing a range of American popular media from the 1950s, it offers a portrait of the Korean War as it looked to Americans while they were experiencing it in real time. It also reads a constellation of fiction from US writers like Susan Choi, Rolando Hinojosa, Toni Morrison, and Chang-rae Lee, and the Korean author Hwang Sok-yong. The multiple and ongoing historical trajectories presented in these works testify to the resurgent afterlife of this event in US cultural memory, and of its lasting impact on multiple racialized populations, both within the US and in Korea.
