Each year, we recognize and celebrate Indigenous Peoples Heritage Month with the goal of educating on Native culture and heritage and ultimately enhancing the visibility of Native and Indigenous people on campus and in the local community. For this year, the Indigenous Peoples Heritage Month committee has chosen the theme, "(Re)connection: Mind, Body, Land & Spirit." We hope that through the cultural and educational activities offered this month, we may come together and connect, or reconnect, with ourselves, each other, the land and our environment, and our community.
