The project was developed primarily for teachers and students and for use in the Columbia College Core Curriculum, but it is hoped that the resource will also find a wider application in schools and colleges in France. Life of a Gothic Cathedral: Notre-Dame of Amiens is intended to change the way we understand and teach the cathedral. This website allows you to see that Amiens Cathedral is not a thing of the distant past. The three-hundred year life of the Gothic cathedral embraced the agency of three overlapping worlds of makers and users: the layfolk who visit it, the clergy in their sumptuous choir and the artisans who built it. The website will allow you to enter into each of these three worlds.
