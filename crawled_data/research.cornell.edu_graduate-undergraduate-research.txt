Students do research and scholarship that span disciplines and topics as wide-ranging as Cornell’s colleges and schools, multiplied by Cornell’s culture of collaborative, cross-disciplinary research. Research opportunities flourish, as students create their own paths—exploring topics about which they are passionate. In addition to working with Cornell’s distinguished faculty, Cornell students have access to world-class research facilities. This combination offers rare opportunities for student researchers.
