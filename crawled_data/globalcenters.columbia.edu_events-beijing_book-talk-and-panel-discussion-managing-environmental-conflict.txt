Time: June 11, 2022, 9:00AM (Beijing) | June 10, 2022, 9:00PM (New York) Event language: English With the deterioration of global and regional environmental problems such as climate change, water shortage, ozone layer destruction, marine pollution, etc., environmental conflicts caused by resource allocation and pollution control have become an important factor leading to social instability. Events including the fight for natural resources in the Amazon Basin, the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, and Japan's plan to release Fukushima water into the Pacific have all triggered confrontations and conflicts in local and regional communities. In reality, conflicts frequently arise over environmental issues such as land use, natural resource management, and laws and regulation, emerging from diverging interests and values among stakeholders. To avoid conflict escalation, we need to learn the theory and practice of collaborative approaches to managing environmental disputes, experiment with new approaches to collaborative conservation in critical ecosystems, and develop and test a variety of approaches to conflict management. About the Book This book is a primer on causes of and solutions to such conflicts. Joshua D. Fisher explains the core concepts in collaborative conflict management and presents a clear, practical, and implementable framework for understanding and responding to environmental disputes. He details strategies to bring stakeholders together in pursuit of collective solutions, emphasizing ongoing processes of dialogue, analysis, action, and learning. The primer examines why and how system dynamics can constrain or expand the possibility of constructive management of conflicts. It features a case study from the Amazon Basin, where local communities, extractive industry operators, conservationists, and land managers have often clashed over access to natural resources, drawing out lessons to illustrate how to adapt the conflict management framework to distinct contexts. Managing Environmental Conflict synthesizes knowledge, methods, and practices spanning consensus building, collaborative governance, complex adaptive systems science, environmental conflict resolution, and environmental peacebuilding. Its presentation of this important and timely topic will be invaluable for academics and practitioners alike, including decision makers, scientists, and conflict management professionals. Speakers Joshua D. Fisher is a research scientist at the Earth Institute at Columbia University, where he is also the director of the Advanced Consortium on Cooperation, Conflict, and Complexity.
