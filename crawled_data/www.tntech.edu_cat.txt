We will work with institutions to setup proctor accounts and specific blocks of time during which a student can log in and complete the CAT. We are also offering online, virtual trainings to engage faculty in the evaluation of student performance on the CAT and the development of CAT Apps. If have questions about an online CAT administration or virtual trainings, please contact cat@tntech.edu. The Critical-thinking Assessment Test (CAT) was developed with input from faculty across a wide range of institutions and disciplines, with guidance from colleagues in the cognitive/ learning sciences and assessment and with support from the National Science Foundation (NSF). DEVELOPED to assess a broad range of skills that faculty across the country feel are important components of critical thinking and real world problem solving. DESIGNED to emulate real world problems. All questions derived from real world situations with most questions requiring short answer essay responses. ENGAGE faculty in the assessment and improvement of student critical thinking skills and connects faculty to a teaching community. We encourage faculty involvement in the scoring process to help them understand student's strengths and weaknesses. Faculty can also use the CAT instrument as a model for constructing better course assessments using their own discipline content. Over 350 institutions across the country have used the CAT for course, program, and general education assessment. NSF support also helped establish the Center for Assessment and Improvement of Learning to distribute the CAT and provide training, consultation, and statistical support to users.
