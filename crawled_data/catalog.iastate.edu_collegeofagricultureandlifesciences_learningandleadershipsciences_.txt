Overview Requirements Catalog Home > Undergraduate Majors, Certificates, Minors, Pre-Professional Study > Agriculture and Life Sciences > Learning and Leadership Sciences Minor Learning and Leadership Sciences Minor The Learning and Leadership Sciences minor provides an opportunity for students to engage in productive thinking, enabling them to lead in their professions and contribute to society and their communities. The coursework builds on the curriculum of a student's primary discipline to enhance student leadership abilities throughout their academic career and beyond. Students will enhance their abilities to engage in productive thinking, such as critical, analytical, and creative thinking in problem-solving; discern the types of thinking required when presented with new situations; and use different types of thinking to address issues and situations as professionals and citizens. Core courses in the minor address eight competency areas that are critical for leaders: 1) understanding self and personal responsibility for learning, 2) understanding worthy team membership, 3) developing productive thinking and creative problem solving abilities, 4) developing resiliency, 5) negotiating and resolving conflict, 6) action planning for providing service, 7) communicating, and 8) recognizing and acting on the obligation to "do" leadership every day. Students in the Learning and Leadership Sciences Minor will ultimately achieve these learning outcomes by uncovering and practicing: habits of deep self-reflection about learning and application of these habits to their professional and community lives; effective interaction with others in professional and community settings, including abilities to listen actively, communicate clearly, resolve conflicts, and negotiate desired outcomes; habits of professional thinking, including accountability, initiative, innovation, resilience, tolerance, and profound respect for others.
