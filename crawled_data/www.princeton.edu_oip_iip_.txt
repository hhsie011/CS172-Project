We are evaluating both in-country and remote positions, however, in-country internships will be contingent on a number of factors including University travel guidelines, government travel restrictions, and public health advice. Princeton's International Internship Program (IIP) offers guidance and financial support to undergraduates who wish to undertake a summer internship abroad. With placements in more than 50 countries, IIP offers students the opportunity to fulfill academic and personal goals while living and working abroad. Interns have held positions in government, media, education, public health and nongovernmental organizations, as well as financial and research institutions. Contact Us Questions?
