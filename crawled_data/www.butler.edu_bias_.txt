What is a bias incident? A bias incident is an act or behavior motivated by the offender’s bias against facets of another’s identity. These facets may include, but are not limited to: race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, citizenship status, military status, sex, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or genetic information. Bias occurs whether the act is intentional or unintentional. Bias may be directed toward an individual or group. Bias may contribute to creating an unsafe or unwelcoming environment.
