Read the full story in our magazine site: magazine.engineering.columbia.edu Unshackling Robots: Self-Aware Machines Runtime 2:23 Columbia Engineering researchers have made a major advance in robotics by creating a robot that learns what it is, from scratch, with zero prior knowledge of physics, geometry, or motor dynamics. Once their robot creates a self-simulation, it can then use that self-model to adapt to different situations, to handle new tasks as well as detect and repair damage in its own body.
