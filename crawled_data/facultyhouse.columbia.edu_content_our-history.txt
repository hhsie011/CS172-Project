Join us for a walk down memory lane to learn about the Faculty House building and its history. In 1894, Columbia University hired renowned New York City architecture firm, McKim, Mead and White, to develop a master plan for the Morningside Heights campus. In 1921, the firm designed the blueprint for Faculty House, to be located at 117th Street and Morningside.

Funding for the building was a gift to the University from alumnus F. Augustus Schermerhorn, Class of 1868. Schermerhorn also served as Trustee of the Faculty House from 1877 to 1908.

An article in The New York Times noted, “The new building’s features make it one of the most attractive and serviceable buildings in Morningside Heights.” Photo courtesy of Columbia University Archives In 1923, construction at Faculty House was complete. The first floor contained a large reception room and coat rooms, as well as billiard and chess rooms. On the second floor was a large lounging room overlooking Morningside Park and a ballroom used for dancing and private parties. Two large dining rooms could be found on the third and fourth floors. This luxurious, spacious design made it possible to host large social events. Image Carousel with 2 slides A carousel is a rotating set of images.

One of the chief renovation goals for the Bogdanow team was to ensure that each of Faculty House’s four floors be designed with its own distinct personality. During the 18-month renovation, the 38,000 square feet of meeting and function space was completely retrofitted to support 21st-century technology. Nearly 75 percent of materials from the original structure were refurbished, re-purposed, recycled or donated during the renovation project.
