For example, a minor might engage the teachings and spirituality of the Roman Catholic Church; or a particular era in the history of the Christian theology; or current ethical issues; or Jewish Studies; or biblical studies; or the beliefs and practices of another major world religion—or all of the above. Requirements The Theology minor consists of the Theology Core requirement plus five 3-credit courses that are Level Two or above. Related Program Religion and Public Life Interdisciplinary Minor The Religion and Public Life minor will offer students a way to explore and connect diverse conversations about the role of religion in public life. Bringing together a wide array of courses to choose from, the Religion and Public Life minor will have an interdisciplinary emphasis and be composed of six courses, one introductory course and five electives.
