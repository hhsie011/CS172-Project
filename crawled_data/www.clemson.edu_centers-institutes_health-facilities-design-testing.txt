The Health Facilities Design and Testing Center is using interdisciplinary design research to improve health care environments through better architecture and building design. Research at this Center focuses on two main areas: how the design of health care facilities affects the delivery of health care and how to create architectural settings that better serve the health and well-being of patients and staff. Researchers at this Center study the relationship between the physical healthcare environment and clinical outcomes; population health outcomes; patient, family and staff satisfaction; operational efficiency; and the ability to accommodate change. The Center for Health Facilities Design and Testing supports two endowed chairs – the endowed chair in Architecture + Health Design and Research at Clemson University and the Endowed Chair in Healthcare Human Factors Research and Practice at the Medical University of South Carolina. As the SmartState Endowed Chair in Architecture + Health Design and Research, Dr. Anjali Joseph serves as the Director for the Center for Health Facilities Design and Testing.
