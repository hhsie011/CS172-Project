Selecting One Life will cause the Second Person and the associated name and age fields to be hidden from view for that run. First Person Enter the name of the person. You may use such titles as "Mr.", "Mrs.", "Dr.", "Rev.", "Jr.", "Sr.", etc. For the remainder unitrust the first person is the first income recipient or beneficiary of the agreement. First Age You may enter the age of the person instead of the birth date. However, if the birth date is known, click on the calendar icon and choose your birth date. Since ages are to be rounded up if the gift date is within 6 months of the next birth date, entering the birth date is the most accurate method. Second Person Second Age Income Tax Rate 10% 12% 22% 24% 32% 35% 37% Select the current federal income tax rate of the donor. This will be used to project possible income tax savings. If you are not certain about the correct rate, you may choose one of the middle rates. For many people, this will be close to the actual income tax rate. Value of Property $ Enter the amount of cash or the fair market value (FMV) of the asset(s) used to fund the CGA. For assets such as real estate, closely-held stock and other hard to value assets, the FMV would be the appraised value of the property on the date of the gift. Cost Basis $ Enter the cost basis of the asset being used to fund the trust or annuity. If the asset is cash, the cost basis is equal to the gift amount. If it is appreciated property, the cost basis will most likely be the amount you originally paid for the property. The cost basis is used to determine the capital gains tax which will be bypassed as a result of selling the asset. If the cost basis is not known or cannot be proven, the IRS assumes the cost basis to be $0. If cash funds the gift annuity, enter the same value as "Value of Property." Current Return % Enter the current return return or yield of the asset(s) which will be used to fund the gift agreement. For example, if the trust will be funded with public-traded stock which is currently paying a dividend of 3%, the current return yield is, in turn, 3%. If the gift is funded with vacant land or a personal residence (assuming the property is not leased), the current return would be 0%. Trust Payout % Enter the percent income payout to the donor. You must select a trust percent payout of 5% or more. Payment Frequency Monthly Quarterly Semiannual Annual Select either monthly, quarterly, semiannual, or annual income payments to the beneficiary(ies) of the income. The choice of payment frequency does affect the amount of the charitable deduction as the more frequent the payment (i.e. monthly as opposed to annually), the smaller the donor's tax deduction.
