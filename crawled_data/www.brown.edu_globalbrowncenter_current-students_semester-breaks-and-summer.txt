Brown's academic calendar has several long breaks, including Thanksgiving (a U.S. holiday celebrated in late November), winter break (after finals end in December through the start of the spring term in late January), spring break (typically the last week of March), and, of course, summer. Being on campus during these times can be a wonderful chance to catch up, enjoy Providence, or get a break. They can also be times when students can feel isolated as most undergraduates and some graduate students, faculty, and staff are not on campus. Planning ahead for breaks is important, including where you'll stay and eat. For more information about housing, dining, and services available during the Winter Break, please review the Residential Life website!
