As you prepare for your first semester on campus, please follow these steps to ensure a successful start to your college career. Step 1: Confirm Your Admission To secure your spot at the University of Cincinnati, you will need to confirm your admission by the appropriate confirmation deadline. You can confirm by logging into your applicant status page and submitting the online confirmation form and $100 (non-refundable) confirmation fee. Step 2: Receive Advising and Enroll in Classes The advising and course registration process can differ depending on which academic college you have been admitted to. Please view your admission decision letter in order to know which academic college your major falls within. Staff within your academic college will assist you with your advising needs. It typically takes 1-2 weeks for colleges to reach out to students once they have confirmed. Learn more about what you can expect in the weeks after confirming your admission by visiting our next steps page. While you are awaiting the transition to your new academic college, the Center for Pathways Advising and Student Success is happy to help. Pathways is an additional support for transfer students to navigate campus and begin making progress to their goals at the University of Cincinnati. Step 3: Register for On-campus Housing and Dining Living on campus is a great way to meet other University of Cincinnati students and integrate into the Bearcat Community. As an incoming transfer student, you are strongly encouraged to live on campus for your first year. The University of Cincinnati offers traditional, suite, and apartment-style residence halls so you can choose the hall that appeals to you most. In order to sign up for on-campus housing and a meal plan, you must confirm your admission first. Visit Housing and Food Services for more information about our residence halls and dining opportunities.
