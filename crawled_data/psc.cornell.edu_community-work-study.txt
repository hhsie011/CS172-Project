Einhorn Center for Community Engagement Community Work Study Contact Us cwsp-psc@cornell.edu The Community Work-Study Program, sponsored by the Einhorn Center, enables Cornell Federal Work-Study (FWS) students to work for nonprofit organizations, schools, and municipalities mainly in Ithaca and Tompkins County. Opportunities exists in a variety of areas, including the arts, K-12 education, environmental programs, health services, legal services, programs for older people, public works and engineering, women's organizations, and youth programs. The work must be designed to improve the quality of life for community residents, particularly low-income individuals, or to solve particular problems related to their needs. Learn more by reading What qualifies as Community Service? Each year we place an average of 250 students in work-study positions in the local community during the academic year, and another 70 students in the summer. Jobs affiliated with Cornell departments or organizations may qualify for CWSP funding if the studentâ€™s work benefits local residents or US residents.
