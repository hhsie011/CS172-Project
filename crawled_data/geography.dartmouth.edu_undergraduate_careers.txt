For the same reason geography is especially valuable for those who plan to enter graduate work in business administration, planning, law, or medicine. Geography also offers a number of rewarding opportunities in teaching at all levels of the educational system. The revitalization of elementary and high school curricula to include or strengthen geography has increased the demand for qualified teachers in our primary and secondary schools, both public and private. In addition, growth of urban and environmental studies programs in colleges and universities, as well as a renewed interest in geography itself, have increased the demand for good teachers and researchers in geography in many undergraduate and graduate institutions. Thus the need for Ph.D. level geographers is growing. There are numerous respected and exciting graduate programs in Geography in North America, and the demand for well-trained undergraduates from programs such as Dartmouth's has always been strong. The potential of applying the geographic approach in government and private enterprise is increasing considerably, although many positions will not carry a geography title. Many employment opportunities exist for individuals trained in geographic information systems, cartography, remote sensing, and computer mapping. Roughly a quarter of all professional geographers today find employment in government either at the state or local levels, or in a variety of federal agencies, the armed forces, and in international organizations. Geographers hold such job titles as cartographer, geographic analyst, map curator, land officer, international economist, forest ecologist, soil conservationist, and climatologist. The application of geographical methodologies in private business is appropriate especially in industrial location analysis, in market research, and in transportation planning and design. Another rapidly developing field is metropolitan and regional planning. Other geographers in private business work as writers, editors, and cartographers for publishers of maps, atlases, textbooks, encyclopedias, and news and travel magazines.

Preparation for Graduate Study The Department is committed to encouraging and preparing students to pursue graduate studies in geography and related disciplines. Interested students should contact a geography faculty member to receive mentorship in major design and graduate school preparation.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Geography Undergraduate Major, Minor and Modifications Courses Culminating Experience Senior Honors Thesis Awards Careers Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Research Overview Faculty Research Student Research Postdoctoral Fellowships Facilities Off-Campus Study News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
