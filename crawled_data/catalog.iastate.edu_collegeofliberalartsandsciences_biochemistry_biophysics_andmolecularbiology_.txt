They are given solely for the convenience of students or advisors who wish to estimate the amount of basic study that may be needed. All minors require at least 15 credits, including at least 6 credits in course numbered 300 or above taken at Iowa State University. The minor must include at least 9 credits that are not used to meet any other department, college, or university requirement. Concurrent Programs Concurrent Bachelor of Science (B.S.)/ Master of Science (M.S.) Degrees The department offers a concurrent enrollment degree program in either Biochemistry or Biophysics that allows ISU undergraduate students to obtain both the B.S. and M.S. degrees in about five years. The program is open to undergraduate students in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. The concurrent degrees can be useful to students entering various career tracks. For those considering careers as research specialists, entry positions with higher-level responsibilities, and a higher-level salary, are made possible with the M.S. degree. For those considering careers as research directors, which require advanced study, the M.S. degree provides an advantage for admission into Ph.D. programs at the most competitive and prestigious graduate schools. Similarly, the M.S. degree can be a competitive advantage for admission in to medical, dental, law, veterinary medicine, or other professional schools. Application to the program is made near the end of the junior undergraduate (third) year. Concurrent B.S/M.S. degree students begin research for the M.S. thesis during the summer semester after their junior year and are eligible for research assistantships, which are renewable based on academic standing and satisfactory research performance. The M.S. thesis requires intensive experience in original, independent laboratory research under the close supervision of a faculty mentor. To apply, see the concurrent B.S./M.S. application instructions found on the department’s Graduate Study web page. Concurrent Bachelor of Science/Graduate Certificate The Bachelor of Science /Graduate Certificate program is intended for exceptional undergraduate students majoring in Biochemistry. In this program, the student completes all of the requirements for the B.S. degree and the graduate certificate in a four-year period by combining the requirements of the two programs. The student enters the Graduate College after he/she achieves junior status and develops a plan of coursework (graduate and undergraduate) subject to the approval of the Director of Certificate (DOC). Required graduate courses are BBMB 504, 505, 506, 507, 561 and 561L. The student must satisfy the requirements of the B.S. in Biochemistry (121 credits) and the Graduate Certificate in Biochemistry (12 credits). Six credits of graduate coursework can satisfy some requirements of the B.S. degree. To apply for the B.S./Graduate Certificate, submit the application form found on the Graduate College Forms web page. Graduate Programs Introduction Biochemistry and Biophysics are the science and technology used to understand the mechanisms underlying biological processes at the molecular level, with an emphasis on the fundamental relationships among the chemical, physical, and biological sciences. The Roy J. Carver Department of Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Molecular Biology (BBMB) administers Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), Master’s (M.S.), and Graduate Certificate programs that lead to an advanced degree or certificate in these disciplines. The prerequisite to graduate study is a sound undergraduate background in biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics. BBMB offers Doctor of Philosophy and Master’s degrees in Biochemistry and in Biophysics that are designed to train students to independently conceive and carry out original research. BBMB also offers two graduate certificate programs in Biochemistry that provide a mechanism for formal recognition of focused graduate study in a specialized area that is less comprehensive than that required for a master's degree. BBMB participates in the Interdepartmental majors of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology; Genetics and Genomics; Immunobiology; Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology; Neuroscience; Plant Biology; and Toxicology. All graduate degree students in BBMB are required to teach as part of their training. Master of Science (M.S.) Degree The M.S. degree programs in Biochemistry and in Biophysics are useful for students who prefer to undertake research training without the longer-term commitment required for the Ph.D. degree. It is also useful for students interested more in the technical aspects of research rather than in careers as research directors. The program requires about 3 years on average to complete and the successful defense of an independent research dissertation is required. About half the time required to earn the degree is spent on advanced coursework and professional seminars, and the other half is devoted to research undertaken in the laboratory under the close supervision of a faculty mentor. Financial support is available. To apply, applicants first submit the free BBMB online application found on the department website, which is used as a screening tool. NOTE: Students interested in a research career are encouraged to consider the Ph.D. track. Students may enter the Biochemistry or Biophysics M.S. degree program as a direct admit to a faculty research group at any time during the year. Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) Degree The Ph.D. programs in Biochemistry and in Biophysics are designed to train students in the ability to independently conceive and carry out original research in the general area of the chemistry or physics of the processes of life. The programs require about 5-6 years on average to complete and the successful defense of an independent research dissertation. The majority of the time required to earn the degree is spent doing research on the dissertation project in the laboratory under the close supervision of a faculty mentor. Considerable time also is devoted to advanced coursework and professional seminars. Financial support is available. To apply, applicants first submit the free BBMB online application found on the department website, which is used as a screening tool. Students may enter the Biochemistry or Biophysics Ph.D. degree programs either as a rotation student in the fall semester or as a direct admit to a faculty research group at any time during the year. Graduate Minor in Biochemistry Graduate students in other M.S. and/or Ph.D. programs at ISU can earn a graduate minor in Biochemistry by completing 12 credits of the following courses with a grade point average of 3.0 or above: at least 6 credits from BBMB 504, 505, 506 and 507 and at least 6 credits of other BBMB 500- and 600-level courses. A student wishing to declare a minor in Biochemistry should arrange for a member of the graduate faculty in Biochemistry to serve on the POS Committee and submit the required form found on the Graduate College Forms page. Graduate Certificate Programs The graduate certificate program is designed for students who wish to continue or expand their knowledge in Biochemistry at the graduate level without the time commitment or lab experience required for a formal Master’s or Ph.D. program. A certificate program can be an attractive option for individuals who have a bachelor’s degree and are interested in broadening their expertise, or who are working in the sciences or industry and want to continue their education at the graduate level. BBMB offers two graduate certificate programs in Biochemistry: a concurrent B.S. / Graduate Certificate and a Graduate Certificate. The standards of admission and the course standards to which a certificate student are held are equivalent to those expected of a master's student. Each graduate certificate requires at least 12 graduate credits, all of which are available either on campus or on line. A graduate supervisor will be appointed to oversee the certification for each student. If a person who completes a graduate certificate program decides to continue for a graduate degree in Biochemistry or Biophysics, program approval is required. Credits earned for the graduate certificate may be used to meet course requirements for the graduate degree program. Graduate Certificate in Biochemistry The graduate certificate in Biochemistry is designed for students who have a B.S. degree in Biochemistry or a related field and wish to advance their knowledge by taking additional coursework at the graduate level. The graduate certificate courses may be taken either on-line or on campus. Candidates for a graduate certificate in Biochemistry are admitted in the Graduate College. A total of 12 credits is required that include BBMB 504, 505, 506 and 507, plus four additional credits of BBMB coursework at the 500-level. The 12 credits earned in the graduate certificate program may be applied to meet the course requirements of a M.S. or Ph.D. program in Biochemistry at Iowa State University (ISU) if the student is accepted into one of these programs. To apply for the graduate certificate in Biochemistry, submit the ISU online application. Every effort has been made to make the catalog accurate as of the date of publication.
