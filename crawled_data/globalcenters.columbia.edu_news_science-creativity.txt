Drawing upon scientific research and her expertise in consumer psychology, Professor Gita Johar, Meyer Feldberg Professor of Business at Columbia Business School, demystified the concepts of creativity and innovation at a presentation organized by the Columbia Global Centers | Mumbai on January 11, 2017, at the residence of Jay Mehta, Columbia University alumnus. Professor Johar demonstrated that creativity is a vital aspect of one’s personal and professional life and that it is not confined to a small group but can be cultivated by anybody with supporting cultural systems.
