Inspired by the art, music and culture of Harlem, on the lower frequencies i speak 4 u (sacred alchemy, reclaiming spaces) contains 14 prints, eight Polaroids and three editioned objects all housed in a laser engraved wooden boombox, conceptually reminiscent of Duchamp’s mini monograph, La Boîte-en-Valise. While a number of the prints in the edition use screenprint as their starting point, the majority rely on extensive hand work including techniques and materials such as photo-collage, stapling and graphite drawing. The edition is the result of the artist’s personal experience living and working in Harlem as well as research he did at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. Cordova (b. 1969, Lima, Peru) received a BFA from The School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1996 and an MFA from Yale University in 2004. His work has been the focus of solo exhibitions in the United States and abroad at institutions including Davison College, Davison, NC; 80M2 Lima, Peru; and MDC Museum of Art + Design at Miami Dade College, Miami, FL. He has participated in numerous artist residencies including Artpace, San Antonio, TX; The Headlands Center for the Arts, Sausaliton, CA; The Studio Museum in Harlem, NY; and American Academy in Berlin, Germany, among others. His work is included in the collections of the Whitney Museum of America Art, NY; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, NY; Harvard University, Cambridge, MA; Yale Art Gallery, New Haven; Museum of Contemporary Art, Miami; to name a few. Cordova lives and works in Miami.
