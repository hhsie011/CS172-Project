Entering Ph.D. students are expected to enroll in Physics 256 (Instruction in Teaching for Graduate Students) fall and winter term, which is taken in addition to three regular course credits. A student will be admitted as a Ph.D. candidate upon: Physics students: Receiving credit for seven out of the following nine core courses: Physics 76, Physics 90 [formerly 91], Physics 100, Physics 101, Physics 103-106, Physics 109. Passing the departmental qualifying examination. Sample qualifying exam - 2006 Sample qualifying exam - 2007 Presenting a thesis proposal [Ph.D. Thesis Proposal Application] and successfully defending it before an appointed Ph.D. thesis committee, for certification. Passing a departmental review of the student's course record and preliminary research progress. Receiving credit for at least two terms of Supervised Undergraduate Teaching (Physics 257) and Physics 256. Students must achieve thesis proposal certification by the end of the fall term of their fourth year, in order to remain in good standing. The Department will admit students who successfully complete these requirements to Ph.D. candidacy. Astronomy students: Receiving credit for Astronomy 74, Astronomy 115, Astronomy 116, Astronomy 117, Astronomy 118 and any one Physics course numbered 61 or above, and any other courses required by the student's advisory committee. Receiving credit for at least six terms of graduate research. Passing a research exam at the end of their first and second years. Presenting a thesis proposal [Ph.D. Thesis Proposal Application] and successfully defending it before an appointed Ph.D. committee for certification. Passing a departmental review of the student's course record and preliminary research progress. Receiving credit for at least two terms of Supervised Undergraduate Teaching (Physics 257) and Physics 256. Students must achieve thesis proposal certification by the end of the fall term of their fourth year, in order to remain in good standing. Students who successfully complete these requirements will be admitted to Ph.D. candidacy by the department. Students are required to meet with their committee at least once per year between the time of their thesis proposal and their defense. The yearly progress report meeting can take whatever form the advisor deems appropriate (short presentation, informal discussion), but requires that the student, the advisor and the in-house members of the committee all be in attendance. It is the responsibility of the student to arrange each meeting and deliver a completed confirmation sheet within one week of the meeting. Confirmation sheets are available from the department office or online here. The candidate will receive the Ph.D. degree upon: Receiving degree credit for at least twelve graduate courses, exclusive of teaching courses. Only two of the twelve courses may be Graduate Research, both of which must be completed no later than the second summer term in residence. Receiving credit for at least two terms of Supervised Undergraduate Teaching (Physics 257). Completing a dissertation of substantial significance and publishable quality. Successfully defending the dissertation before the Ph.D. Thesis Committee in a public forum. It is expected that most students will receive the Ph.D. degree by the end of the fifth year of graduate study.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Physics and Astronomy Undergraduate Overview Information for New Students Physics Major Astronomy Major Engineering Physics Major Undergraduate Awards Honors Recent Senior Theses Undergraduate Requirements Physics and Astronomy Course Offerings Physics Society Student Research Opportunities Careers in Physics and Astronomy Astronomy and Your Career Undergraduate Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Graduate Overview Graduate Awards Apply Financial Aid Degree Requirements Courses Recent PhD Graduates Graduate Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Foreign Study Overview Astronomy FSP in South Africa Research Overview All Projects Astrophysics Current Projects Particles, Fields, Gravitation, and Cosmology Current Projects Gravitational Quantum Physics Quantum and Condensed Matter Current Projects Plasma and Space Physics Current Projects Resources Overview Weather Archive News & Events News & Events Colloquia Physics and Astronomy Colloquia Colloquium Archives (before 2017) Symposiums Symposium on Charles Young's 1869 Discovery of Coronium Jay Lawrence Symposium Archive Pressure of Light Symposium Public Lecture Archives Public Observing People Faculty & Staff Students Alumni Advisory Board Membership Directory Committee Assignments Department Chair Diversity Statement Graduate Advisor Undergraduate Advisor My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
