The ring recognizes the accomplishments of Clemson graduates and, as a ring that has changed very little since it was presented to the first graduating class in 1896, it is widely recognizable among alumni around the world. Students who have completed 90 or more earned hours on their official transcript and purchased the official Clemson Ring during Ring Week are eligible to attend the Ring Ceremony. Introduced to the student body in the Spring of 2000, the Clemson Ring Ceremony is widely acknowledged as the preeminent Ring Ceremony among Clemson’s university peers. Hosted by the Student Alumni Council and the Clemson Alumni Association, more than 4,000 rings are presented to students each year. Only students who have completed 90 or more earned hours on their official transcript are eligible to purchase their Clemson ring.
