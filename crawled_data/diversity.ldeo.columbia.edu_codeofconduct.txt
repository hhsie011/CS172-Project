The annexes to the code of conduct provide information on Columbia University policies and procedures on harassment, discrimination, and other forms of misconduct. This code of conduct is meant for members of the Lamont community and all visitors to Lamont. The Meetings Code of Conduct offers guidelines on appropriate conduct during meetings at Lamont. The Guide to Inclusive Meetings and Conferences (March 2019) provides information on how meetings and conferences can be structured to promote diverse and inclusive participation. This guide arose from an Aspen Global Change Institute workshop in 2018 about diverse, inclusive, and equitable scientific meetings, and was led by 500 Women Scientists and the Earth Science Women’s Network. The workshop was funded by the Heising-Simons Foundation, and held at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, sponsored by the National Science Foundation. National Science Foundation (NSF) Requirements: Principal Investigators (PIs) and Co-PIs can use this code of conduct when referring to the updated NSF requirements (as of Feb 25, 2019) on reporting misconduct.
