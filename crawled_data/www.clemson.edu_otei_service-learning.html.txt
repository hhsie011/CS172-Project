It allows both instructors and students to apply their acquired knowledge and skills in a public setting by performing tasks with or for a community or a specific public organization. These tasks include but are not limited to identifying and analyzing real community needs and developing and implementing solutions to meet those needs. The process is accompanied by reflection activities over the course of the class or project. Faculty who would like help with starting service-learning projects with students should contact OTEI for assistance. Service-Learning in the Community Webcast Clemson Collaborations in Service-Learning will be broadcast over Clemson TV. Episodes involve interviews and discussions with faculty, students, and community partners participating in service-learning activities at Clemson University. View archives of past episodes.
