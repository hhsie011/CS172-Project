The Comprehensive Plan provides coverage for services in the Basic Plan in addition to coverage for prosthetics such as crowns/caps, bridgework, and full and partial dentures. All covered procedures are paid in full when you choose a Participating Dentist. SEBF allows you to choose any licensed dentist; however, reimbursement will be made according to the SEBF Dental Schedule of Benefits if you do not go to a Participating Dentist. Any balance due is your responsibility. For more information regarding the SEBF plans, please review the SEBF Dental Outline [PDF]. Enrollment in the SEBF Dental Plan is a one-year commitment.

The benefits are available every 24 months and may NOT be split between In-Network and Out-Of-Network providers. Enrollment in the SEBF Dental and Vision program is a one-year commitment. However, vision benefits may be used only once every 24 months. Your Cost Link Most premiums are paid through pre-tax payroll deduction.
