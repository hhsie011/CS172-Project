It helps an organization accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control, and governance processes." Audit Services reviews and evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of current systems of internal controls that are established by the university and its affiliated corporations. Based on the result of our assessments, we also provide recommendations to departmental management. In addition, we have committed more of our resources to provide consulting to departmental management on the efficiency and effectiveness of their operating practices through advisory engagements. However, we have NO authority to direct management's activities or to dictate departmental policies and procedures. All Audit Services' activities are conducted in conformance with the requirements of the International Professional Practices Framework (IPPF), which include the code of Ethics, International Standards for the Professional Practices of Internal Auditing (Standards), Position Papers, Practice Advisories and Practice Guides as defined by the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) and all university and Audit Services policies and procedures.
