The Plimpton-Poorvu Design Prize was established in 2015 with a generous gift from long-term friends, business partners, and GSD advocates Samuel Plimpton (MBA ’77, MArch ’80) and William J. Poorvu (MBA ’58). Sam and Bill have each focused their professional lives, through investment and teaching, on real estate and the design of the built environment. The Plimpton-Poorvu Design Prize encourages collaborative and cross-disciplinary work. The prize is awarded to an individual or team whose project, completed as part of their GSD curriculum, best demonstrates feasibility in design and construction and fulfills market and user needs. Specifically, the jury looks for development proposals that use innovative design strategies to solve a problem, address a need, or serve demand in ways that demonstrate a plausible path to implementation. The 2022 competition committee is comprised of faculty from all departments, including David Gamble (committee chair), Frank Apeseche, Matthew Kiefer, Jungyoon Kim, Rick Peiser, and Elizabeth Whittaker. Questions may be submitted to Caroline Newton, Director of Administration, Office of the Dean. 2022 Recipients First prize Hana Cohn (MLA I ’24), Youngju Kim (MAUD ’23), Arami Matevosyan (MDes REBE ’22), and Naksha Satish (MAUD ’22). Their project, Bracing Peter Bracy: Reclaiming Power & Retaining Roots (BPB) in New Rochelle, NY, is sited in the historic Black neighborhood of Pugsley Hollow, founded in the 1800s by descendants of the earliest freed slaves on record. The development is guided by the idea that housing is more than a physical structure or financial asset—it’s a powerful economic engine for local communities. With that as a principle, BPB puts forward a non-privatized vision to redevelop the only remaining traditional public housing project in New Rochelle. The proposal challenges the cascade of displacement and gentrification by deploying “strategic bracing” measures developed through conversations with local residents, the New Rochelle Municipal Housing Authority, and other affordable housing experts. Strategies include the establishment of a community housing trust and the integration of a spectrum of affordable housing typologies. Integrated by a community corridor of amenities, the plan offers opportunities for greater economic freedom, empowerment, and strong roots for the long-time residents of Peter Bracey to continue their life there and to leverage the potential of transit-oriented development in downtown New Rochelle. Second Prize Nicolas Carmona (MArch II ’22), George Guida (MArch II ’22), and Manu Moritz (MDes REBE ’22). Their proposal, Miami Gateway: Affordable Housing for Resilient Communities, proposes an interdisciplinary and intergovernmental plan in pursuit of housing security and climate resilience. Located in Miami, Florida, the project leverages publicly-owned vacant land to erect prefabricated cross-laminated timber dwelling units for residents living below the local area median income. Organized around key investments outlined by the Miami Affordable Housing Framework, the project develops community-oriented programs, leverages housing innovation funds, and supports new businesses while helping to fill the current deficit of 121,820 affordable units. The project is an exploration of the current American affordable housing landscape, which has tempered its civic ambitions through deference to “the market.” Can we develop inclusive, quality, affordable, and climate-sensitive housing as a public investment in our common future? Third Prize Vicky Chen (MAUD & MDes REBE ’22) and Xudong Zhu (MAUD ’22). Their project, Urban Health Catalyst: An Innovative Health Themed Development Model in Miami Health District, provides an accessible living environment for healthcare employees by introducing mixed-income housing and health-themed programming to the institutional Health District, a developing neighborhood in Miami that is home to the second-largest concentration of medical and scientific facilities in the United States. The proposal utilizes the existing healthcare resources to stimulate the surrounding distressed neighborhoods. By bringing 448 units of mixed-income housing and medical community-oriented programs to the current single-use district, Urban Health Catalyst is meeting market needs to provide a quality, healthy environment for locals and future tenants. Past Recipients 2021 First Prize Sarah Fayad (MLAUD ’20), Ian Grohsgal (MArch I ’21), and Dixi Wu (MDes & MArch I ’22). Their project, Building a Scalable Business in Data Centers, sets up a testing ground for a new scalable paradigm with a more human-centered approach and prepares for the 5G-driven future while addressing the current growing demand in urban areas. Located along the Ottawa River in Gatineau, Québec to take advantage of the booming tech presence in Canada East, the data center sits at the nexus of benefiting three groups: the tenant, the community, and the investor. Second Prize Daniel Garcia (March II ’20), Kyle Ryan (MDes ‘21), and Peeraya Suphasidh (MArch II ’20). Their submission, The Block, is a mixed-use, transit-oriented development proposal of a 10-acre shopping center in Allston, MA. Located at the new Boston Landing MBTA rail stop, this project envisions diverse spaces for living, working, and retail in the form of a new elevated urban square, forming the foundation for a 15-min city. Honorable Mention Andriani Wira Atmadja (MUP ’21) and Nadège Giraudet (MArch I ’21). Their project, The Dolvi Township Project in Raigad, India, aims to develop a sustainable residential prototype on a steep terrain next to the JSW Steel Plant in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region of India. 2020 First Prize MacKenzie Wasson (MArch I ’20). His project, Building Biras: A Hurricane Adapted Caribbean Resort, pairs a disruptive business model with unconventional architecture yielding new realms of opportunity for locals, investors, and resort guests in the British Virgin Islands. Second Prize Tessa Crespo (MDes Risk & Resilience ’20) and Stefan Bird (MIT MSRED ’20). Their project, El Mercado Modelo de Miami, embraces the rich Dominican Republic culture of eating and artisanship in public spaces to envision how a nonprofit multi-stakeholder cooperative can be an incubator and community asset for social and economic mobility in the Allapattah neighborhood of Miami. Honorable Mention Zehui Gong (MAUD ’20), Jing Hai (MAUD ’20), Daisha Martin (MUP ’20), and Sidharth Somana (MDes REBE ’21). Their project, Oasi Plaza, proposes a mixed-use development with new transport modalities that symbiotically merges high-density urban living with a bio-diverse marshland in Medford, Massachusetts. 2019 First Prize Sam Adkisson (MAUD ’19) and Hiroki Kawashima (MAUD ’19). Their project, Metro Strand: Renewed Vitality for Overtown in an Urbanizing Miami, proposes a smarter way for Miami’s continued urbanization, with the added complexity of climate change, to establish a better method for future inner-city growth for the impoverished community of Overtown. Second Prize Augustinas Indrasius (MDes ’19), Peteris Lazovskis (MArch ’20), and Thomas Schaperkotter (March ’20). Their proposal, Carbon Park, LA, reimagines how real estate investment may fuel social benefit and ecological sustainability by connecting private investment with public space to seek balance for investors, the downtown Los Angeles community, and California’s growing carbon economy. 2018 First Prize Georgios Avramides (MDes ’18), Duly Lee (MDes ’18), John Lee (MDes ’18), Emily Marsh (MUP ’18), and Alex Rawding (MUP ’18). Their master plan proposal, Port District Interbay: Seattle, aims to address Seattle’s social challenges through improved transportation systems and is designed to be an economic hub that links residential, office, retail, hotel, public space and trails, and connections to the surrounding community. Second Prize Dalia Alderzi (MDes ’19), Alaa Raafat (MDes ’18), and Carlotta Weller (MDes ’19). Their proposal, Glories Olivetti | Barcelona, Spain, revives the legacy of Olivetti, integrates with the existing 22@ innovation district, and becomes the gateway for two communities: El Clot and 22@ innovation district in Barcelona, Spain. 2017 First Prize Patricia Alvarez (MDes ’18), Lisa Hollywood (MAUD ’17), Chris Merritt (MLA II ‘ 17), and Lindsay Woodson (MDes & MUP ’17). Their submission, NoBe Nexo, re-envisions an 18-acre site in North Beach, Miami Beach as a mixed-use development that addresses sea-level rise, storm surge, and food insecurity issues. Second Prize Maxime Faure (MAUD ’18), Van-Tuong Nguyen (MDes ’18), and Carla Wijaya (MAUD ’18). Their proposal, The W, is for a mixed-use housing development on Boston’s North End waterfront that includes housing for students, young professionals, and single householders, and provides a publicly accessible landscape connection along the waterfront. 2016 Anna Hermann (MArch ’17) and Felipe Oropeza, Jr. (MArch ’17). Their submission, Hotel Alexandra: Conservation and Redevelopment project, completed for the class “Fieldwork in Conservation Design” demonstrates a successful integration of design, feasibility, and implementation strategy.
