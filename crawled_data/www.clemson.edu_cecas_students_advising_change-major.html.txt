Changing to a Major in another College If you want to declare a major in another College, you will need to meet with an academic advisor in your intended major to learn more about the major and any admission criteria you may need to meet. For most majors, you can schedule an “Explore (insert major)” appointment through CU Navigate. If an “Explore” major is not an option in CU Navigate, then you should email an advisor to schedule an appointment. You can find contact information for all advising offices at Clemson on the Academic Advising Contacts by College page. When to Request to Change Your Major Once you have met the requirements to change into your major, you can submit a Change of Academic Program Request in iROAR. This request should be completed as soon as you have received your final grades and have confirmed you meet the criteria to change your major. For in-state students receiving LIFE Scholarship or Palmetto Fellows, changing your major may be necessary for you to be eligible for the STEM enhancement. Some majors have a range of dates when they stop accepting change of major requests for the current term to focus on advising. View a list of these key dates. How to Change Your Major You can submit an Undergraduate Change of Program request iROAR ⟩ Student Self Service ⟩ Undergraduate Change of Program: Major, Minor, Emphasis, Catalog Year. A video on changing majors is available. When your change of academic program is approved and has been processed, you will receive an email notification that will include the name of your new academic advisor. If your request is denied, you’ll receive an email notification that will include comments on why the request was not approved. Appeals Admittance is influenced by GPA. If you have extenuating circumstances, you may submit an appeal for special consideration by the department. Decisions will be shared with students by email.
