Please don't hesitate to contact Brown's Office of Insurance and Purchasing Services with any questions you may have. The Office of International Student and Scholar Services maintains an up to date list of hospitals and medical care centers in the Providence area. Health Insurance at Brown Brown Health Services offers a variety of medical services to all students (undergraduate, graduate, and medical). An annual health services fee is charged to all students to cover the cost of providing care at Health Services. However, this fee does not include health insurance. All students must have separate health insurance to cover services not provided by the Health Services fee (such as lab, x-ray, pharmacy and hospital expenses). Students are automatically enrolled in the Brown Student Health Insurance Plan. This plan is designed specifically to complement the services provided by Health Services and Psychological Services. However, students may waive enrollment in the Student Health Insurance Plan if they are covered by a comparable health insurance plan. It is particularly important that international students verify that their insurance plan provides adequate coverage accessible in the Providence area before waiving the Student Health Insurance.
