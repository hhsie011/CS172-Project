His medicinal chemistry research interests encompass the development of both monoaminergic substrates and inhibitors. The former goal focuses on the characterization of novel fluorescent false neurotransmitters (FFNs) that optically trace the uptake, packaging (in vesicles), and release of neurotransmitters from individual monoaminergic neurons. The latter objective is pharmacologically focused on the development of novel (and safe) small molecule derivatives based on naturally occurring substances that serve as selective monoaminergic inhibitors and most importantly, are useful as potential therapeutics for substance use and psychiatric disorders.
