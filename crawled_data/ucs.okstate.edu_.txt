Clinical Updates University Counseling Services is providing in-person, telehealth or phone appointments as requested. If you have any questions please call 405-744-5458. New Clients New students seeking counseling services can now complete intake appointments over the phone by calling SCC (405-744-5458) to speak to a staff member. They will then be sent a link to necessary paperwork. Upon completion, students will do an intake appointment over the phone during “virtual” walk-in clinic hours (M-F, 10-3). Schedule an appointment The virtual walk-in clinic is available Monday - Friday, 10-3, but rather than coming to the counseling center, majority of all appointments will be done virtually or over the phone. If you have specific questions about counseling services or want to make an appointment, please call 405-744-5458. Immediate Support Students may Call SAM, 1-855-225-2SAM (2726) (Student Assistance by Mercy), which is a FREE 24-hour call center staffed with counselors who will assist you in getting the help you need. In case of emergency, call 911. New Student Information A guide for new OSU students and parents regarding the University Counseling Services and the affiliated centers.
