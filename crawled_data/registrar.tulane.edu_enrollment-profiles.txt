While there were a few limited classes held at remote sites in the area, there were no classes held on the university's main campus. Our students visited away at over 600 institutions during this period. Therefore, no formal enrollment figures will be published for fall 2005. For most reporting purposes, it is suggested that fall 2004 data be used. However, the official Spring 2006 Enrollment counts are presented via PDF for your information. 2004-2005 Fall 2004 Enrollment Profiles Official Fall 2004 Enrollment Tulane University Profile Individual School/College Profiles School of Architecture School of Business Graduate School School of Law School of Medicine Newcomb Tulane College School of Public Health School of Science and Engineering School of Social Work Tulane College University College 2003-2004 Fall 2003 Enrollment Profiles Official Fall 2003 Enrollment Tulane University Profile Individual School/College Profiles School of Architecture School of Business Graduate School School of Law School of Medicine Newcomb Tulane College School of Public Health School of Science and Engineering School of Social Work Tulane College University College 2002-2003 Fall 2002 Enrollment Profiles Official Fall 2002 Enrollment Tulane University Profile Individual School/College Profiles School of Architecture School of Business Graduate School School of Law School of Medicine Newcomb Tulane College School of Public Health School of Science and Engineering School of Social Work Tulane College University College 2001-2002 Fall 2001 Enrollment Profiles Official Fall 2001 Enrollment Tulane University Profile Individual School/College Profiles School of Architecture School of Business School of Science and Engineering Graduate School School of Law School of Medicine Newcomb Tulane College School of Public Health School of Social Work Tulane College University College 2000-2001 Fall 2000 Enrollment Profiles Official Fall 2000 Enrollment Tulane University Profile Individual School/College Profiles School of Architecture School of Business Graduate School School of Law School of Medicine Newcomb Tulane College School of Public Health School of Science and Engineering School of Social Work Tulane College University College Prior Year Enrollment Summaries Total Enrollment 2000-2002 1990-1999 1980-1989 Full-Time Enrollment 2000-2002 1990-1999 1980-1989 Full-Time Equivalents 2000-2002 1990-1999 1980-1989 Enrollment by Gender 1990-1998 1980-1989 Enrollment by Ethnicity 1990-1998 1982-1989 University Profile Assumptions The Classification summary includes all students, both full and part time. Freshmen (First Time) counts only first time full time students classified as freshmen. Continuing freshmen are counted separately in Freshmen (Other). Medical Residents and Fellows are included in the overall counts and in the university's FTE (all as full time). They are also included in the Gender category but not in any of the other demographic categories. Others includes special student types such as guest students, consortium, and non-degree seeking students. As of fall 2019, this category also includes students enrolled in certificate-only programs. Average Course Load is computed in the usual manner except that those students enrolled for zero hours (for example thesis and/or dissertation) are ignored for purposes of the calculation. Full Time Equivalents are computed as the sum of all full time students plus one-third of the part time count. Living On Campus refers to those students residing in all residence halls on the uptown campus. Over 25 Years Old refers to students who have reached their 25th birthday by October 1st (the official fall census date)in the report year. New Admits includes all students admitted for the Fall term in question including first time freshmen and transfer students, guest students etc. Foreign students are defined as those students who are non-resident aliens. This category no longer includes permanent residents from other countries. Ethnic counts include both citizens of the United States as well as citizens of other nations who are now permanent residents in this country. Geographic Regions summarize the student-reported permanent addresses of non-foreign students. Regions are defined as: New Orleans Metro: Zip codes 70001-70345 and 70352-70471 Louisiana: Zip codes 70346 and 70472-71497 Midwest: IL, IN, IA, KS, MI, MN, MO, ND, NE, OH, SD, WI Mountain West: AZ, CO, ID, MT, NV, NM, UT, WY Northeast: CT, ME, MA, NH, NJ, NY, PA, RI, VT Pacific West: AK, CA, HI, OR, WA South Atlantic: DC, DE, FL, GA, MD, NC, SC, VA, WV South Central: AL, AR, KY, MS, OK, TN, TX Enrollment Profiles Important Dates Monday, June 20, 2022 Juneteenth Monday, July 4, 2022 Independence Day Monday, August 15, 2022 Summer Degree Conferral Date Thursday, August 18, 2022 Last Day to Waitlist for a Course Monday, August 22, 2022 CLASSES BEGIN View Academic Calendar Link to Tulane Home Page Tulane University Office of the Registrar 110 Gibson Hall 6823 St. Charles Avenue New Orleans, LA 70118 Phone: 504-865-5231 Fax: 504-865-6760 registrar@tulane.edu Maps & Directions News Give to Tulane Medical Center Neighborhood Relations Contact Us Jobs at Tulane Email MyTulane Gibson Online Copyright Privacy Like Tulane University on Instagram Follow Tulane on Twitter Like Tulane University on Facebook Watch Tulane University YouTube channel Follow Tulane University on LinkedIn © 2022 Tulane University
