In keeping with this goal, the University realizes the need for support and education around the topics of weight, body image, disordered eating, food preoccupation, and exercise obsession. We have found that the pressures which Brown students experience can contribute to an increased emphasis on food, body image, and exercise. Brown students are faced with new living and eating situations. In a small community like ours, students often compare their eating and exercise habits to others. Unfortunately, these comparisons can lead to obsessions and unhealthy behaviors. Eating disorders affect people emotionally, socially, and physically. Therefore, individualized treatment utilizes the expertise of a variety of clinical specialists. These professionals are available to you as a Brown student: Physicians/Physician Assistants/Nurse Practitioners: for medical evaluations, irregular menses, bone health, and anemia Psychotherapists: for counseling around stress, depression, and anxiety, and for referrals to therapists in the community Psychiatrists: for evaluation of cognitive and emotional symptoms, and for medication recommendations Nutritionist: for assistance in addressing barriers to healthy, normal eating and activity patterns, as well as achieving a healthy, natural body weight Getting Help There is hope.

Intuitive Eating is an evidence-based, mind-body health approach, comprised of 10 Principles and created by two dietitians, Evelyn Tribole and Elyse Resch in 1995. It is a weight-neutral model with a validated assessment scale and over 90 studies to date (Tribole 2017). It’s thrilling to see all the research and gives me great hope. Intuitive Eating is a dynamic integration between mind and body. The principles work by either cultivating or removing obstacles to body awareness, a process known as interoceptive awareness. Essentially, Intuitive Eating is a personal process of honoring health by listening and responding to the direct messages of the body in order to meet your physical and psychological needs. by Evelyn Tribole, MS, RDN, CEDRD-S Read more about intuitive eating What is The Health at Every SizeⓇ Approach? The framing for a Health At Every Size (HAES®) approach comes out of discussions among healthcare workers, consumers, and activists who reject both the use of weight, size, or BMI as proxies for health, and the myth that weight is a choice. The HAES model is an approach to both policy and individual decision-making. It addresses broad forces that support health, such as safe and affordable access. It also helps people find sustainable practices that support individual and community well-being. The HAES approach honors the healing power of social connections, evolves in response to the experiences and needs of a diverse community, and grounds itself in a social justice framework. by the Association for Size Diversity and Health (ASDAH) Read about the HAESⓇ Principles Get Involved Meet Our Staff About Us Make an Appointment Brown University BWell Health Promotion Health and Wellness Brown University Box 1928 450 Brook Street Providence, Rhode Island, 02912 Phone 401-863-2794 Fax 401-863-7953 [email protected] © 2022 Brown University Connect: [email protected] Related Offices Brown EMS Counseling and Psychological Services Health Services Social Media BWell on Facebook SHAG on Facebook BURP on Facebook Health Services on Facebook
