If you are unable to visit our office, we can easily schedule a telephone appointment. Current Students Students are encouraged to schedule an appointment so that we can ensure your questions will receive adequate time and attention. Please make an appointment at least 24 hours in advance with the appropriate financial aid counselor (see "Financial Aid Staff" below). An appointment can be made in person or by calling the Office of Student Services at 617-552-3300 or 800-294-0294. Please give us some details about your situation so that your financial aid counselor can do as much research as possible before your appointment. If you are unable to visit our office, we can easily schedule a telephone appointment. If a student has a true financial aid emergency, a financial aid counselor is available. During the first week of each semester a student can meet with a financial aid counselor on a walk-in basis. No appointments are necessary during the opening of each semester. Students are assigned a counselor according to the first letter of their last name. The counselors' assigned alphabetical range will appear after their names. These assignments are subject to change.
