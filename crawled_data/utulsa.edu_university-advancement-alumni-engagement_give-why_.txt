TU is fortunate to have a substantial endowment due to the generosity of many over the years. However, only about 20 percent of TU’s annual budget is obtained from the endowment each year and most of this money is restricted to specific programs, limiting the amount of operating flexibility. Annual giving dollars make an immediate impact by providing scholarships, improving technology and providing students with unique educational opportunities, among other great needs. What if I can’t afford to make a large gift this year? Does my gift even make a difference? Every tax-deductible gift makes a difference to TU, and gifts from alumni send a powerful message that the TU “family” proudly supports this institution and its educational mission. Your gift represents the ultimate vote of confidence, carrying enormous weight in influencing national college rankings. As TU moves up in the rankings, so does the value of your degree. Regardless of the size of your gift, your support is important and does make a difference to the students of TU. Why should I support the TU Annual Fund? Tuition, fees and endowment income only cover about 69 percent of the total cost of a TU education. The rest comes from private gifts. Alumni and friends who choose to contribute to the TU Annual Fund each year help meet the university’s ongoing need for flexible, unrestricted income to support our academic mission. Last year alone, thousands of donors provided significant support to the TU Annual Fund that helped the university: Attract and maintain world-class faculty in each department Continue its commitment to providing scholarship support Renew subscriptions to scholarly journals and keep our library up-to-date with the information our students need to support their educational experience Purchase needed materials and technologies used by our faculty members Provide support for every facet of the student experience Simply put, as a donor to the TU Annual Fund, you help TU continue to grow as an incomparable place of higher learning. What’s the difference between restricted gifts and unrestricted gifts? Restricted gifts have their uses designated to a particular purpose or project. The majority of interest income generated by the university’s endowment is allocated in advance for specific uses. Money given to the Annual Fund, in contrast, is unrestricted, meaning that it is disbursed on a current-use basis to meet some of the university’s most pressing needs. I work for a matching gift company. How do I secure a matching gift for TU? Thank you for designating your company’s matching gifts to TU. If you or your spouse work for a matching gift company, and you direct it to TU along with your gift, you will be given credit for the total gift amount. Simply contact your company’s human resources department and ask for matching gift forms. Then send the form to TU with your gift — or submit your employer’s online application — and we will take care of the rest. By taking advantage of matching gift opportunities, your gift can double or triple its impact at TU. Matching Gift and Volunteer Grant information provided by 800 S.
