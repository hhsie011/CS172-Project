PubMed Research Research Overview Katie Sharkey's research focuses on sleep and circadian rhythms, particularly in relation to mood regulation, psychiatry, and women's health. Her current projects include a study of sleep and circadian rhythms across the perinatal period and two intervention trials examining the effects of chronotherapy on mood in pregnant women with anxiety or depression. Funded Research ONGOING SUPPORT Personalized Integrated Chronotherapy for Perinatal Depression Role: PI 1 R01 MH118269 12/01/2019-11/30/2023 $5,107, 700 This study is a four-site confirmatory efficacy randomized clinical trial with Johns Hopkins, University of North Carolina, and Zucker Hospital to test an integrated sleep-circadian intervention for perinatal major depressive disorder and assess outcomes on infant sleep and circadian rhythms. Sleep, Stress, Depressive Symptoms and Other Determinants of Infant Feeding (Risica) Role: Co-investigator Hassenfeld Child Health Innovation Award 4/1/19– 4/30/21 $25,000 This project addresses determinants of childhood obesity, measuring potential key contributors of maternal stress, sleep and infant feeding attitudes and plans during pregnancy, followed by maternal and infant sleep, maternal stress and infant feeding attitudes and behaviors during the first four months postpartum. Alpert Medical School Summer Research Program T35HL094308 (Multi-PIs: Harringon, Tunkel, Sharkey) Role: Co-PI NHLBI 08/01/2009 - 08/31/2024 $56,970 This grant provides support for summer training for medical students interested in pursuing careers as physician scientists. Intervening in sleep to improve perinatal mental health outcomes Role: Co-investigator Health Research Council of New Zealand 10/01/20-9/30/21 $29,964 The aim of this research is to improve perinatal mental health in New Zealand through sleep and circadian health education and intervention. This activation project will be used to explore current knowledge and existing services in this space; expand current networks to bring together researchers, clinicians and health service delivery groups working on this issue; and develop future research that will implement and test the efficacy of psychoeducational methods with a sleep and circadian health focus. COMPLETED SUPPORT Advance CTR Grant Resubmission Award (Sharkey) Role: PI Advance CTR 3/20/19– 4/30/19 $10,000 This grant supports additional data collection to further support the PI’s R01 proposal on a novel chronotherapy intervention for perinatal depression.

Brown University/Women & Infants Hospital National Center of Excellence in Women’s Health Innovations in Women’s Health Research Seed Grant (PI: Sharkey) 01/01/10 – 06/30/11 Role of Sleep and Circadian Phase Disruption in Postpartum Depression Role: Principal Investigator The goals of this project are to describe changes in sleep times, patterns of light exposure, and circadian rhythms during the perinatal period in women with a history of major depression and to test the hypothesis that changes in sleep and circadian rhythms are associated with postpartum depressive symptoms. These pilot data will support a planned NIH grant proposal. Sleep Research Society Foundation J. Christian Gillin, MD Research Grant (PI: Sharkey) 07/15/10 – 03/31/12 Sleep and Circadian Phase Disruption in Postpartum Depression Role: Principal Investigator The goals of this project are to describe changes in sleep times, patterns of light exposure, and circadian rhythms during the perinatal period in women with a history of major depression and bipolar disorder and to test the hypothesis that changes in sleep and circadian rhythms are associated with postpartum manic and depressive symptoms.
