Header Content Thursday, May 12, 2022 6:00 PM to 8:30 PM Joseph I. Lubin House 11 E 61st St New York, NY 10065 ’80s Night for ’80s Alumni will be “A Night to Remember” and a perfect warm-up for Orange Central homecoming and reunion weekend this Fall. Take a “Fast Car” to campus and keep the party going - book your hotel today and start making travel plans! Grab your Walkman and warm up your crimping iron as we reunite the classes of the BEST decade ever—the ’80s! We’re transforming New York City’s Lubin House for the most gnarly night you’ve had since your college days. Neon lights, rad party favors, and a playlist that would make Prince proud await you as you flip through old yearbooks and walk (or dance!) down memory lane. You’ll be humming “If I Could Turn Back Time” as you enjoy food (yes, toasted honey buns!) and drinks—and anyone who rocks ’80s fashion or vintage Orange gear will be in the running for totally tubular door prizes. $25 per person (includes giveaways, food and bar) Questions?
