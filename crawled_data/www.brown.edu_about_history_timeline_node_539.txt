During her tenure at Brown, Simmons created an ambitious set of initiatives - The Plan for Academic Enrichment - designed to expand and strengthen the faculty; increased financial support and resources for undergraduate, graduate and medical students; improved facilities; renewed a broad commitment to shared governance; and ensured that diversity informed every dimension of the University. These initiatives led to a major investment of new resources in Brown’s educational mission.
