Drawing from her background in science and philosophy, she is particularly interested in first-order paleoclimate questions: How does Earth transition from a climate capable of sustaining palm trees in the Arctic Circle to one with expansive icesheets, not once but several times? How can scientists leverage an imperfect proxy record to not only reconstruct ancient temperatures, but also oceanic and atmospheric circulation circulation patterns? Her research utilizes both computational and laboratory techniques to address a broad range of topics, from experimentally determining the effects of heat on seasonally resolved geochemical signals from clam shells to using modern sea surface temperatures to demonstrate how dynamical processes might bias interpretations of paleoclimate data. In July 2020, she began a postdoctoral fellowship with the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History working on the PhanTASTIC project.
