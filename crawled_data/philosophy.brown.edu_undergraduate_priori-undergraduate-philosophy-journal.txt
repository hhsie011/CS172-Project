We aim to serve both undergraduate philosophy students, who hone their abilities for creative and critical thinking, and society at large, which invariably draws on philosophical ideas when making its most important decisions. The Journal especially encourages submissions addressing topics on the margins of traditional analytical philosophy, including essays on philosophy of race, philosophy of gender, and non-Western philosophy. We are furthermore committed to highlighting the work of students from groups underrepresented in philosophy.
