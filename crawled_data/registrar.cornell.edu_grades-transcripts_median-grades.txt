Median grades and total enrollment are posted on official transcripts for all undergraduates who have matriculated by fall 2008. Median grades are not displayed on the transcripts for transfers who entered Cornell before the spring 2009 semester. The median grade is the grade below and above which there is an equal number of grades. Total enrollment indicates the total number of students who took the course for a letter grade. For cross-listed courses, the enrollment indicates the aggregate number of students. Median grades are not reported for courses with an enrollment fewer than 10. Letter grades for all students enrolled in a course, not just undergraduates, are used in calculating the median grade. If there is a tie, the median grade is rounded down to the lower grade. The median grade is not recalculated to take into account grade changes or resolution of incompletes. Median grade reports for Cornell University courses are no longer available. Cornell faculty and administrators who are pursuing scholarship research may request access to this data by contacting the University Registrar.
