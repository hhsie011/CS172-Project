Marcelle Mentor Mentor, Marcelle Lecturer Tuesday, Sep 17, 2019 Education Week Affirming Black Girls’ Humanity: Yolanda Sealey-Ruiz blogs in Education Week about the huge disparity in school suspension "Before deeply investigating the disparities in their suspension data, school districts must first acknowledge and affirm the humanity of black girls. They must understand how their practice of disproportionately suspending them is an infringement on their humanity. Black girls deserve to be seen for their complexity and should not have certain aspects of their behavior stereotyped as defiant and deviant. Stereotypes flatten their experiences."
