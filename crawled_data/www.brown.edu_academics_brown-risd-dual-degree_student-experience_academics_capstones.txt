In keeping with the original program goal to draw on the complementary strengths of Brown University and the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) to provide students with a range of opportunities to develop and integrate academic and artistic work, beginning with the Class of 2024 (class entering in fall 2019), the Capstone will require BRDD students to complete a final project, by the end of their fifth year, relating (integrating, correlating) in some way, some aspect (content, approach, methods) of what they have learned in their studio courses, on the one hand, with some aspect of their liberal studies, on the other. An obvious way for a student to do this will be to interrelate some aspect of their Brown concentration and RISD major, but this is not necessary. Most of the work for this project will be done in a credit-bearing course, taken in the student's fourth or fifth year. A BRDD Capstone Research Seminar will be offered every year in RISD's Wintersession for this purpose. Alternative ways of completing the project will include enrolling in one of the regular RISD Open Seminars (offered in each of RISD's Liberal Arts departments), taking an ISP at RISD or an ISP or GISP at Brown, or (with the approval of the Co-chairs and Assistant Director of the program, using another course either at Brown or RISD that would provide the opportunity for doing a similar kind of project.
