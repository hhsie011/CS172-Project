Sponsored by the Medieval Academy of America, this prize supports the research of early-stage Medieval scholars in honor of the former MAA Fellow, Olivia Remie Constable (1961-2014). Professor Kinias was granted the Constable Award for the project, “Documentation and Analysis of Paintings at the Monastery of Saint-Baptiste de Moncel )1300-1650.” The prize will fund her travel to France to photograph and conduct an art-historical analysis of the fourteenth-century wall paintings in the monastic refectory. Kinias’ analysis contributes to a larger project coordinated by the Club du Vieux Manoir — the current owners of the Abbey of Moncel — and the Laboratoire de Recherche des Monuments Historiques in the documentation and preservation of this important site. Congratulations, Professor! Image: Wall of the Abbaye du Moncel, courtesy of Erica Kinias.
