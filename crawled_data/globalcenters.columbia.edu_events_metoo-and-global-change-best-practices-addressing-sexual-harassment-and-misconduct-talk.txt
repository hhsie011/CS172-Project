Yet reporting remains difficult for many women (and men) and change can be slow to take effect. Still, from media to McDonalds and from private homes to public universities, women are increasingly speaking about their experiences and public and private institutions are responding. As a University leader and legal advocate, Suzanne Goldberg will reflect on the challenges of reporting sexual misconduct and strategies for changing law, policy, and social discourse. Suzanne Goldberg is Executive Vice President for University Life and Herbert and Doris Wechsler Clinical Professor of Law at Columbia University. In her role as EVP, she works to reinforce and broaden the University's commitment to respect, inclusion, and ethical leadership among students, faculty, and administrators. Suzanne is a recognized expert in sexuality and gender law and has worked with universities, private employers, and governments on addressing sexual harassment and misconduct. Her teaching, writing and leadership in social justice efforts has been recognized with numerous awards. She is currently working on a project for the American Law Institute to develop procedural frameworks for campus sexual misconduct cases and has led Columbia University's Sexual Respect and Community Citizenship Initiative.
