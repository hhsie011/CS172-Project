The Engineering Safety Officer informs all graduate students of the dates and times that these (three hour) seminars are held. Failure to attend one of these seminars can negate a TA or a RA appointment. Depending upon the nature of the particular research that a student becomes involved with, the student might need to attend other safety training (e.g., hazardous waste, laser safety, biosafety, radiation safety, etc.).
