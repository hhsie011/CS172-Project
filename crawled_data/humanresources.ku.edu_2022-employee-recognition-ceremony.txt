The team demonstrated dedication through countless hours of reviewing, documenting, and crafting workflow processes, creating and implementing new training all while managing current work assignments and adjusting to support new colleagues. This team’s work was an exercise in adapting to changing circumstances to benefit research at KU combined with creative problem solving to figure out the best way to update processes and rearrange personnel into a more effective structure. The project directly supports the institutional priority of Research & Discovery by improving service to campus partners and reducing administrative burden and supporting the Healthy & Vibrant Communities priority by supporting workplace satisfaction.

The students went to three different virtual locations, Laguna Beach, Aspen, and Las Vegas. The students heard from keynote speakers, attended educational mini-sessions, and attended a networking fair to learn more about employers and career opportunities. Each member contributed different skills, such as creating the various necessary technology elements, promotional items, and customized swag for each student attendee. The team found a way to bridge professional academic development with personal development in a fun and energetic way for students, creating an event that affirmed peoples’ humanity when they were feeling defeated by the pandemic.
