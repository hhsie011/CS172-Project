Move to Self-Service Banner 9 Representatives from business units across campus are working with ITCS to implement the upgraded Self-Service Banner 9 (SSB-9) applications.SSB-9 includes an updated user experience, a modern and mobile friendly user interface, and new functionality for students and employees. The first SSB-9 applications, My Information and Employee Self Service, became available in November 2019, followed by Student Self Service and Faculty & Advisor Self Service in January 2020, and Finance Self Service in March 2020. The project team is targeting March 2022 to go live with the updated SSB-9 Registration application. As new functionality becomes available, ITCS will work closely with the Banner Change Management committee and functional users to evaluate and make this new functionality available. All updates are tested and verified in a non-production environment before being made available to the campus. As with any system upgrade, we understand people often grow concerned over future changes. ITCS has and will continue to work closely with campus administrative departments to anticipate and alleviate those concerns. We welcome user involvement as a part of this initiative, and if you have questions or feedback, feel free to contact me at stanleyd14@ecu.edu.
