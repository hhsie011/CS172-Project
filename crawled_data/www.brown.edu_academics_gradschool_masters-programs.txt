Individual departments and programs may have additional requirements regarding the number of required courses, and the timing of those courses across semesters, proficiency in foreign languages, special examinations, and theses. All work to be used in fulfillment of the requirements for a master's degree must be completed within a period of five years. Graduate work done in graduate residence at other institutions may be offered in partial fulfillment of the requirements for a master's degree, provided it is approved by the department or program and by the Registrar. Specifically, one post-graduate course may be transferred to an 8-course master's program; two courses may be transferred to a 14-course or greater master's degree. If a faculty member working with a master's student leaves Brown for any reason before that student has completed his or her degree requirements, it may not always be possible for that faculty member to continue working with the student as an advisor. In such cases, departments will work with students to help them locate a new advisor.
