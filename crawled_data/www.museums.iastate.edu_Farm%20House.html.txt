The Farm House Museum will again close Saturday, July 2 through Sunday, August 21. Nestled in the center of Iowa State University, the Farm House Museum sits as a monument to early Iowa State history and culture. The first building on campus as well as a National Historic Landmark, the Farm House was built in 1860 and functioned as living quarters for various Iowa State deans, professors, farmhands and students. Undergoing a lengthy restoration from 1970-76, the Farm House evolved into a public museum. Now students, faculty and community members can enjoy the museum while remembering the significance that one small building had upon shaping a nationally recognized land-grant university.
