Len Blavatnik The Foundation’s commitment to Harvard benefiting Harvard Medical School is the most recent in a long history of generous gifts to academic institutions in support of the life sciences. The Foundation’s history of support at Harvard originated with the 2007 establishment of the Biomedical Accelerator Fund. In 2013, a $50-million gift launched the Blavatnik Biomedical Accelerator at Harvard University and the Blavatnik Fellowship in Life Science Entrepreneurship at Harvard Business School. The Foundation is best known for its Blavatnik Awards for Young Scientists, which supports noteworthy young scientists and engineers. The Foundation is headed by Len Blavatnik, a global industrialist and philanthropist who received his MBA from Harvard Business School in 1989. Blavatnik is founder and chairman of Access Industries, a privately held U.S industrial group with global strategic interests in natural resources and chemicals, media and telecommunications, venture capital and real estate. Harvard Medical School is deeply grateful that the Blavatnik Family Foundation has chosen to make this landmark gift to Harvard. We believe passionately that it will bring us closer to solving the most intractable health challenges of our time.
