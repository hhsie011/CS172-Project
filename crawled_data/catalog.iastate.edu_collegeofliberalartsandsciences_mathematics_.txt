Students desiring to undertake graduate work leading to the M.S. or Ph.D. degree should prepare themselves by taking several upper division mathematics courses. The M.S. degree requires a student to take at least 30 credit hours and to write a creative component or thesis. Additionally, students must pass a comprehensive oral examination over their coursework and their creative component or thesis. See the online Mathematics Graduate Handbook for specific requirements. The Ph.D. degree requires a student to take 42 credit hours of coursework in addition to research hours, pass written qualifying examinations, pass an oral preliminary exam, and perform an original research project culminating in a dissertation which is defended by an oral exam. Ph.D. candidates must have at least one year of supervised teaching experience. See the on-line Mathematics Graduate Handbook for specific requirements.
