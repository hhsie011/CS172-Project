As part of our land-grant mission, we believe it is vital that we hear from companies and other employers within our state and across our region about what is important to them. We want to equip our graduates with a thoughtful set of competencies that prepare them to deal with real-world challenges and to apply their technical training within a context that understands the “why” behind their discipline.
