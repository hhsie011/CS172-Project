Register ROAD AT WARGEMONT BY PIERRE RENOIR Sat., Jul. 23, 12-4pm / $89 / One Class All supplies included in class fee. Instructor: Kevin McCarty In-person at VPC A dreamlike landscape with the wind picking up and a storm rolling into the valley, this painting is arguably Renoir’s greatest landscapes. Drawing on the traditions of Ruebens’ late landscapes to the present day of the abstract expressionist, William de Kooning, with his flourish of brushwork in some of the passages. In this painting, the artist’s glowing tones glide into each other, blurring the contours in a view of hills with a meandering, winding road, lines of trees, and clumps of bushes. Come to this class to learn and practice how Renoir blurred his colors by applying thin, translucent layers of color with feathery brushstrokes in a wet-into-wet technique, meaning applying fresh paint to already-wet areas. This method gave the image its fluid, unfocused, and luminous appearance. Build your own skills using Renoir’s painting techniques to produce your own version of the Road at Waremont to take home and enjoy. You will receive one gallery-wrapped, stretched 11 x 14” fine art canvas, a set of brushes, and a full set of acrylic paints in a wide spectrum of colors, at no extra cost. Take home your own original piece of art ready for framing. About Your Instructor Kevin McCarty Kevin has been a professional artist for over 40 years painting landscapes, portraits, and still life. Living and painting in Europe have been major influences on his painting style, as he obtained first-hand knowledge of the great masters. Invite a friend to come to class with you!
