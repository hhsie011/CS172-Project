Given the unprecedented circumstances during the Spring 2020 semester as a result of the outbreak of COVID-19 and the resulting provisions implemented by many institutions to convert grading of coursework to Pass/Fail (or a similar grading basis), Baylor University will provide reasonable flexibility with its expectation that incoming transfer credit noted as “Pass,” “Satisfactory,” or a similar notation from Spring 2020 meet the normal criteria of an earned grade of C or better. Additionally, courses with a grade of “Pass” (or similar) completed during Summer 2020, Fall 2020, and Spring 2021 will be eligible for transfer from institutions with a documented policy of extended Pass/Fail grading related to COVID-19 during those terms. Please note that this credit may or may not meet pre-requisite or degree requirements. General Policies on Transfer Credit A grade of "C" or better must be earned in all courses transferred to Baylor; this coursework does not alter the Baylor grade point average. A maximum of seventy (70) semester hours may be transferred from a community/junior college. A minimum of sixty (60) semester hours must be earned in residence. After a student achieves senior standing (90 earned credits), all upper division courses (3000 or 4000 level) must be taken in residence (or in a Baylor approved study abroad program). A student should plan to be enrolled at Baylor in the semester that he or she is a degree candidate. No course at or above the "3000" level may be taken at a community/junior college, and no community/junior college course will be evaluated as an advanced course. In fall and spring semesters, course credit will not be given for courses taken at other colleges or universities if a student is concurrently enrolled at Baylor University. During summer sessions, course credits can be earned at Baylor and other institutions as long as the total course load does not exceed 19 semester credit hours for the entire summer. (The University strongly recommends against students being enrolled in greater than 8 hours simultaneously for a term(s) that is fewer than 8 weeks in duration.) Courses taken pass/fail will not be eligible for transfer. Baylor highly values oral and written communication. The university believes that our required English courses provide students with the essential preparation they need to strengthen their writing abilities. Consequently, if a student earns credit for as many as two of the four required English courses before registering as a Baylor student (i.e. pre matriculation), the university strongly recommends that the remaining English credit be earned in residence. Policies Specific to Coursework Transferred in Post-matriculation After matriculation (meaning after a student has enrolled at Baylor), a student may transfer a maximum of fifteen (15) semester hours to Baylor for degree credit. After matriculation, a student may transfer a maximum of two (2) courses from any single course prefix (e.g., ENG, HIS, or SPA). Some departments may require students who transfer courses at the post-matriculation level from another institution to complete a Readiness Exam prior to beginning a subsequent course for which the transferred course is a prerequisite. A Readiness Exam is only administered to students who have transferred in a prerequisite course and who have enrolled in a subsequent course within that discipline at Baylor. The purpose of the exam is not to determine credit for a course taken at another college or university, but rather to provide students with information regarding their preparedness for the course they intend to take. Courses taken in residence may not be repeated at another school for degree credit.
