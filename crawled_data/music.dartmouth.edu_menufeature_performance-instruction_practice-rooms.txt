The practice rooms, each of which includes a piano, music stand, and chair, are grouped into three hubs (34, 35, and 36) accessible from the left-hand side of the hallway which extends straight from the lower level door past Hartman Rehearsal Hall (map). In each hub of 4 practice rooms, the two rooms closest to the hallway door (rooms A and D) have upright pianos, while the rooms farthest from the door (rooms B and C) have grand pianos. All rooms are unlocked and available to all students, but students enrolled in IIP piano lessons (MUS 53) have priority access to the grand piano practice rooms (rooms B and D). If all grand piano practice rooms are in use, a MUS 53 student in need of practice space may ask a non-MUS 53 student to vacate a grand piano room for them. What if all the practice rooms are in use? If you find all the practice rooms occupied, head upstairs to the front office of the Music Department and speak to the Administrative Assistant or the Department Administrator (hours: 8:30 AM-4:30 PM). They may be able to find an open classroom, studio, or rehearsal room and reserve it for your practice session. If you are enrolled in IIP piano lessons (MUS 53) and all grand piano rooms are taken, you may ask a non-piano student in one of the grand piano rooms to vacate the space for you. Hours and Rooms Practice rooms are open 7 days a week, 8:00 AM-midnight, except for on certain holidays when the Hopkins Center building is closed.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Music Undergraduate Music at Dartmouth Major and Minor Courses Spring 2022 Summer 2022 Fall 2022 Winter 2023 Spring 2023 Honors Honors Projects Funding Graduate Overview Apply People Current Students Performance Overview Individual Instruction Student Recitals Performance Laboratories Hopkins Center Ensembles Practice Rooms Instruments and Lockers Foreign Study Overview London FSP Vienna FSP News & Events News Events Arts Awards Leonard J.
