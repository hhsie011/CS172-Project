Everyone was out. Red fire galore, and moonlight-- about 3,000 gathered on Library Slope above the fire. Yowls, cheers and songs, and speakers were on the program. The chimes played too. [? Alegra ?] and I have a new occupation. We take walks after dark and explore the campus. Wednesday evening, we went up to the library tower where they play the chimes. While the chimes were playing, the tower seemed nearly as high as the Washington Monument. The chimes made so much noise, we couldn't hear each other. It was very exciting, and lots of fun-- Mary Elizabeth Fessenden, December 10, 1932. Transcript Request Form Name Email Address Disability Accommodation? Disability Accommodation?
