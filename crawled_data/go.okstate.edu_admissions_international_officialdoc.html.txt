The current COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in widespread English testing center closures in impacted regions. In response to this global crisis, OSU will now temporarily accept Duolingo English Test (DET) results from spring and fall 2021 applicants who are unable to take the TOEFL or IELTS due to exam cancellations. * English language proficiency requirement will be waived for American-based international high school students who have attended an English-speaking school for 3 or more years. * English language proficiency exams will be waived for transfer students who have 24 or more transferable credit hours from a U.S. or English-speaking post-secondary institution. * Official TOEFL and IELTS Academic exam scores are valid for two years from the date of the original exam.
