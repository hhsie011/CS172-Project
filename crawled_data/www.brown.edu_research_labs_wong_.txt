Physically, we explore how materials and mechanical aspects of the tumor microenvironment regulate malignant behavior both in 2D and in 3D. Biologically, we seek new insights into single cell heterogeneity and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Our approach will have a translational component, enabling high-throughput screening of new therapeutic compounds. Home News People Ian Y.
