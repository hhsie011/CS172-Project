The bridge is often crowded with students as they make their way between classes. 0:19-0:32 Purple letters spelling "Clemson University Civil Engineering" are on the side of a golf cart. Two graduate civil engineering students are using the cart as they prepare to survey the campus sidewalks for an accessibility project. They both help to set up the surveying equipment. 0:33-0:36 Four females are in a lab, looking over a blue device that holds samples. 0:37-0:46 The same device is seen again with two males and one female sitting in front of it, with a pen, paper, and a calculator. The students fade as a white Tiger Paw comes into focus in the center of the screen. The video concludes. × CECAS In The News More News Teaming Up for Success The student experience in the College of Engineering, Computing, and Applied Sciences is centered around preparing and equipping you to achieve academic success, building genuine relationships to develop a supportive personal and professional network, and developing the skillset and mindset to succeed in your future career.
