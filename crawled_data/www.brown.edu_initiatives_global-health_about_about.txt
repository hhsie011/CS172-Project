Brown University has taken bold action to address global health challenges and improve health care and health care systems in communities around the world. The core of Brown's mission is to educate the next generation of leaders to tackle increasingly complex issues of health, economics, population and environment in a global society. As the University internationalizes, this mission includes partnerships with institutions in the world's developing nations that are having a direct and positive impact on people in these regions. In order to fully tap the potential of this effort, the Global Health Initiative was established in 2009 to expand Brown's partnerships; to bring together faculty members, students, and international collaborators; and to spur innovation and coordination. With current projects and programs in 33 countries - 28 of which are in developing countries - Brown is particularly well-positioned to expand and to accelerate these efforts through the Global Health Initiative. Under the guidance of Edward J. Wing, MD, Dean of the Division of Biology and Medicine between 2008 and 2013, the Initiative has grown to encompass a wide range of practitioners and researchers across medicine, public health, biomedical research, social science, and engineering to provide sustainable solutions in partnership with communities and institutions in Africa, India, Southeast Asia, the Caribbean, and the Pacific. The Initiative was inaugurated with a symposium in September 2009, and Susan Cu-Uvin, MD, professor of obstetrics and gynecology and medicine is its inaugural director.
