Lecturer Office: Daniel Hall 416 Phone: Email: sdhakim@clemson.edu Vita: View Educational Background Focus in Sports Communication and Statistics Ph.D. Communication and Information Sciences 2021, The University of Alabama M.A. Communication Studies 2016, The University at Buffalo, SUNY B.A. Communication 2014, The University at Buffalo, SUNY Courses Taught COMM 4250 (Advanced Sport Communication - Fall 2021 COMM 3240 (Communication, Sport, and Society - Fall 2021) COMM 2500 (Public Speaking - Fall 2021, Spring 2022) COMM 2030 (Communication Inquiry - Spring 2022) COMM 3270 (Sport Media Criticism - Spring 2022) Profile Dr. Sam Hakim joined Clemson in the Fall 2021 as a lecturer focusing in sports communication. He graduated with his Ph.D. in Communication and Information Sciences from The University of Alabama. Sam's area of interest is in interpersonal fan-athlete communication and fan identity. Sam is a motivated teacher and applies his classroom philosophies - teach from the heart and be present - to guide his seminars and daily class discussions. Sam is presently teaching COMM 3270, 2030 (two sections), and 2500 for Spring of 2022. Research Interests Dr. Sam Hakim's research interest surround interpersonal relationships and communication between fans and athletes. Sam has always been curious about athlete-centered communication and how their individual attributes, availability, and communication can create lasting relationships with their communities. Additionally, Sam recently co-authored articles regarding athlete mental health stigma in the NBA, journalistic views of mental health within e-gaming, mediated fan communication in the NBA, and bibliometrics. Looking forward, Sam intends to focus additional research efforts on fan-athlete communication including how interpersonal thin-slice interaction can create fan identity changes. While much of Sam's research is quantitatively based, he does enjoy exploring qualitative approaches to unique research questions. The blue-collar scholar knows that it is all about finding the right tool for the job. Research philosophy: "Research is never done alone." Research Publications Griffin, D. J., Arth, Z.
