(Ithaca) Field of Study Applied Physics Program Description Graduate study in the field offers the opportunity to achieve proficiency in physics, mathematics, and applied science. Applied physics is particularly suitable for students preparing for a scientific career in an area of applied science based on principles and techniques of physics. A student may choose for specialization and thesis or dissertation research any subject compatible with an approach based on the application of principles of physics and mathematics. Current areas of advanced study and research include applied theoretical physics, biophysics, chemical physics, physics of fluids, nuclear and reactor physics, optics, laser physics, plasma physics, solid-state physics, nano-science, and space physics. A professional program leading to the degree of Master of Engineering (Engineering Physics) offers students the opportunity to master advanced topics in physics and extend their skills in their chosen engineering specialties. Additional details about the Applied physics graduate programs are on the website, www.aep.cornell.edu.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
