For years, Army ROTC has been creating leaders who go on to rewarding careers in the military and civilian worlds. Syracuse University’s Army ROTC college leadership program offers a commission as a second lieutenant in either the active Army or Reserves/National Guard in a variety of career fields including Combat Arms (Aviation, Armor, Artillery, Infantry, or Engineers), Combat Support, and Combat Service Support branches.
