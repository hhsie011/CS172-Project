More information can be found here: https://www.cs.iastate.edu/cs.iastate.edu/concurrent-comajor-transfer Graduate programs The department offers graduate programs leading to degrees of Master of Science (MS) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) with a major in Computer Science. The Doctor of Philosophy degree may also be earned with computer science as a co-major with some other discipline. Additionally, the department offers a minor for the students majoring in other disciplines. The department also offers a Master of Science (MS) in Artificial Intelligence. This program is for graduate-level students with strong quantitative backgrounds who are interested in learning AI and machine-learning techniques. Established research areas include algorithms, artificial intelligence, computational complexity, computer architecture, bioinformatics, computational biology, computer networks, database systems, formal methods, information assurance, machine learning and neural networks, multimedia, operating systems, parallel and distributed computing, programming languages, robotics, and software engineering. There are also numerous opportunities for interdisciplinary research. Typically, students beginning graduate work in the Department of Computer Science have completed a bachelor’s degree or equivalent in Computer Science. However, some students with undergraduate majors in other areas, such as Mathematical, physical, or biological science or engineering become successful graduate students in Computer Science. For the degree Master of Science, 31 - 34 semester credits is required. A thesis or a creative component demonstrating research and the ability to organize and express significant ideas in computer science is required. The purpose of the doctoral program is to train students to do original research in Computer Science. Each student is also required to attain knowledge and proficiency commensurate with a leadership role in the field. The PhD requirements are governed by the student’s program of study committee within established guidelines of the department and the graduate college. They include coursework (demonstrating breadth and depth of knowledge), a research skills requirement, a preliminary examination, and a doctoral dissertation and final oral examination. The department recommends that all graduate students majoring in Computer Science teach as part of their training for an advanced degree.
