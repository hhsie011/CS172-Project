Meiklejohn Peer Advisors are paired with a faculty advising partner and work with a small group of first-year students for the duration of the academic year. Meiklejohns advise students on course selection, study habits, housing, summer internships and research opportunities, navigating the Brown campus and Providence, and social issues. Offering a student perspective on the University experience, Meiklejohn peer advisors engender an informal, open dialogue that, year after year, proves indispensable to Brown first-years as they navigate their transition to Brown and beyond. The Meiklejohn Peer Advising Program epitomizes Brown's commitment to student-centered and student-directed learning across all four years of study.
