William Sharpe, professor of English at Barnard, uses a wide range of classic and modern works to reveal key motifs that link apparently disparate works, such as those by Fra Angelico and James Joyce, Clementina Hawarden and Kara Walker, Charles Dickens and Kumi Yamashita. He looks at techniques used by writers and artists to represent shadows from the Renaissance to the art of the modern city—from Renoir and Zola to film noir and projection systems that capture the shadows of passers-by on streets around the globe. 212-854-5573 [email protected] Genre Nonfiction Topic Arts Contact Us [email protected] Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
