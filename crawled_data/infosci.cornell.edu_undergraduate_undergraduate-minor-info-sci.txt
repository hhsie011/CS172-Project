Information Science is an interdisciplinary field covering all aspects of digital information. Students will specialize in a particular area of interest in Information Science by choosing classes from one concentration that will provide in-depth study in that area. Suggested courses under each concentration come from within and outside the department. Read the information on each concentration to determine which one best suits your interests and career goals. Eligibility The minor in Information Science is offered in every undergraduate college at Cornell. Because of small differences in regulations between the colleges, there are sometimes slight variations in the requirements depending on your college and, in a few cases, your major. All courses must be chosen from the list. No substitutions are allowed. Some courses in the minor count toward college distribution requirements. Use Cornell's Courses of Study search page to verify whether a course fulfills a distribution in your college. Note that a letter grade of C or better is required for all classes counting toward the minor; S/U courses are not allowed. (For Spring 2020: a letter grade of C- or better is required, or an S*) * The Information Science department cannot know how graduate schools, employers, and so on, will evaluate S grades. Getting started To start the minor, send an email with your name, college, year of study (e.g. 2nd semester sophomore), expected graduation date, and major, and what will be your minor concentration, to the IS Minor Coordinator Terry Horgan. The minor is self-guided. See the Requirements page for further details. Transfer Credit Course credits from institutions other than Cornell cannot be counted toward the Information Science minor.
