Students majoring in ITEC choose between two options: Manufacturing or Occupational Safety. The department also offers a minor in Industrial Technology. Successful ITEC graduates gain knowledge, skills, and abilities in solving technical problems, understanding the design process, excelling in authentic leadership, being aware of safety issues, having a quality orientation, effectively managing projects, and having a systems-thinking perspective. This translates to a holistic approach that uses science and engineering principles to focus on the way the constituent parts of a manufacturing system interrelate, how they work over time, and how they fit the context of larger systems. Graduates find careers within a variety of industries, businesses, and organizations in the fields of advanced manufacturing; robotics; automation and controls; electronics; lean manufacturing; quality management; safety management, loss prevention; or industrial hygiene. Common job duties of ITEC Manufacturing graduates include: quality management production supervision product process design facility planning and management Common job duties of ITEC Occupational Safety graduates include: development, management, and evaluation of safety programs and systems hazard identification and mitigation loss prevention The certificate in occupational safety is designed to meet the needs of the students who will find themselves in management roles with responsibilities that include safety. The certificate program prepares technically-oriented managers to meet their professional safety responsibilities.
