In addition to consulting with their medical provider, an employee may find the Job Accommodation Network (JAN) a helpful resource for learning more about the Americans with Disability Act (ADA) and exploring accommodation options. The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) is another excellent resource for seeking more information about workplace accommodations.
