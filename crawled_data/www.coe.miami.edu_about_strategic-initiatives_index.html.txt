Engineers contribute to society through their dedication and knowledge to achieve something that impacts lives for the better. As the College of Engineering approaches its 75th year in 2022, and the University its centennial, we will implement strategic initiatives to help lead the world in solving pressing problems at the convergence of the physical, chemical, biological and digital worlds: in health engineering, information security, sustainability and resilience, advanced materials and fabrication, energy and environment, outer space exploration and habitation. The faculty in the College of Engineering embrace the challenge and promise of “Engineering Miami for the Future” – a future we have only begun to imagine. The following Strategic Initiatives have been identified by the College of Engineering: I) Attain critical mass of T/TT faculty (add/create a new department to cover missing areas in comparison to our peer institutions) II) Develop a departmental structure with clusters to promote excellence in college-wide research thrusts; the thrusts should build on the strengths of the current faculty and connect to broader University initiatives Promote the initial research thrusts by identifying faculty champions, creating shared facilities and garnering seed funds. A clear outcome is to increase the cohort of PhD students working in these areas to help promote impact and excellence III) Create a Center of Excellence for Teaching & Learning in Engineering Education IV) Launch an International Academy to enhance partnerships with leading Universities across the globe in strategic research areas. V) Develop programs in Innovation and Entrepreneurship in the College to provide training and opportunities for our students at all levels, and for the faculty. VI) Address and improve organizational & operational aspects in the College Roadmap to Our New Century University of Miami Embarks on Bold “Roadmap to the Next Century” The Roadmap to Our New Century is the strategic plan of the University of Miami as it approaches its centennial in 2025.
