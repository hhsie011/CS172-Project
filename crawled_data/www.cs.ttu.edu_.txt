CS makes graduates aware of new technologies and new ideas and is a foundation for many different computing careers. Computer Scientists design and build software and create efficient solutions to real−world problems in fields such as robotics, computer−enhanced vision, and digital forensics. The need for computing professionals and executives right here in the U.S. is growing as companies become more global. Almost every major challenge facing our world is turning to computing for a solution, from conquering disease to eliminating hunger, from improving education to protecting the environment.
