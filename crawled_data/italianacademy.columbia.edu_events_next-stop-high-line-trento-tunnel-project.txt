Abitare magazine: "year's most innovative design" The Trento Tunnel Project is an experiment in the recovery of an abandoned industrial site; in the reinvention of the history museum; in the animation of historical archives. Imagine two 300-meter tunnels wide enough to accommodate four side-by-side tractor trailers, snaking under the cliff that faces the Northern Italian city of Trento. Cut in the 1970s at the expense of the city’s historic Piedicastello district, abandoned in October 2007, these literal “galleries” were brought back to life during the summer of 2008 by means of an unprecedented urban reclamation project carried out under the aegis of the Fondazione Museo Storico del Trentino by FilmWork (Trento), the Stanford Humanities Lab, Studio Terragni Architetti, and Gruppe Gut (Bolzano). This first international presentation of The Trento Tunnel Project celebrates the opening of an immersive exhibition entitled Historically ABC, scheduled to run through the end of 2010 and the project’s selection by the architecture review Abitare as one of this year’s most innovative designs. The March 2 symposium will feature welcoming remarks by David Freedberg (Director, Italian Academy for Advanced Studies), and Giuseppe Ferrandi (Director, Fondazione Museo Storico del Trentino); Project presentation by Jeffrey Schnapp (Project Curator; Harvard/Stanford) and Elisabetta Terragni (Project Architect; CUNY); and a Round table discussion with Kurt Forster (Yale), Aaron Levy (Slought Foundation), Stanislaus von Moos (Zurich), and Vittorio Zucconi (La Repubblica).
