Yet hunger, destitution, and homelessness continue to afflict even the wealthiest communities, including New York City. We are in the midst of what has been described as a social enterprise revolution: From mobile health to microfinance to new approaches to educating and training those born or living in poverty, there are innovative efforts afoot to bring us closer to actually ending poverty. How does poverty shape the way individuals view the world, and make decisions? What are the particular challenges they face in managing their households and savings? What can we learn from recent developments in economics, psychology, and the emerging field of behavioral economics to help the poor manage their lives better?

Behaviorally Informed Anti-Poverty Programs Video of Behaviorally Informed Anti-Poverty Programs Dean Karlan Professor of economics at Yale University and founder of Innovations for Poverty Action Dean Karlan, professor of economics at Yale University and founder of Innovations for Poverty Action, spoke at the Social Enterprise Leadership Forum: The Economics and Psychology of Poverty. He discussed ways to address people’s biases towards the poor’s decision making and how to improve financial packages offered to those in poverty to encourage good fiscal choices. Justine Zinkin ’02, CEO of Neighborhood Trust, then discussed how her organization is applying findings from behavioral economic research in providing adequate banking services for the unbanked.
