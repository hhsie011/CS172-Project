Students who are dropped or deleted from their last or only courses by an academic department because of nonattendance the first day of class are cancelled by the Office of the University Registrar. This cancellation is without liability for tuition. Undergraduate and non-degree seeking students whose registration is cancelled by the University Registrar must apply for readmission if they have not been enrolled for three consecutive terms. Graduate, law and medical students must apply for readmission if they have not been enrolled for two consecutive terms. For the purpose of this policy, the cancellation term is considered a term of non-enrollment. Note: Students who have received some or all of their financial aid prior to the end of drop/add for a term, may be subject to repayment of financial aid if there is a change in their financial aid eligibility. Examples of this may include, but are not limited to, reduction of course load below required levels, cancellation of schedule, failure to meet satisfactory academic progress requirements, and other conditions required to maintain financial aid eligibility.
