In 1887, the Penn Museum was founded to house artifacts from a Penn-led archaeological expedition to Mesopotamia, during which the ancient Sumerian city of Nippur was first excavated. Since then, the University has consistently pursued deeper engagement with the Middle East, and the Middle East Center, founded in 1965, promotes the interdisciplinary study of the region at Penn and throughout the Philadelphia area. Several Middle Eastern languages are currently offered at Penn, including less commonly taught languages such as Ottoman Turkish. Students can also choose from a diverse selection of short- and long-term study and internship opportunities in the region.

The research internship was designed to offer students an opportunity to explore the political, economic, and social significance of these items to the region, while also building their professional development skills through virtual engagements. In addition, the students assisted Heather Sharkey in creatively adapting her Fall seminar, “Food in the Islamic Middle East” for the online format, and in developing a proposal for a new book on food history. The internships were made possible in partnership with the Penn Undergraduate Research Mentoring (PURM) program.

His work in Iran was interrupted by the revolution in 1979, but in 1998 he was invited by Iran's President to return, and was able to set up an office in Tehran for the American Institute of Iranian Studies (for which he is Penn's trustee), and arrange Persian language courses in Tehran for American students every summer until 2005, when the newly elected president terminated the arrangement. His current research seeks to reevaluate the 1979 revolution in terms not only of the history of Iran and the Middle East but of world history.
