Strategic Sourcing is an organized, collaborative, data-driven approach to making informed purchasing decisions that result in achieving cost savings, improved services, and process efficiencies. It is a structured process of analyzing and leveraging overall spend to reduce the total cost of purchased goods and services, negotiate competitive contracts, and implement the most optimal solutions. The focus is on the total cost of ownership (TCO), which is not necessarily the lowest purchase price. Strategic Sourcing is a continuous process of information gathering, monitoring, and planning, as well as collaboration and relationship-management. Role of Strategic Sourcing Through spend analysis, we can identify opportunities to leverage the University’s buying power by consolidating and driving spend to a smaller number of suppliers with whom we negotiate competitive contracts and promote to campus as preferred suppliers.
