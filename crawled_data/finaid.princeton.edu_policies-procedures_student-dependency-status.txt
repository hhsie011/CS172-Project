Princeton students are considered financially dependent upon their parent(s), unless they meet one of the criteria below: Student is over age 25 and has lived as a self-supporting adult for at least two years. Student is under 25 but married and/or has dependent children and has lived as a self-supporting adult while married or with dependent children for at least two years. Student is/was an orphan not later legally adopted or placed in legal guardianship (unless the guardianship placement was within the last two years). Student is/was a ward of the court not later legally adopted or placed in legal guardianship (unless the guardianship placement was within the last two years). Student has been in legal guardianship for less than two years due to parental neglect, abandonment, and/or abuse documentation. Student is a veteran of the United States Armed Forces. A dependency override grants a student, who does not meet the above criteria and would otherwise be considered dependent, independent student status for financial aid purposes only. Parental unwillingness to pay for college or complete the aid application will not be considered for a dependency override.
