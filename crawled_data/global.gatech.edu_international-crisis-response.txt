As global humanitarian crises arise, the Institute leverages its resources and contacts in support of international students, faculty, staff, and alums who are most affected. Support for Ukraine The War on Ukraine is already having a significant impact on our undergraduate and graduate students from Ukraine and neighboring countries. Georgia Tech would like to host a number of students to complete their degrees as well as faculty who need a temporary university home. While supporting current students will be our top priority, we would also like to generate resources to support displaced scholars and welcome them to join our community. We are asking our community to step up, as it always does, to ensure that the students who are already members of the Tech community can complete their studies and that we can help displaced scholars. We estimate an urgent need of between $3 and $4 million in current, expendable funds, which will be administered through the Office of International Education.
