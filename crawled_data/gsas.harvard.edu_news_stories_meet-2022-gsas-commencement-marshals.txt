Posted on May 9, 2022 Each year, the GSAS Student Council (GSC) chooses its Commencement marshals to represent the School’s graduating class. Marshal nominations are made by members of the GSAS community, including students, the nominee’s graduate program administrator, or Harvard faculty. To be selected as a GSAS marshal is considered an honor for a graduating student and is one of Harvard’s most well-loved Commencement traditions. On the morning of Commencement, marshals help the School’s deans organize the procession from the Lawns at Richards Hall to Harvard Yard. Walking at the head of the procession, they proudly hoist the School gonfalon as they lead the graduating class into Tercentenary Theatre. The 2022 Commencement marshals representing the doctor of philosophy are: Tobias Egle, PhD, Engineering Sciences (Materials Science & Mechanical Engineering) Xavier du Maine, PhD, Biological and Biomedical Sciences Malinda McPherson, PhD, Speech and Hearing, Bioscience and Technology Rhine Samajdar, PhD, Physics Weilu Shen, PhD, Engineering Sciences (Applied Physics) Christian Struck, PhD, Germanic Languages and Literature Clarisse Wells, PhD, South Asian Studies. The 2022 Commencement marshal representing graduates with a master of arts, master of science, and master of engineering is Ghazi Ghazi, AM, Middle Eastern Studies.
