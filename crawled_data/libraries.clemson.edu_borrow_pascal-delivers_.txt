It is quicker than requesting books through ILL. How Do I Request a Book? To find a book, simply search our FindIt@Clemson tool and select PASCAL Delivers in the dropdown menu. If a book is available in the PASCAL system, you can request it and get it within 3-5 business days. To request the book just click on the PASCAL Delivers link under How to Get It. A form will pop up with the information about the book and there will be a green link at the bottom labeled Send Request. How Long Does it Take? Books will arrive within 3-5 days. How long can I keep it? PASCAL books can be checked out for 6 weeks and can be renewed for 6 more weeks. To renew your PASCAL book, visit your Library Account or contact the Resource Sharing Office at cuill@nullclemson.edu. If you find that you need the book beyond this 12-week period, please contact us and we will be happy to borrow another copy for you. Can I make a request for someone else (i.e. a proxy request)? Because PASCAL Delivers requests are automatically sent to PASCAL schools by our system immediately when you make the request, that book is attached to your account and cannot be transferred to another person’s account.
