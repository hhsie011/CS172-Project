Students develop a core set of technical competencies in a resource area selected from the majors, minors and certificates offered by the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. Students choose a world region in which to specialize, develop competency in a relevant world language, and participate in a significant cross-cultural internship experience. They carry out a senior project related to their resource specialization within the context of the world region. The undergraduate experience culminates with a senior capstone course, where students work with real-world clients to address global resource challenges. Multidisciplinary themes are developed in the context of the physical, biological and socio-economic factors affecting global resource systems. In this context, resource systems include natural, food and agricultural, environmental, cultural and human, political and institutional, financial and built, public health and social resources. Graduates of this program have transnational leadership skills and are successful integrators of various specializations on a team. They are skilled in applying a systemic perspective and developing solutions to complex global resource systems problems using innovativeness and creativity. Future professionals communicate effectively and demonstrate environmental awareness, exhibit an ethical perspective, and display clear analysis of how cultural diversity impacts work both here and abroad. They also recognize opportunities for learning after graduation. A degree in Global Resource Systems opens the door to employment opportunities in the many businesses and organizations that require globally competent employees. Student Learning Outcomes Upon graduation, students should be able to: Understand sustainable global resource systems by summarizing factors of biological, physical, and social resources in global systems and predicting the consequences of the utilization and distribution of global resources and their systems; develop an attitude of curiosity to continue lifelong learning. Apply global competency skills by recognizing diverse cultures, reflecting on the value of cultures on global resource systems, and employing skills needed to work in different cultures. Design ethical and innovative solutions to global challenges by using information literacy skills to define global challenges and creating sustainable solutions to global challenges. Use communication and leadership skills by communicating effectively with diverse audiences using written, oral, visual, and electronic skills and participating effectively as leaders in teams and organizations.
