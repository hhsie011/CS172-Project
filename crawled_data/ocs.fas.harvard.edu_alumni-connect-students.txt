Please register using the Employer/Alumni section of Crimson Careers. Exclusive for Harvard alumni and parents: You may list your contact information on the job posting form so that students can reach out to you directly to discuss the available position. Post a Short-Term Project Short-term projects or micro-internships are a great way for students to build skills, earn money, and create invaluable alumni connections. If you have a project in mind, or have the capacity to develop one, please consider sharing this with Harvard students by posting in Crimson Careers. Though short in timespan, these opportunities should be skill-building for the student, introduce them to specific work tasks or functions, and/or educate the student about a specific field. We recommend all projects are paid, however unpaid projects will be considered if they have a significant learning component or support nonprofit or mission-driven initiatives. Projects can be remote or in-person (as long as federal, state, and local authorities are permitting in-person work in your area), but remote is recommended at this time. In-person projects cannot take place in someone’s home and unskilled tasks will be referred to the Student Employment Office. OCS reserves the right to reject opportunities that are not skill building or educational. Participate in a Program on Campus or Remotely Many alumni in diverse fields enjoy connecting with students by participating in educational programs on campus or remotely via Zoom. Email your interest and field to ocs_recruiting@harvard.edu. Participate in a career program. Sit on a panel, represent your organization or field at a career event, or participate virtually in a career chat. Apply to be a Professional in Residence. The goal of the Harvard Professional in Residence program is to connect students to alumni in the professional world across a variety of sectors to facilitate a deeper, cutting-edge understanding of career opportunities and trends. Some activities include office hours, lunch-time career chats, and evening workshops/seminars related to an industry area. OCS seeks alumni from all fields for this program.
