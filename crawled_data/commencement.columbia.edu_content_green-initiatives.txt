For Commencement, clearly marked recycling bins will be provided. Single use plastic bottles will not be distributed. Guests and students should bring their own reusable bottle and fill up at any of our water refill stations available on Morningside Campus during Commencement Week. Columbia EcoReps will be at University Commencement to help collect and properly sort recyclable and compostable materials to reduce and divert additional landfill waste. Did you know that only 9% of plastics get recycled in the United States? By using outdoor water stations, Columbia will be able to prevent the use of nearly 50,000 plastic bottles on University Commencement Day alone. Please contribute to responsible water consumption during Commencement. Learn more about choosing the most sustainable water packaging options to help the Columbia community reduce its impact.
