Five of these courses are selected from a list of courses that emphasize the fundamental principles and practices of the field biotechnology. Three other courses would be selected by the student from outside this list in all of the basic sciences, including biology, chemistry, and physics, as well as in the applied sciences, engineering, and math. AM Requirements A minimum of 8 tuition units are required. Must receive a grade of B or better, courses must be taken for a grade rather than credit/no credit. Program Director endorses the student’s proposed curriculum. Must complete an approved program of study consisting of at least eight structured, advanced-level courses in biology or the sciences.
