The images were printed on paper stained by Bui with tea and then subtly hand colored. Bui interviewed several of the artists selected for the portfolio in the Brooklyn Rail, a monthly journal on art, culture and politics for which he is the publisher, artistic director and co-founder. An artist, writer and independent curator, Bui (b. 1964, Vietnam) attended the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, PA and continued his postgraduate studies at the New York Studio School. He has curated numerous monographic and group exhibitions and served as curatorial advisor at MoMA PS1 from 2007 to 2010. Bui’s artwork has been included in group exhibitions at Pierogi, the Brooklyn Museum of Art, and the North Dakota Museum of Art. He has lectured widely at institutions including Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, Columbia University, Cooper Union, Bard College, Haverford College, and the School of Visual Arts.
