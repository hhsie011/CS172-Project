Sexual harassment, including sexual violence, and retaliation are forms of discrimination prohibited by Title IX. Statement from Vice President Bleuzette Marshall On May 6, the U.S. Department of Education released new Title IX regulations for addressing sexual harassment. As we have sought to ensure institutional compliance with these regulations, our values of innovation, inclusion and impact served as our guideposts in creating a Title IX Sexual Harassment Policy and its provisions of a fair process for all parties involved. The link is now available for our new University Title IX Sexual Harassment Policy and its complaint resolution procedures. This Policy builds on and shall operate congruently with our strong, existing grievance processes; it provides a clear, equitable, and effective framework for addressing allegations of Title IX sexual harassment. Of note, this Policy continues our practice of utilizing the preponderance of the evidence standard of proof in the Title IX grievance process and assures due process for all persons participating in the investigation and adjudication of grievances. While the regulations mandate changes in some of our procedures, our institutional expectations for equity and conduct have not changed. As we have historically, the University shall continue to prohibit discrimination and harassment. Alleged sexual misconduct that falls outside the jurisdiction of this Policy will continue to be addressed under our current policies and procedures, including University codes of conduct, human resource policies, and applicable collective bargaining agreements. UC remains committed to ensuring a welcoming, inclusive and supportive environment, where all members of our community treat each other with dignity and respect.
