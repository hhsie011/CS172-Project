In an age of extreme corporate concentration, global industries are controlled by just a few giants—big banks, big pharma, and big tech, just to name a few. History suggests that tolerance of inequality and failing to control excessive corporate power may prompt the rise of populism, nationalism, extremist politicians, and fascist regimes.
