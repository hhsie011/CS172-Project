Our Commitment Stanford University School of Medicine is committed to fostering a diverse community in which all individuals are welcomed, respected, and supported to achieve their full potential. Our Vision Fostering a diverse learning environment enables the next generation of leaders to incorporate new ways of thinking in discovery and application, and to serve the needs of a diverse society. Our Values We believe that interaction with people with varied backgrounds and life experiences allows us to reach a new level of innovation in education, research and clinical care. About the Office The Office of Faculty Development and Diversity (OFDD) serves to develop all faculty to their fullest potential as academic, clinical, and community leaders and to promote the recruitment and retention of diverse faculty. Senior Associate Dean, Dr. Bonnie Maldonado, recognizes that in order to achieve these goals, OFDD must continue to work toward creating an organizational culture that values the contributions of all members, encourages a broad and open approach to teaching, research, and patient care, and provides an intellectually and socially attractive environment for all people. See Dr. Maldonado's Academic Profile Contact OFDD Email us stanford.med.ofdd @StanfordMedOFDD Supporting Faculty Leaders Faculty Development Academic medical centers need to do everything possible to support the development of leaders who have the skills to respond to the future challenges facing academic medicine. Among our highest priorities at OFDD is to offer leadership programs, networking opportunities, speaker series on cultural considerations, and skills building workshops in order to support the development of leaders who will affect change broadly. OFDD Professional Development Programs On Demand Series x OFDD Team Science Skills-building Workshops R-Series Grant Writing Stanford Leadership Development Program See All Resources Diversity Resources at the School of Medicine Diversity is a core value of Stanford Medicine. We strive for excellence and innovation, and neither can be achieved without diversity. Insights are derived from contrasting points of view, and innovation is a product of these differences. In both clinical and research teams, one person’s reasoning becomes the input for the next person’s reasoning. If each collaborator has the same expertise, status, and experience, then the number of new ideas—the building blocks of innovation—could hardly surpass that of the individual working alone.
