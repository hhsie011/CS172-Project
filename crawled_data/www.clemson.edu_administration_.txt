With a vision to be a top-20 public university and an academic Road Map adopted in 2001, the Clemson administration used quarterly “Report Cards” to the Board of Trustees to chart progress during the decade that followed. Student applications rose 42 percent. Graduation and sophomore retention rates rose. Class size and the student-to-faculty ratio fell. Research support doubled. And Clemson moved up the U.S.News & World Report ranks to become No. 25 among national public universities. After dealing effectively with state funding cuts during the Great Recession to become a leaner, more efficient and more focused institution, a new Clemson 2020 strategic plan was adopted in 2011. It has goals to provide talent for the new economy; to drive innovation, economic development and job creation; and to serve the public good by focusing on the great challenges of the 21st century.
