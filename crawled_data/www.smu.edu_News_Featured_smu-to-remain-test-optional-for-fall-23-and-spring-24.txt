March 18, 2022 DALLAS (SMU) – SMU will remain test-optional for first-year undergraduate applicants seeking admission and scholarships for both fall 2023 and spring 2024. The decision extends for the third year a temporary policy allowing high school students to decide whether to submit SAT or ACT scores with their applications for admission. “Since implementing a temporary test-optional policy in 2020, the admission committee continues to attract high-achieving students who bring great talent to our campus,” said Wes Waggoner, SMU associate vice president for Enrollment Management. “SMU joins most of the highly selective universities throughout the United States in allowing those students to choose how best to showcase their academic and personal achievements on college applications. “The decision came after discussions with faculty and deans who recommended continuing the policy for another year because it supports students and allows the University to attract great students from around the world,” Waggoner said. In making admission and scholarship decisions, SMU considers many factors, including high school grades, rigor of coursework, personal essay, letters of recommendation and a record of personal achievements, in addition to SAT or ACT scores, if submitted.
