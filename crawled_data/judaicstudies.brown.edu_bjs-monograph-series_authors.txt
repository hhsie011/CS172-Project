Submit a Proposal If you would like to submit a proposal, the first step is to contact the editor (see below) most related to the topic of your project. If you are unsure, contact Michael Satlow at Michael_Satlow@brown.edu. Send the editor a short letter of inquiry (1-2 pages) describing your project. The editor will want to know: What is the scholarly contribution it makes and how does it fit into current scholarly conversations? What sources and approaches do you use? How many words are in the manuscript? Is it complete or in progress and, if the latter, when can it be delivered? Also provide a short biography. If the editor feels that the book would be a good fit, s/he will ask you submit the full manuscript (if ready) for review. A manuscript cannot be under consideration elsewhere when we send it out for review. If you are seeking an advance contract the editor may ask for further information. Submission of manuscripts for review will be electronic, in both MS-WORD and PDF formats. Editors Katharina Galor Katharina_galor@brown.edu Jae Han jae_han@brown.edu David C.
