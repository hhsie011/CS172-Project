Rhode Island has a long history of industrial activity resulting in extensive contamination. An academic-government-community partnership model is a key feature of our overall SRP research strategy. Together with our partners we work to expand the understanding of the human health consequences and management of contaminated sites in Rhode Island and other post-industrial states. Our research embraces the complexity of mixed contaminants and their inevitable proximity to dense population centers, and is responsive to the needs of our government and community partners in managing the problems that this causes. Brown University's Superfund Research Program is a win-win-win for Rhode Island citizens, Rhode Island communities, and the Rhode Island environment. Brown SRP Researchers and Community Come Together on Narragansett Tribal Lands - see the feature article on the national NIEHS website Environmental Field Day with our partners from Mystic Aquarium, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Society, and the Narragansett Indian Tribe Brown SRP trainees and staff reviewing research progress outside on the ERC laboratory building patio on the main Brown campus.
