Because of the unique skills and knowledge of the BUCC staff, we are able to recommend services within the BUCC or the community to assist students in obtaining the appropriate services to meet their needs. We encourage all students to take advantage of this valuable service. The BUCC utilizes a short-term model of therapy to assist students in addressing multiple issues common in a college setting. Some of the issues that are commonly addressed in the short-term model at the BUCC are: Personal Issues Anxiety, depression, anger, loneliness, guilt, low self-esteem, grief Stress Feeling emotionally overwhelmed, headaches, tension, fatigue, insomnia, digestive problems Relationship Issues Marital issues, pre-marital counseling, boyfriend/girlfriend difficulties, sexual concerns, roommate problems Developmental/Family Issues Family crisis, divorce, identity concerns, concerns from childhood and/or adolescence Academic Concerns Performance anxiety, perfectionism, under-achievement, low motivation Other Issues Crisis intervention, sexual assault, spiritual concerns, pornography, unplanned pregnancy, body image, food preoccupation, healthy lifestyle choices At times, the initial assessment process may require more than one visit in order to determine the appropriateness of our expertise to address your particular treatment needs. If your needs cannot adequately and ethically be met by the center's resources, our staff will work with you to secure an appropriate referral when necessary. Some of the issues that are commonly addressed through referral to services outside of the BUCC include: A need for intensive treatment that will likely exceed the short-term model of care, as indicated by: Need, or request, to be seen more than once a week Desire for uninterrupted long-term therapy on a weekly basis Chronic suicidality and/or self-injury behaviors best suited for treatment in an intensive outpatient program Students who need specialized services not available through the BUCC, as indicated by: Presence of significant drug and/or alcohol problems, for example, substance dependence, primary substance abuse, and/or past failed treatments Presence of significant eating disorders Request for psychological evaluations for the purpose of accommodations through OALA.
