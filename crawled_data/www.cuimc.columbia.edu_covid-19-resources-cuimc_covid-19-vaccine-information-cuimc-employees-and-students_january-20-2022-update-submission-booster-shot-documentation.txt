As a reminder, the deadline to upload documentation of receipt of booster dosing for those who are eligible is January 31st. The IOS (iPhone) version of the ReopenCU app has now been updated, and documentation can be submitted directly through the app. If your app is set to automatically update, no action is required. The new version of the app, 1.7, should now be on your phone. If your app is not set to automatically update, follow the steps below to update your app: Go to the app store and search for “ReopenCU” Select the ReopenCU app, and then click “Update” Once the app updates, the “update” button will change to “open” Uploading your booster shot documentation can now be done either via ReopenCU website or via the ReopenCU app on your iPhone or Android. You can find instructions here and a helpful video here. For questions or assistance with the ReopenCU app, please submit a ticket to the CUIT Service Desk, email askcuit@columbia.edu or call 212-854-1919.
