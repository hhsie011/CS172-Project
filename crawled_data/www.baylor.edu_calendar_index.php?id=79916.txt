Posting An Item On The Calendar Baylor departments, programs, schools, colleges, and organizations who have a web site on campus should use the events component of the Baylor Content Management System (CMS) to post their events. When this is setup for your department, any events you post and "share" will automatically flow through to the university calendar. Student organizations can also get their events on the calendar by approving them through the Student Activities event approval system online. Once approved, these events flow through to the university calendar as well. Feedback You may send us your feedback on the online calendar at calendar@baylor.edu. Questions About An Event Events posted to the calendar are marked with a university department, program or organization that published the information. For departments and programs, there will be a link to the home page of the publisher on the event detail screen; this should enable visitors to contact those responsible for an event. In addition, departments are encouraged to provide a direct link for more information as part of the event detail. For student organization events, no publisher link is available. For more information about these events, contact Student Activities through their web site, https://www.baylor.edu/student_activities/. Calendar Categories The electronic marketing group at Baylor manages the categories used to help group events. Departments should email calendar@baylor.edu with requests to place an event into certain categories, including the events that are displayed on the Baylor home page. Technical Issues If you experience a problem viewing some portion of the calendar, or have technical questions about our implementation, send email to andrew_maddox@baylor.edu.
