Your support allows us to bring high-quality services to the Morningside Heights and Washington Heights communities. Learn More Services We Offer Learn here about the programs we offer neighborhood residents. Learn More Our programs reach a wide range of youth from our neighborhood, from pre-K to high school. Community Impact oversees six out-of -school programs; one is a homework help and literacy program at a local shelter, another is an early childhood center and four are highly successful mentoring programs. Some mentoring programs partner with local public schools, PS145 and PS129; Our Big Sibs, however, accepts youth mentees from the community at large. In addition, 400 CI volunteers serve as tutors to 1400 youth in a variety of school based programs at 8 local elementary and high schools. We offer two college prep programs, three tutoring programs, a health education program, an arts enrichment program and a conflict resolution program. There are many ways for you to get involved! We encourage you to explore our programs!
