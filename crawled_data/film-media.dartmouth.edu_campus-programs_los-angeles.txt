This program will be offered in winter term 2022, 2024, and 2026. Program Overview Los Angeles is an ideal location for the DSP: a global and cosmopolitan nexus point of the media world, and the center of U.S. media production for over a century. Los Angeles is home to several notable schools in film and media studies, as well as many of the premiere libraries, archives, and museums important to the study of film and media history. This program includes rigorous coursework, primary and secondary research in regional facilities, first-hand experiences with a variety of professionals who work in the creative arts and media industries, and assorted day trips to sights and events of interest across Southern California. Students take three courses that offer a mix of film and media history, theory, and production, plus the opportunity to obtain personal experience in the arts and entertainment industries and related institutions of cultural history. The courses emphasize the interdisciplinary study of film and media, in ways that best utilize the historical and contemporary significance of Los Angeles to our field. All three courses qualify for credit toward the Film and Media Studies major.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Film & Media Studies Undergraduate Overview Major, Minor, And Modified Major The Major Major Requirements Culminating Experience Culminating Exp.
