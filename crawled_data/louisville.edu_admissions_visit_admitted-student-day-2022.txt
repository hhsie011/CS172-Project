Directions & Parking Free parking for this event will be in the lots near the J.B Speed School of Engineering at 2445 S. Brook Street. Exit I-65 at University Blvd. (Exit 133). Take University Blvd to S. Brook Street and turn left. Cross under Eastern Pkwy and enter the blue parking lot on your right. After parking, walk north on S. Brook Street to the Belknap Academic Building (see the green line on the map below.) This will be about a 5 minute walk, so please allow extra time for parking and navigation.
