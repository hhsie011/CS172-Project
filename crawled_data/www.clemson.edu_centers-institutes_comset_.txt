The National Science Foundation (NSF) has made 11 awards totaling $55 million aimed at building research capacity to address fundamental questions about the brain and develop innovations at the intersection of food, energy, and water systems. The cooperative agreements are through NSF's Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) as part of its Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) Track-2... Read more. IDEAS Spotlight Equipment Specifications Welcome to COMSET The Center for Optical Materials Science and Engineering Technologies (COMSET), formed in 2000, is an interdisciplinary unit of the College of Engineering and Science at Clemson University. COMSET provides an organized framework with a significant centralized infrastructure for faculty with common interests to collaborate in developing advanced materials, devices, and systems that generate, transmit, manipulate and utilize light. The science and engineering of light-based technologies is approaching a $7.5 trillion global market. With materials as the technology enabler within all devices and components, Clemson University and South Carolina, through COMSET, are uniquely positioned to support the industry's research, workforce development, and outreach needs. COMSET conducts an important blend of “what-if” basic science and more applied research with immediate deliverables in wide-ranging areas, including organic LEDs, specialty optical fiber, light-emitting plastics, glasses, and crystals. We welcome you to explore this website and contact us with collaborative opportunities. Brag Points The National Academy of Engineering (NAE) has named a new member from Clemson University, optics researcher Roger Stolen. A pioneer in engineering methods to harness light, Stolen is a distinguished visiting professor in materials science and engineering and a faculty member in COMSET. Since the founding of COMSET in 2000, COMSET has published 714 peer-reviewed journal articles (as of 4/13/15), which have been cited 7,905 times.
