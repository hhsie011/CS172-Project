The lecture series commemorates the legacy of the late Prof. Heinz Bluhm, who in 1968 founded the Boston College German Studies Department and served (until 1976) as its first chairman. Prof. Bluhm, who died in 1993, was known for his monumental project, the Index Verborum, an electronically accessible reference guide to the essential words in Martin Luther's writings from 1516 through 1525, that was the crowning achievement of his Luther History Project. He also bequeathed to Boston College his 4,000-volume scholarly library, housed in Lyons Hall 201E. 2019-2020 Lectures Maps and Directions All lectures are free and open to the public.
