Although their information is a bit dated (for example, there's no mention of the discovery of the Higgs Boson), their description of physics is still accurate. What is Physics? is a basic introduction to physics in general, with some emphasis on particle physics. If you'd prefer not to download a PDF file, the same information is available on a web page. On Particle Physics focuses on particle physics, with emphasis on the kinds of high-energy physics research done at Nevis. WEBMASTER
