Fearful he would not recover, Whitman drafted this will, which leaves the majority of his money to his sisters, his property to his brother, and names three literary executors. Whitman would survive for four more years, and go on to publish four more works, including his “Deathbed Edition” of Leaves of Grass. This manuscript is just one of several thousand books and manuscripts recently presented to the library by Daniel G. Siegel ’57.
