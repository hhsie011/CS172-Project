Zullo, PharmD, PhD focuses on improving medication and vaccine use for older adults. In particular, he aims to optimize medication and vaccine use for the outcomes of greatest importance to older adults, such as physical and cognitive function. To that end, Andrew conducts research in geriatric pharmacoepidemiology and health services research. He specializes in studying the functional outcomes of medication use in institutional post-acute care and long-term care. He often applies pharmacoepidemiologic, comparative effectiveness and safety, and causal inference methodologies to large administrative claims, electronic health record, and other linked datasets that provide information on older adults. Andrew's work also includes medication-related evidence synthesis projects.
