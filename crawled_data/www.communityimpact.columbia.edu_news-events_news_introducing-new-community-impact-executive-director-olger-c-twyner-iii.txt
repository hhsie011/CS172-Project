Learn More News & Events News Introducing New Community Impact Executive Director Olger C. Twyner III Following the departure of Sonia Reese, the exemplary recently retired Executive Director who dedicated over 30 years of service to CI, we are fortunate to welcome Olger C. Twyner, III as our new Executive Director. Olger is uniquely positioned to strengthen collaboration between Columbia and the surrounding communities, as he is a Columbia alumnus, was the founding director of the Columbia Business School Community Collaboration and is former Executive Director and President of Double Discovery Center (DDC). During his tenure at DDC, he helped raise DDC’s profile and increased funding for the organization, further establishing it as a leading feeder of students from under resourced communities to Columbia College and Barnard. After leaving DDC, he became the lead of external programs at Xavier University, and served as Development Director for the Mississippi Center for Justice, a leading civil rights policy and legal organization. Olger received his bachelor’s degree from Jackson State University and holds a J.D. and M.B.A. from The Ohio State University College of Law and Columbia Business School, respectively. We are all looking forward to Community Impact’s growth under Olger’s leadership. 105 Earl Hall, 2980 Broadway, New York, NY 10027 212-854-1492 | [email protected] Our Services Adult Programs Current Adult Learners & Teachers ESOL High School Equivalency (TASC) CUNY Assessment Test Preparation College Road Job Road CAFE Prep Student Pre-Registration Form Volunteer Registration Form Youth Programs Emergency Services Health Student Executive Board Our Supporters Support Community Impact Giving Tuesday CI Endowment Campaign Community Impact Alumni Organization (CIAO) Sharing Our Stories Benefit About Us Mission History Leadership Our Impact News & Events Contact Our Opportunities Work Study Job Opportunities Van Amson Service Fellowship Volunteering Donate Follow us Facebook Twitter Copyright © Copyright Community Impact at Columbia University Site by Site by Bureau for Good
