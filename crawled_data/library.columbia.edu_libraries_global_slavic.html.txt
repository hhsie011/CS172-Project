Therefore, to locate older titles in, say, Russian, users must search using Roman characters. For non-Roman languages other than Russian, see the ALA-LC Romanization Tables Index. Many of the databases to which we subscribe (most notably, the East View Universal Databases) are searchable in the original Cyrillic script, utilizing either your own Cyrillic font, or the pop-up keyboard integrated with the database. Each online index tool, each online database, has its own particular characteristics. In order to assist the user, we have prepared several guides: Where do I Start My Research? (PDF below) This guide gives an overview, with screen-shot examples, of how one may approach an initial search for resources--for example, searchable full-text dissertations, indexes of articles (many with links to the articles themselves), etc.--on your topic in Slavic, east European, or Eurasian studies. A Guide to Online Databases (PDF below) gives search examples and tips for a number of our most-often consulted subscription databases: the East View Universal Databases, the Central & East European Online Library, and the various digital databses prepared by IDC/Brill: Soviet Cinema Archival documents from RGALI, 1923-1935), and Soviet Cinema Periodicals, 1918-1942, History of Modern Russian & Ukrainian Art, Slavonic Bibles, and Russian Military Intelligence on Asia, Archival Series, 1651-1917 and Russian Military Intelligence on Asia, Secret Prints, 1883-1914, as well as Jewish Theater Under Stalinism. As always, you should be sure to contact your Global Studies Librarian, Robert Davis, who will be happy to assist you in navigating these databases.
