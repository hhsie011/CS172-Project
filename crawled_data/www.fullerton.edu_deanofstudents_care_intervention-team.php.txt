The BIT team responds to non-emergency concerns and uses a proactive approach to discuss potential problems, intervene early, and develop appropriate courses of action for referred students. The goal is to support students who may be in distress or whose behavior is of concern to others before they rise to crisis levels. The BIT team shares membership with Title IX, Workplace Violence, and Threat Assessment committees and is thus tasked with sharing information regarding crisis situations and cases. BIT Members Core membership of BIT is made of staff representatives from: Counseling and Psychological Services Dean of Students Office the CSUF Cares and Student Conduct teams Disability Support Services University Police The Behavioral Intervention Team can also include members from Academic Affairs, Human Resources, Diversity, and Inclusion; International Programs, University Legal Counsel, Housing and Residential Engagement, Title IX, and Extended Education, among others. Staff from these departments may be invited to attend a BIT meeting for consultation and assessment to address or resolve certain referrals.
