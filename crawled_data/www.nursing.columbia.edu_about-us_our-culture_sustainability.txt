We aim to do our part in reducing Columbia's carbon footprint and helping to create a greener, more sustainable planet for all. We are accomplishing this goal by committing to plan, develop, implement, and measure strategic sustainability initiatives and foster a long-term culture of sustainability across the school. Our efforts include: Reducing paper and office supply waste by printing less and increasing use of electronic documents Promoting recycling and the use of 100% recycled products Encouraging the daily use of reusable cups, dishware, and utensils Reducing the amount of carbon emissions emitted by delivery trucks on campus by consolidating supply orders Enabling power management settings on electronic equipment for energy savings Installing energy-efficient lighting, motion light sensors, and utilizing natural lighting to save energy Using low-flow appliances to reduce water waste Using environmentally friendly cleaning products Promoting sustainable commuting options such as carpooling, biking, and public transit Learn more about our workplace sustainability efforts.
