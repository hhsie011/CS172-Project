However, there are some alternative private and emergency financial aid options for international students. Private Loans A variety of privately funded loan programs are available to international students. Most banks require a creditworthy co-signer who is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident with a permanent U.S. address. If approved for a private loan, our office will coordinate with the loan program. About Private Loans Emergency Tuition Loan International students who have an unforeseen financial situation may be eligible for an Emergency Tuition Loan administered by OSFA. These loans are available on a first come, first-served basis. Contact us for more information. Contact OSFA Payment Plans Work directly with the Bursar and Treasury Services office if there is a small delay in payment (i.e. an international wire payment is taking longer than expected).
