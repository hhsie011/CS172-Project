Students must present a current, valid student ID to purchase tickets. Web sales are available until four hours before the event begins. If a concert is sold out, you can call the Collection to be added to a wait list as a limited number of standby seats may become available for purchase on the day of the performance. We accept Mastercard, Visa, and American Express. Cash or checks are accepted for in-person sales. Seats cannot be reserved without payment and all payments are final. Single tickets and series subscriptions cannot be refunded. If you have tickets you cannot use, you may opt to donate them for resale before the event begins, after which the Box Office will give you a donation receipt for tax purposes. An email address is required to create an account to purchase tickets online. We never release your email address to other organizations. If you would like to unsubscribe or join a new list, you can manage your email preferences online. Cancellations + Postponements Toggle We will make every effort to contact you if we must postpone or cancel a concert to which you have purchased tickets. You can help by providing us with an email address and/or phone number when purchasing a ticket. Inclement weather generally does not affect our performances, so events are postponed or cancelled only when absolutely necessary. Please plan accordingly, as all ticket sales are final. If a concert is postponed to a new date, you will have the option of using your original tickets or receiving a refund. If a concert is cancelled, you will receive a refund. At the Concert Toggle Please silence all cell phones and other devices upon entering the hall. Please do not put your device on vibrate, as the noise from the vibration can often be heard by other audience members. Food and drink are not permitted in the Collection. Please plan to arrive at least 15 minutes prior to the performance. Patrons who arrive late will be permitted to enter the hall at the discretion of the house manager. We regret that we do not have an elevator that goes to the second floor, where the performances are held. However, all performances are streamed live, online. Unauthorized photography and recording are not permitted. If you are a member of the press and would like to record or photograph an event, please contact us in advance to request permission.
