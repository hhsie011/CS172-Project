Daniel Katz Senior Lecturer in Mathematics E-mail: daniel_katz@brown.edu Department of Mathematics Brown University 151 Thayer St Providence, RI 02912 (401) 863-7957 Home Teaching Research Puzzles Spring 2022 Office Hours: Mondays 3pm-5pm, Fridays 1pm-3pm in Kassar 114 Hello! I'm Daniel (Dan) Katz. I grew up outside Philadelphia, studied mathematics and theater at MIT and then more mathematics at Brown, spent a few years in North Carolina, and now I'm back in Providence. My preferred pronouns are he/him/his. In Fall 2012, I was appointed as a Lecturer in Mathematics, a newly established position at Brown, and in 2018 I was promoted to Senior Lecturer. My responsibilities include teaching calculus, overseeing Brown's calculus program, undergraduate curriculum development, and teacher training. I am also the department's Placement Advisor, which means I give students advice about which courses they should take within the calculus-linear algebra sequence. (Though before talking to me, students may wish to utilize the online tools posted here.) Students seeking advice about 1000-level courses and above should contact the Concentration Advisor, a position currently shared by Professors Jeffrey Hoffstein, Benoit Pausader, and Richard Schwartz. And I also handle transfer credit requests for calculus and linear algebra courses. The best procedure for requesting transfer credit is to create an online request on ASK. After logging in, click "More" on the menu bar and then "Transfer Credits." If you have questions about course equivalencies, feel free to write to me. For more information on my background and what I do, you can view my Curriculum Vitae, or you can click the links above. (PS - Yes, I was on Jeopardy! in 2010. No, I did not win. Feel free to tell me all about how you would have known the answer to my Final Jeopardy! question, because that never gets old.)
