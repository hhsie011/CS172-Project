An interdisciplinary minor intended for any undergraduate student at the UW, the ELS minor provides a strong background in how humans learn and how society, environment, and culture shape that learning across school, work, and play. The ELS minor is offered jointly by the College of Education and the College of Arts & Sciences. Students take core courses in human development and schooling and then create an area of focus from approved electives. Finally, students engage in five credits of approved service learning and complete a 1-credit colloquium course in which they reflect on their courses and the influence of education on our learning and society.
