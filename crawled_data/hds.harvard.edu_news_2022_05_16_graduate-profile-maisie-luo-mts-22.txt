How I've Changed As a painter, I have a clearer sense of what kind of work I want to make that is meaningful to me and timely to the current situation. Memorable Moment Eating dogwood berries as desserts with friends in the early fall after community tea. Favorite Class or Professor Terry Tempest Williams, Janet Gyatso, and Charles Hallisey. Message of Thanks My dearest advisors, Terry and Janet, and all my friends who have supported and cared for me and pushed me to grow and be a kinder person. Future Plans I will get an MFA in painting and keep making work.
