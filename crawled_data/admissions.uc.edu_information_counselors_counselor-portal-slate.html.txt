Slate.org is a free tool for school counselors, independent counselors, and community-based organizations to monitor the application status of students through the admission process. Slate.org also allows counselors to conveniently and securely submit application-related materials directly to participating colleges and universities. Slate is the application and communication software used by over 1000 colleges and universities, including Cincinnati. Slate.org provides a counselor portal through which we can share nearly real-time details about the applicants from their school. Many colleges and universities are already sharing applicant information through Slate.org, and more begin sharing all the time. Our hope is that Slate.org will become a valuable tool for you and your colleagues in helping to manage the sometimes chaotic application process. How is Cincinnati using Slate.org? We hope Slate.org will be a helpful tool for you to track your applicant’s status, receive notice of their decisions and upload documents. University of Cincinnati will only display a student’s decision to you after a student has viewed it. How do I register? Visit Slate.org and click the registration link in the main toolbar. How do permissions work? One member of your school will be designated to manage permissions. Click here for an overview of how to get started. If you have previously submitted documents through the Common Application, you are pre-approved for a Slate.org account. Which documents can I upload through Slate.org? You can upload all transcripts, letters of recommendation and other needed materials. Why would I use Slate.org, if my school already utilizes Common App, Naviance, SCOIR, or another platform to submit documents electronically? It is our strong preference to receive documents electronically – whether it’s through Common App, Naviance, Parchment or a similar platform. Even if you typically utilize one of these options, there may be times you find you need to submit a corrected transcript or other non-standard document. We don’t currently envision Slate.org replacing the functionality of the platforms above, but it is simply another option and a great way to submit that information securely. If you work at a school that does not have access to electronic document submission, Slate.org will provide this functionality. How else may I utilize Slate.org? Slate.org may also be used to schedule and advertise opportunities for college representatives to visit your school.
