During the Give Light Campaign, the Louise Herrington School of Nursing will focus their fundraising efforts in the following areas: Endowed scholarships to meet the needs of students and remove barriers to their Baylor education. Endowed faculty positions to broaden and deepen academic opportunities and recruit faculty to help the School remain on the cutting edge of research and innovation. Technology enhancements to provide students with experience and instruction to help them prepare for real-life nursing care scenarios. Missions and research opportunities to provide their students with a global perspective. The following are the Louise Herrington School of Nursing’s highest priority fundraising projects that are being highlighted in the current phase of the Give Light Campaign. The School will bring forward other opportunities for the Baylor Family to support the talented students and faculty within the School of Engineering and Computer Science. Endowed Scholarships: $25 million Nurses can have a transformational impact in the lives of their patients. They fulfill a great need in society. But to attain their dreams of becoming nurses, LHSON’s students must have the support of scholarships. Faculty and Programmatic Endowment: $10 million In order to expand the depth and breadth of the Louise Herrington School of Nursing’s teaching and academic inquiry, the School is seeking to grow its resources and faculty support through the establishment of endowed faculty positions and programmatic support in order to recruit faculty leaders for its departments who will grow its programs and help the school remain relevant and forward-focused. Simulation Laboratory Technology Enhancements: $3.6 million The technology that drives simulation has the same needs as any other technology – it requires specialized training for its users, regular maintenance to keep it operating as designed, and at some point, it needs to be replaced and upgraded to include the latest advancements. LHSON is seeking support to improve its technology, as well as to renovate its simulation spaces to improve the training experiences and create a more believable setting for its students. The LHSON is also seeking endowment support to provide a sustained, secure source of support for the maintenance and replacement of aging simulators. Missions Outreach: $5 million As a Christian institution, Baylor attracts mission-minded students who are eager to make a difference and who look to the institution to help equip them with the skills necessary to make an impact. The LHSON provides its students with international medical missions opportunities, helping them to connect their professional practice with their faith. Current trips provide medical missions to India, Africa and Peru and domestically in Texas. The School is looking for endowment support to fund scholarships for students interested in missions trips and for programmatic support to expand the missions program. Simulation Laboratory LHSON is leading research on simulation teaching strategies that improve interprofessional education and collaborative practice among nurses and healthcare professionals.
