Not reading every book, but reading the collection: how it is organized, what subjects have more texts, what sections see more traffic. Since December 2016, I have been playing the vibrations between student and Library Circulation Assistant.

One can really get lost in boxes and boxes of unprocessed archival material, it seems. But all good things must come to an end, and for me, that took place today. After a great 7 month internship at Burke, I closed the lid on my last archival […] Read More… Posted in Student EntryTagged Archives, Burke Library, Graduate Intern, interns, MRL, Processing, studentsLeave a comment From Finding Aids to Floppy Disks Posted on July 18, 2014 (July 24, 2014) by Elizabeth Willse I spent yesterday and today getting acquainted with my first archival box. To learn and get experience with writing a finding aid, I’m working with materials that already have a finding aid, “The Chinese Church of Christ in Korea papers 1908-1975.” Some of what needed to be done was basic copy editing and formatting the […] Read More… Posted in Student EntryTagged Chinese Church of Christ in Korea, Collections, interns, Korea, library science, Missionaries, MRL, MRL8, Processing, studentsLeave a comment United We Stand: National Workshop on Christian Unity Records Posted on October 16, 2013 by Rossy Mendez I just finished processing my first collection at the Burke Library and I am filled with excitement but also with anxiety. While the hard work of describing and arranging is over, the finding aid needs to be evaluated and then made available to the public. The idea that this document will be made public terrifies […] Read More… Posted in UncategorizedTagged Archives, Collections, ecumenism, Processing, unityLeave a comment Surprises in the Archives: Reflecting on My First Month at the Burke Posted on July 1, 2013 (June 27, 2013) by Virginia Pastor A month has passed since I started at Burke as a summer intern, and I now find myself reflecting upon the last four weeks. While I came into this internship with previous processing experience, I have found that I am constantly learning something new at Burke, whether it’s learning how to wrap a book in […] Read More… Posted in Student EntryTagged Burke Archives, interns, MRL12, ProcessingLeave a comment State Council of Churches and Wrap-Up Posted on December 10, 2012 (December 10, 2012) by Bree Midavaine I want to put in a quick plug for the collection that I just finished…on my LAST day of my internship here at the Burke Archives.

Kamsler Now that you know a little more about the MRL and WAB collections, as well as the Luce Foundation, I thought it would be useful to explain the reason behind needing this project in the first place. Most, if not all, archives and libraries have what we call "backlog."
