Use our meeting rooms as group study space on demand, eat and chat at food court tables, spend a quiet moment on a corridor bench, or lounge in comfy furniture throughout the building. We Have You Covered, On Demand! Need a space to study or work on a small group project? Have a limited amount of time to meet? Don't want to roam around the library for 30 minutes searching for an open space? TUC has a limited number of rooms available for on-demand use by students, staff and faculty. On-Demand rooms can only be requested at the time of intended use and cannot be reserved in advance. Visit the Event Services Desk on Level 4 in TUC, with a valid UC ID to request a room. Please note that On Demand rooms can only be requested at the time of intended use and cannot be reserved in advance. Additional TUC Study Spaces Student-focused features, such as built-in electric sockets, handy book stashes and adjustable writing surfaces make TUC a popular place to study or visit. Some spots are just plain comfortable! And don't forget the steps outside on MainStreet and Bearcat Plaza during nice weather!
