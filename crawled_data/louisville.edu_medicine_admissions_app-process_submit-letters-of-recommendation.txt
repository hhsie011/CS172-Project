FAQ Contact Submit Letters of Recommendation Each applicant is required to submit a pre-med advisory committee report. If your college/university does not have a pre-med committee, we require three (3) academic letters of recommendation. These letters must be on college letterhead and should include at least one professor of a pre-requisite or higher level science course. Remaining academic letters may include a professor from a course in your academic major, a research supervisor or science independent study professor in which credit was awarded, or a course from a non-science area of study. Candidates may submit two additional letters, ideally, from sources that speak to the candidate’s suitability for medicine. Non-traditional applicants or those that have been out of school for 2 or more years may substitute no more than 2 academic letters with employer letters from a direct supervisor, a letter from a research PI/supervisor or letters from a substantive volunteer environment. All letters of recommendation for the University of Louisville School of Medicine must be submitted via the AMCAS letter service. This service enables medical schools to receive all letters electronically via AMCAS, and enables authors to send all letters to be considered by schools participating in this service to AMCAS rather than each school. There are several mediums in which a letter writer can send your letter to AMCAS. AMCAS will receive letters from users of VirtualEvals, Interfolio, and via the mail. In addition, letter writers who currently mail letters can opt to upload letters directly to AMCAS through the AMCAS Letter Writer Application. It is our preference that letters of recommendation be received within two weeks of submitting your supplemental application materials. However, the final deadline for receipt of all letters is January 1st, and no files can be reviewed before the Admissions Committee until all letter requirements have been met.
