Continuously funded by a P50 Transdisciplinary Tobacco Use Research Center Grant from the National Cancer Institute and National Institute on Drug Abuse, and additional extramural support, CIRNA investigators conduct interdisciplinary research focused on improving the treatment of nicotine dependence for smokers who wish to quit smoking. The highly collaborative research of CIRNA investigators spans from "cells to society", crossing departments and schools at the University of Pennsylvania and extending to institutions across North America. Over the past 15 years, CIRNA has evolved to include 4 overarching and interrelated programs of research.
