Solid Mechanics Research The Mechanics of Solids group fosters a balanced program that integrates the perspectives of continuum mechanics, structure of matter, and materials science. The mechanics of solids is an engineering science that is fundamental to the practice of mechanical, civil, structural, and aeronautical engineering; it is also directly relevant to materials engineering, nanotechnology, biology, geophysics, and other branches of engineering and applied science. The Mechanics of Solids Group at Brown University fosters a balanced program of research and instruction that integrates the perspectives of continuum mechanics, structure of matter, and materials science. The program has a long tradition of leadership through innovations in the analytical, computational, and experimental concepts and methodologies that form the core of the field. Some of the current research in the Solid Mechanics group includes: The Micro and Nanoscale Behavior of Advanced Materials The Mechanical Behavior of Soft Matter (e.g., gels, polymers) The Mechanics of Cells and Biological Systems (e.g., cell adhesion, endocytosis, traumatic brain injury) Multiscale Materials Modeling, Deformation and Failure of Thin Films and Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) The Mechanics and Failure Behavior of Batteries and Energy Storage Systems Many of these research activities are part of the General Motors Collaborative Research Laboratory (CRL) for Computational Materials Research. Our faculty use theoretical, numerical and experimental approaches, and we maintain a close interactions with colleagues in applied mathematics, physics, material science, biomedical engineering and the Brown Alpert Medical School.
