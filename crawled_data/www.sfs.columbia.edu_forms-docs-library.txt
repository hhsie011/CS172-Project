Most federal student loans have loan fees that are a percentage of the total loan amount. The loan fee is deducted proportionately from each loan disbursement you receive while enrolled in school. This means the money you receive will be less than the amount you actually borrow. You can find additional information about Plus Loans at https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/loans/plus. This calculator is designed to aid students in estimating the amount of anticipated loan fees associated with their loan request. Actual figures may vary based on an applicants’ individual circumstances. Multiple Term Request calculations assume equal disbursement over a period of two terms. 05/17/2021 Federal Direct Loan Request Form (2021-2022) For GSAPP, SPS, Graduate Engineering, or SOA students: request Federal Direct Stafford Loan funds if you have a valid 2021-2022 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form on file with the Office of Student Financial Planning. 03/10/2021 Federal Direct Loan Request Form (2022-2023) For GSAPP, SPS, Graduate Engineering, or SOA students: request Federal Direct Stafford Loan funds if you have a valid 2022-2023 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form on file with the Office of Student Financial Planning. 05/06/2020 Federal Withholding Certificate (W-4, external PDF) Work-Study earnings are taxable income.
