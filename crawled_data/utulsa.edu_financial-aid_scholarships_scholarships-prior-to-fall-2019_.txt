Performance and Talent Scholarships – variable amounts, scholarships awarded on basis of merit and demonstrated talent. Awarded by departments through and audition or evaluation of performance. Renewable by department’s guidelines. Art Music Theatre/Musical Theatre Endowed and Supported Scholarships – These awards are made possible by the annual earnings of restricted gifts invested with The University of Tulsa’s endowment funds or by gifts given to The University of Tulsa by corporations, foundations and friends of the university. Most of these awards are used to underwrite university grants, scholarships and other sources of TU funded assistance. To reemphasize, these funds are not combined on top of current funding. The scholarships are honorary in nature. Other Scholarship Awards – Funds from sources outside the university will credit to the student’s account no earlier than the first day of class each semester upon receipt of the funds. Outside scholarships received and TU scholarship funds may be combined up to the student’s federal cost of attendance. TU will follow the directives issued by the funding source if their guidelines are more restrictive than TU’s policy. Presidential Scholars may combine outside scholarships up to their federal cost of attendance, with the exception of the Oklahoma Academic Scholars funding and the National Merit Scholarship as both of these sources are part of the comprehensive Presidential package. It is necessary to report to Student Financial Services any change in circumstances, including outside scholarship awards not considered in the offer of assistance. By law, Student Financial Services must make adjustments to prevent or correct “over awards” that may result from the receipt of these outside sources of financial assistance. Adjustments will be in both gift aid (grants/scholarships) and self-help aid (work/loans). IMPORTANT! If you are a student athlete, you must meet with The University of Tulsa Athletic Compliance Office. There are NCAA rules that may impact the renewal of your TU Academic Scholarship based on your gpa. Scholarship policies are reviewed annually and are subject to change from year to year. 800 S.
