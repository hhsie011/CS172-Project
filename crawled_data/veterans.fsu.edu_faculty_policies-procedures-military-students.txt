Failure to verify for two consecutive months will interrupt the Monthly Housing Allowance (MHA) and/or kicker payments. A simple and convenient verification option is to sign up for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) text message verification. Students with a US mobile phone number on file with the VA will receive an opt-in text as their next enrollment period approaches. Students who do not have a US mobile phone number on file with VA will not be able to use text verification and instead be automatically enrolled into email verification system. Another option for students who do not opt-in for text is to call the VA Education Call Center at 888-442-4551 to verify their enrollment status. Home Faculty Policies & Procedures for Military Students Policies & Procedures for Military Students ACE Evaluations of Military Courses Off-Campus Resources for Veterans Policies & Procedures for Military Students Military Short-Term Absence or Call to Active Duty Policy The University recognizes and appreciates the important contributions made in service of our country by active duty, Reserve, and National Guard members and their dependents. In order to accommodate these students and their dependents, University faculty and staff will provide the following options to accommodate unexpected training/drill, deployment, or change-of-station orders: For any training/drill, deployment, or change-of-station orders: Students will attempt to make arrangements with instructors to maintain and/or make up classwork as needed. Registration for those courses in which instructors accommodate the absence will remain unchanged and tuition and mandatory fees will be assessed in full for those courses. Service members should provide instructors with maximum advance notice of absences, as well as copies of training/drill, deployment, and/or change-of-station directives from the military, Reserve, or National Guard. Instructors will work with students wherever possible to assign grades as appropriate (including incompletes to be made up later). Instructors must accommodate absences of up to two weeks in duration (or equivalent in Summer) in accordance with paragraph one. When unable to make satisfactory arrangements with any instructors: Course(s) will be dropped and the tuition and mandatory fees for the course(s) will be rescinded. When unable to make arrangements with any instructors for unexpected orders requiring longer than a two-week absence: The student's entire registration will be withdrawn or cancelled and 100% of the tuition and mandatory fees will be rescinded.
