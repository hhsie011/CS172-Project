A Thousand Girls Like Me Date/Time: Wednesday, February 27 at 18:45 Location: ANAMED (Koç University Research Center for Anatolian Civilizations), İstiklal Cad. Merkez Han No:181 About the Film (2018, Sahra Mani, 80 min, Persian with English subtitles) An Afghan young woman was abused by her father since she was four. She had 1 child, 2 miscarriages and is pregnant with her 4th child when she goes to the law to seek justice. Her family and community blame her. Khatera lives in hiding, moving from house to house when she fears her identity is at risk. But what if it was more the norm that the stories of Afghan women were heard? What if they succeeded in fighting the cultural, familial and legal forces that strive to keep them silent? And what if the words they spoke were a demand for justice? Discussion Following Film With: Sahra Mani Mosawi, filmmaker; Bharati Sadasivam, UNDP Gender Equality Expert Ayşen Ufuk Sezgin, Professor, Istanbul University Department of Forensic Medicine This screening series is an initiative of the UNDP Istanbul Regional Hub, Columbia Global Centers | Istanbul, and Koç University’s Media and Visual Arts Department.
