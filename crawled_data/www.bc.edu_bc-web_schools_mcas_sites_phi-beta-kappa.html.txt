Following careful faculty scrutiny, the very best undergraduate scholars in the College of Arts and Sciences are invited to join Phi Beta Kappa as members in course. Students who join the BC Chapter remain members of the Chapter throughout their lifetime. Approximately 120 faculty, elected by other Chapters during their own undergraduate careers, are considered resident members of the Chapter.
