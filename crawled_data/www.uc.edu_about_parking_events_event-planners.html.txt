When your department or organization schedules an event requiring parking, you have a partner in Julian Botella, our Assistant Director, Operations and Events. Parking Services has experienced significant growth in the number of special events on campus. We can provide a better parking experience for visitors when we are notified of your event in advance. Here are some tips for planning your event: Review the Parking Events Calendar to determine if your event may be impacted by another event. When your event numbers 50 or more attendees, please complete our Special Parking Request form. When your event numbers less than 50 attendees, please complete our Voucher Pass Order Form if you wish to pay for their parking. By following these tips, our communication channels throughout the university community are strengthened, providing a positive experience for you and your guests. Contact Julian at 513-556-4044.
