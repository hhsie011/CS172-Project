Financial Settlement is the final phase of registration each term you attend Baylor. Once your charges are available for the term, you must complete the following two steps: Confirm your attendance in BearWeb Student Financial Services > Student Account > Confirm Attendance If you do not owe a balance, you must still confirm your attendance. Pay your charges View your charges in the E-Bill System and either pay in full or enroll in a Payment Plan. You can also view our Cost of Attendance worksheet for an estimate. Important Summer 2022 Dates April 11 - Charges and anticipated aid ready to be viewed in the E-Bill System. April 29 - Payment Due Date* April 25 – Refund processing begins if set up for direct deposit, financially settled, and financial aid applied. May 2 - Classes Begin *When currently enrolled students early register for an upcoming term, they are then billed approximately two weeks prior to the due date. Students registering after a certain point are on a rolling “register—bill—due” cycle. This means the due date will be determined by the date of registration. Financial Aid Verify financial aid and/or loans are properly reflected on your student account. If accepted loans have not been applied and you are registered for less than full time (8 hours or less), then you will need to contact the Student Financial Aid office to request the loan(s) be reset for less than full time enrollment. If necessary, review the Online Student Financial Aid Checklist and contact the Student Financial Aid office at 254-710-2611 with any questions. Payment Plan To make the process of paying for your Baylor education more manageable, you have the option to enroll in a Payment Plan. Plan enrollment is required each term in which you participate in the Payment Plan. For more detailed information on Baylor's Payment Plan, click here.
