Students gain the essential business knowledge provided in the corporate program with added emphasis on topics specific to the needs of start-ups including venture finance, intellectual property and entrepreneurial strategy. Degree Programs Part-Time Full-Time Real-World Perspective All MBAe classes are taught by distinguished Clemson professors, successful entrepreneurs and business leaders who illustrate real-life examples of how to take innovative ideas to market. In addition, students have multiple opportunities to interact with local and national entrepreneurs and business leaders at networking events including the Innovative Leadership Series, as well as special programming developed through the Phyfer Innovation Hub. Clemson EnterPrize Awards The MBAe program culminates with a business capstone course and pitch competition known as the EnterPrize Awards. During this intensive course, students have the opportunity to pitch their ideas to an audience of business owners, venture capitalists and entrepreneurs over multiple sessions and receive feedback that allows them to refine and perfect their presentations. The ability to convey ideas quickly and effectively is a valuable skill that is beneficial to entrepreneurs and executives alike. The EnterPrize Awards are designed to give students ample opportunity to practice and develop this key skill. Innovation at Work Competition This capstone competition is designed for MBAe students who have instituted an intrapreneurial program or strategy within an organization. Innovation at Work empowers students to take what they learn in the classroom and apply it to real-world problems in the workplace. The competition is a single event with judges comprised of corporate executives, HR leadership and business owners.
