Beware of any scholarship search service that charges a fee. The information that you are paying for could be obtained through another source at no cost. Visit the Federal Student Aid site on How to Avoid Student Aid Scams for guidance on how to identify and avoid scholarship scams. Scholarships are a type of aid that does not need to be paid back and can be based on merit, extracurricular activities, or demographics. Some scholarships require that you complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Filling out the FAFSA should always be your first step in applying for financial aid of any type. The key to earning a scholarship is to make the effort to identify scholarships that you may qualify for, respond fully and accurately to any application requirements, and don't give up! FS4U FSU offers an online scholarship platform to help you in your scholarship search: FS4U - Finding Scholarships For You. FS4U identifies any FSU Foundation scholarships that you may apply for. Please review it carefully, and check back frequently as new opportunities may be added at any time. Private Scholarships Private scholarships must be reported as outside aid. They are a financial resource that will be used in determining your need for other aid. Your financial aid award may be adjusted based on receipt of scholarships at any time during the academic year. For more information about private scholarships, including a comprehensive list of scholarships that are available, visit FSU Student Business Services Private Scholarships.
