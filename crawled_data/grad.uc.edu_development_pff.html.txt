The UC PFF program provides instruction in modern teaching and learning and offers rich mentoring experiences that strengthen these career skills. Established in 1993, the UC PFF program was one of the founding group of national PFF programs. Active participation in a PFF program is widely recognized. PFF is changing with the times! UC's PFF program is transitioning from a certificate program to a participatory professional development program, housed within the Graduate School. Students matriculated prior to the fall 2019 application deadline will adhere to previous program requirements, found under the Legacy Program page. Prospective students can complete an updated application and submit one letter of recommendation, on official letterhead, to gradpff@uc.edu. Is the PFF Program Valuable? According to several prominent studies, the PFF program provides much-needed pedagogical skills to PhD candidates, giving them an edge over candidates who do not earn PFF certificates. These studies show that: PFF prepares graduate students for academic careers at postsecondary institutions; it helps graduate students conduct productive job searches and achieve early career success; and the program provides professional development that does not extend time-to-degree. Current and former UC PFF students agree. Elements of PFF Participation Reading Groups: Join a multi-disciplinary group of your peers to discuss teaching-related issues. Workshops: Participate in workshops across campus, hosted by various organizations, in order to gain effective teaching skills, explore pedagogical methods, and more. Courses: Register for PFF courses to better support your abilities as a teacher and to effectively navigate the academic job search. The three semester-credit Teaching Effectiveness course is offered each fall (PD8041). The two semester-credit Academic Job Search course is offered each spring (PD8042). Mentoring: Gain teaching experience and work closely with a faculty mentor at an affiliated institution through the PFF mentoring experience.
