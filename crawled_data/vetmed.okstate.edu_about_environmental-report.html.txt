Our performance contract with Johnson Controls has helped us take a fiscally-responsible step in that direction. The Oklahoma State University College of Veterinary Medicine upgraded five buildings that are expected to realize approximately $9 million in cost avoidance over the course of a 20-year performance contract with Johnson Controls, Inc. (NYSE: JCI). Work began on the project in September 2006. Based on actual utility bill comparison, the project has already delivered more than $5,912,854 in cost avoidance to date (December 2018). The utility cost avoidance is a result of upgrades that range from glazing windows and installing lighting controls to retrofitting the buildings’ plumbing and air flow systems. Under the terms of the performance contract, the expected cost avoidance over 20 years will outstrip the initial capital expenditure to implement the facility upgrades. If the cost avoidance does not meet an agreed-upon threshold, Johnson Controls will compensate OSU for any shortfall. Environmental Impact The project's reduced emissions are equivalent to: CO2 sequestered by 859,321 tree seedlings grown for 10 years in an urban scenario CO2sequestered by 7,146 acres of pine or fir forests CO2 emissions from 6,408 passenger vehicles CO2 emissions from 77,938 barrels of oil consumed CO2emissions from the energy use of 2,852 homes for one year CO2 emissions from burning 175 coal rail cars Project Highlights Electric Power Education - Active programs to educate faculty, staff and students on the importance of being a partner in conservations efforts by responsibly reducing electrical consumption of offices, laboratory and common spaces. Active lighting controls allow lights to be activated while facilities are occupied and then extinguished when a lack of activity is sensed. Active controls to allow lights on vending machines to be extinguished when a lack of activity near machine is sensed. Fixture re-lamping with new high efficiency lighting products results in an enhanced visual appeal and energy conservation. Steam / Chilled Water Education - Active programs to educate faculty, staff and students on the importance of being a partner in conservation efforts by supporting thermostat set-points and eliminating use of local heaters. Temperature management policy allows for consistent application of energy management principles while permitting exceptions in areas where special circumstances exist. Air handler unit replacements have resulted in major savings due to enhanced efficiency of units and digital control systems. Window replacement utilizing high efficiency glass. Active HVAC system Monitoring allows proactive response to maintenance functions which could result in reduced efficiencies or system failures. Environmentally friendly anti-freeze products are used throughout our facilities. New Construction/Remodeling Active control systems are installed in all remodel and new construction spaces allowing implementation of a managed energy program in all areas. Environmentally friendly design principles are applied in all construction with an eye toward responsible energy consumption. Space reuse allows avoidance of new construction and enhancement of energy savings in existing structures. Domestic Water Low-Flow Fixtures reduce water consumption dramatically. Savings are 2 - 4 gallons per flush cycle. Sewer discharges are decreased as a result of reduction in domestic water use resulting in savings for treatment costs Appliances Energy Star certification on new appliances allows selection of devices which contribute to the energy conservation efforts of CVHS Consolidation of functions allows for fewer appliances to meet the needs of multiple users thus reducing energy consumption Grounds Water - low water consumption landscaping materials reduces need for irrigation Gasoline - slow growth landscaping materials reduce mowing and other maintenance Vehicles Fossil Fuels - forklifts and other vehicles use alternative fuels wherever feasible. Information Technology Energy Star certification of computing hardware Server consolidation/virtualization Server cooling optimization utilizing latest ASHRAE guidance Active, monitored local workstation power management Replacement of CRT’s with LCD’s Consolidation of printing functions to high efficiency printing devices Office Supplies Paper - Use of Recycled Paper Paper Recycling Cardboard Recycling Ink/TonerUse of recycled cartridges Recycle Ink- jet Cartridges Recycle Toner Cartridges Cleaning Supplies Currently use 80 percent green certified cleaning products Environmentally friendly Improved indoor air quality Animal Bedding Recycled Paper Shavings Oklahoma State University CAMPUSES CAMPUSES Stillwater Tulsa Center for Health Sciences Oklahoma City Institute of Technology Division of Agriculture Veterinary Medicine UNIVERSITY LINKS UNIVERSITY LINKS Campus Safety Diversity Research Extension & Engagement Alumni & Friends OSU Athletics America's Healthiest Campus ® News & Information RESOURCES RESOURCES Ethics Point EEO Statement Accessibility Trademarks Terms of Service Privacy Notice Webmaster CAMPUS MAP © - Oklahoma State University | All Rights Reserved ©
