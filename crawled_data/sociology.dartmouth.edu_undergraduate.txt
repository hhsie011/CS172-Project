First Year Questions Undergraduate Apply to Dartmouth Share Undergraduate When you take courses in Dartmouth’s Sociology Department, you’ll be introduced to a unique way of asking questions, examining problems, and viewing the world. Sociology is really about learning analytical thinking in the best tradition of the liberal arts. Professor Kathryn Lively talks with students. PreviousNext Curriculum and Perspective In addition to the standard major, the two sociology minors and the modified major are designed to fit the needs of students who have an interest in sociology but are primarily interested in another discipline or, in the case of a modified major, wish to study some specific problem or topic that resides at the nexus of sociology and a related field. Our curriculum focuses on current and important social problems. The world is constantly confronted with public policy issues that are essentially social in character. Sociological analyses provide a coherent, yet diverse framework for examining these issues and understanding the many perspectives involved in attempting to solve social problems. We also provide students with a unique perspective with which better to understand their day-to-day lives. Sociological questions concern not only interpersonal interaction and conflict, but also the behaviors of groups, organizations, institutions, industries, social movements, and nation states.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Sociology Undergraduate Overview Majors Minors Honors The Thesis Proposal Past Honors Theses Courses Course Schedule by Term First Year Seminars Introductory Courses Methods Theory Lower Division Upper Division Culminating Experience Prizes & Awards Research Awards Transfer Credit Careers Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story What is Sociology?
