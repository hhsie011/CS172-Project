Our renowned faculty work closely with and mentor our predoctoral research fellows, postdoctoral research fellows, research assistants, and summer research interns to prepare them for future careers in business research. Opportunities Summer Research Internship Program CBS' summer research internship program exposes students to the world of business research. Each intern is matched to a faculty member who has an available research project. Many of our summer interns have gone on to top-tier PhD programs in economics, finance, marketing, and data science after graduation. Learn More Predoctoral Fellows Program The Predoctoral Fellows (PDF) Program is a 2-year predoctoral research program. Under the guidance of CBS faculty, predoctoral fellows play an active role in multiple research projects that are in various stages, from conception through publication. Our alumni have been admitted to PhD programs in top business schools and PhD programs in related disciplines such as economics and sociology. Learn more Columbia Undergraduate Business Scholars The mission of the Columbia Undergraduate Business Scholarship (CUBS) Program is to increase participation of students from underrepresented groups in business research. CUBS are paired with faculty for whom they work as paid research assistants and, in the process, develop basic research and data-analytics skills, and gain insight into careers in academia.
