Temple University is proud of our strong partnerships with neighboring communities, and we are committed to increasing the number of North Philadelphia students enrolled here. Part of our dedication to this initiative is providing equitable opportunities for underserved and underrepresented students to fully participate in college-level courses and academic enrichment programs. Temple’s Cecil B. Moore Scholars Program creates an academic pathway for Philadelphia public (district or charter) students living in our neighboring North Philadelphia ZIP codes—19121, 19122, 19123, 19125, 19130, 19132, 19133 and 19140. The program is named after Cecil B. Moore, a renowned civil rights activist in Philadelphia and Temple alumnus. Program Details The Cecil B. Moore Scholars Program partners with Steppingstone Scholars to provide academic support to high school seniors selected to take the dual enrollment course. It also creates success-based advising and enrichment initiatives to support BIPOC (Black, Indigenous and people of color) and low-income students. The program will provide students coordinated pre-college preparation, admit selected students in cohorts for focused campus advising and mentoring, and award scholarships that cover full tuition at Temple. Fifty high school students will be selected for a dual enrollment program—a free Temple course that students complete during their senior year of high school. From those 50 students, 20–25 high school students will be selected to become Cecil B. Moore Scholars and attend a summer bridge program before enrolling as first-year students in the fall.
