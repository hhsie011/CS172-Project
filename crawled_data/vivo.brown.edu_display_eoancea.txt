She obtained a PhD in Cell Biology from Duke University Medical Center and her postdoctoral training from Harvard University Medical School and Children's Hospital, Boston. Dr. Oancea has always been fascinated by cell biology and signal transduction events, which she studies using different microscopy techniques combined with molecular biology and biochemistry.

My lab is equipped with a state-of-the-art two-color TIRF microscope, which we will use to study UV-induced pigmentation in human skin and melanoma behavior. To visualize signal transduction events, we design and generate novel fluorescent probes using molecular biology techniques, which give us a unique angle in answering biologically relevant questions. Research Statement The focus of my laboratory is in understanding signal transduction events using fluorescent microscopy in living cells. Lately, Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent (TIRF) microscopy proved to be an important tool for studying molecular events at and in the near vicinity of the plasma membrane. My lab is equipped with a state-of-the-art two-color TIRF microscope, which we will use to study UV-induced pigmentation in human skin and melanoma behavior. To visualize signal transduction events, we design and generate novel fluorescent probes using molecular biology techniques. These probes will give us a unique angle in answering biologically relevant questions. My research focuses on the TrpM family of Trp ion channels: understanding their cellular function and the signaling pathways in which they are involved. Most recently, I directed my research towards TrpM1, the founding member of the TrpM subfamily. Despite being identified ten years ago, very little is known about this molecule. TrpM, initially named Melastatin, was identified from melanocytes as a molecule down-regulated in aggressive melanoma, suggesting a tumor suppressor function for this molecule. TrpM1 is used as a prognostic marker for melanoma tumors: its expression level directly correlates with the metastatic potential of tumors. We showed that TrpM1 is a non-selective ion channel with role in pigmentation. These findings raise new questions and opportunities to understand how pigmentation occurs in human skin, how cells detect and respond to UV radiations and what is the relationship between skin pigmentation and melanoma.
