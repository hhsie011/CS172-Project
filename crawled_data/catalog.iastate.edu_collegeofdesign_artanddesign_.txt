Degree offerings include the Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Art and Design, Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) in Integrated Studio Arts, and Master of Fine Arts (MFA) in Integrated Visual Arts. The Bachelor of Arts in Art and Design is a four-year degree program with two options: Art and Culture or Visual Culture Studies. Both options require students to complement their studio art or visual culture studies coursework with study in a second area, within or outside of the College of Design. This can include a second major or minor, or an alternative program of study approved by the student's academic advisor. Flexibility is a key feature of the BA in Art and Design. Many students, working with an advisor, design a course of study that allows them to pursue the BA degree in conjunction with a second major or minor such as journalism, advertising, business, entrepreneurship, history, or psychology. The BA in Art and Design can serve as a springboard into a wide array of exciting graduate school and career opportunities, including art criticism, art history, art sales, conservation, corporate art collections, gallery/museum studies, and art therapy. Art and Culture Option (Fine Arts + another area of interest) In the Art and Culture option, students combine coursework in studio art with another area of interest. Working with an advisor, students design their own programs of study, which may include another major or minor in addition to the concentration emphasizing studio art. Visual Culture Studies Option (Art History + another area of interest) The Visual Culture Studies option is for students seeking a concentrated course of study in art and design history, theory, and criticism. For students interested in museum studies, courses may include up to nine (9) credits of museum or gallery internship. Working with an advisor, students design their own programs of study, which may include another major or minor in addition to the concentration in visual culture studies. Required courses include six (6) history courses at the 300/400 level. This curriculum offers two concentrations: Art and Culture and Visual Culture Studies. Both concentrations are combined with an approved program of study, which may consist of a second major or a minor. Art and Culture Concentration The curriculum in Art and Design: Art and Culture Concentration leads to a 121-credit undergraduate Bachelor of Arts degree.
