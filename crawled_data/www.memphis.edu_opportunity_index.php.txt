Counted among that throng of proud graduates are about 10,000 students who have graduated from Tennessee high schools who are not eligible for in-state tuition, federal aid or student loans because of their residency status. Unlike for their classmates, however, this moment of achievement is muted by the fact that their path to higher education remains difficult at best. The University of Memphis is committed to ensuring that anyone who is determined and demonstrates the skills and motivation needed to earn a college degree has access to higher education. We are pleased to partner with Equal Chance for Education, a non-profit organization based in Nashville, TN that provides scholarships to students based on academic excellence, financial need and interview evaluation and without regard to race, religion, or nation of birth.
