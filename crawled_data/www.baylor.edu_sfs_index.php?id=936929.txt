Student Financial Aid Students must file the FAFSA beginning October 1 each year to receive consideration for federal and institutional financial aid. Students who file their financial aid applications late should be prepared to pay the first installment payment (including a $60 non-refundable installment plan fee) to complete financial settlement. In addition to the FAFSA, students must file the CSS Profile beginning October 1 to receive consideration for institutional need-based aid. Please monitor BearWeb and your Baylor email for important notifications about outstanding aid requirements that must be completed. All financial aid must appear as a "Credit" or "Anticipated Financial Aid" on a student's account in order for it to count towards their financial settlement. Recipients of scholarships from religious institutions, foundations, corporations, individuals, or other organizations outside the University should arrange with their donors to have checks sent to the Student Accounts office. If you need financial aid assistance, please contact the Student Financial Aid Office. Additional Charges / Miscellaneous Expenses A monthly notification will be sent on the first business day of the month to both the student's Baylor email and to all valid Authorized Users' emails regarding any additional charges or miscellaneous expenses (i.e. Health Center charges, library fines, traffic fines, etc.) incurred throughout the semester. Payment in full is expected by the end of each month. For more information about payment policies, please contact the Student Accounts office.
