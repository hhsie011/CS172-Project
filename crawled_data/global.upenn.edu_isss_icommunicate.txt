Track 1 The World of Intercultural Communication Intercultural communication plays an important role in Pennâ€™s vibrant community of people from all over the world and all walks of life. Whether itâ€™s in the classroom, in the office, socially or professionally, communication across cultures can be a source of conflict but can also be a window to another point of view. In this first track, you will gain an understanding of cultural factors that are involved in interactions and ideas of low and high context communication so that you can enhance your relationships with others. Request a training Track 2 Facts that Impact Intercultural Communication There are many facets of life that have an impact on how we communicate with others. Your home culture â€“ whether it be a country, region, or down to the scope of your family â€“ all influence how we communicate and can impact your relationships with others. Life experiences and identities also differ from one person to the next. This session will grow your awareness of facts that impact intercultural communication, help you become a more effective communicator, and support our shared goal to create a safer, more inclusive environment at Penn. Request a training Track 3 How I Communicate Are you a direct or indirect communicator? Do you take a more attached or detached approach?
