MORE TASKS at ONE.IU Supporting Teaching, Learning & Research Textile Arts Exhibit at Wylie House Museum A new exhibit is hangin’ around historic Wylie House! If you drive by on 2nd Street, you might see some of the museum’s textiles that represent the creative and feminine aspects of different types of embroidery, crocheting, and cutwork. Come on in if you’d like a closer look! While you’re here, add your own personal flair to the exhibit by contributing to an embroidery square with other members of the community. This exhibit, created by IU Curatorship Master’s student Lily Jervis, runs at Wylie House Museum through June 18. Selected textiles and the interactive community embroidery will be out on the museum’s upper porch from Wednesday-Saturday during museum hours, 10am-4pm (weather permitting). Details on this and other IU Libraries events Starting a book club? We can help! Do you belong to a book club? Would you like to start one, but don't know how? If you can gather a small group of interested readers, we can supply free books and some discussion questions you can use as you host your own gatherings! Our current book is "Galapagos" by Hoosier author Kurt Vonnegut, in which a small group of apocalypse survivors stranded on the Galapagos Islands are about to become the progenitors of a brave new human race. Vonnegut's humor, accessible writing style, and Hoosier roots make his work a natural for book club discussion! You could even make it part of your own Granfalloon celebration. You don't need to be an IU student or faculty member to participate, and you do not need to return the books when you're finished. Reserve your book club kit now Student spotlight: Land, Wealth, Liberation The Scholarly Communication Department has published a blog post to spotlight the students who worked on the recently launched public open-access digital resource – Land, Wealth, Liberation: The making and unmaking of Black wealth in the United States. The digital resource makes scholarly and historical information on historic black communities and pivotal figures available to the public in a bid to generate discourse and spur ideas and policies that foster socio-economic justice. The project could not have been completed without the hard work and enthusiasm of these students, and we're grateful for their efforts!
