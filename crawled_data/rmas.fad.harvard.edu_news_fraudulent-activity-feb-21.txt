The purchase orders / requests fraudulently represent that they are coming from “Harvard Procurement” staff and often are inquiring about the purchase of branded marketing items (backpacks, water bottles, etc.) or asking vendors for sensitive tax information. While vendors have been reaching out to Harvard contacts to verify the legitimacy of orders, some vendors have experienced losses as a result of the scheme. Notice to Vendors: Always ensure that a purchase request has come from a legitimate Harvard email or individual. If unsure, contact a known Harvard email or phone number. If you are the victim of fraudulent activity, please contact your local law enforcement. Notice to the Harvard Community: If a vendor asks for confirmation of a Harvard purchase request, please review the request for legitimacy and alert RMAS Fraud Alert at RMAS-FraudAlert@harvard.edu if you have reason to think the request is illegitimate. Examples Fraudulent requests/emails could come from domains similar but not limited to @harvard-edu.net, @harvard-educ.com, @harvardd-edu.com, @harvardcollege-edu.com, harvard-edu @financier.com, or harvard_eduinfo @aol.com. Valid Harvard email addresses ALWAYS end in ‘harvard.edu’ or ‘hbs.edu’. (e.g. john_harvard @harvard.edu or jharvard @fas.harvard.edu) Characteristics of Common BEC/EAC Schemes Please be sensitive to additional types of attempted Business Email compromise / Email Account Compromise (BEC/EAC) schemes.
