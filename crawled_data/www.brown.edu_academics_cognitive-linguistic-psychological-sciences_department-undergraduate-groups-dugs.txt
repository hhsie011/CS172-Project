A Department Undergraduate Group is a group that fosters a sense of community within a concentration (or two [or three]). As outlined by Brown University, DUG leaders are responsible for the following: a) help students make and strengthen connections with other concentrators, professors, and concentrator alums; b) provide a means for first- and second-year students to explore various concentrations; and c) enable concentrators to explore potential career opportunities related to their disciplines. The Cognition DUG encompasses Cognitive Science and Cognitive Neuroscience, and we will host events that bring these concentrators together to make friends and support one another throughout their duration at Brown. 2021-2022 DUG Leaders Behavioral Decision Sciences - [email protected] (Sign up for BDS DUG) Rachel Avram [email protected] Maja Nieweglowska [email protected] Cognitive Science / Neuroscience - (Sign up for COG DUG) Celine Aubuchon [email protected] Katherine Dokhoyan [email protected] Noa Mintz [email protected] Leticia Wood [email protected] Grace Desmond [email protected] Kaitlyn Mi [email protected] Isabel Riches [email protected] Linguistics Becky Matthew [email protected] Corrin Anderer [email protected] Psychology - (Sign up for Psycholog DUG) Nathaniel Kim [email protected] Mary Yockel [email protected] Undergraduates Behavioral Decision Sciences Cognitive Science Cognitive Neuroscience Linguistics Psychology DUGs Honors Requirements Resources Cognitive, Linguistic & Psychological Sciences Cognitive, Linguistic & Psychological Sciences Brown University Box 1821 Metcalf Research Building 190 Thayer Street Providence, RI 02912 Phone: 401-863-2727 Fax: 401-863-2255 Email [email protected] Brown University Giving to Brown Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA 401-863-1000 Contact Us Maps Directions Career Opportunities Campus Safety Accessibility All Social Media Â© 2022 Brown University | Back to top
