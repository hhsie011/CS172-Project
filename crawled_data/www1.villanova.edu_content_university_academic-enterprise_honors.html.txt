TRANSFORM. SUCCEED. The University Honors Program is an intellectual home for Villanova’s academically gifted students. The program empowers its students to be seekers of truth, learning to relate critically and empathetically to their own traditions while exploring contemporary questions. Honors students are given space to test ideas in an environment that supports their own definition of success—both personal and professional. For Prospective Students For Current Students For Alumni THE HONORS DIFFERENCE DISTINCT ACADEMIC PATH Honors courses are small interdisciplinary seminars that emphasize student initiative in discussion, research and presentations. MORE RESEARCH Students have access to meaningful undergraduate research opportunities with Villanova's teacher-scholars. Student research often culminates in Senior Thesis projects. MORE FIRST-YEAR LEARNING EXPERIENCE Students can take themed classes over several semesters with peers who share their interests and live with them in Honors housing. MORE INTERNSHIPS Students are provided the resources needed to secure internships that support their professional and academic goals. An Honors-specific fellowship program encourages exploration of work that promotes justice. MORE WHAT OUR STUDENTS ARE SAYING Reid Koren (Charlotte, N.C.) "The Honors residence hall has been an amazing experience. Being able to live and study with my classmates has really fostered those relationships and allowed them to grow and strengthen very quickly. The fact that I can walk down the hall and work on my Chemistry homework with one kid and then talk about my Ancients homework with another is awesome." MORE... Kevon Turner (Washington, D.C.) "What I really ended up connecting with was the very small, intimate seminar settings where there's a group of less than 20 students and we're having these very in-depth discussions and really reaching into the material and getting a lot of meaning out of it." MORE... Simran Kripalni (Edison, N.J.) "We were pushed to have opinions and pushed to voice our opinions. That style of teaching has helped me not only read material, but extrapolate things from material and be able to convey my thoughts and stances on certain things." MORE... Austin Glass (Lancaster, Pa.) "The Vocare Summer Fellows Program impacted my professional goals. It confirmed that I want to work in a space where I'm leveraging my skills from my business education and my economics understanding in a way that serves social good, working across the private and public sector to meet the needs of those experiencing homelessness." MORE... Elizabeth Eby (Bedford, N.H.) "I have been so impressed with my Honors professors. They really challenged me to think in ways I've never thought before. And I love being surrounded by a group of like-minded students who are super eager to be in class and who also challenged me to think in ways I haven't before." MORE... Hwa Pyung Yoo (Seoul, South Korea) "When we're in a seminar style classroom, we get to engage with the professors on a level that we wouldn't necessarily be able to within a normal lecture style classroom. So as they talk with us and converse with us about all these different ideas, they push us to question different things." MORE...
