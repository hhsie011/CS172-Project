Morris, PhD (202) 865-8678 vmorris@howard.edu Howard University Biography: Dr. Morris is a full Professor in the Department of Chemistry, and the Director of the Atmospheric Sciences Program at Howard University. He also has joint appointments in the Environmental Engineering Program at Howard University; and is a member of the graduate faculty at both the University of Maryland, College Park, and the University of Texas, El Paso. He earned his PhD in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences from Georgia Tech; and completed postdoctoral study at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the University of California Davis. He also earned recognition as an NSF CAREER awardee, and a NASA Administrator’s Fellow before returning to HU to lead NCAS. Dr. Morris serves as the Director of NCAS {2001 – 2017} and currently directs the NOAA Cooperative Science Center in Atmospheric Sciences and Meteorology (NCAS-M) {2017 to present}. In this capacity, Dr. Morris provides the executive leadership for the 13-member academic consortium, including the overall scientific design and implementation. He has sustained international research collaborations in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Philippines and coordinated memoranda of understanding for research and education with nine (9) academic institutions in six (6) different countries. Dr. Morris has published over 60 papers and has delivered more than 100 invited talks and national/international conference presentations. Vernon Morris PhD Biographic Sketch Current Research: Dr. Morris’ research activities focus on field measurements of trace gases and aerosols in the urban environment, long-range transport of mineral dust aerosols, aerobiology, and environmental chemistry. He has led 15 interdisciplinary field observation missions since 2001, including environmental justice studies in Memphis, TN and Washington, DC. The AERosols and Oceanographic Science Expeditions (AEROSE) comprise a principal effort. The AEROSE cruises are an internationally recognized series of field campaigns designed to explore African air mass outflows and their impacts on climate, weather, and environmental health. This projects began with a dedicated cruise in 2004 and has been conducted annually since 2006 to generate the most comprehensive data set of complementary atmospheric measurement and oceanographic observations aimed at characterizing the impact and microphysical evolution of Saharan dust aerosols transported across the Atlantic Ocean.
