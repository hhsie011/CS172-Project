Skip to Main Content Emergency Medicine Emergency Medicine Yale School of MedicineEmergency Medicine About Us Clinical Services Sections Education Medical Simulation Informatics Research Faculty & Staff Department of Emergency Medicine Emergency Medicine is the field of practice concerned with the assessment, stabilization, diagnosis, and disposition of people with acute illness and injury. Emergency practitioners treat the full spectrum of patients using skills ranging from those of a general practitioner to specialists. They diagnose emergency conditions and undertake acute interventions to stabilize the patient. Some of many skills include: Trauma resuscitation Advanced cardiac life support Advanced airway management Assisting women in labor Management of drug overdoses In July of 2009, the Yale School of Medicine’s Section of Emergency Medicine was elevated to departmental status, reflecting both the reputation of the section and the maturation of emergency medicine as an academic discipline. The Section of Emergency Medicine, formerly part of the Department of Surgery, was created in 1991. It has grown in size from five to 47 faculty members, who have responsibility for 80,600 patient visits a year at Yale New Haven Hospital and 24,600 visits annually at the Yale New Haven Shoreline Medical Center in Guilford. The department’s focus increasingly involves elements of public health and prevention, including screening for hypertension, diabetes and HIV, and treatment and referral for drug addiction, domestic violence, mood disorders and other mental health issues. 24|7|365 The Evolution of Emergency Medicine Watch video Latest News May 27, 2022 Dr. Sharon Chekijian Collaborates with AUA to Develop Armenia’s Emergency Response SystemsSource: AUA Newsroom Read more May 18, 2022 Health Headlines: How many times can you catch COVID?Source: WTNH Read more May 05, 2022 Health & Veritas: Grappling with the Opioid Epidemic (Ep. 32)Source: Yale Insights Read more May 04, 2022 Health Headlines: Could a nose spray before the defense against COVID?Source: WTNH Read more More News Twitter Feed @Yale_EM Retweeted @arjunvenkateshGreat work by Leigh Evans and @ambrosehwong - Improving patient and clinician safety during COVID-19 through rapidly adaptive simulation and a randomised controlled trial: a study protocol @BMJ_Open @Yale_EM @SAEMSimAcademy https://t.co/eaMy8AWzlY11 DAYS AGO @Yale_EM Retweeted @pagrawalmdBottom line: racial and gender disparities significantly impact career trajectories in EM - important work by @tsaiduck77 of @Yale_EM presented during @AWAEM RIP @SAEMonline https://t.co/wVe5imNOSG19 DAYS AGO @Yale_EM Retweeted @arjunvenkatesh@CameronGettel at #SAEM22: attrition in the EM workforce between 2013 and 2019 increasing particularly in rural areas - one communities surplus is another’s shortage @Yale_EM @ACEPNow @dmark123w10 https://t.co/vTSvjn2YMC19 DAYS AGO Follow @Yale_EM Interim Chair, Department of Emergency Medicine Andrew Ulrich, MD Professor of Emergency Medicine View Full Profile 464 Congress Ave New Haven, CT 06519 Maps & Directions 1 Event you could attend in June 2022 Calendar Contact Us Intranet Site Editor Accessibility at YSM Terms & Privacy Policy Yale University Yale Phonebook © 2022 Yale School of Medicine.
