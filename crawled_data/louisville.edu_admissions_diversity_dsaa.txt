Since the inception of this program (AVIATORS), these students have played a tremendous role increasing enrollment numbers of students of underrepresented backgrounds for the university. In 2018 the program refocused from a volunteer opportunity to a paid student worker opportunity with the new name Diversity Student Ambassadors for Admissions (DSAA). The program is currently comprised of 25-30 undergraduate students from various backgrounds. These DSAA's introduce high school students to their unique college experience. Meet the DSAA's Why I wanted to become a DSAA... "A Diversity Student Ambassador for Admissions provides a safe space for others to get a good grasp of the college experience. We aim for the students that are often ignored, particularly those from diverse backgrounds. I wanted to be a DSAA so that I could partake in this education while contributing the diversification of UofL" - Asha Ramesh, Psychology "Being a Diversity Student Ambassador for Admissions is so exciting because I get to meet so many different people and I share what it's like to be a Cardinal! DSAA's have such an important responsibility to welcome visiting minority groups and to create an inclusive first-time experience. Being a DSA is really an honor because I get to be sometimes one of the first few faces students meet when they visit campus." - Rita Ackah, Public Health "I wanted to become a Diversity Student Ambassador for Admissions to share my love of the university with prospective students as well as provide them with an authentic experience during their visits. Being a DSAA allows me to share what being a college student is like at UofL, and form connections with students to figure out how the university can cater to their needs and wants." - Lauren Jones, Individualized Major: Psychological Communication, Pre-Med Responsibilities The main responsibilities of Diversity Student Ambassadors for Admissions are to enhance the office’s Diversity Visit Programs, such as Order Your Educational Steps (OYES) Group Visit and Up Close and Personal Shadow Visit opportunities.
