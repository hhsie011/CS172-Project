Founded in 1990, the College of Computing represented just the second computing college at top U.S. universities, and its commitment to that continues to this day. Our four schools and some 140 faculty allow us to explore a wide range of research areas - from the foundations of computing, like networking and software engineering, to disciplines like that focus on the exchange between person and machine, like human-computer interaction and animation, and even to the emerging areas of computational engineering and sciences. We invite you to use the links below to explore the widening research world of GT Computing.
