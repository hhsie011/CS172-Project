This area of the website is intended to provide the public with detailed information about the collection of crime statistics, and the requisite crime reporting mechanisms established by both federal and state law. College or university reporting of crime statistics is frequently referred to as "Clery crime statistics" or Clery reporting". These references are named after the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Police and Campus Crime Statistics Act. This federal law mandates the disclosure of certain statistics regarding criminal incidents that occur within the geographical boundaries of an institution of higher education. The state of Florida also mandates similar requirements under the state law. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the "Clery Act" and the wealth of information available to you. For questions, please contact the University's Clery Officer: Lieutenant Carrie Allen Phone: (850) 644-1940 Email: caallen@fsu.edu Clery Data Form title-inside title-centered 2 Clery Resources and Links Clery Center for Security Main Campus Annual Security Report Panama City Campus Guide Ringling Annual Security Report London Study Center Safety Guide Valencia Study Center Safety Guide Republic of Panama Safety Guide Florence Study Center Safety Guide FSUPD Headquarters Florida State University Police Department 830 West Jefferson Street PO Box 3064215 Tallahassee FL, 32306 Map Location P: (850) 644-1234 F: (850) 644-3205 FSUPD Panama City Florida State University Panama City 4750 Collegiate Drive Panama City FL, 32405 Map Location P: (850) 872-4250 F: (850) 770-2721 Transportation & Parking Services 104 N.
