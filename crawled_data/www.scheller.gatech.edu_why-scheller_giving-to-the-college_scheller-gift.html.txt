But this transformation began shrouded in mystery. In the fall of 2009, an anonymous donor gave $25 million to the school ($20 million of which was a dollar-for-dollar challenge grant designed to inspire other donors). The man behind the gift was a closely guarded secret until summer 2012, as the challenge grant edged closer to completion. Then suddenly the news broke. With an additional $25 million commitment from alumnus Ernest Scheller Jr. (for a total of $50 million), Georgia Tech College of Management not only had a new brand name, but also was officially known as a college of business. The $20 million challenge grant was completed in early 2013, tripling the College’s endowment through the creation of faculty chairs and professorships, student scholarships and fellowships, and other opportunities. Ernest Scheller Jr. graduated from Georgia Tech in 1952 and is chairman emeritus of Silberline Manufacturing. He continues to serve as a major inspiration to alumni and friends who are dedicated to the advancement of the Scheller College of Business. Challenge Results: 4 Endowed Faculty Chairs 7 Endowed Professorships and Early Career Professorships 34 Endowed Dean’s Scholarships for Undergraduate Students 2 Steven A.
