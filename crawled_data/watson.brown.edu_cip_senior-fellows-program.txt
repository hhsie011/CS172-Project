Senior fellows receive a one-year appointment at Brown University through the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs. Fellows are encouraged to lead student study groups each semester, and throughout the year to attend student/faculty discussions, visit courses, host public events, and mentor undergraduate and graduate students through office hours. Recent fellows include Menaka Guruswamy, senior advocate at the Supreme Court of India, former U.S. Senator Heidi Heitkamp, former Lieutenant Governor Michael Steele, writer ZZ Packer, and Jim Yong Kim, former president of the World Bank. About Study Groups Senior Fellow study groups provide an opportunity for students to delve deeply into policy and international affairs topics and apply theory and research to real world challenges. They are open to undergraduates and graduate students from all concentrations. The study groups are designed be accessible to students across different fields and to avoid infringing on students’ coursework. Fellows often invite guest speakers to address specific topics. Background reading is usually assigned for each session but is kept to a minimum. Group size is kept small to promote student participation and conversation, and participating students are expected to attend all five meetings.
