How I've Changed Before attending HDS, I had trouble finding my grounding and who I truly wanted to be. But through the community of HDS, being thrown into an unfamiliar city, and finding Boston Joyful Church, I have gained confidence in who I am and my purpose in this world. Message of Thanks I want to thank God. Without God, I would not have made it this far in life. I want to give a special thanks to the many people that have been influential in my life. I want to thank my family, LaMeka and LeMard Cyrus, Malcolm, and Velinda Watson, for their love and encouragement. I thank my mentor Dr. Joyce Nki, who believed in me and helped me blossom during my undergrad years at Bethune-Cookman University. I also want to thank Dr. Deborah-Henson Governor and Mrs. Holmes for caring for me in such difficult times. I also want to thank Pastor Deogsig and Judy Kang, my spiritual parents, for grooming me and helping me elevate spiritually. Thank you all for being an inspiration in my life and the many others that I failed to mention. Future Plans I plan to go to Haiti to pursue missionary work and help teach English to children and adults. I also hope to one day obtain a doctoral degree to become a teacher and help motivate others, just like the influential educators in my life have motivated me.
