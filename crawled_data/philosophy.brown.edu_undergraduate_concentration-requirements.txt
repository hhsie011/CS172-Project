Please note that Philosophy courses were renumbered beginning Fall 2021. Numbers in parentheses refer to courses from before the renumbering. So what is now 0640, for example, used to be 0540. Learning Goals Students in philosophy will: Learn to think analytically and creatively about philosophical texts and issues Understand the work of major figures in the history of philosophy, including Plato, Aristotle, Descartes and Kant Become familiar with arguments and approaches in metaphysics or epistemology, and a selection of other areas of philosophy, such as philosophy of mind and philosophy of language; as well as topics in ethics and political philosophy Know how to carry out logical proofs and derivations within a formal system Produce a significant body of written work Requirements The concentration requires 10 courses total, of which no more than one may be below PHIL 0100 (0350), and at least three must be at or above PHIL 0990. There are five area (or 'distribution') requirements: One course in Ancient Greek Philosophy Typically, PHIL 0110 (0350), though most other courses numbered 01XX and 11XX also satisfy this requirement. One course in Early Modern Philosophy Typically, PHIL 0210 (0360), though most other courses numbered 02XX and 12XX also satisfy this requirement. One course in Logic Typically, PHIL 0640 (0540), though most other courses numbered 06XX or 16XX also satisfy this requirement. One course in Epistemology or Metaphysics Most courses numbered 07XX, 08XX, 17XX and 18XX satisfy this requirement. One course in Ethics or Political Philosophy Most courses numbered 04XX, 05XX, 14XX, and 15XX satisfy this requirement. With approval of the Director of Undergraduate Studies, up to two courses from departments other than the Philosophy department may be included among the ten courses required for the Concentration. These courses may not be counted toward fulfillment of the area requirements. Students are also required to take at least one seminar. Normally, these courses are the undergraduate seminars numbered 09XX or graduate seminars (with the instructor's permission) number in the 2000s. Other discussion-based courses can be counted as fufilling the seminar requirement with permission of the DUS. All philosophy students are also required to complete a capstone. For details on that, see the Capstone page. Honors in Philosophy To qualify for Honors, a student must: Have grades of either A or Satisfactory with Distinction in more than half their philosophy courses and any courses from outside the department that they are counting towards the concentration. Successfully complete a Senior Thesis that, in the judgment of the advisor and second reader (to be appointed by the Director of Undergraduate Studies), is worthy of an Honors recommendation.
