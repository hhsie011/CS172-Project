Learn more About Mentoring Youth in NYC Mentoring Youth in NYC (MyNYC) is a mentoring program that works with high school students who will become first generation college students, providing them mentors and resources for the college application process, assistance that would otherwise be unavailable. Mentors advise high school students on building strong college applications and share information on what to expect in the college experience, including choosing a major, managing time, and respecting diversity. Additionally, MyNYC's off campus, one-on-one outings are designed to foster trusting relationships between the mentors and their mentees. Sessions run from 4:00pm - 5:30pm on Fridays in Earl Hall at Columbia. Volunteer commitment is for one year.
