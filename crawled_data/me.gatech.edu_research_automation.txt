Research in mechatronics focuses on the fusion of mechanical and electrical disciplines in modern engineering processes, aimed at achieving a cost-effective, optimal balance between mechanical structure and their overall control. Research topics include active and passive damping, adaptive learning and robust control of systems with uncertainty, automated manufacturing and demanufacturing, fuzzy and neural networks for control and identification, precision engineering and motion control, multimedia technology, intelligent sensors and actuators, vision-based motion control, and teleoperation.
