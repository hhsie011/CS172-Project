The field of "materials" encompasses concepts in many diverse fields ranging from chemistry, physics, and optics to mechanical, electrical, and chemical engineering. Rapid advances in technology have dramatically increased the importance of materials science and engineering to society. Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) is the study of the structure/processing/properties relationships of engineering materials. Modern MSE encompasses a broad range of materials, from traditional metallurgy to biological materials, polymers, ceramics, semiconductors, composites, and optical and magnetic materials, as well as numerous nanotechnology materials. The study of materials science allows students considerable freedom to the depth of their understanding of such materials while being simultaneously engaged in real world research. Participants in this minor will be able to improve their understanding, awareness and job skills in material selection and application to have additional opportunities and advantages to pursue a career in Engineering. Students taking graduate level EMA courses as Restricted Electives can use them for the Accelerated BS-to-MS program in Materials Science and Engineering. Admission Requirements A minimum UCF GPA of 2.5 is required for acceptance into this minor.
