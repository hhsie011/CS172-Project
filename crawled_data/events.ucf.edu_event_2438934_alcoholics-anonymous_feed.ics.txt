The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking. There are no dues or fees for A.A. membership; we are self-supporting through our own contributions. A.A. is not allied with any sect, denomination, politics, organization, or institution; does not wish to engage in any controversy; neither endorses nor opposes any causes. Our primary purpose is to stay sober and help other alcoholics to achieve sobriety.\n\nFor more information about this meeting visit [studenthealth.ucf.edu/recovery/](https://studenthealth.ucf.edu/recovery/) or call the AA 24-Hr Helpline at [(407) 260-5408](tel:4072605408) END:VEVENT END:VCALENDAR
