In comparison to other countries in the region, Tunisia fared well politically and socially. Two peaceful elections in 2011 and 2014 witnessed a smooth transfer of power and consolidated a number of democratic institutions in the country. Yet several obstacles remain, such as an economic crisis within the country and the resilience of authoritarian tendencies. Columbia Global Centers | Tunis is hosting a discussion on April 12 about the future of Tunisia as a democratic MENA republic. The event will feature speakers discussing the country's political situation, the security and economic risks it is facing, and prospects for the future, as the country looks ahead eight years after the Arab uprisings of 2011. Being the only free country in the region, Tunisia is attracting attention and remains an alternative to the existing authoritarian models. The event will feature: Eric Verhoogen, Professor, Department of Economics and SIPA, Co-Director, CDEP, Columbia University (Moderator) Sarah Yerkes, Fellow, Middle East Program, Carnegie Sharan Grewal, Post-Doctoral Fellow, Center for Middle East Policy, Brookings Zied Mhirsi, civil society activist and Board Member of Tunisian American Young Professionals Elyes Ben Rayana, Head of Corporate and Investment Banking, BIAT (via videoconference) This event is part of a yearlong 10-event series celebrating the Columbia Global Centers' 10th anniversary.
