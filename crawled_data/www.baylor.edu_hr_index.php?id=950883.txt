Managing and leading can be hard work, but a good plan and the right resources can make it easier. In this section you will find helpful tips to start putting together your personal leadership plan, and you will find resources to help you maximize your impact in your position. Leaders and managers support Baylor University's mission by fostering a caring community through providing coaching, feedback, and seeking learning opportunities for their employees. Through these core actions, employees are better equipped to succeed in their personal and professional lives. Introduction to Management Every manager must perform several key elements well to be an effective leader. Successful managers must be able to select and hire new employees, set a vision and direction for the team, set expectations and hold people accountability, develop employees, and ensure individuals and the team are producing results. At the heart of all this is the ability to coach and provide feedback. Coaching is actively developing others by asking questions and providing guidance that shifts perspectives, explores different approach, and shares key learning. Feedback helps others know what they are doing well and how they can do even better. Positive feedback reinforces actions, while developmental feedback guides toward a more effective approach. Both coaching and feedback require sometimes having difficult conversations to share shortcomings and reinforce expectations. This is no small task and if you are a new manager, it is likely some or all of these skills may be new to you. Leadership is a distinct skillset and Baylor provides many resource to jumpstart and your success as a manager, from the leadership focused courses in Ignite to access to e-learning and videos in LinkedIn Learning and RightNow Media @ Work.
