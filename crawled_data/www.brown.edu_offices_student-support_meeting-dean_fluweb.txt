Recognizing this, there is a process in place for students to alert the university by submitting the Sickness Support Request Form. The support form is part of a larger set of resources provided through the Temporary Resource Management (TRM) system for students who are sick. We encourage all students who are ill to contact Health Services for care and a Health Services team member can register the student through TRM as needed. Once a student submits the Sickness Support Request Form, a staff member from Student Support Services will send an email (usually within 24 hours) to review resources and to check in about academic concerns and general support which may be needed. As needed, we can arrange for a Dean’s Note to be sent to professors. Fortunately most students are on the mend rather quickly, and for those few who may experience a longer recovery period, Student Support Services will make every effort to provide assistance in determining an academic plan. For any healthcare related concerns, students should call Health Services at 401.863.1330.
