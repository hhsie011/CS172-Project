These relationships are critically important in not only generating much-needed private philanthropic support for the institution, but in supporting a strong base of committed university advocates. I am proud to call myself a Titan, and I am honored to be a part of this remarkable organization. It is my hope that this website will help you discover the people and departments within University Advancement that comprise our cumulative efforts to help move the institution forward and enhance its ability to fulfill its educational mission.
