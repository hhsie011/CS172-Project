Foster Success Center Reporting Deficiencies Student Course Evaluations Evaluation, Tenure, Promotion, and Compensation Policies and Procedures Related to Employment at Baylor Faculty Benefits Faculty Senate Faculty Ombudsperson University Libraries Information Technology Services University Committees Policy Revisions Delayed Examinations A student who misses an end of semester examination on account of illness or other imperative cause should, as early as possible, consult the teacher for permission to take a delayed examination. If possible, this request should be made before the scheduled time for the examination as late explanations are less likely to be accepted. If delayed examination permission is granted, the course grade will be "I" (Incomplete) if the student is in satisfactory status in the course;otherwise, the grade will be "F." If a delayed examination request is directed to the dean, he or she will consult the instructor and subsequently inform the student of the approval or disapproval of the request. If approved, the student may then arrange with the instructor for the examination. Permission for a delayed examination will not be given unless the student is in good standing in the course. The incomplete grade must be removed by the end of the subsequent semester (summer terms included); the "I" will automatically be changed to the grade of "F" if the course is not completed by this time. An "I" is not included in hours earned or grade point average until it expires or becomes a grade.
