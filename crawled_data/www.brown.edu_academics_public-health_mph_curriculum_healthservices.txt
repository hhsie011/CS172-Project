The concentration explicitly seeks to train scientists to optimally contribute as part of multidisciplinary teams in academic posts, government agencies at the state, national and international levels, and in research arms of private sectors of health services delivery organizations. The concentration explicitly seeks to develop scientists skilled in the communication of scientific knowledge, equipped with leadership skills for the purpose of improving services and influencing health policy at the organizational, state, national, and international levels such that those policies lead to more equitable use of resources thus improving health outcomes. The competency-based curriculum provides students with a strong analytic foundation and general health services research orientation. Health Services Concentration-Specific Competencies Organize and present information drawn from multiple sources that characterize the economic, political and financial forces that shape the way in which the health care system interacts Critically evaluate the relative strengths and weaknesses of evidence and research regarding the performance of components of the health care system Design a primary data gathering instrument/protocol Collect primary data to address a public health issue Evaluate the strengths and limitations of primary data collection methods Develop a performance measure Develop a hypothetical run chart to assess whether an intervention to improve performance was successful Develop a pay-for-performance scheme to enhance a quality improvement effort Students who matriculated in Fall 2018 or Fall 2019 should click here Students who matriculated prior to Fall 2018 should click here.
