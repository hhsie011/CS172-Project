(Photo by Joseph Mehling) PreviousNext COVID-19 Response The Guarini School of Graduate and Advanced Studies realizes the impact COVID-19 has had on testing centers. Access to TOEFL and GRE testing has been limited globally, and our 2021 applicants are struggling to meet our programs admissions requirements. For our next graduate applications cycle August 1st, 2021 to July 31st, 2022, The Guarini School will be flexible as to the types of GRE and Language Proficiency tests accepted by our programs for admissions purposes. DuoLingo testing will not be accepted. We still ask that applicants attach unofficial copies of their test scores to their application if required by their prospective program. International Applicants: For TOEFL/IELTS testing requirements please visit the individual program websites for more information and waiver requirements. However, official test scores will still be required from Educational Testing Services if you are admitted. Application Requirements Applications generally include a completed application form, undergraduate transcripts, three letters of recommendation, and scores from the General Test of the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE). Application requirements vary by program; exact requirements can be obtained from each department. See our complete list of programs for links to department websites.
