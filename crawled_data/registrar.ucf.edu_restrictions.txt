NC-SARA is a voluntary, regional approach to state oversight of postsecondary distance education. The reciprocity agreements allow for the open delivery of academic credit-earning activities in participating states, including academic field experiences such as internships or practicums. Current authorized SARA member states include the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and all states except California. California is not a SARA state but currently has no state authorization restrictions for regionally accredited public institutions like UCF. Therefore, UCF has no U.S. state restrictions on enrolling students. Due to current restrictions imposed by U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, UCF’s Webcourse delivery cannot be provided to the following countries. Students who are resident or may be resident in any of these countries during their UCF study should not enroll or begin an academic program at UCF. The restricted countries are: Cuba Iran North Korea Syria The region of Crimea HOURS OF OPERATION Monday through Friday: 9 a.m. – 5 p.m. LOCATION Millican Hall, Room 161 4365 Andromeda Loop N., Orlando, FL 32816-0086 CONTACT US 407-823-3100 407-823-5652 registrar@ucf.edu LET’S GET SOCIAL facebook twitter instagram youtube The University of Central Florida is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) to award degrees at the associate, baccalaureate, master’s, specialist, and doctoral levels.
