This includes new guidance for people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised and recommendations on vaccination following monoclonal antibody therapy. The New York City Department of Health & Mental Hygiene issued a notice late last week that covers these updated considerations and includes other vaccine updates relevant to New York City health care providers. We encourage clinical faculty and staff to review the departmentâ€™s full advisory here: Updates to CDC COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance, Including For People Who Are Immunocompromised. Key updates from the CDC included: A shortened, three-month interval between an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine primary series (including the third additional primary dose) and a booster dose in people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised Recommending an additional primary dose of mRNA vaccine after at least 28 days for people who received a single Johnson & Johnson primary dose and are moderately or severely immunocompromised People who receive this additional dose should receive a booster dose at least two months after the additional dose Patients who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and already received their booster dose can get their additional dose at least two months after their booster dose An allowance for providers who care for moderately or severely immunocompromised patients to administer mRNA COVID-19 vaccines outside of the FDA and CDC dosing intervals based on clinical judgment Elimination of the deferral period for COVID-19 vaccination after receipt of passive monoclonal antibody products; however, tixagevimab/cilgavimab (EVUSHELD) for pre-exposure prophylaxis should be deferred for at least two weeks after vaccination Adding history of myocarditis or pericarditis after an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine as a precaution to any COVID-19 vaccination Additional information for health care providers can be found on the New York City Department of Health & Mental Hygiene website. Thank you and stay safe!
