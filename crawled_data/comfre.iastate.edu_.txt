These fluid systems play a fundamental role in numerous fields, each comprising several multi-billion-dollar industries. Examples of applications include: Petroleum and biorenewable fuel and chemical production Energy generation Materials processing and manufacturing Pharmaceutical production Food processing Consumer product manufacturing Concrete production CoMFRE provides a forum for integration of the activities and skill-sets of multiple ISU investigators with external collaborators from academia, industry and national laboratories to accelerate knowledge transfer from fundamental scientific advances in multiphase flow to industrial applications and end-users.
