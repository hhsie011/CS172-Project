General campus questions and vaccination information hotline 801-213-2874 Health and testing questions hotline 801-587-0712 Self Reporting Form Vaccination Information Testing Information Work Reimagined Steps to Take for COVID-19 Symptoms, Exposure or Positive Test INFORMATION & PRECAUTIONS Updated MARCH 3, 2022 We are a mask friendly campus When students and faculty return to campus on March 14 at the end of spring break, masks will not be required in indoor spaces on main campus. The general public will not be required to wear masks in public facilities—including the Utah Museum of Fine Arts, Natural History Museum of Utah, and Pioneer Theatre. It is important that our campus remain “mask-friendly.” Those who still wish to wear masks are encouraged to do so, especially those at high risk of severe illness from COVID-19. Masks are still required in all University of Utah Health facilities. In addition, in order to keep the number of cases low members of the campus community are being asked to follow these protocols: Test weekly for COVID-19, even if asymptomatic Get vaccinated against COVID-19 and get a booster when eligible If you test positive, or are unvaccinated and exposed to COVID-19 follow the 5-5-5 rule* You can learn more about these protocols here. VACCINATION INFORMATION Students who attend the University of Utah are required to be fully vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR). With the full FDA approval of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, the university is also requiring COVID-19 vaccination. Read more about the requirement. COVID-19 vaccination is also required for all U of U Health Hospitals and Clinics staff, credentialed and privileged providers, and Health Academics staff in patient-sensitive job codes. Dr. Tom Miller detailed the new U of U Health policy in a Clinical Update. More information will become available by mid-September. In the same meeting, Dr. Jeanmarie Mayer answered questions about the policy and provided updates about vaccine effectiveness (32:25-50:14). Getting vaccinated is the best way to protect yourself and our campus community. As a reminder, people are considered fully vaccinated against COVID-19 two weeks after their second dose in a two-dose series of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, or two weeks after a single dose of Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen vaccine. While very uncommon, vaccinated individuals can still get a coronavirus infection, but are more likely to have mild or no symptoms. Find your free vaccination now.
