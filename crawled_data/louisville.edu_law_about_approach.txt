Brandeis Our History and Traditions Our City and Campus Our Commitment to Diversity Certificate in Health Law Our Accreditations Home / About / Our Approach Our Approach Understanding the value of a hands-on learning approach and the benefit of individualized attention, we provide our students with outstanding contemporary instruction combined with abundant and meaningful practical opportunities to enhance their skills and gain experiences both inside and outside of ordinary legal practice. Personalized Attention With a faculty-to-student ratio of 12.2-to-1, first year sections averaging between 20 to 60 students, and a total enrollment of under 400 students, Brandeis School of Law offers a welcoming atmosphere where students receive personal attention and an open-door policy from faculty, staff, and the Dean. Everyday Learning through our Public Service Commitment We are committed to training thoughtful, civic-minded lawyers who play active roles in their communities. Maintaining more than 130 placements, such as legal aid offices, public defender offices and government agencies, the Samuel L. Greenebaum Public Service Program offers students the chance to develop skills working with real clients and real legal issues. The Class of 2016 donated nearly 10,000 hours of public service. Active Learning through our Externship Programs With the goal to help our students transition from being in law school to being a lawyer, we provide a wide variety of field placement opportunities in major areas of law, including judicial externships, criminal justice externships, public interest externships and in-house counsel externships, for students to develop their lawyering skills and professional identity. Learn more. Practical Learning through our Law Clinics Through the Robert and Sue Ellen Ackerson Law Clinic, students work on real cases from inception to completion, working directly with clients, lawyers and judges. With our law students having helped more than 1,000 families in need since 2009, the clinic empowers students to become agents of change and helps them acquire valuable legal experience. Learn more. We also added an Entrepreneurship Clinic during the spring semester of 2012 with an objective of providing law students with an experiential learning opportunity by providing legal support to the Entrepreneurship MBA program at UofL's College of Business. Not only does the clinic offer Brandeis students a unique real-life opportunity, it also aligns with Brandeis' interdisciplinary focus central to its mission. Learn more. Distinguished Lectures and Continuing Legal Education Events The Law School hosts two major lecture series each year — the Brandeis Medal and Lecture Series and the Boehl Distinguished Lecture Series in Land Use Policy — as well as a Labor and Employment Law Institute and Estate Planning Institute, bringing in national speakers from many different backgrounds and professions.
