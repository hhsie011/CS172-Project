You may reach the transfer team by emailing transferapp@brown.edu and we will respond during regular business hours. Most students who are unsatisfied with their college experience don't consider transferring to another school. They are unwilling to put up with the extra work, emotional energy and personal upheaval that transferring requires. Consequently, those who do take the initiative to transfer are already a significant distillation of the American college population. Transfers are people who are unwilling to settle. They are willing to do the extra work to get what they want. And they are willing to take the path less traveled to arrive at a better place. These qualities that transfers possess prepare them well for college in general and for Brown in particular. Brown's Open Curriculum is designed for the student who takes unusual initiative and demonstrates unusual independence. This could be part of the reason why transfers routinely do so well at Brown both academically and socially. It also might explain why so many of our most famous alumni originally came to Brown after a year or two at another institution.
