Rochon is working on cataloguing her collection of dancer and choreographer Jean-Léon Destiné's work and writing his biography. She's collaborated with Serendipity, an internationally connected arts organization in the UK, to curate Colonisation in Reverse: Jean-Léon Destiné Exhibition. Jean-Léon Destiné (1918–2013) is known for his choreography that addresses Haiti’s history of resistance again colonialism and slavery. Featuring archival materials, some of which have never been presented in public before, Jean-Léon Destiné’s rich and colourful career is brought to life in Colonisation in Reverse with details about Destiné's choreography, the shifting language around his work, short films, and clips from Rochon's oral histories. Colonisation in Reverse: Jean-Léon Destiné is available online as part of Serendipity's annual Let’s Dance International Frontiers, an international dance festival that features performances, discussions, workshops and a conference exploring dance as a medium for positive change. The A’Lelia Bundles Community Scholars Program, administered by the Office of Government and Community Affairs, the School of Professional Studies, and the Office of the Provost, enables members of the Upper Manhattan community to pursue aspirations and projects through a three-year affiliation with the university.
