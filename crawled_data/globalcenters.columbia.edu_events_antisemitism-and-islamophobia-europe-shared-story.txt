A Shared Story? Events Past Event Antisemitism and Islamophobia in Europe. A Shared Story? Share Add to Calendar: Google Yahoo November 10, 2017 7:00 PM - 9:00 PM Columbia Global Centers l Paris, 4 rue de Chevreuse, 75006 About the book This is the first book to examine the relationship between European antisemitism and Islamophobia from the Crusades until the twenty-first century in the principal flashpoints of the two racisms. With case studies ranging from the Balkans to the UK, the contributors take the debate away from politicised polemics about whether or not Muslims are the new Jews. Much previous scholarship and public discussion has focused on comparing European ideas about Jews and Judaism in the past with contemporary attitudes towards Muslims and Islam. This volume rejects this approach. Instead, it interrogates how the dynamic relationship between antisemitism and Islamophobia has evolved over time and space. The result is the uncovering of a previously unknown story in which European ideas about Jews and Muslims were indeed connected, but were also ripped apart. Religion, empire, nation-building, and war, all played their part in the complex evolution of this relationship. As well as a study of prejudice, this book also opens up a new area of inquiry: how Muslims, Jews, and others have responded to these historically connected racisms. Participants: Benjamin Gidley, Senior lecturer, Birkbeck, University of London James Renton, Reader in History, Edge Hill University, Visiting Fellow, European University Institute Lecture organized by Jean-Philippe Dedieu, historian and sociologist, professor in the Columbia MA in History and Literature.
