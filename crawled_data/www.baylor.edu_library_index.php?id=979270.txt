In a literal sense, every gift to the University Libraries provides a service, a resource, or a space that directly affects the scholarly success of one of our students, faculty, or visiting researchers. Here are a few of the ways your philanthropy toward the Libraries shapes the future for Baylor University. 1. A Reimagined Moody 1st Floor A Reimagined Moody First Floor The University Libraries transformed a significant portion of the first floor of Moody Memorial Library from a previous incarnation as a location for book ranges into a vibrant, inclusive, and cutting-edge area for individual, small group, and seminar-style instruction aimed at supporting the university’s goal of creating a “transformative undergraduate education” for our students. Completing this project will made great strides toward the Libraries’ goal of increasing overall space for student use from the current level of a maximum of 9% of our student body to our target of 15% and is key to our mission of reclaiming the libraries for students, not materials. This view of Moody 1 West shows rows of book ranges that held general collection items until the late fall 2020. The shelves were removed over the winter 2021/2021 break. After extensive remodeling work during the 2020 Christmas break, the space was opened for small group use, offering dramatic views of the Baylor campus in a refreshed environment. In early summer 2021, temporary furniture was added to the area in anticipation of permanent fixtures to come. By the start of the Fall 2021 semester, individual study furnishings, a "pavilion" of four small rooms, and upgraded desks were added. Funds for the furnishings and technology infrastructure in this area were provided by the Library Dean's Excellence Fund and generous benefactors like the Schumacher Foundation. The Baylor Libraries extends their thanks to all who gave in support of this transformation project! 2. Moody 304 Active Learning Lab - Supported by the Schumacher Foundation The renovation of the former Seminar 2 space in the Arts & Special Collections Research Center into a state-of-the-art "flipped" classroom was made possible by a generous gift from the Schumacher Foundation. Their investment in technology for the space provided high-resolution monitors, connectivity solutions, and a short-throw projector for a classroom that is flexible, interactive, and modern. 3. Black Gospel Archive & Listening Center The next step in the ongoing evolution of the Black Gospel Music Restoration Project (BGMRP) is located on the Garden Level of Moody Memorial Library, just outside the Riley Digitization Center. Opened on November 12, 2021, the new Black Gospel Archive & Listening Center (BGA) is the physical home of the BGMRP, with archival storage space for thousands of items, a sound booth for private listening and research, and meeting space for scholars to engage with the scholarly resources found in the project. The project was initiated with a lead gift of $50,000 from the Prichard Family Foundation, long-time supporters of the Black Gospel Music Restoration Project. Total project costs will run to $175,00, plus an additional $40,000 in furnishings. The Libraries received $20,000 in gifts toward furnishings and the purchase of the sound isolation booth, with a major gift from the Libraries Board of Advocates leading the way. 4. "Chairs For Bears" Original 1968-era Moody Library chair (left) and "Lyric" chair by Allsteel When Moody Memorial Library opened its doors in 1968, it was considered a prime example of Mid-century Modern architecture, with furnishings and decor to match. Over time, much of the furniture from Moody's early years has been lost due to constant use by hundreds of thousands of Baylor students. Surprisingly, some 300 original chairs can still be found throughout Moody, but as may be expected, their aesthetic and functional value has been greatly reduced over the ensuing 50-plus years. In short: many of the chairs in Moody are old, uncomfortable, and in desperate need of replacement. Over the past five years, the Libraries have made a priority of upgrading the furnishings in Moody to include new tables, lighting, carpet, flooring, and soft seating. As we work toward a goal of providing seating for 15% of our student body within Moody and Jones Libraries, upgrading our existing seating remains a top-level project. A donation to our "Chairs for Bears" project will provide the resources our students deserve:ÃÂ modern, functional, and comfortable new LyricÃÂ chairs from AllsteelÃÂ designed to last for decades to come. Project Progress Thanks to a generous gift of $20,000 from Ken Betterton and another $5,000 from Nancy Newman Logan, we have secured 74 new "Lyric" chairs for the first floor of Moody Memorial Library, completing our project to upgrade the seating on an entire floor of our main campus library! A major gift from Vernon and Charlene Wells of $32,000 will allow us to purchase another 90 chairs toward our goal of replacing 300+ original 1968 chairs! As of February 2022, we've secured the funding to replace all of the remaining chairs on Moody 2! The new pieces will be in place by mid-Spring barring production delays. Now all that remains is 120 chairs on Moody 3! Update! As of March 2022, the necessary funding to replace all chairs in Moody Memorial Library has been secured! Many thanks to all who gave toward this project. Questions? Contact Dean of Libraries Jeffry Archer at jeffry_archer@baylor.edu. Named Spaces There are many spaces throughout the University Libraries named in honor of generous benefactors spanning back to the earliest days of the university. Their legacies and names endure in places like the Joe Allbritton Foyer (Moody Memorial Library), the Prichard Family Information Commons (Moody Memorial Library), the Ray I. Riley Digitization Center (Moody Memorial Library) and the Frances C. Poage Map Room (The Texas Collection). A gift at this level ensures future generations of Baylor students will recognize the enduring legacy of Baylor's proudest supporters. Crucial Resources Baylor's attaining R1-Tier1 status - a designation that represents the highest levels of academic, scholarly, and research output - underscores the need for access to new scholarly resources. From journals dedicated to highly specialized scientific areas to Open Educational Resources (OER), the Libraries are at the crucial junction of expertise, acquisition, and access that undergirds the university's advancing research agenda. Pledge Your Support To give to the Baylor University Libraries, contact Dean Jeffry Archer and discuss how your gift can change the lives of members of Baylor's academic community today.
