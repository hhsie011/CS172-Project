On-campus residents who test positive for COVID-19, or are exposed to someone who tested positive, should inform their live-in residential staff. Residential staff are prepared to discuss available options and guide them through the next steps. Some residents may be able to isolate/quarantine in their own room or apartment, depending on their unique situation and where they live. Residents who are from a location beyond a five-hour drive from College Station might have the option to isolate/quarantine in an alternate location on campus. Each case will be evaluated individually. Contact the Department of Residence Life at 979-862-3158 or visit their website at https://reslife.tamu.edu for more information. On-campus residents are strongly encouraged to be proactive and formulate a plan now for where they will go if they become ill or exposed, even those who are fully vaccinated. Residents who are able to return to their permanent residence to isolate/quarantine are strongly encouraged to do so and save the limited resources for residents who cannot logistically return home to isolate/quarantine.
