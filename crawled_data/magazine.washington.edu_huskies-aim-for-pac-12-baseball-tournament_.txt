The double-elimination tournament will take place over five days at the spring training home of the San Francisco Giants. The top eight teams in the conference standings at the end of the regular season will earn berths in the Pac-12 tournament, and the champion will receive the conference’s automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. This year’s Huskies squad brings high hopes into the 2022 season, thanks in part to a group of new Huskies ranked No. 20 in the country by D1 Baseball. Among those listed by D1 Baseball are true freshmen infielders Cam Clayton of Lake Oswego, Oregon, and AJ Guerrero of Fife. They are expected to contribute early to the Huskies. Talk about dominance: Pac-12 teams have combined to win 29 of the 74 NCAA baseball championships all-time, 15 more than the next closest conference.
