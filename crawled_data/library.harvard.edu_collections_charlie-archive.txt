Charlie Archive Collection The 2015 terrorist attack against the staff of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo provoked a vigorous debate about fundamental political and ethical issues. This archive aims to document the events and ensuing debate. Items left at the site of the Charlie Hebdo attack. Photo by Nicole Mills. 2015. View Details. Charlie Archive Collection Issues that came to the fore following the attacks and are covered in this archive include freedom of expression; the relationship between state, religion and society; respect for other beliefs and perspectives; inequality; and the disenfranchisement of individuals and communities. This archive, curated by Lidia Uziel, Head of Americas, Europe, and Oceania Division and build in collaboration with Harvard librarians, faculty members, and students, contains a wide array of materials and perspectives from individuals with a range of political positions and social backgrounds. Though the events and later protests were concentrated in France, extensive media coverage drew global attention. "Je suis Charlie" ("I am Charlie") or "Je ne suis pas Charlie" ("I am not Charlie") became international expressions of adhesion to or distance from the stance attributed to Charlie Hebdo on religion in general and to Islam in particular. The goal of the archive is to document a moment in the early 21st century when the word “Charlie” took on tragic significance and became charged with conflicting emotions, opinions, and agendas. Accessing These Materials While much of the archive is available online, physical items are also available upon request for use in Widener Library's Phillips Reading Room. Use the collection finding aid and HOLLIS record to locate items. Place requests to view the items via HOLLIS.
