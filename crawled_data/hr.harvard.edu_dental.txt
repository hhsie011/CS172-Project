Coverage includes dentists “in network” in Delta’s Premier and PPO networks; 97% of Massachusetts’ dentists participate. You can also choose to see “out-of-network” dentists, but this may increase your out-of-pocket costs. To see if your dentist is in network, visit www.deltadentalma.com Plan Benefits Dental benefits cover preventive, basic, restorative, major, and orthodontic services. Preventive care is 100% covered. Other services are covered at 25%-50% after deductible (some plan limits apply); for more information please refer to our Dental Plan Overview. You can choose between PPO and Premier network dentists; PPO dentists cost less. Dentists agree to accept Delta’s negotiated rate; you can’t be billed for the difference.
