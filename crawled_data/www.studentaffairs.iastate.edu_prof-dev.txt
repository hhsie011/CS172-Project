Identifying and Confronting White Nationalism on Campus Delivered October 15, 2020 Presented by: Jeremy Best, MAT, Ph.D., Assistant Professor, History Watch the recording of this presentation here: https://iastate.box.com/s/x7meb6f7nm3rm8a1x50bmt3ykuzavk2b White supremacist ideas never really disappeared from America’s campuses and schools, but in the last decade the ideas of white nationalists and other white supremacists have reemerged as a more vocal and dangerous influence. The advocates of these ideologies are deeply immersed in the mythologies and conspiracies of their movement. This situation often puts those who would stand against white nationalism at a disadvantage. Communities committed to fighting white nationalism can be empowered with basic content and strategies to more effectively re-balance the contest. This session will aid in this correction by introducing key vocabulary and concepts of contemporary white nationalists and white supremacists; by giving guidance on identifying the coded and un-coded language and symbology of white nationalist and supremacist ideas; and by presenting best practices for addressing the presence of nationalism and supremacy on campus and in schools. Participants in the session will build content competence and practical confidence by participating in scenarios and brainstorming sessions to address hypothetical and real examples of white nationalism in classroom, campus, and other settings.

Dismantling Inequities by Building Cultural Proficiency through the Tools of Cultural Humility Delivered September 16, 2020 Presented by: Isaiah McGee, Graduate Student, School of Education Watch the recording of this presentation here: https://iastate.box.com/s/05e8nwpaaism7jdi9j43ppx1jhcxyxvj Social justice advocates and allies are largely in agreement that some initial context of interpersonal cultural awareness is necessary for building the capacity to Inclusion. However, equity implementation efforts are largely treated as skill-set approaches that presume only more information around culture is needed, rather than a growth mindset approach that requires transformation about interactions with culture. The debate then shifts towards whether to prioritize and focus on interpersonal work or systems work. This session dives into the heart of this debate by proposing a re-analysis of the popular Cultural Proficiency Framework (Lindsey, Nuri-Robins, Terrell, 2018) and reframes it within the context of Cultural Humility. Participants will examine conditions that disproportionately affect marginalized populations in organizational settings such as schools and colleges and developing a deeper consideration of the foundational elements upon which equity should be based; unpacking a shared sense of belonging and dignity. Participants will also examine five core values behind culture and how a set of inverse factors pull individuals and systems either toward or away a process of cultural humility that leads to improved cultural competence.

Navigating Higher Education During Social And Political Change Delivered February 10, 2020 Creating inclusive communities requires vigilance and attention to the personal experiences students encounter as they interact with peers, university personnel and contend with social and politically charged events occurring within and beyond the university’s borders. Student affairs staff can play a critical role in assisting students to navigate a complex set of dynamics. University colleagues and a panel of senior leaders examined scenarios that have occurred in educational settings across the country and engaged in active problem solving and possible approaches for our campus community. Participants will: 1. Reflect on the complexity of issues around diversity and inclusion and their impact on campus climate. 2. Explore ways campus members can support students with different identities, beliefs, and lived experiences. 3. Examine the decision-making process and engage in collaborative problem solving to address issues related to diversity and inclusion. 4. Explore how policy decisions at an institutional level impact decisions on a local, regional, and national scale.
