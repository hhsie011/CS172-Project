Applicants are required to submit financial documentation that equals or exceeds the cost of attendance for one full academic year. Adjustments in the financial certification cannot be made based on a student’s individual circumstances. This estimate is based upon 15 semester hours each semester for undergraduate studies. The financial guarantee form, as well a bank statement can be submitted by email at international@okstate.edu. Students will not be admitted to Oklahoma State University and a Certificate of Eligibility (I-20) or (DS-2019) will not be issued until this information is provided and verified.
