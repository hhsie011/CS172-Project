Recognizing that you may have limited time and that speed-to-market is critical to success, we have streamlined our process. After graduating from our seven-week pre-accelerator program, you present your idea to a room of experienced *EIRs who then help you prepare a plan to compete for additional funding from the State of Ohio of over $300,000. This funding is designed to support the launch of your company to then attract additional resources and investment that will take your idea to market. *Entrepreneurs-in-Residence (EIRs) are accomplished founders and/or industry experts with a wide range of experience, who are looking to build their next startup by finding exciting opportunities at UC. They serve as experienced guides, helping you form your company, your vision, a go-to-market plan, a roadmap for product development, and a funding plan. 1819 Innovation Hub 2900 Reading Rd Cincinnati, OH 45206 513-556-5511 UC Tools Canopy & Canvas One Stop Email Catalyst Shuttle Tracker IT Help UC VPN Bearcats Landing About Us Maps & Directions Jobs News Diversity Governance & Policies Directory Events Calendar University of Cincinnati | 2600 Clifton Ave. | Cincinnati, OH 45221 | ph: 513-556-6000 Alerts | Clery and HEOA Notice | Notice of Non-Discrimination | eAccessibility Concern | Privacy Statement | Free Speech | Copyright Information © 2020 University of Cincinnati 1819 Innovation Hub 2900 Reading Rd Cincinnati, OH 45206 513-556-5511 © 2020 University of Cincinnati scroll up to the top
