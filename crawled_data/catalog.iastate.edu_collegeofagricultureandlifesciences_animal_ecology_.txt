Overview Degree Requirements Four Year Plan Undergraduate Minor Contact Information John Burnett 114 Science Hall II nrem.iastate.edu jburnett@iastate.edu 515-294-3681 Catalog Home > Undergraduate Majors, Certificates, Minors, Pre-Professional Study > Agriculture and Life Sciences > Animal Ecology Administered by the Department of Natural Resource Ecology and Management The Animal Ecology curriculum provides its majors with an understanding of ecological principles and processes and their applications to natural resource management. This major is oriented toward students desiring a general and flexible program in environmental biology and for those planning graduate study. Graduates find employment as aquaculturists, aquatic ecologists, wildlife biologists, fisheries biologists, resource managers, and ecologists for industry, environmental consulting firms, natural resource and environmental agencies and organizations, zoos, and as educators. Graduates are able to communicate and work effectively in the multidisciplinary arena of ecology and natural resource management. Additionally, they recognize the importance of ethics in their field of study and are sensitive to cultural diversity and broad environmental concerns. Students majoring in Animal Ecology may select from one or more of four options: Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, Interpretation of Natural Resources, Preveterinary and Wildlife Care, or Wildlife. Each option has specific outcomes expectations that include (1) the scope of the specialization and its relationships to broader aspects of animal ecology, biotic resource management, and other allied scientific disciplines and professions, (2) career opportunities and requirements, and (3) knowledge and skills appropriate for employment at technical and practitioner levels in each discipline. All options require three months (400 hours) of relevant work experience or study at a biological station prior to graduation. The latter may be accomplished at the university’s affiliate field stations: Rod and Connie French Conservation Camp in Montana, Iowa Lakeside Laboratory at West Lake Okoboji, and Gulf Coast Research Laboratory at Ocean Springs, Mississippi. Information on these laboratories is available from the Department of Natural Resource Ecology and Management Student Services Center. Preveterinary medicine preparation may be achieved while satisfying degree requirements in animal ecology. Additional education and training can lead to other opportunities in such areas as research and management, natural resources planning and administration, teaching, and environmental consulting, among others. Graduate training is necessary for many specialized positions within the fields of animal ecology. Students preparing for graduate study should consult with their academic advisor concerning appropriate coursework. Students wishing to be certified by the American Fisheries Society or The Wildlife Society need to consult with their advisors in selecting required courses in their respective programs. The formal application then needs to be completed and submitted for review by their professional societies. Certification in either society has many professional benefits and may be required or recommended for employment by federal and state agencies and private industry. Students seeking certification to teach biology in secondary schools must meet requirements of the College of Human Sciences as well as those of the Animal Ecology curriculum. In addition, they must apply formally for admission to the teacher education program (see Teacher Education Program). Students with an interest in careers in outdoor writing are encouraged to obtain a minor or a second major in journalism (see Journalism and Communication, Courses and Programs). Students who wish to pursue a job as a conservation officer may wish to minor in criminal justice (see Criminal Justice). Student Learning Outcomes Upon graduation, students should be able to: 1. Identify, explain and critically evaluate their own beliefs, values and actions in relation to professional and societal standards of ethics. For any given situation, graduates identify, critically evaluate, and state their own beliefs and values as they relate to professional and societal ethical standards, for any given situation. They elaborate on how those values and beliefs impact their actions, and they explain which specific canons or principles of a professional code of ethics are applicable to a particular situation. 2. Anticipate, analyze and evaluate natural resource issues and opportunities, explaining the ecological, economic, and social consequences of natural resource actions at various scales and over time. In the case of existing natural resource issues, graduates explain the ecological, economic, and social consequences that reasonably could be expected to occur as the result of actions taken to address the issue. The explanation includes considerations of the geographic area influenced by the issue as well as the time frame over which the consequences can be expected to occur. In the case of evolving circumstances, graduates predict natural resource issues that may arise as a result of the circumstances and explain the ecological, economic and social consequences of those issues. 3. Actively seek the input and perspectives of diverse stakeholders regarding natural resource problems and issues. Graduates identify the comprehensive list of individuals or groups who may be impacted by particular natural resource problems and issues. They are well versed in techniques for seeking and incorporating input and perspectives from those people, and they incorporate those inputs and perspectives into the decision-making process. 4. Assess, analyze, synthesize, and evaluate information fairly and objectively. Not all information is equally sound or applicable in a particular situation. Graduates evaluate the validity and importance of information obtained from any source. Once evaluated, they use the information appropriately in the solution of natural resource problems. 5. Work effectively, both individually and with others, on complex, value-laden natural resource problems that require holistic problem-solving approaches. Effective solution of natural resource problems often involves input from diverse constituencies with diverse value scales. When working individually, graduates incorporate those values into the solution of problems. Graduates work effectively with diverse individuals and groups to reach consensus on problem solutions. 6. Formulate and evaluate alternative solutions to complex problems and recommend and defend best alternatives. The natural resource base with which we deal is capable of providing numerous goods and services to numerous publics. Graduates formulate multiple alternatives, as well as action plans, to achieve stakeholder objectives. They evaluate each of the feasible alternatives in terms of biological possibility, economic feasibility and social acceptability. They recommend best alternatives based on the stakeholders’ objectives, and they justify their recommendations on the basis of sound science. 7. Communicate clearly and effectively with all audiences using appropriate oral, visual, electronic, and written techniques. Graduates utilize the best form, or forms, of communication for effectively conveying information to, or seeking input from, a particular audience. They are proficient in all forms of communication, and adjust their style or technique of communication to suit different audiences. 8. Recognize and interpret resource problems and opportunities across spatial scales from local to global. Graduates recognize where resource problems and opportunities can or could exist, and they evaluate and interpret these for others. They, evaluate and interpret for individual landowners at a very local scale as well as for problems that span multiple ownerships, regions and ecosystems. 9. Appreciate cultural diversity and understand the impact of the global distribution of people and wealth on natural resource use and valuation. Different cultures, population densities, and income classes value and use natural resources in very different ways. Because natural resources often are used simultaneously by different groups, it is important for graduates to be able to account for those differing uses and valuations when making management decisions about natural resources. 10. Exercise leadership skills as professionals and engaged citizens Graduates organize, facilitate, and participate effectively in groups, teams, or organizations. They define problems or opportunities, implement action planning processes, work toward goals and justify actions taken. 11. Demonstrate creativity and innovation in identifying and pursuing opportunities that produce environmental, social, or economic value. Graduates display creativity in a variety of situations, and identify opportunities to promote understanding of natural resource issues. They demonstrate persistence when working with individuals who have diverse interests in order to build consensus and facilitate accomplishing stated objectives. 12. Exercise life-long learning skills developed before graduation. Graduates articulate why life-long learning is important. Graduates find answers to their questions as they arise throughout life. They are capable of determining what they need to know to effectively deal with an issue or situation, and they know how to obtain the necessary knowledge. They have learned how to learn in the absence of teachers. CURRICULUM IN ANIMAL ECOLOGY Total Degree Requirement: 128 cr.
