Some of the oldest specimens include a Townsend’s Chipmunk collected in 1836, and a series of Red Squirrels collected in 1847. The Outram Bangs Collection, composed of specimens collected primarily from North America between 1890 and 1902, marks the beginning of our modern systematic holdings and consists of over 10,000 specimens with complete data.
