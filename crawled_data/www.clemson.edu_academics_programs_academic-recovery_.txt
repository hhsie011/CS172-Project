This initiative, also known as the academic recovery program, aims to guide students on academic probation in their pursuit of good academic standing by: Facilitating awareness of available resources (staff, programs, and services). Encouraging engagement in these resources throughout the term. Providing opportunities to assess their academic situations with designated departmental advisors. While this initiative is coordinated through the Academic Success Center, Success Matters involves extensive collaboration among academic and student services departments to provide students with targeted and timely consultation as they pursue a Clemson degree. Success Matters advisors conduct outreach to students with cumulative GPR under 2.0. The aim of this targeted outreach is two-fold: To provide individualized opportunities for students to assess their academic situations. To refer students to campus resources relevant to their academic situations and concerns. Enrolled students with less than a 2.0 cumulative GPA are expected to complete the Success Matters online modules no later than the first day of classes. Access to these modules will be provided 3-4 weeks in advance of each semester. Questions about Success Matters may be directed to Jessica Owens at: dean4@clemson.edu.
