The scholarship fund will be used exclusively to reward academic achievement and provide need-based financial assistance to students from the MENAT. This is an excellent way for Syracuse University alumni and friends from the Middle East, North Africa and Turkey to have an immediate, local impact with their giving — while helping Syracuse University attract the most promising future leaders from the MENAT region! Alumni, current students, and parents are invited to support today’s undergraduate students from the MENAT. A gift can be made online to the MENAT Regional Council Scholarship Fund or send us an email to learn more.
