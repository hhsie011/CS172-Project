He will be assisting by organizing events, hosting competitions, and helping with the Gaudy Boy press. 2021 Mia Xing (CC’23) was awarded the summer intern fellowship with Restless Books, an independent publisher that addresses how the movement of literature connects to the mobilities of people in the US and around the world. By publishing linguistically and thematically diverse books and bringing them to various communities and into the carceral system, Restless Books makes space for foreign and immigrant voices and strengthens the American democracy. Mia’s role as an intern will include reading and providing critical evaluations of manuscripts in English and original languages (French, Mandarin, Spanish, and Japanese) for publication consideration; translating interviews and other promotional material; and liaising with public libraries to organize free, public writing workshops. She will be using her translation and literary skills to diversify voices and strengthen communities. 2020 Nora Kushner Salitan (CC’21) was awarded the summer intern fellowship for her service as a research assistant at The Global Health Justice and Governance Program (GHJG), a university-wide initiative housed at the Heilbrunn Department of Population and Family Health at Columbia University. There she assists in an ongoing, multi-country study of donor-funded programming on sexual and gender-based violence (GBV) that seeks to answer why these programs have not produced greater results and to identify good emerging practices. The research evidence will generate policy recommendations regarding how to implement essential GBV services within emergency preparedness and future epidemics; recommend funding strategies to ensure critical funding in these under-funded areas does not further diminish in crises; and identify and promote funding practices that reinforce effective GBV responses during emergency responses. 2019 Alondra Aguilar (CC’21) worked with GlobeMed’s GROW internship in partnership with Gulu Women’s Economic Development and Globalization (GWED-G). GlobeMed is a national organization that aims to find grass root health organizations throughout the world to partner with and support through fundraising, education, and awareness. The Columbia University chapter of GlobeMed is partnered with GWED-G in Gulu, Uganda, which was founded by women in the community to combat the immense cultural, economic, social and health effects of the war in Northern Uganda. 2018 (Inaugural Year) Daniella Apodaca (CC’20) received the first Catherine Medalia Johannet summer intern fellowship for her work with the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center (NMILC). NMILC works directly to address social inequality and injustice issues by providing legal services, advocacy, and education for low-income immigrants at risk of deportation. As an intern, one of her primary duties involved providing support at the Cibola County Detention Center, which houses the greatest percentage of asylum seekers of any detention center in the US and is the only one to hold transgender immigrants. The primary communicator to French-speaking individuals, she provided critical legal information to French and Spanish-speaking immigrants and asylum-seekers through presentations, individual consultations, weekly workshops, and also helped clients fill out citizenship applications, renew residency cards, and renew their DACA.
