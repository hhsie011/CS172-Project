Basic science research in pathobiology addresses how a sequence of biologic events leads to a disease state. Translational and clinical research bridges basic mechanistic research to advances in clinical diagnosis and treatment of human disease. Diagnostic testing in pathology and laboratory medicine at Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University is performed at our hospital affiliates; a total of 90 faculty are located at Brown University, Rhode Island Hospital, The Miriam Hospital, Women & Infants' Hospital, Memorial Hospital of Rhode Island, and the Office of the Medical Examiner at the Rhode Island Department of Health. All campus and hospital-based faculty participate in teaching and advising undergraduates, graduate students, medical students, residents, and postdoctoral and clinical fellows. These trainees work together in multidisciplinary teams involving pathologists, biomedical scientists, clinicians, chemists, and engineers on basic and applied research projects related to human disease.
