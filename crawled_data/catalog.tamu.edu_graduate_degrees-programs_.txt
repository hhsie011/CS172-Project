Please review them here. The delivery platform differs among these programs. Most are available 100% online, some are web-supported with interactive video and others require periodic campus visits. The delivery platform in most programs changes depending on the course/program content, needs of the students and their geographic locations. Students should carefully consider distance education and address any specific questions to the department offering the program of interest. Only a student who is admitted to Texas A&M University may enroll in these distance education programs and the associated courses. A student wishing to enroll in any of the distance education programs must be admitted as a degree-seeking graduate student or as a post-baccalaureate non-degree seeking student. Please see http://admissions.tamu.edu for graduate admissions information. A student may take up to 12 hours in non-degree-seeking post-baccalaureate status and apply these hours to a master’s program with the approval of the student’s advisory committee, the head of the department (or Chair of the Intercollegiate Faculty, if appropriate), and the Office of Graduate and Professional Studies if all admission requirements to the selected master’s program are fulfilled. Courses offered for extension credit may not be used on the student’s degree plan. Post-baccalaureate non-degree status does not establish eligibility for admission to degree-seeking status. Students who are not enrolled in an approved distance education program cannot take more than 50% of their required courses online. The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB) rules that no more than 50% of courses can be taken online if the program is not approved to be offered online as a distance education program. Texas A&M University provides students pursuing a graduate degree by distance a wide variety of student support services, including access to library resources, advising, technology support and course materials acquisition through the online bookstore. A complete listing of services, degree program descriptions, appropriate points of contact within each program, and costs are available through the distance education website at http://distance.tamu.edu. Additional distance education programs are in development. Interested students should check the website periodically for updates. Students should contact the department offering the program for any questions. State Authorization State authorization allows Texas A&M University to offer educational opportunities to students among other states and nationwide. National Council for State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements (NC-SARA) Texas was approved as a SARA state in 2015, and is administered by the Southern Regional Education Board (SREB.) "The State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement is a voluntary agreement among its member states and U.S. territories that establishes comparable national standards for interstate offering of postsecondary distance-education courses and programs. It is intended to make it easier for students to take online courses offered by postsecondary institutions based in another state." -NC-SARA Combined Masters Programs Texas A&M University currently offers the following combined master’s programs: Master of Architecture in Architecture and Master of Urban Planning Combined Degree Program Master of Business Administration in Business Administration and Master of Science in Analytics Combined Degree Program Master of Land and Property Development and Master of Architecture Combined Degree Program Master of Land and Property Development and Master of Real Estate Combined Degree Program Master of Land and Property Development and Master of Science in Construction Management Combined Degree Program Master of Land and Property Development and Master of Urban Planning Combined Degree Program Master of International Affairs and Master of Public Health (HPCH) Combined Degree Program Master of International Affairs and Master of Public Health (PHPM) Combined Degree Program Master of Science in Architecture and Master of Architecture in Architecture Combined Degree Program Master of Science in Economics and Master of International Affairs Combined Degree Program Master of Science in Nutrition and Master of Science in Kinesiology Combined Degree Program The combined master’s program represents two master’s degrees pursued and awarded simultaneously. Combined degree programs may allow a shorter time for completion due to the “double-counting” of some coursework. Where this is the case, programs must explain how the quality and integrity of each degree involved is maintained. The minimum number of unduplicated combined credit hours should be 60 credit hours, 30 credit hours for each program. In exceptional cases, however, the total unduplicated combined credit hours may be less than 60. In such a case, the programs must (a) identify the specific courses that will count toward both degrees, and (b) offer a compelling, academic rationale as to why each course is applicable to the content area of each program. Combined master’s programs must be approved as defined by the University Curricular Processes. Students should declare their intentions to enroll in combined master’s programs at the time of application to their graduate studies or early in their education process. This will ensure the maximum benefit from a combined master’s program. Combination Programs Combination programs represent two degrees of different academic levels that are pursued and awarded simultaneously. Combination programs may allow a shorter time for completion due to the “double-counting” of some coursework. Even though the programs are combined, students must satisfy the required hours of both programs. See the specific program for more details.
