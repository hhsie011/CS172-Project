Whether you volunteer locally or internationally, paid or unpaid, engaging in service and advocacy work can have several benefits for you as a professional. Explore your interests If you're exploring potential careers, engaging in service opportunities can help you gain hands-on experience and see firsthand what working in a particular field or setting might be like. Get experience Employers want to hire individuals with employable skills and hands-on experience; service programs can help you develop these skills and gain valuable experience. As you search for service opportunities that interest you, think about what you would like to gain from your service to help guide your decision. Not finding opportunities that fit the skills and experiences you want to develop? Consider speaking with the volunteer coordinators of programs in which you are interested; they may be willing to allow you to take on different responsibilities. Network When engaging in service opportunities, take time to develop meaningful relationships with others. You never know who might give you a lead to your dream internship or job in the future. Share your career interests with program administrators, supervisors, and fellow volunteers. Let them know what you're looking for and ask for advice and referrals that may help you.
