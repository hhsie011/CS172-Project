UTRA funding has supported undergraduate fieldwork in Petra, Montserrat, and Greece, for example, for fieldwork sponsored by the Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World faculty members. Brown University's BrownConnect LINK Award Program offers students another way of supporting summer research, by providing financial assistance to students pursuing unpaid or low-paying summer internships. These awards allow students to explore career options and engage in experiential learning activities outside of the classroom. For general information on undergraduate research at Brown, visit the website of the Dean of the College. Independent study projects are also possible, either working with members of the Joukowsky Institute or with other Brown faculty and resources. In recent years, undergraduates have also volunteered with both the conservation department and the curator of ancient art at the Rhode Island School of Design Museum, students have helped design and install exhibits at Brown University's Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology, and undergraduates have become increasingly involved with the Think Like an Archaeologist program -- as just a few examples of possible research opportunities. Students interested in gaining this kind of original research experience should begin to explore their options, and to talk to faculty, as soon as possible. Students can enroll in ARCH 1970 (Individual Study Project) to facilitate this work during the Fall or Spring semesters, or can apply for funding from the UTRA Program for either academic year or summer support. Undertaking an independent study project, doing summer fieldwork, or participating in the UTRA program may help to shape students' senior thesis research, or provide glimpses into options after graduation.
