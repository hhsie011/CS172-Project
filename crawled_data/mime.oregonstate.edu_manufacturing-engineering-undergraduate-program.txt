The majority of MfgE students participate in MECOP, which involves two six-month structured internships that become an integral part of their educational process. Also, because the Manufacturing Engineering program is closely aligned with our Industrial Engineering (IE) and Mechanical Engineering (ME) programs, many of our students elect to pursue dual majors in either MfgE & IE or MfgE & ME. For more information about manufacturing engineering and the MfgE undergraduate program at Oregon State, consult these links: What Do Manufacturing Engineers Do? MfgE Program Description You can access other academic tools and resources for MIME undergraduates by using the "Academics-Related Links" sidebar at right and the My MIME page.
