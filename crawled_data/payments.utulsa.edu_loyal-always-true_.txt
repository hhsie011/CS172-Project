Skip to main content University of Tulsa Logo Payments for The University of Tulsa Loyal Always True Originally established as a needs based fund, Loyal Always True was created to help offset the rising costs for Tulsa Athletics due to COVID-19. As we move forward this fund will serve as an enhancement fund for the TU Athletic department. Gifts made to the Loyal Always True fund will go towards supporting unexpected sport program needs. Some examples of this are one off equipment, travel accommodations, or special projects like locker room renovations/modifications. This fund will also go towards supporting the TU Athletic priorities which are established yearly by Rick Dickson and the TU leadership team. Thank you to all our supporters that are considering a gift to the Loyal Always True Fund. Your continued support is critical to providing a first-class experience for our student-athletes. 800 S.
