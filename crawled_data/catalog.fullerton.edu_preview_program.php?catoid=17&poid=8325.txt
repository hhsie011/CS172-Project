Print Degree Planner (opens a new window) | Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Facebook this Page (opens a new window) Tweet this Page (opens a new window) (30 UNITS) The Master of Science degree in Computer Engineering provides students with an in-depth knowledge in theory and a strong platform in practical applications in the hardware and software aspects of computer-based systems, and integrating both into usable computer systems. The degree prepares students for leadership roles in careers with industry, government and educational institutions. It integrates pertinent science and mathematics courses with engineering courses in order to develop engineers capable of designing and analyzing all aspects of modern computer and embedded systems. Admission Requirements Students must meet the CSU requirements for admission to a master’s degree program. Please consult the Graduate Admissions section in this catalog for complete information. In addition, to qualify for admission with conditionally classified standing, applicants must meet the following departmental requirements: Minimum GPA of 2.5 for applicants graduated from domestic (U.S.) institutions with undergraduate degrees in engineering or computer science Minimum GPA of 2.5 for applicants graduated from ABET-accredited international institutions with undergraduate degrees in engineering or computer science Minimum GPA of 3.0 for applicants graduated from domestic (U.S.) institutions with undergraduate degrees other than engineering or computer science Minimum GPA of 3.0 for applicants with undergraduate degrees from non-ABET accredited international institutions In addition, for international students from countries where English is not the official language, a minimum TOEFL score of 550 on the paper-based version or 80 on the Internet-based version is required. A minimum International English Language Testing System (IELTS) score of 6.5 is acceptable. Classified Standing The following are required for classified standing status: Approval of a formal study plan by the computer engineering program coordinator and Office of Graduate Studies. Students enrolled in the program must meet with an adviser prior to completing 13 units toward the M.S. degree to develop a study plan. The study plan must be approved by the program coordinator and Office of Graduate Studies Satisfactory completion of no more than 13 units on the study plan Fulfillment of the University Writing Requirement Competency in written communication in English must be demonstrated by a passing score on the California State University Examination in Writing Proficiency (EWP) exam. The requirement must be satisfied before the student can be classified. Students who fail to pass the EWP test may complete ENGL 301 or ENGL 360 with a “C” (2.0) or better as an alternative to the EWP requirement. Study Plan Students must complete all requirements for the degree with an overall minimum GPA of 3.0. The requirements include 18 units of required core courses and 12 units of elective courses.
