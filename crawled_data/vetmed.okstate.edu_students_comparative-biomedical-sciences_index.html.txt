Our goals for the future include continued development of a nationally renowned program of animal health and biomedical research. Building upon the foundation of an outstanding training program in veterinary medicine, we see extraordinary opportunities for growth and for a greater contribution to the quality of life in many parts of the world. Human and animal health can be enhanced through biomedical research utilizing the tools of comparative medicine, comparative and functional genomics, and other modern approaches to disease pathogenesis. Working with the livestock and poultry industries, we strive to increase the numbers and improve the health and productivity of food animals to help meet the nutritional requirements of the six billion or more people who inhabit the earth. As society has become increasingly sensitive and demanding about the quality of our foods and increasingly intolerant of potentially dangerous food additives, and of poisons that contaminate the environment, veterinary and biomedical research have come to assume greater responsibility and greater leadership in preventive medicine and public health. Apply Now Who We Are The College of Veterinary Medicine’s Comparative Biomedical Sciences (CBSC) graduate program offers MS and Ph.D. students paths to careers in animal and human health through research in focus areas of: Clinical Sciences Infectious Diseases/Parasitology Physiology Stem Cell Biology Toxicology/Pharmacology Sixty faculty participate as teachers and mentors for 30 to 40 students in the program, which is recognized for excellence in training students in biomedical sciences by the National Research Council study of doctoral programs.
