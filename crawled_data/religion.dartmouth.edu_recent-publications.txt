For that conference, Karen Lebacqz and Stephen R. Palmquist delivered papers examining my writings in the areas of bioethics and philosophy of religion. Karen Lebacqz's paper, entitled "On Hope and Hard Choices: Ronald M. Green and Bioethics" now appears in the December issue of The Journal of Religious Ethics [Vol. 44, no. 4, (2016), pp. 722-737], where it is followed by the published version of Stephen R. Palmquist's paper, entitled, "The Paradox of Inwardness in Kant and Kierkegaard: Ronald Green’s Legacy in Philosophy of Religion" [The Journal of Religious Ethics [Vol. 44, no. 4, (2016), pp. 738-751]. My own "Response to Karen Lebacqz and Stephen Palmquist," delivered at the conference, follows their papers in the journal [The Journal of Religious Ethics [Vol. 44, no. 4, (2016), pp. 752-759].
