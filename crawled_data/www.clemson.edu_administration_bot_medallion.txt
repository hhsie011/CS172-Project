Nominations are solicited in odd years and recognition events are hosted in even years. Eligibility The Clemson Medallion shall be bestowed only to living individuals. This award is reserved principally for nominees who graduated from Clemson University and others who have cultivated a meaningful relationship with Clemson University. Selection Process No later than November 30 of years ending with odd-numbers, the Selection Committee will recommend to the Chair of the Board no more than two (2) candidates they believe meet the high standards to receive the Clemson Medallion. As soon as possible thereafter, the Chair of the Board will review those candidates with the President of Clemson University and affirm the recommended candidate(s).
