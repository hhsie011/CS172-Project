The International Office at the University of Copenhagen will assist students in obtaining this permit. Application for a permit must be made at least two months prior to the student’s departure for Denmark. In fact, students accepted to the program should begin immediately to arrange for their visas. You will be required to submit your U.S. passport to the Danish authorities as part of the visa application process, so if you wait until the last minute to apply for a visa you run the risk of having neither a visa nor a passport when it is time for you to go to Copenhagen! Please note that in the past students who have failed to get a student visa have been denied access to the libraries and experienced other difficulties. For more information about obtaining a student resident permit, contact any Danish consulate in the United States, such as the Royal Danish Consulate General in New York (tel. 212-223-4545 ext. 5) or see their web site at http://usa.um.dk.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Sociology Undergraduate Overview Majors Minors Honors The Thesis Proposal Past Honors Theses Courses Course Schedule by Term First Year Seminars Introductory Courses Methods Theory Lower Division Upper Division Culminating Experience Prizes & Awards Research Awards Transfer Credit Careers Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story What is Sociology?
