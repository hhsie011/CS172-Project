Once the new position has been approved by the Provost's office, please complete the following steps: 1. Establish a search committee. 2. Establish search in Interfolio (please contact your college/school business officer if you have questions regarding Interfolio). 3. Pursue all possible means to identify and invite promising candidates to apply. This will be summarized in your submission of finalists to the Provost's office, and should not just confirm that appropriate channels have been followed, but also demonstrate that effort has been exerted to maximize the ability to locate candidates who are professionally excellent, mission-supportive, and diverse. 4. Attend one of the Faculty Search Seminars sessions hosted by the Provost's office (have the search chair, any or all search committee members, business officer, and the dean attend) on faculty hiring procedures. 5. Distribute the Office of General Counsel's Faculty Search Committees Guide to all faculty who may participate in interviewing/hosting candidates. 6. Use the pre-approved external advertising template. 7. Keep copies of all faculty position ads, and maintain a list of any URLs used during the search process. This is particularly important when a foreign national is hired because the ads may be used to aid the new hire in obtaining a green card. 8. Interfolio will secure and maintain appropriate affirmative-action information. Refer to this document for Publications and Organizations for Job Postings. Baylor University has an institutional membership with several organizations, some of which have no-cost job board announcements. Please refer to each of the following User Guides for processes and instructions when using Interfolio for hiring faculty: Interfolio Hiring Process Instructions - Creating a Position Requisition; Interfolio Hiring Process Instructions - Submitting an applicant for approval to hire; Interfolio Hiring Process Instructions - Assigning or Changing a status Office of the Provost Pat Neff Hall, Suite 109 1329 S. 7th Street Waco, Texas One Bear Place #97014 Waco, Texas 76798 (254) 710-3601 Office of the Provost Policies & Guidelines Administrative Resources Hiring Faculty Hiring Process for Faculty About Back Office Directory Academic Affairs Organizational Chart Academic Calendar Academic Units Deadlines Academic Search Index News Faculty Back Prospective Faculty Current Faculty Back Baylor Commencement Departmental Resources: Tenure & Promotion Faculty Awards Back Outstanding Faculty Research Leave Awards Teaching Awards Faculty Development Faculty Meetings Faculty Retirement Planning Program Faculty Updates and New Information Recommended Syllabus Statements Past Faculty Back Emeritus Faculty Recent Retirees Retiree Benefits Retiree Resources Faculty Handbook Back Faculty Handbook History Faculty Classifications Back Academic Professionals Clinical Faculty Lecturer Faculty Retired Faculty Back Emeritus Faculty Tenure-track/Tenured Faculty Faculty Responsibilities Back Academic Freedom Community Life Personal Conduct Research Responsibilities Teaching and Related Responsibilities Back Academic Appeals Academic Support for Students Accommodating Students with Disabilities Add/Drop a Course Attendance Policy Classroom Conduct Career Counseling Class Roll Instructions Delayed Examinations FERPA/Handling Student Records Final Exam Policy Grading Policies Harm to Self or Others Honor Code Honor Code Reporting Form Library Questions Mental Health Counseling Resources Office Hours Office of Spiritual Life Paul L.
