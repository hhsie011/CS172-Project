Like other engineering fields, industrial engineering is concerned with solving problems through the application of specialized knowledge in mathematics and science, as well as the principles of engineering. Two major distinctions of our discipline, among the engineering disciplines, is the unique focus of industrial and systems engineering on human factors and the quantification and systematic removal of uncertainty from production systems. Industrial and systems engineering has five major focus areas: advanced manufacturing, operations research, data sciences and machine learning, health and human systems, and systems engineering. An important characteristic of industrial and systems engineering is its systems approach to integrate the basic resources of production and service systems and other relevant resources, such as information and energy, in such a way as to create a smooth, efficient and competitive operation within an enterprise. Industrial and systems engineers are needed in virtually all types of enterprises, ranging from industries such as manufacturing, distribution, logistics, transportation, and construction; service sectors such as health care, telecommunications, retail, banking, and engineering consulting to government agencies, military, and non-profit organizations. The mission of the Wm Michael Barnes ’64 Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering is to serve the state, nation, and global community by educating industrial engineering students to be well founded in engineering fundamentals and to have the knowledge and skills required to design, develop, improve, implement and control sophisticated production and service systems in an environment characterized by complex technical and social challenges. Throughout this educational process, students will be instilled with the highest standards of professional and ethical behavior. It is the intent of the undergraduate industrial engineering program to equip its graduates to achieve the following accomplishments a few years after graduation: Graduates are successful in advancing the practice of industrial engineering. Graduates are providing leadership in their respective organizations exemplifying ethical standards and practices. Graduates are actively engaged in lifelong learning through professional development. The undergraduate program in Industrial Engineering at Texas A&M University is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, www.abet.org. Industrial and systems engineering students may participate in one of two accelerated programs: the Accelerated Bachelor of Science and Master of Public Health or the Accelerated Bachelor of Science and Master of Science in Finance. Students who successfully complete either of these programs graduate with both degrees in just five years. The department also has a combination program for academically qualified students who want to take selected graduate courses in industrial and systems engineering and receive both graduate and undergraduate credit by meeting specific requirements. Students may also participate in the Undergraduate Minor Program offered by Texas A&M University. This program is usually comprised of 15 to 18 hours, some of which may be substituted as technical electives. The most common minors are math, business and engineering project management. The department encourages students to participate in industrial internships or the Cooperative Education Program to acquire practical experience to complement their industrial engineering education. Internships are generally encouraged during the summer months only. Students who participate in the Co-op program during three academic semesters may count the three credit hours as a technical elective in their curriculum. Graduate degrees including the Master of Science (MS), Master of Engineering (MEng), and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) are also offered by the department in addition to the Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering and the two accelerated programs. For graduate degree information, please see the Texas A&M University Graduate Catalog. Before commencing course work in the major, students must be admitted to the major or have the approval of the department.
