Whiterspoon The Department of Mathematics offers graduate studies leading to the MS and PhD degrees in mathematics. Many of the course offerings are also suitable for graduate students pursuing degrees in engineering, science, geosciences, business, economics, finance, and education. At the MS level, a student can be enrolled either in the campus program or in the distance (online program). For the distance MS program, two tracks are available: computational math and math teaching. For the campus MS program, five tracks are available: traditional (generally, preparation to continue with a PhD), math teaching, computational math, industrial math, and math biology. Students in the campus MS program can pursue either a thesis or a non-thesis degree. Admission to the Department’s graduate programs is decided by the Graduate Programs Committee. The GRE General Test, undergraduate and graduate GPR, undergraduate academic background and achievement, letters of recommendation, and GRE Subject Test in Mathematics (for the PhD program) are among the factors considered in admission decisions. Detailed information concerning programs, the application process, and financial assistance may be obtained on the website https://www.math.tamu.edu/graduate/ or by writing the Graduate Programs Office, Department of Mathematics.
