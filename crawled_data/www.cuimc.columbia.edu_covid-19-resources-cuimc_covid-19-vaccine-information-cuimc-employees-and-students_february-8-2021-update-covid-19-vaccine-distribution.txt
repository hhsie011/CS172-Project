Below is a Question of the Day that relates to topics raised in recent Town Halls: I tested positive for COVID shortly after receiving my first dose of the vaccine. Should I still get the second dose? If so, when? If you develop a COVID-19 infection after your first vaccine dose, data from clinical trials show that the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are SAFE in people who had past COVID-19 infection. CDC recommends that people who currently have COVID-19 infection wait to be vaccinated UNTIL they meet criteria to discontinue isolation. Upon meeting the criteria to return to work and clearance by the WH&S hotline, you may receive the second dose of the vaccine. Generally, isolation can be discontinued when 1) at least 10 days have passed since the onset of symptoms or a positive test if a person has been asymptomatic; 2) has not had a fever in the last 24 hours without taking fever-reducing medications such as aspirin or acetaminophen; and 3) symptoms are markedly improved. If you are unable to receive the second dose on the originally scheduled date, it should be given as close as possible to the original date of the appointment. To reschedule, you may do so through Connect. If you are not currently registered, you may do so here: https://www.myConnectNYC.org/newuser/. You should be able to reschedule four days after the second dose appointment is missed. Thank you and stay safe!
