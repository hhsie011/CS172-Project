However, ICAP’s efforts with the Ministry of Health to establish crisis-responsive patient flows, contingency plans, flexible supply chains, and relationships with laboratories outside the country have made it possible for health facilities to sustain their level of care and connection for people living with HIV even through periods of increased unrest.

Project Details ICAP partnered with the MOH to provide technical assistance to scale-up comprehensive, family-focused HIV care and treatment programs and increase access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) for adults and children. This project built on ICAP’s previous work and aims to expand: a strong continuum of care for people living with HIV; the use of data to inform evidence-based programs; and the development of new health systems, policies, and tools for use at national and facility level. (funded by PEPFAR through the CDC) Technical Assistance for HIV Prevention, Care, and Treatment (2012 - 2015) Project Details ICAP provided technical assistance to the MOH at the national and state level to strenghten HIV program management and implementation, including standardizing the HIV package of care and using Project Details ICAP provided technical assistance to the MOH at the national and state level to strenghten HIV program management and implementation, including standardizing the HIV package of care and using strategic information for evidence-based decision-making. ICAP supported: a nationwide assessment of all ART sites; the development and update of national guidelines, policies, and tools; health care worker trainings in HIV and TB/HIV management; and worked with state health care worker trainings in HIV and TB/HIV management; and worked with state health authorities to support clinical supervision and TA to sites providing ART. (funded by PEPFAR through the CDC) UTAP-2 Project Details In September 2002, the Mailman School of Public Health (MSPH) at Columbia University (CU) entered into a Cooperative Agreement with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for the University Technical Project Details In September 2002, the Mailman School of Public Health (MSPH) at Columbia University (CU) entered into a Cooperative Agreement with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for the University Technical Assistance Projects (UTAP) in Support of the Global HIV/AIDS Program. Situated within ICAP, UTAP was originally envisioned as a single-country program for the provision of technical assistance, but rapidly grew to include long-term and short-term technical and administrative assistance to the national responses to HIV/AIDS in five countries: Mozambique, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, and Zambia. As the original UTAP project drew to a close and PEPFAR moved into its second phase—focused on sustainability—ICAP entered into several, follow-on Cooperative Agreements, called UTAP-2. Four were country-focused (in Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Swaziland, and Tanzania) and the fifth—UTAP-2 Atlanta—became a flexible mechanism for providing a wide range of technical assistance and other support to PEPFAR countries. After beginning in 2009 as a means to help CDC conduct surveillance training more efficiently through distance education, UTAP-2 Atlanta grew over the next six and a half years to comprise 11 distinct projects addressing needs and gaps in the HIV response and answering important research questions to inform the response going forward.
