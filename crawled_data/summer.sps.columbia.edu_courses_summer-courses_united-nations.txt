What is the UN track record in promoting and protecting human rights? This intense six-week course will examine the UN human rights standards, mechanisms, institutions and procedures established over the past sixty years and question their effectiveness. With a particular focus on the actions (or lack thereof) of the UN Security Council, the UN Human Rights Council and diverse international judicial institutions like the International Tribunal for Rwanda and the International Criminal Court, the course will illustrate, through practical case studies, the inherent challenges associated with the protection of human dignity, the enforcement of human rights and the fight against impunity.

Peacebuilding is complex and multi-faceted encompassing security, sustainable development, human rights, reconciliation of past differences, and, ultimately, societal transformation. It is above all else an inherently political process. This course examines the evolution in thinking and approaches to peacebuilding and how it has been put into practice by the United Nations, at both the Headquarters and country levels. We will look at the many stakeholders, the need for partnerships and the challenge of coordination, as well as the tools used by the UN in its support to peacebuilding. We will also extract lessons learned and the conditions for peacebuilding to succeed, with special attention to the UN’s work in supporting peacebuilding at the country level.

The United Nations recently passed its seventieth anniversary and a new Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, was selected by the Security Council to succeed Ban Ki-moon. At this critical juncture, the international system is being challenged to provide adequate responses to the rise of violent extremist groups, waves of refugees arriving in Europe, and to --â€ fewer but deadlier --armed conflicts. As prevention continues to be elusive and recent - mostly intrastate --armed conflicts have proven to be particularly resistant to peaceful settlement whether through mediation, the deployment of peace operations or peacebuilding projects, the question of the relevance of the UN is posed yet again. Has the Security Council been successful in using the tools at its disposal, from prevention to peace operations and enforcement measures? What has become of the Responsibility to Protect? Is a divided Security Council facing a crisis of relevance? What does it mean for peace operations sent where there is no peace to keep? What are the persisting obstacles to effective prevention? What are the lessons from the evolving partnership with regional organizations? How can peace be sustained over the long term? What will have been Ban Ki Moon's legacy? What are the prospects for UN reform and what could it look like? To address these questions and more, the course will examine the evolving role of the world organization in global security, shaped by its member states with different strategic interests and by the broader geopolitical context in which it operates.

This six week course provides an overview of the contribution the United Nations development system has made in the sphere of development. The course traces the historical evolution of the UN's contribution in the areas of development cooperation, poverty reduction, environment and climate, human rights, gender and humanitarian action. It explores the emerging role of non-state actors, in particular the private sector and civil society. The last sessions will examine in detail the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals and Agenda 2030 and the recognition that to be relevant in today's rapidly changing world, the UN must commit itself to major reform. The course will draw extensively from the practical experience of the instructor.

The seminar consists of three parts: Historical Background, Thematic and Political Issues and Conclusions. It provides historical perspectives on the development of today's Ukraine, analyses the evolution of its politics since Independence, and its quest for Euro-Atlantic Integration. While providing an assessment of political, social and economic transformations, the course examines major causes of Euromaidan and the Revolution of Dignity. The current political situation in the country and the current war with Russia will be thoroughly investigated. The top priority of Ukraine's foreign policy is to ensure international support for its efforts to rebuff Russia’s full-fledged aggression and to restore its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Can diplomacy still play a role? What is to be done to solve the existing internal problems? What is to be done to restore the country? Can Ukraine’s President, its government and Parliament solve all these problems? Is there a future for the UN peacekeeping operation in Ukraine? These and other issues, including international assistance to Ukraine, behind-the-scenes activities, power struggles and diplomatic endeavors are analyzed in the course. The course delivers first-hand Insight by a career diplomat who has been actively involved in the implementation of Ukraine's foreign policy and closely connected with the upper echelons of the country's political establishment.
