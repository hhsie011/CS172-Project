For the undergraduate curriculum in Software Engineering leading to the degree Bachelor of Science. The Software Engineering Program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org. A software engineer uses their expertise to design, develop, and evaluate software, configure and install computer systems, and build and maintain software systems throughout their lifecycle. Specific tasks software engineers perform evolve quickly, reflecting changes in technology, as well as the needs of employers. Software engineers work as members of teams that may include experts in engineering, marketing, manufacturing, accounting, training, and design. The Software Engineering Program provides undergraduate students with the opportunity to learn Software Engineering fundamentals, to study applications of state-of-the art software technologies, and to prepare for the practice of Software Engineering. The student-faculty interaction necessary to realize this opportunity occurs within an environment motivated by the principle that excellence in undergraduate education is enhanced by an integrated commitment to successful, long-term research, and outreach programs. Student learning outcomes Graduates of the Software Engineering curriculum should have, at the time of graduation: an ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics an ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences an ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions an ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies. PROGRAM EDUCATIONAL Objectives Within five years of graduation, the graduates should: 1. attain a productive career in Software Engineering or related fields; 2. attain leadership roles and become effective collaborators to advance professional and organizational goals; 3. engage in lifelong learning and professional development; 4. encourage and support diversity and inclusiveness in their workplace. We expect that these objectives will be manifested in our graduates through the following five key attributes: (a) peer-recognized expertise, (b) engagement in professional practice, (c) sustained learning, (d) leadership and (e) teamwork. Demonstration of expertise involves applying state-of-the-art practices for solving problems in the design, development, validation, evolution and sustainment of (software) products. Demonstration of professional engagement involves contributing locally and globally to the use of ethical, competent, and creative practices in industry, academia or the public sector. Demonstration of sustained learning involves the ability to adapt to rapid technological, environmental, and organizational changes through self-study and group study and through opportunities of professional development or graduate study. Demonstration of leadership involves the ability to take initiative, and to facilitate the advancements of individuals and the community by influencing others and by having a widespread, positive impact on critical issues and projects. Finally, demonstration of teamwork involves the ability to work with collaborators who have varied expertise, and with diverse cultural and interdisciplinary backgrounds. As a complement to the instructional activity, the College of Engineering and the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences provide opportunities for each student to have experience with broadening activities. Students have the opportunity to gain practical industry experience in the cooperative education and internship program. Students have the opportunity to participate in advanced research activities. Through international exchange programs, students learn about engineering practices in other parts of the world.
