Home / Tulane Doctors / Tulane Institute of Sports Medicine (TISM) Tulane Institute of Sports Medicine A strong sports medicine program is vital to keeping athletes safe, fit, and at the top of their game — and it’s critical to preserving their future health and well-being. At the Tulane Institute of Sports Medicine, taking care of athletes is what we do. We know it takes a team, so our physicians, athletic trainers, physical therapists and other professionals work together to get you back in the game as safely and quickly as possible. We also offer education and support for athletes and coaches at all levels. And we work with parents to help them take the best care of their young athletes. Our Doctors Felix 'Buddy' H.
