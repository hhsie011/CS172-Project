This goal, which is in alignment with those set forth in Brown’s strategic plan: Building on Distinction A New Plan for Brown (2013), will introduce a new building to campus that offers a unique residential and academic experience and will be a model for learning and engagement. The Wellness Center will bring together physical health services, mental and emotional health services, and wellness education and programming—functions currently spread out across the Brown campus—into one location. The Wellness Center and new Residence Hall will be co‑located, creating an environment for students who are committed to developing and sustaining healthy lifestyles, wish to study holistic global approaches to wellness, and want to live with like‑minded students. This will be the first new building in the housing portfolio in 30 years, and a prototype implementation of the vision and principles underlying the Undergraduate Housing Master Plan update (2018). The building will be located at 450 Brook Street, it will be 96,000 GSF in size and designed to achieve a minimum, LEED silver status.
