During these unprecedented times, the Penn Libraries remains agile and responsive, bolstering the University’s mission of teaching, research and learning, with the evolving needs of our communities at the forefront of our priorities. The world has changed dramatically since we began writing our strategic plan in Fall 2019, but we are unwavering in our commitment to deliver collections and services at point of need, anytime, anywhere. Looking ahead, we must continue building our capacity to address the essential information challenges and opportunities in an everchanging world. We must sharply increase our efforts to acquire and provide digital content, to digitize pre-existing Penn-owned collections, and to make strategic investments in technology. It is critical that we continue to reimagine our physical spaces and services in increasingly virtual environments. At the same time, we must continue and strengthen the conversations launched in spring 2020 on what we as an organization can contribute to local and national movements to address the inequities of our society. Libraries are built to serve all people—whether in bricks and mortar buildings or through virtual interactions. In building deep and distinctive collections, preserving knowledge, and increasing access to it, we have the ability to inspire, to offer hope, and to change people’s lives. As we move forward with our strategic plan, we reaffirm our commitment to creating a living and learning environment that is truly transformative, safe and welcoming for all. Thank you for your support and partnership in advancing knowledge to power Penn and better the world. Constantia Constantinou H.
