The part-time schedule offers a reduced course load, with part-time students typically complete the JD program in four or five years instead of the usual three. Part-time students must have flexible availability, especially those who plan to pursue full-time employment simultaneously. All first-year classes are taught on weekdays during the day, and when necessary, course faculty may hold make-up sessions at different times than classes would normally meet. In addition, many programs designed for students’ academic and career success — some of which are mandatory — take place outside of scheduled class time, including academic success skills groups, professional development workshops and student life events. Three course sequences are required for part-time first-year students: Contracts I (Fall) » Contracts II (Spring) Lawyering Skills I (Fall) » Lawyering Skills II (Spring) Torts I (Fall) » Torts II (Spring) If granted permission to do so, a part-time student may add one additional course sequence of the following two: Criminal Law (Fall) » Civil Procedure I (Spring) Property I (Fall) » Property II (Spring) Tuition for part-time students is charged by the credit hour rather than by the term. For students first enrolling in Fall 2020 or later, the current tuition rate is $1,190 per credit hour for Kentucky residents and $1,448 per credit hour for nonresidents. Part-time status is defined as less than 15 credit hours per semester in the first year and and less than 10 credit hours per semester in subsequent years. Students may choose to switch from part-time to full-time status after their first year of study.
