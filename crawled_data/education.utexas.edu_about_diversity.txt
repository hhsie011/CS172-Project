The Social Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion committee serves as a steward of this facet of the college’s mission. We believe that diversity is inextricably linked to excellence. We believe that embracing diversity and social justice—in our faculty, staff, students, research, curricula, and service to the community — creates a rich atmosphere for teaching, learning, and inquiry and is a necessary condition for preparing our graduates to succeed in a diverse world and to change it for the better. We recognize a history of oppression, inequity, and structural discrimination in the university, local, state, and national context. We leverage diversity and interdisciplinarity as critical components in our innovative research, inclusive and empowering curricula, and professional leadership.
