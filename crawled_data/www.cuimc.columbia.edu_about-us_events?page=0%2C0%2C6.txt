Perinatal detection of congenital anomalies leads to the identification of infants who are affected by life-limiting conditions with a short life expectancy. Perinatal palliative care offers a plan for improving quality of life of the infant and the family, when extending the baby’s life is no longer the goal of care. The evidence base for perinatal palliative care continues to grow. However, there is no consensus about best clinical practice in managing pregnancy and delivery of women who elect to continue their pregnancies, and promoting support for the family and comfort for the neonate. Pregnancy and delivery management, and support for the family are achieved through appropriate obstetric care, pre- and postnatal consults, shared decision-making, and advance care planning. A state of comfort for the neonate is achieved when relational basic needs such as bonding, maintenance of body temperature, relief of hunger/thirst, and alleviation of pain/discomfort are met. To address this growing need to support families or the comfort of the neonate, an interdisciplinary team developed a 3-day intensive training, which will include information about the successful experiences of the Neonatal Comfort Care Program in providing perinatal palliative care for over a decade at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Moreover, the course faculty will discuss evidence-based rationale, practical aspects and strategies to provide support for families and achieve a state of comfort for newborns with life-limiting conditions. BME Seminar: Russell D. ‘Rusty’ Lansford, Ph.D., USC Friday, September 23, 2022 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM Venue Online Event Categories Engineering Research Healthcare FALL DATE TBD We will welcome Prof. Rusty Lansford from USC as he presents, "Intravital Imaging Across Kingdoms." ABOUT THE SEMINAR Intravital Imaging Across Kingdoms Since 2011, I have worked at the University of Southern California (USC) & Children’s Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) using a combination of experimental, computational, and theoretical approaches to quantitatively understand decision-making in single cells and tissues, focusing on questions in vascular, neural, and germ cell development. We have a quiver of new molecular tools that permit molecular perturbation to be induced in vivo with extreme spatiotemporal accuracy and generated new multispectral fluorescent sensors to assay changes in cell behaviors resulting from the molecular disruptions. The quail model system uncouples early embryogenesis from maternal influences, providing a simpler system to assay the complex and multifactorial effects of how germ cells act in their native environment during the equivalent of their first-trimester development. Recently we have been developing new spectral technologies to investigate marine-based cross-kingdom mutualistic interactions to advance understanding how diverse organisms adapt to their changing environment. ABOUT THE SPEAKER Russell D. “Rusty” Lansford, Ph.D., Associate Professor, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine & Investigator at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles Rusty Lansford earned an A.B. in Immunology at UC Berkeley and worked with Dr. Marian Koshland on the regulation of the J chain protein transcriptional regulation. He obtained a Ph.D. in Molecular Immunology at Columbia University working with Dr. Fred Alt. Lansford worked as a postdoctoral researcher in Developmental Biology and Optics at Caltech with Dr. Scott Fraser working on neural crest cells migration and patterning and he co-developed multispectral imaging hardware and software now widely used in microscopy. As an independent investigator at Caltech, he developed transgenic quail as a model system to dynamically investigate embryogenesis. ABOUT THE 2021-2022 BME SEMINAR SERIES The Department of Biomedical Engineering at Columbia University is proud to host an annual weekly seminar series on the latest developments and research in Biomedical Engineering. The weekly series takes place on Friday mornings at 11:00AM Eastern and includes a variety of renowned academics from top universities to talk about their specific research and experience. The January 21 seminar is a virtual event.
