These are considerations we will hold ourselves accountable for in our interactions and communications. As it is living, this is an always in-process list. Listen to receive and do not respond. #Leanonme, we are resources for one another. Recognize forms of labor. Trust, ask. We all still have things to learn. Be generous (listeners, humans). Asking questions is important :). Throw sunshine, not shade. Hold people accountable respectfully. Be conscientious of communication. Respect & lean on writers' vulnerability. 2021-2022 Writing Fellows Madeleine Adriance Eva Azazoglu Saadhya Bahudodda Bazif Bala Callie Bouton Jasmine Cardichon Rachel Carlson Sophia Chan Vivian Chun Emily Cigarroa Nasreen Duqmaq Roopa Duvvi Joyce Gao Ricardo Gomez Yemi Hailemariam Adam Hall Leona Hariharan Elana Hausknecht Robin Hwang Alice Jo Samiha Kazi Grace Keefe Nicole Kim Kyoko Leaman Anna Lembke Cristian Loor Lindsey Maher Katherine Molloy Sarosh Nadeem Ethan Pan Grace Park Bailee Peralto Davi Perez Sophie Pollack-Milgate Geat Ramush Ingrid Ren Aila Rodriguez Hillel Rosenshine Emily Rust Tarana Sable Gemma Sack Shilpa Sajja Kolya Shields Allison Singleton Ella Spungen Morgan Varnado Michael Wang Whitney Yu Megan Zhang Learning Collaborative Problem Solving Research Writing Writing Across the Curriculum Seminar Writing Fellows People Courses English 1190M Apply Data Science The Sheridan Center The Sheridan Center Brown University Box 1912 Sciences Library 201 Thayer Street, 7th Floor Providence, RI 02912 Phone: 401-863-1219 Fax: 401-863-6976 Email [email protected] Facebook Facebook Brown University Giving to Brown Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA 401-863-1000 Contact Us Maps Directions Career Opportunities Campus Safety Accessibility All Social Media © 2022 Brown University | Back to top
