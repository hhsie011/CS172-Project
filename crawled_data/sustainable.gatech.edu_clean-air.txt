The fact that the majority of people now live in cities means that a huge proportion of the global population are living in airsheds where the air quality may pose health risks, at least for part of the year. Characterizing and understanding the scope of this problem is not only critical to making progress towards solutions, but helps people maintain their health by providing real-time information about the risks of poor air quality.
