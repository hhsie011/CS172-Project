The Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies Collection at the Fung Library specializes in difficult-to-find Chinese-language publications. The collection includes statistical sources and unpublished documents as well as unique materials on political, economic, and sociological issues related to contemporary China. There is also a complete collection of all standard and new English language social science books focusing on contemporary China. New titles are acquired upon publication and immediately appear on the shelves for patron use. Each year a wide variety of publications, documents, and other materials previously unavailable in the West is acquired. The collection also maintains subscriptions to 150 periodicals and newspapers in Chinese and English. Accessing These Materials The entire collection is searchable in HOLLIS.
