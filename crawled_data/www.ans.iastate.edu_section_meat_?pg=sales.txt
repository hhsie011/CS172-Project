There will be a stainless steel container on a cart at the base of the stairs to the dock to place your check into. You may come to Meat Lab Sales to pick up the order if you wish to. Please be aware that the online order form may show that we have an item in stock, but the item may be out of stock before the order form has been updated. If we are out of an item you ordered, we will let you know when we send the notification email. Remember, that online, you are ordering by the package and not the pound. Package weights are variable except for ground product in 1LB chubs. Adding multiples of a single item is adding packages, not pounds and the total amount will reflect that.
