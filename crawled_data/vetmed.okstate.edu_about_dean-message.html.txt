The College of Veterinary Medicine is the premier provider of animal care in the state of Oklahoma and for the region. The college provides quality educational opportunities to prepare our graduates for varied careers within the veterinary profession, and continues to be near the top ranking of return on investment to obtain a doctor of veterinary medicine degree compared to other U.S. colleges of veterinary medicine. Our curriculum is built on a culture of scholarship that has led to the excellent reputation of the college for educating students not only to be ready to enter practice but to become successful veterinarians. This reputation makes Oklahoma State the place where students want to attend. Our multidisciplinary approach to train students, our centers for excellence in research, our Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory to promote the overall well-being of animal health through veterinary diagnostic testing, our outreach to the agricultural and veterinary communities to provide continuing education, our college-based Comparative Biomedical Sciences graduate program to train future scientists, and our clinical research activities that advance new diagnostic methods and treatment of diseases, establish sound assurance to continue progress in the college's role as an international leader in veterinary medical education and research. As I serve the constituents of Oklahoma State University, I want to reach our alumni and stakeholders with a commitment that we will increase the value of our graduates to our profession. This commitment will serve as the focus of our mission. I will work with our talented faculty and engaged staff to foster a nurturing and stimulating environment so that our students can reach their full potential. -Dr. Carlos Risco Oklahoma State University CAMPUSES CAMPUSES Stillwater Tulsa Center for Health Sciences Oklahoma City Institute of Technology Division of Agriculture Veterinary Medicine UNIVERSITY LINKS UNIVERSITY LINKS Campus Safety Diversity Research Extension & Engagement Alumni & Friends OSU Athletics America's Healthiest Campus ® News & Information RESOURCES RESOURCES Ethics Point EEO Statement Accessibility Trademarks Terms of Service Privacy Notice Webmaster CAMPUS MAP © - Oklahoma State University | All Rights Reserved ©
