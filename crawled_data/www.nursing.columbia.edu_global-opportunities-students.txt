Our curriculum provides such on-the-ground experience at home and abroad, in countries like Ghana, Nepal, the Dominican Republic, and other low-income regions where health care is a limited resource; where seeing a nurse, reaching a clinic, receiving medication, and improving health are challenging. By learning from nurses who surmount these limitations and develop sound models of care, our students gain a broader understanding of solutions to secure health as a human right. Classroom learning is totally different from actual practice on the ground in a place like Ethiopia. Sending nurses to these locations is transforming nursing knowledge and the way nurses practice in the world. Jennifer Dohrn, DNP, Assistant Dean of OGI Global Sites Columbia University School of Nursing currently partners with 14 global clinical sites where MDE and DNP students can spend six weeks working with communities, in local community health centers, and hospitals, as well as performing clinical practicums and research. Each site in turn initiates activities beneficial to its goals to improve community health with Columbia Nursing. Reciprocity is a central foundation of this program. OGI notifies students of upcoming opportunities and application requirements, while program directors match opportunities to the students. Opportunities are offered to current Columbia Nursing students.
