Retiree Life Insurance We are pleased to offer University of Louisville retirees additional options for life insurance coverage.

The cost of additional coverage above $5,000 will be based on your age and the level of coverage you choose. See the Retirement Benefits Guide for rates.

We strive to take care of our employees on campus, as well as when they part and become our extended family. View the 2022 Retirement Guide. View the Optum HRtalks-Direct Bill training recording. Review the Optum registration instructions for direct bill. View and complete the Optum ACH form. Optum Financial Direct Bill Customer Service: 1-855-687-2021. Pre 65 Retirees Retirees under the age of 65 who want to continue coverage under the university's benefit plan as they retire from the university are able to do so. Pre-65 retirees can continue to participate in their university benefit plan until they reach the age of 65. Retirees under 65 are also eligible to participate in the Get Healthy Now program and receive discounted medical plan rates. Please visit our Retiree Medical Plan Rates webpage to view plan option and rates. Note: After your last paycheck from the university, you will begin receiving billing statements for your premiums at the retiree health rates directly from Optum. Optum will bill for health, dental, vision and life insurance premiums. You will be responsible to pay these premiums to Optum going forward to maintain your benefits coverage. Failure to pay these premiums will result in loss of coverage and you will lose the ability to re-enroll during future open enrollment periods. To avoid missing payments, we recommend the auto payment (ACH) option with Optum. To set up ACH, complete the Optum ACH form or call Optum Financial Direct Bill Customer Service at 1-855-687-2021. If you have questions about your retirement health benefits, contact Carol Zehnder. If you have questions about your Get Healthy Now incentive, contact Tamara Iacono. Post 65 Retirees Retirees and spouses/QA over age 65 are Medicare eligible and must transition from the university health plan to Medicare. This transition will happen at the time of retirement if you are already age 65 or as you approach your 65th birthday. To help cover some of the costs not covered by Medicare Part B, the university provides retirees access to an AARP Medicare Part B Supplement plan. While you are responsible for paying a monthly premium for this supplement plan, the university will provide a contribution to lower the overall cost of this plan to retirees ($108.10/month for individual or $216.20/month if you have an eligible spouse/QA). Note: If you were under the age of 65 at the time of retirement, you must contact the UofL Benefits office three months prior to your 65th birthday to begin your transition from the university health plan to Medicare and the AARP Medicare Part B Supplement Plan. Want to understand more about the transition to Medicare? Contact Health Advocate at 866-799-2731 and they can assist you in your transition!
