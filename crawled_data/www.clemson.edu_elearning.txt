Once you are in Percipio®, you can search a list of the course offerings by clicking the search box on the top right side of the page. I love mobility. Is there an app for Percipio®? Absolutely! The Percipio® app can be downloaded from the Apple App Store or from Google Play. Can I use Percipio® offline?

Percipio® is available for free to all faculty, staff and currently enrolled students of Clemson University. Technical Notes and Requirements: Percipio® uses the Adobe Flash Player, which sometimes can be tricky to install on 64-bit operating systems (most frequently Windows 7 or 8).
