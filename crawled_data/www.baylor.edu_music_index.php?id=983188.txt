He has conducted professional orchestras, ballet, opera and contemporary chamber ensembles, but it is his passion for wind music and the teaching of conducting that has inspired the majority of his artistic career. As Professor of Conducting Emeritus and Distinguished Professor at the University of Colorado Boulder, Professor McMurray has been recognized as one of the leading teachers of wind conducting in America and abroad. In demand as a visiting artist, he has guest conducted and taught conducting in over 200 colleges and universities internationally. During the thirty-five years prior to his 2013 retirement as Director of Bands, Professor McMurray founded CUs Master of Music in Wind Conducting and the Doctorate of Musical Arts in Instrumental Conducting and for over 25 years he hosted the CBDNA Conducting Symposium. He has also created and published a groundbreaking set of three DVDs on the teaching of conducting entitled Conducting from the Inside Out. Professor McMurray is past president of the College Band Directors National Association and is a recent recipient of CBDNA’s prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award. He has also received numerous other professional honors and awards including the Bohumil Makovsky Award from Kappa Kappa Psi, and the Distinguished Artist in Classical Music Award from California State University at Long Beach. In 2004 he was recognized by the Board of Regents as Distinguished Professor at the University of Colorado for his professional achievements in the field of the teaching of conducting. Allan McMurray and his wife, Judy, currently reside in California and British Columbia and he remains active as a guest conductor and teacher of conducting.
