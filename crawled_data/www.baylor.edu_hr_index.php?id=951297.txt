Service awards recognize the recipients' years of loyal service and contributions to the life of the University. Awards are given in five year increments, beginning with year five, and honor anniversary milestones achieved during the preceding calendar year. Recipients receive a recognition packet that includes a catalog from which they may select a gift to commemorate the occasion. An honoree can select the traditional Baylor service pin or a gift of their choice.
