And yet, empirical research reveals that political humor affects knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. In this class, we will survey extant research findings to evaluate late night political humor's content and effects, using social scientific and rhetorical theories to better understand how, and in what ways, late night television political comedy matters. Speaking and writing projects will be used to achieve course objectives. No prerequisites. Limited enrollment. Instructor: Compton Distributive: SOC. Not offered in the period from 21X through 23S. To view the ORC description, follow this link: Speech 33 A couple of decades ago, we had little empirical support for effects of political humor. But now—and particularly, in the past five years—scholars have conducted many investigations of late night political humor content and effects, with results that, more often than not, challenge our conventional wisdom and expectations about politics, humor, and entertainment. Some findings are inconsistent. Political humor helps candidates; political humor hurts candidates. Political humor increases cynicism toward politics; political humor decreases cynicism toward politics. But even among the inconsistencies, one consistent theme resonates: It is a mistake to dismiss late night political humor as “just comedy.” Late night political humor is doing something to viewers, and the nature of this something warrants closer scrutiny. Studying political humor leads to a better understanding of political rhetoric, satire, information processing, civic engagement, persuasion, and attitude formation and change. This course begins with the assumption that late night television comedy matters and turns, immediately, to evidence for this conclusion. We begin with narrative reviews of empirical late night political humor scholarship (Compton, 2008, 2011) before exploring specific effects, including impacts of late night television political humor on candidate image, attitudes toward politics, and participation in politics. Along the way, we turn to social scientific and rhetorical theory to help us make sense of the effects, including classic models of information processing (e.g., Elaboration Likelihood Model) and persuasion theory (e.g., inoculation theory). We also consider rhetorical theories, including work with Burkean constructs of the comic frame and more contemporary theorizing about image (e.g., Benoit’s image repair typology). Although the focus of this course is on effects of political humor, using evidence from empirical investigations, we will also explore the content of late night political humor. Students will complete a term project analyzing a specific political artifact through the lens of theory, using writing and speaking to meet project and course objectives. Smaller writing and speaking assignments during the course will allow us to discover and share our thinking throughout the term. We will also expand our scope beyond late night political humor, considering how our discoveries of this unique artifact can inform our own rhetorical choices and analyses. For example, we will compare late night political humor with other venues of political humor, including public address and word-of-mouth jokes. As the title of a collection of political humor essays puts it: Laughing matters. We will discover together, through careful reading and interpretation of scholarship, how and why laughing matters, and what these findings mean for politics, civic engagement, and our own rhetorical choices. Course Goals The overriding goal of the course is for you to develop a more nuanced understanding of political rhetoric by exploring contemporary late night television political humor. We’ll use writing and speaking to make these discoveries, so along the way, we’ll refine our communication approaches, too. To achieve this goal, we will aim for the following primary learning objectives: to better understand the content of late night television political humor; and to write and speak about political rhetoric with an informed understanding. To meet these primary objectives, I will help you to: Analyze arguments for and against the academic study of political humor in general and late night television comedy in particular; Survey and assess extant late night television comedy scholarship; Compare contemporary late night television comedy with other forms of political humor/satire; Discover dimensions of attitude formation and change through the study of priming, attitude accessibility, and information processing models; Analyze political humor rhetoric with rhetorical models; Apply ancient canons of rhetoric to contemporary forms of political rhetoric; Explicate discrete effects of late night political humor, including candidate evaluations, cynicism, and civic engagement; In collaboration with classmates, develop a typology of late night political jokes; Use theory (e.g., ELM) to reconcile conflicting findings about late night comedy and potential learning effects; Discover and overcome challenges of inherent subjectivity in interpreting and conducting humor studies; Weigh the relative merits of political humor (and television humor in particular) on civic engagement and political deliberation; Evaluate strengths and weaknesses of rhetorical and quantitative analyses of political humor; Transfer findings about the content and effects of late night comedy to other forums of political humor; Develop a more nuanced understanding of political image through the lens of late night comedy scholarship; and Write and speak about humor with approaches consistent with academic studies of humor (e.g., communication, political science) Departments African and African American Studies Anthropology Art History Asian Societies, Cultures, and Languages Program Biological Sciences Chemistry Classics Cognitive Science Comparative Literature Computer Science Earth Sciences Economics Education Engineering Sciences English Environmental Studies Film and Media Studies French and Italian Geography German Studies Government History Humanities 1 & 2 Institute for Writing and Rhetoric Jewish Studies Latin American, Latino and Caribbean Studies Linguistics Mathematics Medieval and Renaissance Studies Music Native American Studies Philosophy Physics and Astronomy Psychological and Brain Sciences Religion Russian Sociology Spanish and Portuguese Studio Art Theater Women’s and Gender Studies Inclusivity “Dartmouth’s capacity to advance its dual mission of education and research depends upon the full diversity and inclusivity of this community…Diversity and inclusivity are necessary partners. Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Institute for Writing and Rhetoric Philosophy & Aims About Writing at Dartmouth Speech at Dartmouth Our Stories The Story of Writing Instruction at Dartmouth The Story of Speech at Dartmouth The Story of Writing Support at Dartmouth Curriculum Overview Writing Courses Writing 2-3 WRIT 5 First-Year Seminars Humanities 1-2 Speech Courses Speech 20 Speech 25 Speech 26 Speech 27 Speech 30 Speech 31 Speech 33 Speech 34 Speech 36 Speech 37 Speech 40 Placement and Enrollment Policies First-Year Writing & First-Year Seminar Requirements Differences Among First-Year Writing Courses FAQ Directed Self-Placement Process for Writing Registration for Writing 5 or Writing 2-3 Registration for First Year Seminars FAQ First-year Writing Registration First-year Writing Choices Prizes Writing Prize Winners Speech Contest Winners Speech Contest Call for Entries Learning Overview Writing Center Make an Appointment Materials Sources and Citations at Dartmouth Teaching Overview Guidelines Teaching Writing in the First Year Expectations for Writing 2-3 Expectations for Writing 5 Teaching the First-Year Seminar First-Year Writing: Pedagogies, Methods, & Design Active Learning in the First-Year Writing Classroom Syllabus and Assignment Design Teaching Writing as Process Integrating Reading and Writing Diagnosing and Responding to Student Writing Conducting Writing Workshops Collaborative Learning/Learning with Peers Teaching Argument Teaching Research Addressing Grammar Useful links Support The Writing Assistant Program Research Past Research Activities Research Overview Multilingual Overview Support for Undergraduate Students Support for Graduate Students Faculty Support News & People People News Employment Upcoming Events Past Events My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
