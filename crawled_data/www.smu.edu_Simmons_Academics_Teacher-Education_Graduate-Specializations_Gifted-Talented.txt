Today's diverse classrooms mean that educators must be able to recognize and serve talented and high achieving students in heterogeneous settings as well as in special program settings. The curriculum consists of three 3-hour graduate courses all of which can be applied to the specialization module of SMU's Master of Education (M.Ed.) degree (pending acceptance into the M.Ed. program). Successful graduates of the GT program are prepared to take the Gifted and Talented TExES (Texas Examination for Educator Standards); those who pass the exam earn GT certification. The three GT courses can be completed in one year. Two courses are online and one is face-to-face. The three courses can be taken in any order. Fall Term Courses EDU 6325.
