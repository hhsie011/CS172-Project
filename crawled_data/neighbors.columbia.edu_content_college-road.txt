Counselors work with students one-on-one to find the right college for them, complete admissions applications, and explore financial aid and funding options. College tours and campus visits are also arranged so that students can be confident with the schools they have selected. At the end of this process we will even help pay for testing and application fees.To help ensure that our TASC and CAT Prep students are ready for college level work, Community Impact offers a wide range of extra curricular programs that expand and enrich our test prep classes. A 6-week College Prep seminar series is taught by Columbia University faculty that introduces advanced students to college level assignments and discussions. We also offer luncheon seminars taught by Columbia professors who discuss selected topics from Columbia’s renowned “Core Curriculum,” as well as one-on-one mentoring with Columbia Students, daily tutoring, computer literacy workshops, and access to computer directed learning such as Khan Academy. Thanks to our affiliation with Columbia University, we are able to introduce new, unique enrichment programs every year to meet our students’ needs.Contac Contact Information Website: College Road Phone: (212) 854-9621 Address: Community Impact, 105 Earl Hall, New York, NY 10027 Age Groups Adults Youth Categories Education The Office of Government & Community Affairs309 Low Library, 535 West 116th Street · New York, NY 10027 Phone (212) 854-5915 Internal Use Only Login to Access Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
