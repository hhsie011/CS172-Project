Students in classical studies programs master a high level of critical thinking and research skills, which makes them highly employable and well paid. TU’s certificate in Classical Studies provides an interdisciplinary approach to the Greco-Roman World and its medieval and modern legacies. Two versions of the certificate are available, one focusing on classical civilizations alone and the other on classical civilizations and languages. Courses can be selected from a variety of disciplines, including art history, comparative literature, film studies, Greek, history, Latin, philosophy, political science, religion and theatre. The certificate requires 21 credit hours. Learn more. The certificate program in classical studies is designed for the traditional and non-traditional student who wants to acquire a solid foundation in the Greco-Roman world and its legacy. Students must either have a bachelor’s degree from an accredited college or university or be in the process of completing a bachelor’s degree at The University of Tulsa. Certificate programs consist of between 18 and 24 credits. If a certificate is being completed in lieu of a minor, at least 12 hours must solely fulfill requirements for the certificate. Students interested in fulfilling the requirements of a certificate program should consult the director of the specific program or the College Advising Office.
