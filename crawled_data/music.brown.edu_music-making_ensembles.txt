Javanese Gamelan Gongs and percussion instruments made of tuned metal are found throughout Southeast Asia. In Java (an island in the Republic of Indonesia), ensembles built around such instruments are called gamelan. Jazz Band Jazz at Brown has a history as old as the style itself. Old-Time String Band Fiddlers, banjo-players, mandolinists and guitarists play the high, lonesome sounds of traditional Southern Appalachian Mountain music in Brown's old-time string band. Orchestra Participation in the Brown University Orchestra is open to all members of the Brown community: undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, and staff.
