Our Land-Grant Heritage Iowa State University was founded on the ideals that higher education should be accessible to all and that the university should teach liberal and practical subjects. These ideals are integral to the land-grant university, a special class of university created by the Morrill Act, passed by Congress in 1862. Iowa was the first state to accept the law's provisions. Iowa State University subsequently pioneered the idea of Extension -- extending the university's knowledge to people throughout the state. PDF version of the plan.
