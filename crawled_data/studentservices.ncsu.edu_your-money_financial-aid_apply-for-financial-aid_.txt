Financial Aid Verification Planning for Tuition Costs Forms Find your financial aid counselor Apply for Financial Aid Follow these steps to apply for financial aid: Step 1: Submit the FAFSA by March 1 (School code 002972). The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is available each October 1. All students who wish to be considered for federal aid and state and institutional need-based financial aid must submit a FAFSA. Complete the FAFSA as soon after October 1 as possible; waiting for an official admission notice is not necessary. Students should submit the FAFSA and any possible additional documentation as early as possible as financial aid is offered on a first come, first-served basis. Students who submit FAFSAs by the priority filing date (March 1) are given first consideration for need-based grant assistance offered by the university. The FAFSA is free; we recommend you avoid paying filing organizations and service sites such as FAFSA.com. Step 2: Check your email for FAFSA results. Within four weeks of completing the FAFSA, a Student Aid Report (SAR) is sent to the student indicating that the FAFSA has been processed and sent to designated institutions. Check the SAR for accuracy and ensure that NC State is listed as a designated institution. Step 3: Once you are admitted and given MyPack Portal login access, grant parent access to trusted individuals. We strongly encourage dependent students to authorize the release of financial aid information to parents or other trusted individuals. A student’s financial aid information may not be discussed with anyone other than the student and individuals they have authorized. View how to grant parent access here. Step 4: Check MyPack Portal to confirm that the FAFSA has been received. Once you are officially admitted you will be given MyPack Portal access credentials. Approximately two weeks following your FAFSA submission, check MyPack Portal (Student Homepage > Financial Aid > Select Aid Year > Required Documents) to confirm NC State’s receipt of your aid application. We use your social security number (SSN) to match your FAFSA and university records. If you did not provide your SSN on your original application, you may add it to your student record by clicking Provide my Social Security number on MyPack. If your SSN is incorrect, contact Undergraduate Admissions (for entering undergraduates), the Graduate School (for entering graduate students) or Registration & Records (for continuing students) to update your record. Step 5: Submit any additional requested documentation promptly. Frequently visit MyPack Portal (Student Homepage > Financial Aid tile > Select Aid Year > Required Documents) to determine if any additional documentation has been requested. We strongly recommend responding to requests within 14 days, but no later than June 1 for priority applicants. Failure to respond timely could result in delays, reductions, and/or cancellations of financial aid and/or class schedules. Step 6: Submit the Scholarship Notification E-Form to record outside resources. You must report receipt of outside assistance to the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid as quickly as possible. Visit MyPack Portal (Student Homepage > Financial Aid > Select Aid Year > Scholarships/Fellowships > Report External Scholarship) to submit scholarship information.
