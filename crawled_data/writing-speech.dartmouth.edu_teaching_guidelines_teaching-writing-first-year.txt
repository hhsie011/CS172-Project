In this spirit, our first-year writing courses are designed to welcome students into the ongoing conversation of scholarship. These courses - which include Writing 2-3, Writing 5, and the First-Year Seminar - provide Dartmouth students an environment where they can practice the reading, thinking, writing, and speaking that will shape their intellectual lives. Teaching Goals Our goals for our students include the following: Deepening their critical reading and thinking skills Teaching them how to contemplate and then to compose good scholarly questions Helping them find, evaluate, and employ the resources that can help answer these questions Guiding them as they craft thoughtful, clear, and well-supported arguments Encouraging them to revise by re-engaging with their questions, and re-envisioning their arguments We further hope that our courses encourage students to develop the rhetorical flexibility that will enable them to address the challenges of writing in a variety of situations, with a variety of modes, and in a variety of disciplines. Methodology and Course Design Instructors who have not taught writing before will want to know more about how they can design courses that will achieve these aims. They will also want to know more about what methods are commonly and effectively employed. We offer here a brief introduction to the principles and practices of our first-year courses. Instructors can look forward to hearing more about these methods and philosophies in the Institute's ongoing professional development workshops. They will also discover the value of being part of a corps of experienced and informed colleagues, who are always delighted to engage in conversations about teaching.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Institute for Writing and Rhetoric Philosophy & Aims About Writing at Dartmouth Speech at Dartmouth Our Stories The Story of Writing Instruction at Dartmouth The Story of Speech at Dartmouth The Story of Writing Support at Dartmouth Curriculum Overview Writing Courses Writing 2-3 WRIT 5 First-Year Seminars Humanities 1-2 Speech Courses Speech 20 Speech 25 Speech 26 Speech 27 Speech 30 Speech 31 Speech 33 Speech 34 Speech 36 Speech 37 Speech 40 Placement and Enrollment Policies First-Year Writing & First-Year Seminar Requirements Differences Among First-Year Writing Courses FAQ Directed Self-Placement Process for Writing Registration for Writing 5 or Writing 2-3 Registration for First Year Seminars FAQ First-year Writing Registration First-year Writing Choices Prizes Writing Prize Winners Speech Contest Winners Speech Contest Call for Entries Learning Overview Writing Center Make an Appointment Materials Sources and Citations at Dartmouth Teaching Overview Guidelines Teaching Writing in the First Year Expectations for Writing 2-3 Expectations for Writing 5 Teaching the First-Year Seminar First-Year Writing: Pedagogies, Methods, & Design Active Learning in the First-Year Writing Classroom Syllabus and Assignment Design Teaching Writing as Process Integrating Reading and Writing Diagnosing and Responding to Student Writing Conducting Writing Workshops Collaborative Learning/Learning with Peers Teaching Argument Teaching Research Addressing Grammar Useful links Support The Writing Assistant Program Research Past Research Activities Research Overview Multilingual Overview Support for Undergraduate Students Support for Graduate Students Faculty Support News & People People News Employment Upcoming Events Past Events My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
