That means you will always receive messages sent to your Dartmouth student email even after you are no longer a student. To help you manage this change, the Alumni Help Desk (603) 646-3202, will provide alumni with information on how to obtain, setup, and configure free e-mail accounts that are offered by Microsoft or Google. They will also assist with configuring those accounts to allow you to send e-mail from your new Dartmouth.edu address. This will allow you to receive and send mail from a Microsoft or Google account but using a Dartmouth.edu address. For graduating students: your e-mail address will stay the same but approximately 60 days after commencement your mailbox will be removed. Prior to this time, your dartmouth.edu address should be forwarded to a non-Dartmouth account. Information will be sent to you during the spring term regarding this transition, giving you time to migrate any messages or contacts to another non-Dartmouth account.
