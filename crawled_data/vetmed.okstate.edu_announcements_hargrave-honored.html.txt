Pictured (left to right) are: Charlie Vasso, Tanya Vasso, Becky Koch, Marla Hargrave, June Hargrave, Janine Warmowski and Joey Warmowski. A ceremony to unveil a bench in honor of the late Jim Hargrave, was held on April 13, 2022. Hargrave served as the OSU College of Veterinary Medicine’s facilities manager from 1991 until his retirement in 2020. In attendance was Hargrave’s family, as well as several CVM faculty and staff members. “The dedication was a very special way to honor Jim and his years of service to the College of Veterinary Medicine,” Ashley Hesser, director of development with the OSU Foundation, said. “Having his family, along with a number of faculty and staff, as a part of unveiling was emotional and wonderful.” The bench, bearing his name, sits near the Roger J. Panciera Education Center on the OSU Stillwater campus. Hargrave was instrumental in the planning and construction of the Center, a state-of-the-art classroom building that houses veterinary students in years one through three.
