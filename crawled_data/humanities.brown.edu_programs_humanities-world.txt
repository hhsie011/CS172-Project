Connected histories emphasize the flow of ideas across regions and localities, and showcase varied contexts for humanistic enterprise. Scholarship in the new humanities is grounded in questions of social justice and ethical accountability. Humanities in the World promotes cross-campus collaboration in such areas, and support important new work that expands the scope of the traditional humanities. Events include lectures, workshops, colloquia, and conferences. The “Race in a Global Frame” lecture series showcases transnational perspectives on racialization, racial injustice, racial emancipation, antiracist intervention, and critical race thinking. They feature new work by emerging and established scholars, writers, artists, and cultural commentators across disciplines and locations.
