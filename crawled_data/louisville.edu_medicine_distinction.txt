The University of Louisville currently has four Distinction Tracks: Business and Leadership, Global Health, Medical Education, and Research. Each track is unique in its requirements, ensures a mentored longitudinal experience, and culminates in a scholarly project. Leadership The Distinction Track Program is housed in the Undergraduate Medical Education Office and is overseen by an Advisory Steering Committee, chaired by the Vice Dean for Undergraduate Medical Education, M. Ann Shaw, MD, MA. The committee includes representatives from the University of Louisville faculty and staff, Distinction Track Directors, and student representatives. The role of the Advisory Committee is to provide support for the distinction tracks by sharing student recruitment and assessment strategies and identifying resources to support learning. It also provides a forum to share ideas. Value Participation in a distinction track enriches medical school training without prolonging it. Students must be in good academic standing to be considered for track selection and can only enroll in one distinction track. Presently about 20% of our medical students are participating in a distinction track. Successful completion of distinction track requirements are noted on the student’s official transcript and in the Medical School Performance Evaluation (MSPE) letter for residency application. Students are acknowledged at the Senior Honors Banquet and receive a certificate at graduation. Overview The Distinction in Business and Leadership (DIBL) track will prepare students for a career in the business of healthcare. [...] The Distinction in Global & Public Health Track (DIGPH) introduces students to various aspects and perspectives of global health through the lenses of clinical, social, political, and epidemiological study. [...] The MD with Distinction in Medical Education (DIME) will provide students to engage in activities focused on developing their skills in multiple teaching modes pertinent to medical education, as well as conducting educational research. [...] The Distinction in Research (DIR) track is designed as an enrichment program for a select groups of medical students.
