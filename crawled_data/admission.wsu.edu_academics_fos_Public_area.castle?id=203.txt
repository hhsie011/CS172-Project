You're not alone. A nationwide study estimates that 80% of entering college students don't know what they want to study. Our Major Exploration Advising Program (also known as MEAP) is your home base while you're exploring your options. Your advisor will connect you with interesting opportunities and help you throughout the decision process. If you have 31 or more credit hours, you'll be advised by the Academic Success and Career Center, which works hand-in-hand with the MEAP center. And don't worry too much about changing your mind along the way. More than half of first-year students change their major at least once.
