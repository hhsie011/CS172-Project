Freshman admission is competitive and based upon a comprehensive review of the student’s academic record. The primary factors include the high school/secondary grade point average and demonstrated English proficiency. Transfer admission is competitive and based upon the cumulative grade point average of all previously attended colleges/universities (international and domestic) and must be at least a 2.0 GPA on a 4.0 scale for consideration. Demonstrated English proficiency is also required of all international applicants. Pay the non-refundable undergraduate application fee of $50. Applicants should upload a copy of their unofficial international transcript or marks sheet (high school/secondary or college/university) using our secure document upload system. The Office of Undergraduate Admission and Orientation will conduct an initial assessment of your international transcript/marks sheet for admissions review. Receipt of official transcript/marks sheet will be required prior to enrollment. After the application fee has been paid and all high school or college transcripts have been uploaded, review of the undergraduate application will begin. While the review period may vary, on average, applicants will be notified by email of a decision within 5-7 business days. After admission to the UofM, all transfer students with international college/university course work must have their official international college transcripts/marks sheet evaluated by a NACES approved credentialing agency in order to receive course transfer credit. No unofficial college transcripts will be evaluated for course credit. All international transfer applicants must have their international documents evaluated by a US credentialing agency that holds membership with the National Association of Credential Evaluation Services (NACES). Please access the website at www.naces.org. Once there click on How to Find a Member. Any of the agencies found on this website can be used to do the evaluation, however the University of Memphis partners with SpanTran for an expedited evaluation process.
