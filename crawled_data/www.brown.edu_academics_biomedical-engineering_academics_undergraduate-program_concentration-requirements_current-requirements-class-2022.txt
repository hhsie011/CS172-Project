Students with AP credit should take a higher level math course as a replacement. Premeds should take CHEM0360, BIOL0280, and two biology lab courses including BIOL0800. Students with AP credit can replace the AP math course with CHEM 0360. †All substitutions should be discussed with a concentration advisor. Please contact a concentration advisor if you are interested in taking one of these courses as an elective. ‡In some cases, Independent Study may be substituted subject to Concentration Advisor approval. §Advanced placement credit can also not be used to satisfy a general education requirement.
