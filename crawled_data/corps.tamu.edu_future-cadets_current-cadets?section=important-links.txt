Knowing your strengths and weaknesses, focusing on processes, knowing what values you believe in as a leader, and having a leadership philosophy you can clearly communicate are just a few of the lessons I have learned from these executives and from completing my ILDP. I just wanted to let you know you have done an excellent job molding this program into something which will put us leaps and bounds ahead of our peers outside of the program, and I wanted to thank you for that!” Recent graduate, Class of 2019 “I can’t describe how much of an impact [this program] has had on me. It got me my first job and most importantly, made me a better person!” Recent graduate, Class of 2019 “I wanted to let you know I found my first job as a research administrator here at Texas A&M and could not be happier. Having the leadership certificate on my resume and being able to talk about it in my interview was a tremendous advantage.” Recent graduate, Class of 2018 Hollingsworth Center for Ethical Leadership CADET POLICIES INCOMING CADETS Site Footer Home Future Cadets Why The Corps Academic Advantage FAQ Visit The Corps Hollingsworth Center For Ethical Leadership Cadet Leadership We Develop Leaders Development Module Career Readiness Army ROTC Air Force ROTC Navy/Marine ROTC News Visit The Corps Programs Corps Center Make An Impact TAMF CCA Bricks Contact Us Future Cadet Form Staff Directory History Hall of Honor Profiles Medal of Honor Texas A&M University Accessibility Privacy & Security Corps Of Cadets Association Home Future Cadets Cadet Life We Develop Leaders Visit The Corps Current Cadets Contact Us March To 3,000 Copyright 2022 • Texas A&M Corps of Cadets | The Keepers of the Spirit • All Rights Reserved. • Hosted by Division of Student Affairs Department of IT
