The energy is transferred in short pulses enabling a variety of applications such as food treatment & sterilization, high power microwave generators, particle accelerators, lightning simulation, industrial, manufacturing technology, etc.. The voltages and currents involved may be in the Mega-Volts and Mega-Ampere range, and on a time scale as short as the sub-nanosecond regime. Research Focus Texas Tech University engineers and scientists investigate the behavior of materials under extreme high electric field stress and electric current densities. Uncovering the underlying physical mechanisms enables developing advanced high voltage pulse systems and components such as wideband semiconductor switches. Recent Developments Developed novel, high-efficiency, high-energy density, solid state power supplies for the Department of Defense and NASA. Developed one of the first U.S. examples of all-explosive pulsed power generators. Developed a unique university explosives research facility. Developed unique high-speed diagnostics with optical and electrical capabilities. Investigated novel methods leading to electronically triggered equipment defeat. Developed multi-university cooperative research programs. Probed the operational machining limits of energetic materials. Established the IEEE International Pulsed Power Conference, which now has more than 600 participants. Largest producer of graduate students in the area of Pulsed Power. The majority of students find employment at national laboratories such as LANL, Sandia, Los Alamos, and NRL. For more information, please visit the Pulsed Power and Power Electronics website.
