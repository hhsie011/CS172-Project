The yearbooks begin annual publication in 1903 and continue through today. The newer editions are planned to be included on this website in future developments. The original yearbooks can be viewed at the Cushing Memorial Library and Archives. Digitized Yearbook Collection is funded through the generosity of the Class of 1949. To support the Digitization Project, please contact Adelle Hedleston ’88 at adelle-h@library.tamu.edu or (979)862-4574. The Texas A&M University Online Yearbook Collection provides a window into student life at Texas A&M. In addition to introducing the reader to those who have both built and inhabited A&M throughout the years, the yearbooks include important historical information and commentary concerning the growth and development of Texas A&M. The first yearbook published was the Olio in 1895. For unknown reasons, no more yearbooks were published until 1903. With the publication of the 1903 Long Horn, yearbooks became an annual publication and continue through today. The Long Horn name was abandoned in 1949 in favor of the Aggieland, a name the student body felt better-suited the contents and the purpose of the book. Cushing Memorial Library and Archives strives to make our digital collection resources available and useful to our faculty, staff, students, alumni, researchers and the general public. Through our web site, the Libraries offers public access to a wide range of information, including historical materials that may contain offensive language or negative stereotypes. Such materials must be viewed in the context of the relevant time period. Texas A&M does not endorse the views expressed in such materials. The online yearbook collection contains all yearbooks produced, with the exception of the four most recent years. All original yearbooks up to the most recent publication can be viewed at the Cushing Memorial Library and Archives.
