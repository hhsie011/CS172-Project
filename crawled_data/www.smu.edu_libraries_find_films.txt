Streaming films are available in our streaming media databases. If we don't have access in our databases, you can request the film. Licenses for streaming films can expire, so verify we have access to the film each semester you assign them. The Library Search record will have an expiration date under the link to the film. We are unable to license or purchase Netflix or Amazon Prime films for classroom use. Netflix Original allows for educational screenings of documentaries. Screen Films Outside the Classroom Any copyrighted films screened outside an official course classroom require public performance rights, even if you do not charge admission. Learn more about acquiring licensing for screening a film. Find Films in Other Libraries You can discover films held by other libraries in WorldCat. We are part of a sharing program that allows us to borrow materials from other libraries called Interlibrary Loan. To request a film we don’t have, click on “Request SMU Interlibrary Loan” in the record from the WorldCat search results.
