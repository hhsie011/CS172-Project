Victims of IRS Tax-Related Identity Theft Beginning with the 2013 tax year, tax filers who because of IRS Tax-Related Identity Theft are denied an IRS Tax Return Transcript, will be referred to the Identity Protection Specialized Unit (IPSU) at toll-free number at 800-908-4490. Filers who believe they are victims of identity theft do not need to be referred to the IPSU; they may call the number directly or go to the identity theft website on IRS.GOV. Tax filers can request that the IRS mail to them an alternate paper tax return transcript called a TRDBV (Transcript Database View). It will look different from the regular IRS Tax Return Transcript. Additionally, the tax filer will need to provide a completed Verification of IRS Identity Theft Form.
