The School of Computer Science networks group seeks to understand the behavior and properties of networks and to use that understanding to solve real-world problems. We contribute tools, techniques, and insights that affect researchers, practitioners, and policy makers. For example, our work on the evolution and economics of Internet peering has contributed to the FCC debate on network neutrality; our tools for modeling Internet topology remain in use nearly 20 years after their development; and our techniques for high-speed network monitoring have been picked up by commercial router companies, such as Huawei. Our major source of funding is the National Science Foundation, supplemented by other federal agencies such as the Department of Energy, the Army Research Lab, DARPA and industry partners such as Cisco, Google, AT&T, Verizon, Motorola, and HP. We collaborate across Georgia Tech, including work with the schools of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Industrial and Systems Engineering, Biology, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, and International Affairs. We welcome the involvement of curious and motivated students in our research projects and intellectual community. We have a long history of including undergraduates and M.S. students in research projects alongside Ph.D. student colleagues, as well as a track record of placing students in exciting industry and academic positions.
