The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University received a full eight-year accreditation from the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME). At the end of their medical education, students are certified as having completed their requirements for the medical degree, and that information is used for them to obtain a license to work as residents under supervision by a licensed physician in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The last LCME site visit review was in October 2020 and involved key stakeholders from the Medical School, including students, faculty, administration, and staff. The Medical School was reaccredited through 2028. The Warren Alpert Medical School’s graduate and continuing education programs are accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME), respectively.
