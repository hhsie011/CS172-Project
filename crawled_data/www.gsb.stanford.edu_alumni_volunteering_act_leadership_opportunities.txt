If you’ve volunteered with ACT, you know the difference our projects make to nonprofits in our community. You also know how fun and rewarding it is to work alongside other GSB alumni on meaningful pro bono assignments. ACT thrives on excellence and continual improvement, and we’re seeking people with project experience to serve in leadership roles and help propel the program forward. If this sounds fun and interesting, please consider applying for one of the ACT Management Board or Committee roles listed below. Deadline to apply: June 6, 2021. Management Board Head of Client Development ACT volunteers highly value opportunities to have impact, learn new skills, and work with exciting clients. In order to offer GSB alumni these opportunities, we proactively develop relationships with targeted clients. The Head of Client Development is critical to ACT’s success in recruiting engaging projects by crafting responses to these and other questions: What criteria should we use for the targets we pursue? Are the targets different for local nonprofits vs those that focus on advancing racial equity anywhere in the US? What’s the best way to nurture and sustain relationships with key organizations? How can we best cultivate our volunteers to serve as spokespersons for ACT in support of client development? You will also be “in the field”, meeting with prospective targets, learning from those experiences and developing prospects for the next round of projects. The Client Development Role may be ideal for you if: You are enthusiastic about the value ACT offers to both volunteers and clients, having participated in several projects yourself. You are committed to ACT’s goal of executing on 50 projects by the end of 2025 with organizations focused on advancing racial equity. You enjoy outreach. You like to meet people, to learn about their organizations and their challenges. You are skilled in thinking on your feet about how ACT might address those challenges. You also enjoy collaboration. You will be working closely with other Management Board members whose insights and procedures will inform your own thinking and actions. You are a go-getter who is comfortable taking action while still developing responses to strategic questions. You’ll have flexibility to set your own timetable and work plan and must be self-motivated to meet it. The ideal Client Development Head will have knowledge of the Bay Area nonprofit community. As Head of Client Development you will: Review existing data on volunteer experiences and criteria for highly valued clients and types of projects and update as necessary. Initiate and maintain relationships with target clients and partners, taking initiative and proactively seeking out relationships. Work with the support of the Head of Racial Equity Initiatives and the Head of Project Screening to bring impact projects to ACT each round. The fine print: The commitment for this position is approximately 8-10 hours per month on average, which includes our monthly board meetings. Calendar tie-in: You might need to spend more time with prospective clients in Nov-Dec and May-June, just before client applications are due. Head of Events and Volunteer Recognition We have learned that many ACT volunteers highly value the sense of community that they experience with fellow alumni, both in their project teams and in their interactions with other ACT volunteers. Often it is this sense of community that draws alumni again and again to ACT opportunities. The Head of Events and Volunteer Recognition has the enviable job of emphasizing the fun, the camaraderie and the appreciation that come with being an ACT volunteer. This role may be right for you if: You enjoy meeting other ACT volunteers. You like to plan events, incorporating new ideas to make them better. You enjoy coming up with fun, new ways to do things. You like to help make people feel appreciated and recognized for their contributions. You’d like to help strengthen the ACT culture. As Head of Events and Volunteer Recognition, you will: Plan and organize two project kick-offs and an annual volunteer appreciation event with the support of ACT staff and other Management Board members, events that build community, promote pride in belonging to ACT, and help volunteers feel excited about their ACT participation. Determine how to welcome new Management Board members and celebrate outgoing Management Board members. Consider and implement volunteer recognition strategies. Collaborate with other Management Board members such as the Heads of Marketing Content and Volunteer Development. The fine print: The commitment for this position is approximately 8-10 hours per month on average, which includes our monthly board meetings. You’ll have months when you devote much less time, and periods when you’ll be busier. Calendar tie-in: Project Round Kick-Offs occur in March and September. Volunteer appreciation event takes place in June. Management Board welcomes new members in September and celebrates outgoing members in August. Head of Remote/Hybrid Teams ACT has traditionally served nonprofits in the Bay Area with the services of in-person volunteers. When the pandemic hit, ACT pivoted to all virtual teams, allowing non-Bay Area alumni to become project volunteers. ACT is now in its third round of virtual projects, with the last and current rounds including out-of-area nonprofits as well, ones that focus on advancing racial equity. Our remote teams and clients have given the same strong satisfaction scores to which ACT is accustomed. ACT aims to continue to leverage remote project teams, anticipates including hybrid project teams that include in-person and remote volunteers, and is looking at accommodating remote members of the ACT Management Board. The Head of Remote/Hybrid Teams is responsible for: Creating, with great intentionality, the key underpinnings of effective remote teams as well as teams of mixed in-person and remote volunteers. Developing procedures that promote a sense of community, camaraderie and fun no matter where volunteers are located. Ensuring that clients with remote and mixed project teams have had the top-notch experience that they would have had if their teams were not remote. Determining the feasibility and desirability of remote or hybrid events (project round kick-offs and volunteer recognition) This role may be right for you if: You are passionate about finding new, flexible ways for people to participate in meaningful volunteer work You’d like to diversify ACT’s volunteer teams The ideal Head of Remote Teams will have experience working in and leading remote teams As Head of Remote/Hybrid Teams, you will: Create a strategy for remote and hybrid project teams (including expectations, accountability, fairness, communication methods, team leader and volunteer support, etc) Develop recommendations on whether to continue to conduct ACT’s events (kick-offs and volunteer recognition) fully remotely post-COVID &/or determine factors that would make hybrid ACT events meaningful and a draw for both in person and remote participants Establish ways to measure performance of remote and hybrid teams Collaborate with other Management Board members such as the Heads of Volunteer Development, Marketing, Screening and Racial Equity Initiatives in recruiting and supporting remote volunteers The fine print: The commitment for this position is approximately 8-10 hours per month on average, which includes our monthly board meetings. You’ll have months when you devote much less time, and periods when you’ll be busier. Calendar tie-in: Volunteer recruitment occurs in February and August Kick-offs are in March and September; our Volunteer Appreciation event is in June Board Committee Roles Marketing Committee Member We are looking for a few exceptional volunteers to help with marketing. The time commitment is approximately 4-8 hours per month. It’s a fun opportunity to engage with ACT, with less time commitment than other roles. ACT communicates with a range of stakeholders, including current and potential volunteers and client organizations. Examples of ACT marketing activities include interviewing ACT volunteers and clients and writing content for ACT communications, posting to the ACT LinkedIn page, and making sure the ACT web pages, social media presence and communications are effective. If you have an interest in marketing strategy and skills in at least one of these areas, please consider joining the team: Social media, especially LinkedIn Interviewing and writing Photography or graphic design We will tailor your tasks to your interest and scheduling needs.

Racial Equity Initiatives Committee Member Interested in helping ACT increase Racial Equity throughout our organization? We are looking for a few exceptional volunteers to help increase racial equity initiatives at ACT. The time commitment will be approximately 4-8 hours per month. In 2020, Dean Levin committed ACT to conduct 50 engagements for organizations or projects that focus on racial equity in the next 5 years. In order to support this, as well as to keep building and growing, the ACT MB made a commitment to strengthening racial equity throughout ACT. The ACT Racial Equity Committee will provide strategic guidance and hands-on impact work to support ACT and the Head of Racial Equity Initiatives (REI) to achieve its goals. In addition to providing guidance on the ACT Racial Equity Strategic Plan, volunteers may also contribute to the following activities: Building relationships with and soliciting strategic project proposals from organizations nationwide that focus on racial equity Serving as liaison to the Black and Latino alumni organizations as well as helping recruit BIPOC alumni volunteers Providing input and guidance to Volunteer Development to support Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging (DEIB) Supporting Marketing efforts to provide an equity lens for ACT Marketing Other activities as defined by the Head of REI and the committee We will tailor your tasks to your interest and scheduling needs.

Contact Kevin Richardson, Head of Racial Equity Initiatives for the ACT Management Board, if you would like more information on this role prior to volunteering. About the Management Board The ACT Management Board is an operational board, not an advisory board. ACT Management Board members are thinkers and doers. Each Management Board member has a functional area of responsibility and is committed to making ACT the best possible pro bono consulting experience for GSB alumni and our nonprofit clients. This takes considerable time and effort, but we think it’s worth it to sustain this continually improving premier pro bono consulting organization. The Management Board term is two years (with one year review for new members), the maximum service six years. Our year begins in September and ends in August. COVID allowing, we plan to start meeting in person on campus again in September, with even–numbered month meetings conducted remotely, via Zoom. Meetings are the second Wednesday of every month likely from 4:00–6:30 pm. About our Committees Some Management Board functions benefit from committees that support the work of that function; we have two such committees in need of members. Committee roles offer flexible volunteerism to suit your schedule. Please consider committee work as a step on the ACT volunteer pathway. Application Process Complete the ACT Management Board and Board Committee Interest Form to express your interest in one of the above roles and let us know your interests and talents by June 6, 2021. An ACT Nominating Committee member (for Management Board positions) will contact you about an interview later that week. ACT Committee applicants will be contacted by Peggy Lizaur, Head of Marketing Content, or Kevin Richardson, Head of Racial Equity Initiatives. Questions about a Management Board position?
