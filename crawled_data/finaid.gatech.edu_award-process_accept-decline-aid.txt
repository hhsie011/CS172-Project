This includes financial assistance from high schools, communities, civic and professional associations, and other programs. Students are responsible for providing official notification from the donor as soon as they are offered an award or scholarship. Upon receipt of the scholarship notification, OSFA will recalculate your eligibility for restricted and need-based aid. Federal regulations require students to report any scholarship, grant, special teacher rate, or other assistance received from sources other than Georgia Tech. Failure to do so may result in cancellation of any and all aid administered by Georgia Tech.
