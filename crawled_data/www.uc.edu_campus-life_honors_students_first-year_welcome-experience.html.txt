First year students will be placed into a small group which will be led by a returning UHP student who will be a resource to them. As a student, you will meet as a small group at least three times throughout the beginning of fall semester where you can meet other UHP students, learn more about different spots on campus and get your questions about UC, UHP, Cincinnati, and more answered. It is our hope that you make lasting connections with other UHP students for years to come! Questions? Email Bria Howard at bria.howard@uc.edu. Registration Registration will open Monday, June 6 at 10:00am and will close Friday July 29 at 11:59pm.
