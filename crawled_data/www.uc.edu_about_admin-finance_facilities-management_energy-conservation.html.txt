This BMS system allows for a sophisticated control of many of the largest pieces of equipment, lighting and HVAC systems operating throughout the campus buildings. Beyond the BMS, the preferred temperature control setpoints for the buildings during occupied periods at the university are 70°F heating and 74°F cooling. The University's staff sets back the temperatures and the airflows wherever possible. UC's unoccupied building temperature setpoints are 65°F heating and 78°F cooling. These unoccupied periods are determined by either an occupancy sensor or time of day schedule. Energy Efficiency Tips Facilities Management strives everyday to create a comfortable and sustainable environment to work and learn in. Here are some tips that you can do to personally reduce energy consumption that have a huge impact on the environment and reduce costs. Electricity Consumption Turn off the lights in unoccupied areas. Use compact fluorecent lights (CFLs) in lamps instead of incandescent bulbs. Turn off computers, printers and electronics that are not in use. Unplug appliances or electronics that will not be used for long periods of time and that can be safely unplugged without causing damage. Windows & Venting Keep windows closed. In winter, open window blinds only when exposed to direct sunlight. In summer, try to keep window blinds closed. Close exaust fans and laboratory hood fans when not in use. Heating and Cooling Wear layers of clothing that can be adapted to your current environment. Do not block air vents with furniture, backpacks, or other items. When leaving for extended periods of time, change your thermostat a few more degrees than you normally would have it set. Decrease the set temperature in winter and increase it in summer. If the temperature in your area is outside of the setpoints listed above, notify us.
