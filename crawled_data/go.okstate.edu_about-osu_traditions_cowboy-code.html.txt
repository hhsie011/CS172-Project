Fast Facts Live by the Code.Hailing from all 50 states and 100 countries, we are united by the Cowboy Code. We end the day knowing we gave it everything we had. We dream only as big as the sky. We know challenges come with pain, but pain will not win. We have a passion to do what's right, even when it's hard. We stand for what matters, even if we stand alone. We finish what we start. Being a Cowboy isn't in our clothes, it's in our character. Inspired by the book "Cowboy Ethics: What Wall Street Can Learn from The Code of the West." © 2004 James P.
