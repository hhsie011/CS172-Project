My research focuses primarily on imaging subsurface structure on a tectonic scale using surface-wave methods. I am most interested in lithospheric structure and evolution, particularly at plate margins. Science is an active process and I enjoy engaging with every step, from data collection in the field to science communication and outreach beyond the classroom. Fields of Interest seismology, surface-wave imaging, ambient noise, plate tectonics, slow slip, science outreach Education PhD, Seismology (proj. 2022) - Columbia University M.Phil, Seismology (2021) - Columbia University M.A., Seismology (2019) - Columbia University Sc.B. with Honors, Geology-Physics/Mathematics - Brown University Graduate Student, Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences (DEES) Contact Info Seismology 201D 61 Route 9W Palisades, New York 10964 USA [email protected] https://ccarchedi.github.io/ Download Curriculum Vitae Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory61 Route 9W · Palisades, NY 10964 Phone 845-359-2900 Contact Us [email protected] Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
