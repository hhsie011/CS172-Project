Keller, T. Keller, Livingston, Mariscal, Meredith, Outlaw, Quadagno, Reeves, Roberts, Roeder, Roux, Tschinkel The Department of Biological Science offers an undergraduate major in biological science that includes programs of study in most contemporary areas of biology. Specific academic concentrations within the major include cell and molecular biology; ecology, evolution, and environmental biology; marine biology; physiology and neuroscience; invertebrate and vertebrate zoology; plant sciences; and pre-professional health sciences. The requirements for the baccalaureate degree in biological science include most prerequisite courses necessary for admission to medical, dental, optometry, veterinary, osteopathic, chiropractic, and other allied health professional schools. In addition, students interested in marine science may complete the program in marine biology and living resources ecology as part of the major in biological science. The department offers a combined BS/MS degree pathway designed for academically gifted students who wish to pursue an accelerated program culminating in a BS degree in biological science and an MS degree in biological science. This program allows up to twelve semester hours of coursework to be dually counted toward both the BS and MS degrees. The department also offers a major in computational biology in conjunction with the Computer Science Department. This interdisciplinary major provides a top-notch educational program for students interested in the areas of computational biology and bioinformatics. The program seeks to achieve two goals: (1) to develop an understanding of the issues associated with developing biologically meaningful computational models, and (2) to give students the broad-based education that is needed to create a set of models directed toward solving a practical biomedical problem. The department offers a second interdisciplinary major, cell and molecular neuroscience, in conjunction with the Program in Neuroscience and the Department of Psychology. The major offers focused study of the brain, emphasizing the cellular and molecular processes that underlie the development, anatomy, physiology, and behavioral functions of the brain. The unique multidisciplinary breadth of the cell and molecular neuroscience major prepares students for a variety of STEM-related careers in scientific research and/or education, all health professions, and biomedical engineering. Course Repeat Policy in Biological Science According to FSU academic regulations, students will not be allowed additional credit for a course repeated in which the student originally made a “C–” or better unless the course is specifically designated as repeatable to allow additional credit. Students will not be allowed to take non-repeatable coursework in the department of biological science if they have already earned a passing grade of “C–” at FSU or as transfer credit unless they petition for permission from the department. Computer Skills Competency All undergraduates at Florida State University must demonstrate basic computer skills competency prior to graduation. As necessary computer competency skills vary from discipline to discipline, each major determines the courses needed to satisfy this requirement. Undergraduate majors in biological science and in biology/FSU-Teach satisfy this requirement by earning a grade of “C–” or higher in BSC 2010L.

FSU-Teach Program in Science Teaching For those interested in teaching Biological Science, FSU-Teach is an innovative approach to teacher education that involves a collaboration between scientists, mathematicians, and education faculty at Florida State University. In this program, students develop deep science or mathematics knowledge and the skill and experience needed to be an effective science or math teacher. FSU-Teach pays for tuition for the first two courses (Step 1 and Step 2). Work study positions with scientists, mathematicians and local schools are available. Prerequisites for admission to the Biological Science/FSU-Teach major are the same as the prerequisites for the Biological Science major. The program is a double-major only curriculum requiring students to complete a primary major in Biological Science in addition to a second major in Secondary Science and Mathematics Teaching (SSMT). The discipline area has a special track for FSU-Teach majors enabling students to complete the double major in four years (120 hours), or they may complete the normal discipline area track and the SSMT major with the understanding that they may exceed the excess credit-hour threshold and be subject to the excess credit surcharge (https://registrar.fsu.edu/records/excess_hours/). Students may begin taking courses in the program as soon as they matriculate at FSU. The program culminates with conferral of the baccalaureate degree with two majors and all coursework and state testing requirements for initial Florida teacher certification. Note that students seeking certification must be formally admitted to the School of Teacher Education and meet all of the requirements for pursuing a state-approved program. For information regarding the requirements for the second major in Science and Mathematics Teaching, please see the FSU-Teach chapter in this General Bulletin for School of Teacher Education. For additional information, see our Website: https://fsu-teach.fsu.edu/. Program in Computational Biology Computational biology is a new and promising field of study. The purpose of the interdisciplinary major is to provide a top-notch educational program for students interested in the areas of computational biology and bioinformatics. The program seeks to achieve two goals: 1) to develop an understanding of the issues associated with developing biological meaningful computational models, and 2) to give students the broad-based education that is needed to create a set of models directed towards solving a practical biomedical problem. This major is offered through both the Biological Science and Computer Science departments. Students in the program should be sure to consult with the advisors in their home department to make sure they are taking the correct courses in the correct sequence and that they are in compliance with the academic requirements of that department. For computational biology (biology) majors, this will include the prerequisites for upper division courses, the academic performance standards, the academic performance for retention policy, and the transient and co-op study policies listed for biological science majors.
