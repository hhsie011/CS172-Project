The HPCC provides free consulting and training services that include: • Introducing Campus Researchers to HPCC Resources • Introducing Campus Researchers to National Scale Resources • Code Optimization and Parallelization Strategies • Collaborating with Researchers and Their Students • Migrating User Workflows from PC to Linux Environments The HPCC's primary cluster is RedRaider, with a peak theoretical total computing power of approximately 2.2 petaflops, consisting of two CPU partitions and two GPU partitions. Other cluster computing resources include an interactive Open OnDemand partition and several specialty clusters and special-purpose resources. These clusters are designed to provide a natural stepping stone between capabilities available to researchers on their individual desktop, laptop and portable resources and those of highly competitive national and international-scale supercomputing resources. Dedicated computational resources to ensure priority computing may be purchased on an annual or pre-paid basis by individual researchers or research groups. For more detailed information, please refer to our page on HPCC equipment. The HPCC provides research computing-related data storage and network transfers within and beyond the campus to facilitate data movement among and between such resources. A large amount of common data storage is made available for general-purpose computing to support use of the clusters. Dedicated storage beyond these amounts may be purchased on an annual or pre-paid basis with or without backup services by individual researchers or research groups. For more information on data-related topics, please visit our pages on data transfers and data storage policies. The HPCC staff provides consulting and assistance to campus researchers with advanced computational software and/or hardware needs, along with consulting to support, configure and help users to port and optimize applications to make effective use of HPCC resources. Our team also assists campus researchers to scale up from local systems to national and international supercomputing resources. We accomplish this by organizing monthly training opportunities that cover use of such resources and by hosting cross-disciplinary seminars and meetings with research groups. The HPCC staff also serves as a liaison between various campus teams that are engaged in research. For more information, please visit our pages on user training, user guides and user support. The High Performance Computing Center's (HPCC) resources are distributed between two primary locations on campus, the Experimental Sciences Building and Chemistry building, and a machine room at the Reese Center off campus.
