The University of Washington encourages all employees to use Direct Deposit. Direct Deposit can be set up with any financial institution in the US, and can be split among up to three different bank accounts. You can enroll in Direct Deposit, and update the bank account(s) to which your paycheck should be deposited (i.e., your “payment elections”), at any time in Workday. For changes submitted in Workday to be effective in time for your next paycheck, you must submit them prior to the Timesheet Approval Deadline on the Payroll and Workday Approval Deadline Calendar. For step-by-step guidance for setting up Direct Deposit in Workday, refer to the Payment Elections User Guide. Take me to the User Guide Note for Student Employees Your payment election in Workday only directs the deposit of your UW paycheck. If you also receive financial aid or refunds for tuition and fees, and would like any balance transferred directly to your bank account, you will need to additionally enroll in the Direct Deposit Transfer program by selecting the Direct Deposit icon found on the Student Fiscal Services homepage. Updating Your Direct Deposit Payment Elections You can update the bank account(s) to which your paycheck should be deposited (i.e., your “payment elections”), at any time in Workday. Find step-by-step instructions for changing/updating your Direct Deposit information in Workday at the “Updating Your Payment Elections” section of the Payment Elections User Guide. Take me to the User Guide Closing Your Bank Account? If you are closing an account, be sure to update your direct deposit payment elections in Workday by at least 5 days prior to the upcoming payday to avoid having your funds be deposited into a closed/invalid account. If the update was not made in time, a paper check will be issued to you only after the funds are redirected back to the University by your financial institution. Exceptions cannot be made. Note that this process normally takes 3-4 business days. The many benefits of Direct Deposit include: Deposits are credited on payday. No worries about mail delays and lost or stolen checks. No check cashing fees. Many banks offer free checking and other incentives for UW employees using Direct Deposit. Save trees with less paper being used for printed paychecks and mailing envelopes.
