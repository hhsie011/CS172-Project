Home » About UC » UC Accreditation UC Accreditation The University of Cincinnati (UC) and all regional campuses are accredited by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC). HLC Statement of Accreditation Status The University of Cincinnati is an Ohio Public Institution, and each of its programs are approved by the Ohio Department of Higher Education (ODHE). ODHE Status What is Accreditation? Accreditation is the process whereby an outside organization certifies a college or university as meeting certain requirements of excellence. Accreditation is an important “stamp of approval,” accredited colleges and universities prove to their peers that they are deeply committed to educational quality and improvement. The designation serves as public recognition that an institution has met accepted standards of academic quality. What is the Higher Learning Commission (HLC)? The Higher Learning Commission (HLC) is an independent corporation that was founded in 1895 as one of six regional institutional accreditors in the United States. HLC accredits degree-granting post-secondary educational institutions in the North Central region, which includes 19 states. The mission of the Higher Learning Commission is to "serve the common good by assuring and advancing the quality of higher learning. What is the Process for Accreditation? University of Cincinnati's review will be carried out through the HLC Open Pathway process. The University is currently accredited by the Higher Learning Commission with the most recent reaffirmation of accreditation received in 2018. Reaccreditation is conducted on a ten-year cycle. This process includes writing an Assurance Argument, demonstrating Federal Compliance, and hosting a site visit by a team of reviewers comprised of faculty and staff from other universities with similar missions. As part of the Assurance Review, the institution submits an Assurance Argument - along with materials of evidence - explaining how the institution complies with each Criterion and Core Component. The peer review team also uses the Assurance System to conduct its review of the materials.
