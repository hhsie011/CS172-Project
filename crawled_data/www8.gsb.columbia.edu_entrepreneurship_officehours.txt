Review the following points before scheduling an appointment below: Preparation: To ensure a productive meeting for both parties, please make sure to perform due-diligence on each coach before booking time with them. Additionally, please come prepared to your coaching session with an agenda and a list of questions. Remote 30-min Sessions: Our Coaches currently* meet with students and alumni in 30-minute sessions via phone or video conference for advice and guidance. One Session at a Time: So that availability is relatively evenly distributed, sign up for one coaching slot at a time. First-come, first-served. Once you have met with a Lang Coach, you can sign up to meet with another one. After Signup: After you sign up for a session, you will receive an email from StartupTree regarding approval of your meeting request and logistics such as date, time, and a video conferencing link. Please check your inbox and junk/spam folders for this information. If you do not recieve an email with this information, please reach out to the Lang Center at [email protected]. When booking please use the same email that you use to sign into your StartupTree account. Cancellations: You must cancel any appointments you can no longer attend at least 1 business day in advance of your meeting. If you do not comply, we will block your ability to schedule future appointments. Session Topic Policy: You may not ask Coaches directly for funding, contacts, or sales/business leads; only seek advice and guidance. Violators may be blocked from scheduling future appointments. *When our policy changes from remote only, in-person appointment locations will be indicated in parentheses next to the Coach's name. Please visit our Office Hours Guidelines page to see our full policy on "Appointment Dos and Don'ts".
