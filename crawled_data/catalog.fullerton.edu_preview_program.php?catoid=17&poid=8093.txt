Admittance into the major is by audition. The entrance audition also serves as the placement audition. Students entering the program must attend an advisement session before enrolling in the major classes. Dance majors are required to enroll in a daily technique class. An assessment will determine advancement to the next level or the need to repeat the course. Majors who remain in the same level after two consecutive assessments will be counseled out of the major. Students may repeat up to eight units for each level in the requirements of modern and ballet technique and up to four units in the electives of jazz and tap technique. Repeatable courses meet major requirements.
