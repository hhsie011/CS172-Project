Degree Works is a tool designed to assist students in providing an overview of degree requirements and how coursework applies to their degree program. Students should work with their academic advisor to verify the information in their audit, develop an understanding of program requirements, discuss class registration, and verify final official degree clearance at the time of graduation. As of Fall 2018, degree audits are available for all active undergraduate degree/certificate programs and the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree.
