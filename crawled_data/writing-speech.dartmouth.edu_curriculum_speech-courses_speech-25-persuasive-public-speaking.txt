Approaching persuasive public speaking as transactional, students will engage in audience analysis during speech invention, organization, language choices, and delivery. Assignments include formal speeches (to convince and to actuate), brief extemporaneous speeches, speech and argument analyses, and peer speech evaluations. Peer group work will facilitate speech preparation and provide a forum to audition arguments and ideas. No prerequisites. Limited enrollment. Instructor: Compton. Distributive: ART. Offered: 22S: 10A. To view the ORC description, follow this link: Speech 25 We start the course with a basic question: How can we craft and deliver messages that influence and engage audiences? In this course, we will consider the process of persuasive public speaking from the origination of an idea through post-speech analysis and evaluation. We’ll draw on advice of ancient rhetoricians as well as contemporary scholars, including empirical social scientific investigations of affect, source credibility, and literary techniques. As part of our exploration of persuasive public speaking, we’ll consider persuasion in multiple domains, including marketing, law, and health campaigns. We’ll consider which challenges and opportunities are unique to public speaking venues while examining persuasion in mass- and computer-mediated messages. There will be two major formal speeches in the course, several brief speeches, written activities, peer evaluations, and class discussions. The online Blackboard (Bb) course site will be used often in the course for blog postings, discussions, document distribution, evaluations, pre- and post-speech analysis, Wikis, and other purposes. How do we transform our arguments into clear, convincing, compelling and credible speeches? How do we craft and deliver public messages that persuade? Discovering answers to these questions and many others will be a challenging and rewarding goal of this course. Course Goals The overriding goal of the course is for you to become a more persuasive and informed public speaker, with improved skills in researching, organizing, developing, and delivering persuasive messages. Ethics of persuasive speaking will be considered at each stage of the process. To achieve this goal, we will aim for the following primary learning objectives: to become better persuasive public speakers through the practice of persuasive public speaking; to help others become better persuasive speakers through observation, collaboration, and constructive criticism. (A more nuanced idea of what we what we mean by “better” is another goal of this course.) To meet these primary objectives, I will help you to: offer a thoughtful definition of what it means to persuade; gain insight into contemporary persuasive speaking from ancient and contemporary rhetorical principles; read and explain persuasion scholarship; survey persuasion, social influence, and compliance-gaining theories to craft more persuasive messages; incorporate understandings of dissonance into speeches; discover effective methods of choosing and refining persuasive speech topics and theses; demonstrate ways of incorporating ethos, pathos, and logos appeals into speeches; use speech organizational strategies that best articulate your persuasive arguments; select wording that is clear, concise, accurate, and impacting; practice persuasive delivery techniques, including nonverbal, vocal, and paralinguistic factors; ponder ethical challenges of persuasive public speaking; develop and assess counter-positions of arguments; summarize, analyze, and apply contemporary persuasion research findings; survey persuasive messages strategies in health, law, and marketing contexts; increase confidence in your public speaking aptitude; improve critical listening skills; and adapt persuasive approaches to changing contexts.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Institute for Writing and Rhetoric Philosophy & Aims About Writing at Dartmouth Speech at Dartmouth Our Stories The Story of Writing Instruction at Dartmouth The Story of Speech at Dartmouth The Story of Writing Support at Dartmouth Curriculum Overview Writing Courses Writing 2-3 WRIT 5 First-Year Seminars Humanities 1-2 Speech Courses Speech 20 Speech 25 Speech 26 Speech 27 Speech 30 Speech 31 Speech 33 Speech 34 Speech 36 Speech 37 Speech 40 Placement and Enrollment Policies First-Year Writing & First-Year Seminar Requirements Differences Among First-Year Writing Courses FAQ Directed Self-Placement Process for Writing Registration for Writing 5 or Writing 2-3 Registration for First Year Seminars FAQ First-year Writing Registration First-year Writing Choices Prizes Writing Prize Winners Speech Contest Winners Speech Contest Call for Entries Learning Overview Writing Center Make an Appointment Materials Sources and Citations at Dartmouth Teaching Overview Guidelines Teaching Writing in the First Year Expectations for Writing 2-3 Expectations for Writing 5 Teaching the First-Year Seminar First-Year Writing: Pedagogies, Methods, & Design Active Learning in the First-Year Writing Classroom Syllabus and Assignment Design Teaching Writing as Process Integrating Reading and Writing Diagnosing and Responding to Student Writing Conducting Writing Workshops Collaborative Learning/Learning with Peers Teaching Argument Teaching Research Addressing Grammar Useful links Support The Writing Assistant Program Research Past Research Activities Research Overview Multilingual Overview Support for Undergraduate Students Support for Graduate Students Faculty Support News & People People News Employment Upcoming Events Past Events My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
