Texas Tech University Directory Raiderlink A-Z Index Office of Research Commercialization Menu Search TTU Research Home For Inventors Disclose an Invention Faculty members should file an invention disclosure form when they believe they have discovered something new that has possible commercial value, or when the terms of a sponsored research project require disclosure of any invention. Ideally, disclosure should occur before your work is published or any other public disclosure of your work is made. Not disclosing before you make your work public can affect a potential patent for which you might file, especially internationally. As a general rule, an inventor has one year from first public disclosure of his/her work in which to file for a patent. When you file an invention disclosure with ORC, please make sure to inform the office if you have already or expect to soon discuss your invention publicly.
