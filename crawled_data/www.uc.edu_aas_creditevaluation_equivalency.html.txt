This tool is intended to provide a preview of how courses from other institutions may transfer to UC. Course evaluation reports are provided once an application for admissions is completed and all required official transcripts for prior coursework are submitted. For more information, see our overview of the credit evaluation process. The Transfer Equivalency Database is updated frequently with the intention of being as accurate as possible. Please note that information available here is subject to change at any time and is not a guarantee of transfer. Can't find your course? UC transfers many courses that are not yet listed below. If you cannot find a course, it does not mean it’s not eligible for transfer credit; it may not have been evaluated yet. Members of the Credit Evaluation staff at UC will evaluate all your courses once you complete the admissions process described above. Can I appeal a transfer credit decision? Yes. Please contact your assigned academic advisor at your home college to determine whether: A degree audit exception is appropriate for your transfer credit to be applied towards your degree OR A transfer credit appeal form should be submitted for review.
