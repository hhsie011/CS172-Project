Our Diversity Counseling and Outreach Specialists provide counseling, support, and outreach for student populations with marginalized and underrepresented identities. Although our Diversity Counseling and Outreach Specialists have a unique role in specializing services to reach these student populations, all CMHC clinicians and staff are specifically trained in and committed to working with our diverse student body. Diversity Counseling and Outreach Specialists Support Services for Students Diversity Counseling and Outreach Specialists meet the needs of the campus community in different ways. In an effort to provide services that are convenient for students, CMHC offers a number of ways to connect with the Diversity Counseling and Outreach Specialists, both inside and outside of the Counseling and Mental Health Center. Open identity-based discussion groups supporting the mental health needs of marginalized and underserved communities. These are drop-in groups and do not require participants to sign up ahead of time. Here is a list of groups currently available and their locations. Consultation: Diversity Counseling and Outreach Specialists can provide consultation sessions for students experiencing identity-related concerns that are impacting well-being or academic success. During these consultation sessions, students have the opportunity to talk with a Diversity Counseling and Outreach Specialist about their individual situation and engage in some short-term problem solving. Call CMHC at 512-471-3515 and ask to schedule a consultation session with a Diversity Counseling and Outreach Specialist. Individual counseling sessions with Diversity Counseling and Outreach Specialist. If you have a preference for a particular counselor based on identity, please let the BART (Brief Assessment and Referral) counselor know when you schedule. At certain times throughout the year when appointment demand is high, there may be a longer wait to be seen by a Diversity Counseling and Outreach Specialist. Keep in mind that all CMHC clinicians have been trained to serve our diverse study body. Outreach programs to students for building awareness of mental health and self-care Support during campus community events Collaboration with Faculty and Staff: Diversity Counseling and Outreach Specialists work closely with faculty and staff to offer consultation, trainings, and support as they work directly with students; however, the services provided to students are always confidential.
