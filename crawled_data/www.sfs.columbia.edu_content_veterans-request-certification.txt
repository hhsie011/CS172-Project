Comments If you have any additional notes or circumstances we should know about regarding your Columbia enrollment or VA benefits, please use this space to inform us. I understand that in order to comply with Veterans Administration (VA) regulations, Columbia University must submit registration and, at times, academic progress reports to the VA. Furthermore, I understand that any changes in my registration status or enrollment (e.g. add, drop, withdrawal) may affect the VA benefit amounts and, as a result, other financial aid, I receive, or may result in a balance owed to the VA. I further understand that if my enrollment changes I am responsible for submitting a revised copy of this form reflecting the changes. Finally, I understand that I am responsible for any outstanding balance on my student account that is not covered by VA benefits.
