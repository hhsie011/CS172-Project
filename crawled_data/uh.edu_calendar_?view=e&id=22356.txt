McGovern College of the Arts Link to Graduate Catalog MFA Program Many art schools are engaged in a national debate on how best to educate emerging artists. Many have devised programs that take certain positions relative to current innovations in the field, or in anticipation of future trends. At the University Of Houston School Of Art, we reframed that discussion by focusing not on the contextual fields of practice, but rather on you – the practitioner. You are the only stable and absolutely central component in the equation. The only question worth asking is not how you might fit into our program, but rather how we might fit into yours. This question needs asking of each student who enters our MFA program, and each answer will necessarily be as unique as each individual. We fit into “your program” by devising programs that are flexible and dynamic and by creating the environments that help you to broaden and deepen your investigations.
