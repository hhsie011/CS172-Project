Photo by Tony Rinaldo The Schlesinger Library holdings date from the founding of the United States to the present and include more than 4,400 manuscript collections, 150,000 volumes of books and periodicals, and films, photos, and audiovisual material. Researchers travel from around the world to use the Schlesinger’s rich holdings. In addition to its traditional strengths in the history of feminisms, women’s health, and women’s activism, the Library’s collections document the intersectional workings of race and ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and class in American history.

She was the main architect of the campaign in the 1910s to pass the 19th Amendment to the US Constitution, which gave women the right to vote. View Collection Beecher-Stowe Family The Beecher-Stowe Family was a prominent New England family noted for its contributions in the fields of education, religion, social reform, and literature. View Collection Susan B. Anthony Best known as an iconic women’s rights activist who played a pivotal role in the campaign for women’s suffrage, Susan B. Anthony (1820‒1906) was also involved in a number of other 19th century social reform movements, including temperance, abolition, and labor rights. The library has digitized several small collections of her papers, consisting of correspondence, diaries, and speeches along with photographs, inscribed books, and related memorabilia. View Collection Blackwell Family The extraordinary Blackwell family, four generations of whom are represented in these papers, played important roles in 19th and 20th century American social reform movements: abolition of slavery, women’s rights, woman’s suffrage, and temperance. For more than a century and across generations, the Blackwells offered each other advice on courtship, marriage, finances, domestic relations, health, and childrearing. In addition to personal and family matters, these documents highlight the important issues the Blackwell family confronted. View Collection Charlotte Perkins Gilman Charlotte Perkins Gilman (1860–1935) was many things throughout her life: philosopher, artist, novelist, lecturer, mother, divorcée, editor, suffragist, journalist, wife, invalid, and publisher. She was a popular and influential public figure who tirelessly worked against women's inequality inside and outside the home, and she wrote about the social changes she thought necessary to achieve gender equality. She is the author of the short story "The Yellow Wallpaper."
