Critical Cardinal Conversations: Training Sessions The Office of Diversity Education and Inclusive Excellence (DEIE) looks for staff and faculty members who desire to engage in the work of having Critical Conversations. Training is offered to those interested in hosting book clubs and real talk conversations. These training balance both liberation and education as trainees learn more about their individual identities, as well as how those identities impact our daily interactions. Trainees also learn how to effectively navigate difficult dialogues. Critical Cardinal Conversations: Book Club Cohort Model Book Club Cohorts are designed to build community among individuals committed to taking a journey together by engaging with a book around critical topics on diversity, inclusion, equity, and social justice. Cohorts meet monthly to discuss the readings as well as connect the reading to real issues in our community. One cohort unpacked Michelle Alexander’s critically acclaimed book, The New Jim Crow. In addition to reading and discussing this book, the cohort also examined the documentary 13th and participated in prison tours in order to gain a better understanding of how prisons operate. Finally, the cohort agreed to come up with an action plan to respond in a way that addressed systemic barriers. Critical Cardinal Conversations: The Aftermath Series The Critical Cardinal Conversations: The Aftermath Series is designed to create a safe space for our campus community to engage in critical dialogue around issues of diversity, inclusion, equity, and social justice that impact our communities. Monthly facilitated dialogues will occur with predetermined topics selected by The Office of Diversity Education and Inclusive Excellence.
