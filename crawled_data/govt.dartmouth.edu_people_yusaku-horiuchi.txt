My research focuses on applying experimental designs and statistical methods to a wide range of empirical questions in political science. With substantive interests in Foreign/Global Public Opinion, Japanese Politics, Diversity, Elections, Political Methodology, and Other Topics, I have published many articles, including articles published or forthcoming in the American Journal of Political Science (2 articles), the American Political Science Review (2 articles), the British Journal of Political Science, Comparative Political Studies, the Journal of Politics, Nature Communications, Political Analysis (2 articles), Political Behavior (3 articles), Science Advances, and World Politics, as well as two books. I have used observational and experimental data from Japan, as well as other countries, such as Australia, France, Israel, South Korea, Venezuela, the United Kingdom, and the United States, to study many topics (see Portfolio). At Dartmouth, I teach Quantitative Political Analysis (GOVT10), an introductory course on empirical research designs and statistics; Data Visualization (GOVT16/QSS17), an introduction to data wrangling and data visualization with R; and Politics of Japan (GOVT40/AMES43). I earned an M.A. in international and development economics from Yale University in 1995 and a Ph.D. in political science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2001. I have held visiting appointments at Keio University in Japan, the Australian National University in Australia, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. + View more Personal Website Contact Yusaku.Horiuchi@Dartmouth.edu Silsby 204 HB 6108 Department(s) Government, Quantitative Social Science Center(s) The John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding Education B.A. Keio University (Tokyo, Japan) M.A. Yale University Ph.D. Massachusetts Institute of Technology Areas of Expertise foreign/global public opinion /Japanese Poliics /Diversity /Elections /Political Methodology /Other Topics Selected Publications Please visit my website: horiuchi.org Works In Progress Please visit my website: horiuchi.org Courses Data Visualization (GOVT16, MSS17) Quantitative Political Analysis (GOVT10) The Politics of Japan: A Unique Democracy?

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Government About Why Government?
