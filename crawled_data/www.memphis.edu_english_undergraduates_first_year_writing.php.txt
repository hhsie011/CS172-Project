The First-Year Writing Program at the University of Memphis is a two-course sequence that emphasizes the analytical and research strategies that encourage students to become thoughtful readers and effective writers who understand how writers make meaning through language. English 1010 introduces students to writing as a subject of study and explores the choices writers make to shape messages for particular audiences. English 1020 further enhances the skills of assessing audience, purpose, and structures that allow students to construct arguments and compose effective researched essays.
