The exhibit follows the trajectory of Christopher Robinson (Brown 1825) from his roots in abolitionist Woonsocket through his stint as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the American Consulate in Lima during the Civil War. This little-known Brown alumnus — a renowned lawyer in his day — was a key player in the effort to write a state constitution for Rhode Island, and an unfettered advocate for democracy in the United States and abroad. Beloved in Peru, Robinson made friends and contacts easily, even meeting with Garibaldi in Europe at an international peace conference in 1867. Discover the story of this fascinating Rhode Islander who, until now, had been buried by history. This exhibition has been endorsed by the Rhode Island Civil War Sesquicentennial Commission.
