Computer Science Courses Computer Science Faculty Computer Science Website Print Open All Close All Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science The curriculum for the bachelor of arts degree in Computer Science is based on current recommendations of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) for liberal arts institutions. The program is designed both to provide a solid foundation in the fundamentals of computer science and to provide practical, hands-on experience with computing systems, as the current technology job market dictates. Bachelor of arts students complete a 34-credit computer science component, supplemented by a mathematics component rooted in calculus. For most students, the program requires completion of fourteen 3-credit courses along with one 1-credit lab. Computer Science Component The 34 credits required for completion of the bachelor of arts major are grouped into two categories, seven required core courses (totaling 22 credits) and four electives (totaling at least 12 credits). The seven required core courses are the following: CSCI1101 Computer Science I CSCI1102 Computer Science II CSCI2243 Logic and Computation CSCI2244 Randomness and Computation CSCI2271 Computer Systems CSCI2272 Computer Organization and Lab CSCI3383 Algorithms All of these courses are 3 credits with the exception of CSCI2272, which is 4 credits. The remaining 12 credits will typically be earned from four courses with 3 credits earned through any CSCI courses numbered CSCI2000 or above and at least 9 of the credits earned from courses at the CSCI3000 level or above. Logic and Computation and Randomness and Computation (CSCI2243 and CSCI2244) provide students with mathematical fundamentals necessary for Computer Science. It is especially important that these be completed no later than the end of junior year, since this material is a prerequisite for the required course Algorithms (CSCI3383). CSCI2243 and CSCI2244 are also required prerequisites for many 3000-level CSCI electives. Mathematics Component One semester of calculus at the level of Calculus II for science majors or higher is required for completion of the bachelor of arts major. Students will ordinarily complete the calculus requirement with any one of the following courses: MATH1103 (Calculus II for Science Majors), MATH1105 (Calculus II–AP), or MATH2202 (Multivariable Calculus). Many students will need to complete a prerequisite calculus course (e.g., MATH1102 (Calculus I for Science Majors) before MATH1103), so this calculus requirement is often satisfied by enrolling in a two-semester sequence. Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Bachelor of Science in Computer Science The curriculum for the bachelor of science major in Computer Science is designed to provide an extensive background in computer science and is well suited for students considering graduate study or students planning to pursue careers in science or engineering. Bachelor of science students must complete a 38-credit computer science component, supplemented by a mathematics component and a natural science component. Computer Science Component The bachelor of science major in Computer Science requires a minimum of 37 credits in computer science. The computer science credits are grouped into two categories: seven required CSCI courses (totaling 22 credits) and five elective courses (totaling at least 15 credits). The seven required core courses are: CSCI1101 Computer Science I CSCI1102 Computer Science II CSCI2243 Logic and Computation CSCI2244 Randomness and Computation CSCI2271 Computer Systems CSCI2272 Computer Organization and Lab CSCI3383 Algorithms All of these courses are 3 credits with the exception of CSCI2272, which is 4 credits. Of the 15 credits of electives, 3 credits must be earned from one course in the social and ethical issues cluster (CSCI2260–2267) and at least 12 credits must be from courses numbered CSCI3000 or above. Logic and Computation and Randomness and Computation (CSCI2243 and CSCI2244) provide students with mathematical fundamentals necessary for Computer Science. It is especially important that these be completed no later than the end of junior year, since this material is prerequisite for the required course Algorithms (CSCI3383). CSCI2243 and CSCI2244 are also required prerequisites for many 3000-level CSCI electives. Mathematics Component At least 12 credits of mathematics are required for completion of the bachelor of science major: MATH1103 Calculus II (Math/Science majors) or MATH1105 Calculus II–AP (Math/Science majors) MATH2202 Multivariable Calculus MATH2210 Linear Algebra Any MATH course 3000 or higher, other than MATH 4426 Probability. Since many students will need to complete MATH1102 before taking MATH1103, this calculus requirement will often be met by enrolling in a two-semester sequence. Science Component A two-semester sequence in a laboratory science for science majors. The sequences that fulfill this requirement can be chosen from among Biology, Chemistry, Physics or Earth and Environmental Sciences. Biology: BIOL2000 Molecules and Cells, BIOL2010 Ecology and Evolution and BIOL2040 Investigations in Molecular Cell Biology Lab, or BIOL2000 Molecules and Cells, BIOL3030 Introduction to Physiology and BIOL2040 Investigations in Molecular Cell Biology Lab; Chemistry: CHEM1109/1111/113 General Chemistry I and CHEM1110/1112/1114 General Chemistry II or CHEM1117/1119/1121 Honors Modern Chemistry I and CHEM1118/1120/1122 Honors Modern Chemistry II; Physics: PHYS2200/2050 Introductory Physics I (Calculus) and PHYS2201/2051 Introductory Physics II (Calculus); Earth and Environmental Sciences: Option #1 Exploring the Earth EESC1132/1133 Then any two of the following 2-credit Environmental Systems courses: EESC2202/2212 Ecosystems EESC2203/2213 Water Resources EESC2204/2214 The Critical Zone EESC2205/2215 Climate Change EESC2206/2216 Oceans EESC2207/2217 Earthquakes EESC2208/2218 Quantitative Methods Option #2 Exploring the Earth EESC1132/1133 Then any 2000, 3000, or 4000 level class in EESC (note the prerequisites) Option #3 Any two of the following 2-credit Environmental Systems courses: EESC2202/2212 Ecosystems EESC2203/2213 Water Resources EESC2204/2214 The Critical Zone EESC2205/2215 Climate Change EESC2206/2216 Oceans EESC2207/2217 Earthquakes EESC2208/2218 Quantitative Methods Then any 2000, 3000, or 4000 level class in EESC (note the prerequisites) Departmental Honors Departmental Honors Junior and senior Computer Science majors with at least a 3.3 GPA in CSCI courses are eligible to join the Departmental Honors Program. In order to graduate with the Departmental Honors designation, eligible students must maintain at least a 3.3 GPA in CSCI courses and complete a senior thesis. Thesis requirements are to have a thesis proposal approved by a faculty advisor and by the Honors Committee by the end of junior year. Students in the Departmental Honors Program must Complete two sections of CSCI4961 Honors Thesis during their senior year with grades of B+ or higher; Submit a written honors thesis by the last day of class in the second semester of senior year, and Give a 30-minute presentation of their thesis at the end of their senior year. Students participating in the Honors Program are required to take both sections of CSCI4961 Honors Thesis. One section of CSCI4961 Honors Thesis may count as a CSCI 3000-level elective. The Minor Program The Minor Program The minor program in Computer Science is designed to provide an introduction to computer science, primarily for mathematics and science majors. It is also suitable for students with a strong secondary interest in computer science and good analytical skills. 18 credits are required for completion of the minor. The requirements for a Minor in Computer Science are: CSCI1101 Computer Science I CSCI1102 Computer Science II Two electives numbered 2000 or higher (only one of: CSCI2257 Database Systems and Applications or CSCI2267 Technology and Culture may count toward this requirement) Two electives numbered 3000 or higher Students pursuing a minor in computer science should carefully consider the prerequisites of 3000-level courses when selecting 2000-level electives. Several 3000-level electives specify CSCI2243 Logic and Computation and/or CSCI2271 Computer Systems as prerequisites. The 3000-level CSCI electives are in high demand, so minors should be prepared for a wide variety of 3000-level electives. Students wishing to pursue a minor emphasizing computer science should consider the foundations sequence: CSCI2243 Logic and Computation and CSCI2244 Randomness and Computation (to be taken after CSCI2243) Students wishing to pursue application development or applications of computer science in management may wish to consider: CSCI2254 Web Application Development and CSCI2257 Database Systems and Applications Students wishing to pursue applications in data science may wish to consider: CSCI2244 Randomness and Computation (to be taken after CSCI2243), CSCI3346 Data Mining, or CSCI3345 Machine Learning Students wishing to pursue applications in security may wish to consider: CSCI2201 Computer Security, CSCI2243 Logic and Computation, and CSCI3381 Cryptography Interdisciplinary Concentration in Bioinformatics Interdisciplinary Concentration in Bioinformatics The Bioinformatics Concentration is offered to students majoring in Biology, Mathematics, or Computer Science. Please note that courses in this concentration may overlap with major or minor requirements. In addition, a semester of bioinformatics research within a lab can be substituted for either one of the three additional computer science courses or the computational biology course. Students wishing to pursue this option should visit the Biology Department (Higgins 355) for course approval.

Both B.S. and B.A. majors are designed to provide a solid foundation in the fundamentals of computer science. At the same time, they provide practical, hands-on experience, as the current technological job market dictates. Students are prepared for a variety of careers such as software development, network administration, technical support, and systems analysis. In addition, knowledge of computing technology is becoming increasingly important for people entering business, law, and the health care fields. First-Year Computer Science Majors First-year students considering majoring in Computer Science should plan to complete the program's calculus requirement (MATH1102 or higher) during their first year. Most will enroll in MATH1100 in fall semester and continue with MATH1102 in spring semester. Students who either carry advanced mathematics placement or who have completed a year of calculus in high school, should enroll directly in MATH1102 (or a more advanced course) in the fall semester. First-year students wishing to double major in Computer Science and Mathematics should take the calculus sequence recommended for the Mathematics major. First-year students with prior programming experience are encouraged to take CSCI1101 Computer Science I, whether or not they have coding experience. Students who have had no programming experience should consider beginning with Principles of Computer Science (CSCI1080) in their first semester. First-year students who have achieved a score of 4 or higher on the Computer Science AP examination or students entering with significant programming backgrounds should speak with the Undergraduate Program Director about course placement. First-Year Non-majors The department periodically offers introductory 3-credit courses in computer science: CSCI1080, CSCI1101, and CSCI2227. CSCI1080 and CSCI1101 are the introductory programming courses. One of these is required of all Computer Science majors and minors and is a prerequisite for all advanced computer science courses. The skills needed to write computer programs come easily to some people and less easily to others. Students who have little or no programming experience and are apprehensive about their ability should consider enrolling in CSCI1080 before enrolling in CSCI1101. CSCI2227 is an introduction to programming with an orientation to scientific applications, using MATLAB as the programming language. Transfer Credits and Placement for Computer Science Courses Transfer Credits and Placement for Computer Science Courses The Computer Science Department will accept transfer credits from other schools with documentation (for example, syllabi) sufficient for us to determine course equivalence. Before taking an external course, check BC's academic policies. AP, IB, and GCE scores are used to make placement decisions, but not for course credit. Specifically, students who score a 5 on the Computer Science A exam, or a 4 or 5 on the Computer Science AB exam, or who have significant programming experience should consult with the Chairperson of the Department or Undergraduate Program Director about starting the Computer Science course sequence with CSCI1102. Course Availability Course Availability Most introductory courses (e.g., CSCI1101 and CSCI1102) are available every semester. CSCI1080 is offered every fall. All courses that are required for the major are offered at least once each academic year. Most advanced electives are offered only in alternate years; hence, student schedules should be designed carefully. Course Credit Information Course Credit Information All Computer Science courses are prefixed by the letters CSCI and are registered as courses in the Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences.
