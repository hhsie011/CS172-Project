The university strives to impart an appreciation and broad understanding of the human experience throughout the world and the ages. This education extends to diverse cultural legacies and accomplishments in many areas, such as the arts and technology; the advancement of human thought including philosophy and science; the development of economic, political, and social institutions; and the physical and biological evolution of humans and their environment. San Diego State University pursues its mission through its many diverse departments and interdisciplinary programs in the creative and performing arts, the humanities, the sciences, and the social and behavioral sciences. History San Diego State University is the oldest higher education institution in San Diego. Since its founding in 1897, the university has grown to become a leading public research university, and a federally-designated Hispanic-serving Institution as well as an Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institution (AANAPISI). Each year, SDSU provides more than 36,000 students with the opportunity to participate in an academic curriculum distinguished by direct contact with faculty and an international emphasis that prepares them for a global future. In The Beginning Serving the San Diego region has always been a core part of SDSU’s mission. Founded March 13, 1897, San Diego State University began as the San Diego Normal School, a training facility for elementary school teachers. Seven faculty and 91 students met in temporary quarters over a downtown drugstore before moving to a newly constructed 17-acre campus on Park Boulevard. The curriculum was first limited to English, history and mathematics. Course offerings broadened rapidly under the leadership of first president, Samuel T. Black, who left his position as state superintendent of public instruction to become the new school's first president. Black served from 1898 to 1910. From 1910 to 1935, SDSU President Edward L. Hardy headed a vigorous administration that oversaw major changes to the fledgling institution. In 1921, the Normal School became San Diego State Teachers College, a four-year public institution controlled by the state Board of Education. In that same year, the two-year San Diego Junior College, forerunner of today's local community colleges, became a branch of San Diego State Teachers College. That union lasted until 1946. 1931 Relocation By the 1920s, the college was already beginning to outgrow its Park Boulevard location, and San Diegans launched a campaign to build a new campus on the city's eastern border. In February 1931, students, faculty and staff moved into seven buildings surrounding a common area still known as the Main Quad. SDSU's new campus on Montezuma Mesa in 1930. Four years later, the state Legislature authorized expansion of degree programs beyond teacher education, and San Diego State Teachers College became San Diego State College. In 1935, Walter R. Hepner took the helm as SDSU president, beginning a 17-year tenure. The college continued to grow over time, reaching an enrollment of more than 25,000 students during the administration of Malcolm A. Love, who served as president from 1952 to 1971. The SDSU Library is named after Love. The SDSU Library is named after Malcolm A. Love, who served as SDSU president from 1952 to 1971. In 1959, what is now known as SDSU Imperial Valley was founded on the original site of the first Calexico High School. In 1960, San Diego State College became part of the newly created California State College system, now known as The California State University system. In 1963, just months before he was assassinated, U.S. President John F. Kennedy gave the commencement address at San Diego State College. President Kennedy received the university's first honorary doctorate – also the first in the CSU system. U.S. President John F. Kennedy giving the 1963 SDSU Commencement address. In the early 1970s, with legislative approval, San Diego State College became San Diego State University. Leading the university during the 1970s were Acting President Donald E. Walker (1971-1972), President Brage Golding (1972-1977), Acting President Trevor Colbourn (1977-1978) and President Thomas B. Day, whose tenure spanned 1978 to 1996. Day championed the teacher-scholar model for faculty and promoted research across campus. His vision led the way for new areas of exploration and an increase in research grants and contracts awarded to SDSU faculty. In 1996, Stephen L. Weber became the university's seventh president, presiding over the university's significant gains in student preparation and graduation, study abroad, philanthropy, research and other areas of excellence. Elliot Hirshman served as president of San Diego State University from 2011 to June 30, 2017 – a period in which SDSU raised its profile as a major public research university. SDSU created a new strategic plan, raised over $800 million for scholarships and new initiatives and programs, established and endowed the Susan and Stephen Weber Honors College, and built and remodeled facilities across campus. Former SDSU presidents Stephen L. Weber, Elliot Hirshman and Thomas B. Day. Sally Roush – a former senior vice president at SDSU – began her term as interim president on July 1, 2017. She is the first woman to be named president of San Diego State University. On Jan. 31, it was announced that Adela de la Torre, vice chancellor for student affairs and campus diversity at University of California, Davis, would become the university's ninth president in late June 2018, and the first woman to be named permanent president of SDSU. Under the charge of SDSU President Adela de la Torre came the development of SDSU Mission Valley, SDSU Imperial Valley's expansion and a new, 5-year strategic plan. In her first several years as president, de la Torre is credited with leading new initiatives that leverage the university’s historic legacy to elevate the campus into a new era of excellence. Under de la Torre’s tenure, the university launched a new, 5-year strategic plan, saw record increases in philanthropy, diversified the university’s funding and auxiliary sources to balance revenue streams and expanded investments in SDSU Imperial Valley. The university also saw improvements in student retention and graduation rates and closed equity gaps across several categories through expanded investments in advising, innovative use of virtual technologies, support programs, student aid initiatives, health and well-being offerings and other efforts. De la Torre led the university through its response plan during the COVID-19 pandemic, launching and sustaining SDSU Flex, a flexible repopulation, instruction and business continuity plan. The purchase, groundbreaking and initial construction of SDSU Mission Valley also began under de la Torre’s tenure. A critical component of SDSU Mission Valley is the innovation district, which is important to growing the university’s already unique status as a high research-activity, community-engaged, border-connected, emerging R-1 institution.
