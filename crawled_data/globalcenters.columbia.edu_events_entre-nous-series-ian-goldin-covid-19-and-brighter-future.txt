Described by Arianna Huffington as “essential reading” and by Gordon Brown as “a fresh and penetrating insight...into what’s gone wrong with our world and what needs to be put right,” Rescue: From Global Crisis to a Better World calls for an optimistic future and one we all have the power to create. Published in the shadow of a pandemic that swept (and continues to sweep) across the world, Goldin argues that we are at a crossroads, that Covid-19 has destroyed global norms, and that many think (wrongly) that after the devastation there will be a bounce back. But it is business as usual, Goldin writes, that led to the pandemic; and it is business as usual that will lead to a dystopian future. In his book, Goldin tackles the challenges and opportunities posed by the pandemic, ranging from globalisation to the future of jobs, income inequality and geopolitics, the climate crisis and the future of cities. Ultimately, Rescue provides an urgently needed roadmap that reveals how the pandemic could lead to a better world.
