Not this world, hostile and unkind, but the one we are building in the lines of poems, in our wildest melatonin dreams, in the dirt of our gardens and the recipes passed down to us in a language that we have not yet forgotten. I catch glimpses of it in the tsunami of voices that floods the streets after another life is snatched from a mother’s grasp, their demands for justice impossible to ignore. I feel it in my friend’s deliberate knuckles massaging coconut oil into my scalp, how their steady hands unworry my brow. Everywhere I look, aliveness. I open my cupboard to discover the plump red face of a tomato that I forgot to turn into pasta sauce, now blooming soft tufts of mold, the stubborn insistence of life in even the harshest conditions. I slice the tip of my finger while chopping cloves of garlic, and before the first drop of blood has blushed the counter, it coagulates at the edge of the wound— a miracle, this body, how it has already begun to heal before I’ve even registered the hurt. When I say You deserve the world, what I mean is this is not the first apocalypse we have survived. The world has ended before, and before and before, and for some, there was no after. We have watched its rind cracking open like a freshly broken heart, and each time we build and rebuild. We kiss our houseplants on their leafy foreheads before we go to sleep. We dress our bodies in the most brilliant light. We dance like the empire is dying, water the ground where it once stood, and watch what blooms, lush and verdant, in its wake.
