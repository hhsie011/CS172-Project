More about Rutgers’ 250th The Rutgers Shield Introduced in 2015 in celebration of Rutgers’ 250th anniversary in 2016, the Rutgers shield honors our roots and affirms our values while providing greater flexibility when used as 21st-century iconography in pageantry, publishing, and promotion. Learn about the symbolism in the shield and why it is a fundamental expression of the university’s identity. The Rutgers Shield: A Symbol of Our Past and Our Present The shield’s elements convey where we have been and who we are now. The shield is divided into thirds, representing Rutgers’ deep connections to New Jersey’s three regions—north, central, and south—and denoting the university’s tripartite mission—teaching, research, and service. Five symbolic elements both acknowledge our past and promise for the future. Sunburst The sunburst conveys illumination—light as metaphor for knowledge—and it is the motif of our seal and the heart of our motto, “Sun of righteousness, shine upon the West also.” Our centuries-old seal and motto are both variants on those of Utrecht University, the Netherlands; its motto reads, “Sun of righteousness, enlighten us.” The Crown The crown represents our founding in 1766 as Queen’s College, named in honor of Queen Charlotte, wife of Great Britain’s King George III who reigned over the American colonies when our charter was signed. Queen Charlotte is an apt early namesake: current scholarship finds she cared deeply for education, and, against convention, ensured that her six daughters were educated as well as her nine sons. 1766 Rutgers was founded in 1766 and is one of America’s nine original colonial colleges. A decade later, as the American Revolution erupted, the college gave itself over to the cause of freedom, as all “who were able to bear arms immediately marched to oppose the enemy.” Rutgers people today continue to passionately champion just causes. Stars The three stars represent the State of New Jersey, the third state to ratify the U.S. Constitution. Rutgers is devoted to serving our home state as New Jersey’s land-grant school and is proud to be The State University of New Jersey. Book The book is a timeless symbol of our enduring commitment to teaching, learning, academic inquiry, and scholarship. Across generations and disciplines, at our core, we create, share, and apply knowledge for the enrichment of individuals and the betterment of the broader society.
