This notice explains how and why we use these technologies and the choices you have. When this policy mentions “University,” “we,” “us,” or “our,” it refers to the University of Miami in its capacity as the Data Controller. That is, the responsible party for your information under this Privacy Statement. The University of Miami’s websites and applications, collectively, will hereinafter be referred to as the “University Website.” What is a "cookie"? A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a web server to be stored on a web browser so that it can be read back later from that browser. The cookie is a text file saved in the browser’s directory and stored in RAM while the browser is running. The cookie may also be stored on the computer’s hard drive once a user logs off from that website or web server. Cookies store data about your use, but they are helpful because they allow us to function and customize your experience. You can configure your desktop or mobile browser’s settings to reflect your preference to accept or reject cookies. Other Technologies We also use other technologies with similar functionality to cookies, such as web beacons, pixels, mobile identifiers, and tracking URLs, to obtain Log Data. Purpose We use these technologies for a number of purposes, such as: To enable you to use and access the University Website and our secure payment services.

For fraud detection and prevention, and investigations. For purposes of our own analytics, research, product development, and regulatory compliance. Third Parties We may also allow certain business partners to place these technologies on the University Website.

For example, to help us better understand how people use the University Website, some of our website properties use Google Analytics and other Google suite tools and as per their guidelines, we “will not facilitate the merging of personally-identifiable information with non-personally identifiable information collected through any Google advertising product or feature” unless providing “robust notice of, and the user’s prior affirmative (i.e., opt-in) consent to, that merger.” To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser by clicking here. Marketing services Third parties may also use such tracking technologies to serve ads that they believe are most likely to be of interest to you and measure the effectiveness of their ads both on the University Website and on other websites and online services. Targeting and advertising cookies we use may include Google, and other advertising networks and services we use from time to time. For more information about targeting and advertising cookies and how you can opt out, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s opt-out page.
