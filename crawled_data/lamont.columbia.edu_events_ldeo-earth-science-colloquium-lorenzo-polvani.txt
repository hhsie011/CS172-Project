Dr. Polvani is the Maurice Ewing and J. Lamar Worzel Professor of Geophysics in the Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics at Columbia University. Dr. Polvani’s research encompasses many aspects of atmospheric and climate dynamics, including the physical response of the climate system to increasing concentrations of CO2, the chemistry and dynamics of the stratosphere, Arctic and Antarctic climate change, and past and future climate impacts related to the Montreal Protocol. He is particularly interested in quantifying and distinguishing the effects of anthropogenic forcings from natural climate variability. Dr. Polvani also retains an interest in geophysical fluid dynamics, and occasionally dabbles in planetary atmospheres. This in an in-person-only Colloquium.
