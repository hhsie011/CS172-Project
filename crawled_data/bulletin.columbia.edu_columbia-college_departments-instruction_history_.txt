It encourages students to develop historical understanding in the widest sense of the word: a thorough empirical grasp along with the kind of analytical skills that come with a genuinely historical sensibility. This is done through two types of courses: lectures and seminars. Lectures range from broad surveys of the history of a place or period to more thematically oriented courses. Seminars offer students the opportunity to work more closely with historical sources in smaller groups and to do more sophisticated written work. Because history courses usually have no prerequisites, there are no preordained sequences to follow. It is advisable, however, that students take a relevant lecture course in preparation for a seminar. Majors wishing to follow a more intensive program are advised to enroll in a historiography course and to undertake a senior thesis project. Historically, majors have pursued careers in a very wide range of areas including medicine, law, mass media, Wall Street, and academia. Advanced Placement Students may receive 3 credits toward the overall degree requirements for a score of 5 on the AP European History exam or the AP United States History exam. No points count toward or fulfill any requirements of the history major or concentration. Advising During their junior and senior years, majors and concentrators are advised by the faculty members of the Undergraduate Education Committee (UNDED). UNDED advisers also review and sign Plan of Study (POS) forms for majors and concentrators at least once per year. POS forms track students’ progress toward completing all major and concentration requirements. New history majors and concentrators may see any member of UNDED. For the most up-to-date information on UNDED members, please see the undergraduate advising page of the departmental website. Majors and concentrators can also receive pure academic interest advising (non-requirement advising) from any faculty member and affiliated faculty member of the department. First-years and sophomores considering a history major or concentration can seek advising from UNDED or any other faculty member. For questions about requirements, courses, or the general program, majors and concentrators can also contact the undergraduate administrator. Departmental Honors To be eligible for departmental honors, the student must have a GPA of at least 3.6 in courses for the major, an ambitious curriculum, and an outstanding senior thesis. Honors are awarded on the basis of a truly outstanding senior thesis. Normally no more than 10% of graduating majors receive departmental honors in a given academic year. Course Numbering Courses are numbered by type: UN 1xxx - Introductory Survey Lectures UN 2xxx - Undergraduate Lectures UN 3xxx - Undergraduate Seminars GU 4xxx - Joint Undergraduate/Graduate Seminars and field (with some exceptions): x000-x059: Ancient x060-x099: Medieval x100-x199: Early modern Europe x200-x299: East Central Europe x300-x399: Modern Western Europe x400-x599: United States x600-x659: Jewish x660-x699: Latin America x700-x759: Middle East x760-x799: Africa x800-x859: South Asia x860-x899: East Asia x900-x999: Research, historiography, and transnational Seminars Seminars are integral to the undergraduate major in history. In these courses, students develop research and writing skills under the close supervision of a faculty member. Enrollment is normally limited to approximately 15 students. In order to maintain the small size of the courses, admission to most seminars is by instructor's permission or application. In conjunction with the Barnard History Department and other departments in the University (particularly East Asian Languages and Cultures), the History Department offers about 25 seminars each semester that majors may use to meet their seminar requirements. While there are sufficient seminars offered to meet the needs of majors seeking to fulfill the two-seminar requirement, given the enrollment limits, students may not always be able to enroll in a particular seminar. Students should discuss with UNDED their various options for completing the seminar requirement. The History Department has developed an on-line application system for some seminars. The department regularly provides declared majors and concentrators with information on upcoming application periods, which typically occur midway through the preceding semester. Students majoring in other fields, or students who have not yet declared a major, must inform themselves of the application procedures and deadlines by checking the undergraduate seminar page of the departmental website.

Major in History Students must complete a minimum of nine courses in the department, of which four or more must be in an area of specialization chosen by the student and approved by a member of UNDED. Students must also fulfill a breadth requirement by taking three courses outside of their specialization. Two of the courses taken in the major must be seminars (including one seminar in the chosen specialization). All History majors MUST submit an UNDED approved Plan of Study to the department in order to be certified. The requirements of the undergraduate program encourage students to do two things: Develop a deeper knowledge of the history of a particular time and/or place. Students are required to complete a specialization by taking a number of courses in a single field of history of their own choosing. The field should be defined, in consultation with a member of UNDED, according to geographical, chronological, and/or thematic criteria. For example, a student might choose to specialize in 20th C. U.S. History, Medieval European History, Ancient Greek and Roman History, or Modern East Asian History. The specialization does not appear on the student's transcript, but provides an organizing principle for the program the student assembles in consultation with UNDED. Gain a sense of the full scope of history as a discipline by taking a broad range of courses. Students must fulfill a breadth requirement by taking courses outside their own specialization -- at least one course removed in time and two removed in space. Time: majors and concentrators must take at least one course removed in time from their specialization: Students specializing in the modern period must take at least one course in the pre-modern period; students specializing in the pre-modern period must take at least one course in the modern period. If the course proposed is in the same regional field as a student's specialization, special care must be taken to ensure that it is as far removed as possible; please consult with UNDED to make sure a given course counts for the chronological breadth requirement. Space: majors must take at least two additional courses in regional fields not their own: These two "removed in space" courses must also cover two different regions. For example, students specializing in some part of Europe must take two courses in Africa, East or South Asia, Latin America/Caribbean, Middle East, and/or the U.S. Some courses cover multiple geographic regions. If a course includes one of the regions within a student's specialization, that course cannot count towards the breadth requirement unless it is specifically approved by the Director of Undergraduate Studies. For example, if a student is specializing in 20th C. U.S. history and takes the class World War II in Global Perspective, the class is too close to the specialization and may not count as a regional breadth course. All courses in the Barnard History Department as well as select courses in East Asian Languages and Cultures; Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African Studies; and other departments count toward the major. Eligible inter-departmental courses may include: African Civilizations (AFCV UN1020) (when taught by Professor Gregory Mann, Professor Rhiannon Stephens, or PhD students in the Columbia University Department of History; the course does NOT count for History when taught by anyone else) Primary Texts of Latin American Civilization (LACV UN1020) (when taught by Professor Pablo Piccato, Professor Caterina Pizzigoni, or PhD students in the Columbia University Department of History; the course does NOT count for History when taught by anyone else) Introduction to East Asian Civilizations: China (ASCE UN1359), INTRO EAST ASIAN CIV: JPN (ASCE UN1361), Introduction to East Asian Civilizations: Korea (ASCE UN1363) or other ASCE UN1xxx courses (when taught by Professors Charles Armstrong, Carol Gluck, Robert Hymes, Dorothy Ko, Eugenia Lean, Feng Li, David Lurie, Jungwon Kim, Paul Kreitman, Gregory Pflugfelder, Gray Tuttle, or Madeleine Zelin, and NOT when they are taught by anyone else) Please see the Courses section on the departmental website to see which of these might count in a given semester. Any courses not listed or linked on the departmental website, however historical in approach or content, do not count toward the history major or concentration, except with explicit written approval of the UNDED chair. If you suspect a History course has escaped being listed at the above link and want to confirm whether or not it counts for History students, please contact the Undergraduate Administrator. Thematic Specializations Suitably focused thematic and cross-regional specializations are permitted and the breadth requirements for students interested in these topics are set in consultation with a member of UNDED. Classes are offered in fields including, but not limited to: Ancient history Medieval history Early modern European history Modern European history United States history Latin American and Caribbean history Middle Eastern history East Asian history South Asian history Additionally, classes are offered in thematic and cross-regional fields which include, but are not limited to: Intellectual history Jewish history Women's history International history History of science These fields are only examples. Students should work with a member of UNDED to craft a suitably focused specialization on the theme or field that interests them. Thesis Requirements Majors may elect to write a senior thesis, though this is not a graduation requirement. Only senior thesis writers are eligible to be considered for departmental honors. The senior thesis option is not available to concentrators. The yearlong HIST UN3838-HIST UN3839 Senior Thesis Seminar carries 8 points, 4 of which typically count as a seminar in the specialization. For the most up-to-date information on the field designations for history courses, please see the Courses section of the departmental website. Concentration in History Effective February 2018, students must complete a minimum of six courses in history. At least three of the six courses must be in an area of specialization, one far removed in time, and one on a geographic region far removed in space. There is no seminar requirement for the concentration. All History concentrators MUST submit an UNDED approved Plan of Study to the department in order to be certified. Fall 2022 History Courses HIST UN1010 The Ancient Greeks 800-146 B.C.E.. 4 points.

This course examines the history of the Roman Empire from the formation of the Roman monarchy in 753 BCE to the collapse of the Western Empire in 476 CE. At the heart of the class is a single question: how did the Roman Empire come to be, and why did it last for so long? We will trace the rise and fall of the Republic, the extension of its power beyond Italy, and the spread of Christianity. Epic poetry, annalistic accounts, coins, papyri, inscriptions, and sculpture will illuminate major figures like Cleopatra, and features of daily life like Roman law and religion. The destructive mechanics by which Rome sustained itself--war, slavery, and environmental degradation--will receive attention, too, with the aim of producing a holistic understanding this empire.

This course is an introduction to the history of the Native peoples of North America. Instruction will focus on the idea that indigenous people in North America possess a shared history in terms of being forced to respond to European colonization, and the emergence of the modern nation-state. Native peoples, however, possess their own distinct histories and culture. In this sense their histories are uniquely multi-faceted rather than the experience of a singular racial group. Accordingly, this course will offer a wide-ranging survey of cultural encounters between the Native peoples of North America, European empires, colonies, and emergent modern nation-states taking into account the many different indigenous responses to colonization and settler colonialism. This course will also move beyond the usual stories of Native-White relations that center either on narratives of conquest and assimilation, or stories of cultural persistence. We will take on these issues, but we will also explore the significance of Native peoples to the historical development of modern North America. This will necessarily entail an examination of race formation, and a study of the evolution of social structures and categories such as nation, tribe, citizenship, and sovereignty Fall 2022: HIST UN1488 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 1488 001/10644 T Th 11:40am - 12:55pm Room TBA Michael Witgen 4.00 40/40 HIST UN1768 European Intellectual History. 4 points. This course provides an introduction to some of the major landmarks in European cultural and intellectual history, from the aftermath of the French Revolution to the 1970s. We will pay special attention to the relationship between texts (literature, anthropology, political theory, psychoanalysis, art, and film) and the various contexts in which they were produced. Among other themes, we will discuss the cultural impact of the Enlightenment, the French Revolution, industrialism, colonialism, modernism, the Russian Revolution, the two world wars, decolonization, feminism and gay liberation movements, structuralism and poststructuralism. In conjunction, we will examine how modern ideologies (liberalism, conservatism, Marxism, imperialism, fascism, totalitarianism, neoliberalism) were developed and challenged over the course of the last two centuries. Participation in weekly discussion sections staffed by TAs is mandatory. The discussion sections are 50 minutes per session. Students must register for the general discussion (“DISC”) section, and will be assigned to a specific time and TA instructor once the course begins.

This course surveys the main currents of British history from 1900 to the present, with particular attention to the changing place of Britain in the world and the changing shape of society and politics. Throughout this course, we will ask: Where is power located in Britain and its empire? What held Britain and the empire together, and what tore them apart? What was life like for Britons – young and old, men and women, rich and poor, Black and white – across the course of this century? When and how did social change happen? How did people respond? , We will tackle these questions by looking closely at some key periods of political conflict and resolution, by reading key texts from the time, and – for the latter part of the course – by viewing films and speeches. The course requirements include section participation, including regular posts (20%), a take-home midterm (20%), two short research assignments (20% each) and a take-home final (20%). You must complete all assignments and exams to pass the course. The research assignments are devised to help familiarize you with historians’ practice, so that you can search for answers to historical questions on your own. The assignments are integrated into section discussion: due dates are (as a result) not flexible and section attendance is required. The films are an essential part of the course and will be discussed in section. , Readings for this courseare drawn mostly from the rich primary materials available. They are supplemented by select articles chosen to bring out some of the key issues historians find significant about particular periods or events. My lectures constitute the main “textbook” for the course, but I am also recommending that you read selected chapters from a textbook that is available online: Stephanie Barczewski et al, Britain since 1688: https://www-taylorfrancis-com.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/books/9781315748610. , Most material is available online, but five books (asterisked below) will need to be ordered or bought from Book Culture (or, if you are not in the New York area, online). A timeline, a list of interesting web links, and a list of great British films can be found on the Courseworks page. , Course objectives , The course aims to provide students with (a) a good foundational knowledge of the course of British history and culture from 1900 to the present; (b) an understanding of how historians do research and basic research skills; (c) the ability to analyze historical materials (speeches, novels, memoirs, government documents, films), placing them in context and deploying them to make analytical arguments about the past.

Since the production and regulation of queer life has always been intimately linked to the production and policing of “normal” sexuality and gender, we will also pay attention to the shifting boundaries of normative sexuality, especially heterosexuality, as well as other developments in American history that shaped gay life, such as the Second World War, Cold War, urbanization, and the minority rights revolution. Themes include the emergence of homosexuality and heterosexuality as categories of experience and identity; the changing relationship between homosexuality and transgenderism; the development of diverse lesbian and gay subcultures and their representation in popular culture; the sources of antigay hostility; religion and sexual science; generational change and everyday life; AIDS; and gay, antigay, feminist, and queer movements Fall 2022: HIST UN2533 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 2533 001/10592 M W 11:40am - 12:55pm Room TBA George Chauncey 4.00 200/200 HIST UN2535 History of the City of New York. 4 points.

The course examines how womanhood and feminism were shaped by class, race, ethnicity, culture, sexuality and immigration status. We will explore how the construction of American nationalism and imperialism, as well as the development of citizenship rights, social policy, and labor organizing, were deeply influenced by the politics of gender.

During the 2020 US presidential election and the years of the COVID-19 pandemic, science and “scientific truths” were fiercely contested. This course provides a historical perspective on the issues at stake. The course begins with an historical account of how areas of natural knowledge, such as astrology, alchemy, and “natural magic,” which were central components of an educated person’s view of the world in early modern Europe, became marginalized, while a new philosophy of nature (what we would now call empirical science) came to dominate the discourse of rationality. Historical developments examined in this course out of which this new understanding of nature emerged include the rise of the centralized state, religious reform, and European expansion. The course uses this historical account to show how science and pseudoscience developed in tandem in the period from 1400 to 1800. This historical account equips students to examine contemporary issues of expertise, the social construction of science, pluralism in science, certainty and uncertainty in science, as well as critical engagement with contemporary technologies Spring 2022: HIST UN2978 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 2978 001/12839 T Th 4:10pm - 5:25pm 614 Schermerhorn Hall Madisson Whitman, Pamela Smith 4.00 64/95 HIST 2978 AU1/19997 T Th 4:10pm - 5:25pm 614 Schermerhorn Hall Pamela Smith, Madisson Whitman 4.00 20/21 Fall 2022: HIST UN2978 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 2978 001/10637 T Th 4:10pm - 5:25pm Room TBA Madisson Whitman, Pamela Smith 4.00 35/90 HIST UN3011 THE SECOND WORLD WAR. 3.00-4.00 points.

This course explores manners of conceiving and being a self in early modern Europe (ca. 1400-1800). Through the analysis of a range of sources, from autobiographical writings to a selection of theological, philosophical, artistic, and literary works, we will approach the concept of personhood as a lens through which to study topics such as the valorization of interiority, humanist scholarly practices, the rising professional status of artists, the spirituality of Christian mysticism, mechanist and sensationalist philosophies of selfhood, and, more generally, the human person’s relationship with material and existential goods. This approach is intended to deepen our understanding of the Renaissance, the Reformation, the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment, and other movements around which histories of the early modern period have typically been narrated Fall 2022: HIST UN3189 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 3189 001/10602 Th 10:10am - 12:00pm Room TBA Charly Coleman 4.00 15/15 HIST BC3327 Consumer Culture in Modern Europe. 4 points.

The United States was founded on Indigenous land and in conversation with Indigenous nations who shared possession to most of the territory claimed by the republic. The expansion of the U.S. beyond the original thirteen states happened in dialogue, and often in open conflict with the Native peoples of North America. This course will examine the creation and expansion of the American nation-state from the perspective of Indigenous peoples and Indigenous history. Most histories of the Republic equate the founding of the U.S. with the severance of colonial ties to Great Britain and the proceed to characterize America as a post-colonial society. We will study the U.S. as the first New World colonial power, a settler society whose very existence is deeply intertwined with the Indigenous history of North America Fall 2022: HIST UN3502 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 3502 001/12686 W 4:10pm - 6:00pm Room TBA Michael Witgen 4.00 8/16 HIST UN3515 Surveillance from KGB and NSA to Border Control. 4.00 points.

We will cover Socialism and the Ku Klux Klan in the early twentieth century; the Communist Party and right-wing populists of the 1930s; the civil rights movement, black power, and white resistance, 1950s-1960s; the rise of the New Left and the New Right in the 1960s; the Women's liberation movement and the Christian right of the 1970s; and finally, free-market conservatism, neoliberalism, white nationalism and the Trump era. We will explore the organizational, ideological and social history of these political mobilizations. The class explores grass-roots social movements and their relationship to “mainstream” and electoral politics. We will pay special attention to the ways that ideas and mobilizations that are sometimes deemed extreme have in fact helped to shape the broader political spectrum.

Note: This course meets as a lecture but it is a seminar. Prerequisites: NA This seminar explores the roots of and responses to the contemporary refugee "crisis" at the U.S.-Mexico border. We examine the historical factors that are propelling people, including families and unaccompanied minors, to flee the so-called Northern Triangle of Central America (El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala); the law and politics of asylum that those seeking refuge must negotiate in the U.S.; and the burgeoning system of immigration incarceration that detains ever-greater numbers of non-citizens. The course is organized around a collaboration with the Dilley Pro Bono Project, an organization that provides legal counsel to detainees at the country's largest immigration detention prison, in Dilley, Texas.

The seminar will examine several “Islamic” cities in depth, focusing on critical moments in their histories. The students will acquire a solid knowledge of these centers. They will study their dynamic and complex histories in an episodic manner, deconstructing their images frozen in a particular moment. We will begin by recent critical theories on the “Islamic” city, the latter concept developed as a rigid formula during the colonial era and reiterated since. As we resituate our case studies in their shifting historic contexts, we will gain insights into the complexity of their formations. More specifically, for example, Damascus will not be constrained to its canonical early medieval period, but will be investigated with reference to its Greco-Roman history, the Ottoman interventions in the pre-modern period, the nineteenth-century reforms, and the French planning experiments under the Mandate. Istanbul will not be limited to its sixteenth-century glamor, but will be scrutinized in terms of its turbulent passage from Byzantine to Ottoman rule, and as a pioneering experiment in nineteenth-century modernization reforms. Situating urban forms, “the tangible substance, the stuff” of cities at the center of our discussions, we will look into the political, social, cultural, and economic factors that framed their development, as well as the subsequent effects the cities made on these realms. The interdisciplinary approach will capitalize on the rich literature in the field and engage in analyses using textual and visual materials in complementary ways. The students will learn how to triangulate their discussions by using arguments and data (including visual documents) from different academic fields.

R. AMBEDKAR AT COLUMBIA. 4 points. B. R. Ambedkar is arguably one of Columbia University’s most illustrious alumni, and a democratic thinker and constitutional lawyer who had enormous impact in shaping India, the world’s largest democracy. As is well known, Ambedkar came to Columbia University in July 1913 to start a doctoral program in Political Science. He graduated in 1915 with a Masters degree, and got his doctorate from Columbia in 1927 after having studied with some of the great figures of interwar American thought including Edwin Seligman, James Shotwell, Harvey Robinson, and John Dewey. This course follows the model of the Columbia University and Slavery course and draws extensively on the relevant holdings and resources of Columbia’s RBML, [Rare Books and Manuscript Library] Burke Library (Union Theological Seminar), and the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture among others to explore a set of relatively understudied links between Ambedkar, Columbia University, and the intellectual history of the interwar period. Themes include: the development of the disciplines at Columbia University and their relationship to new paradigms of social scientific study; the role of historical comparison between caste and race in producing new models of scholarship and political solidarity; links between figures such as Ambedkar, Lala Lajpat Rai, W. E. B. Du Bois and others who were shaped by the distinctive public and political culture of New York City, and more. This is a hybrid course which aims to create a finding aid for B. R. Ambedkar that traverses RBML private papers. Students will engage in a number of activities towards that purpose. They will attend multiple instructional sessions at the RBML to train students in using archives; they will make public presentations on their topics, which will be archived in video form; and stuents will produce digital essays on a variety of themes and topics related to the course. Students will work collaboratively in small groups and undertake focused archival research. This seminar inaugurates an on-going, multiyear effort to grapple with globalizing the reach and relevance of B. R. Ambedkar and to share our findings with the Columbia community and beyond. Working independently, students will define and pursue individual research projects. Working together, the class will create digital visualizations of these projects.

What was daily life like for the “average” European in pre-industrial society? This course examines the material circumstances of life and death in Europe from the fifteenth to the eighteenth century. It also asks the question of whether and how we can enter into the inner life of people of the past. How did people experience their material conditions? How did they experience the life of the mind and of the emotions? What are the methods used by historians to gain knowledge about the material conditions and lived experience of the past?

This seminar examines the social construction of criminality and the institutions that developed to impose and enforce the criminal law as reflections of Latin American urban society throughout the region’s history, with a particular emphasis on the rise of police forces as the principal means of day-to-day urban governance. Topics include policing and urban slavery; policing the urban “underworld”; the changing cultural importance of police in urban popular culture; the growth of scientific policing methods, along with modern criminology and eugenics; policing and the enforcement of gender norms in urban public spaces; the role of urban policing in the rise of military governments in the twentieth century; organized crime; transitional justice and the contemporary question of the rule of law; and the transnational movement of ideas about and innovations in policing practice. In our readings and class discussions over the course of the semester, we will trace how professionalized, modern police forces took shape in cities across the region over time. This course actually begins, however, in the colonial period before there was anything that we would recognize as a modern, uniformed, state-run police force. We will thus have a broad perspective from which to analyze critically the role of police in the development of Latin American urban societies—in other words, to see the police in the contemporary era as contingent on complex historical processes, which we will seek to understand Fall 2022: HIST GU4277 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 4277 001/12789 M 4:10pm - 6:00pm Room TBA Amy Chazkel 4.00 14/15 HIST GU4397 Nationalism and Revolution in Modern Ireland. 4.00 points. Nationalism is one of the most persistent, powerful and elusive forces in modern world history. This course examines it through a particularly compelling and accessible case study: Ireland. As both a subject of, and a partner in, British colonialism, Ireland straddled both the imperial and anti-imperial dimensions of nineteenth and twentieth-century nationalism. Ireland reveals nationalism’s complexities and ambiguities in an era in which large multinational empires, not nation-states, were frequently seen as fundamental units of political organization. Through its relationship to the Catholic church, through the global Irish diaspora (especially, though not exclusively, in the US) and through its correspondence and cooperation with other struggles for ‘nationality’ in nineteenth-century Europe, modern Irish nationalism became a transnational phenomenon. As such, it can show us some of the ways in which growing global communication and interconnection can produce and reinforce national sentiment rather than undermining it. Over a period from the late-eighteenth to the late-twentieth centuries, we will trace the diverse and often conflicting modes of nationalist politics and ideology in Ireland, encompassing controversies over sovereignty, empire, democracy, religion, trade, property, political violence and culture. In so doing, we will not only learn about the role of nationalism in Irish history, but seek to understand its broad conceptual relevance in modern politics Fall 2022: HIST GU4397 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 4397 001/12851 W 10:10am - 12:00pm Room TBA James Stafford 4.00 15/15 HIST GU4403 American Empire. 4.00 points.

The course’s chronological focus begins roughly two decades before the first recognition of the syndrome to the first decade of the twenty-first century. Thematically, the course will address several issues, including syndemic theory; stigma, homophobia and political marginalization; late capitalism and public health; the health effects of segregation; and mass incarceration.

For thousands of years people have been getting ready for the end of the world, giving rise to millenarian movements that have sometimes changed history. More than once, large numbers of people have experienced events such as the Black Death, the Little Ice Age, colonial conquest, and “strategic” bombing that seemed very much like the end of their world. And over the last seventy-five years, governments and international organizations have made major investments in predicting and preparing for catastrophic threats. Efforts to manage or mitigate these dangers have had world-changing consequences, including “preventative” wars, and new forms of global governance. The very idea of the end of the world, in other words, has a long history, with a demonstrable impact, which provides instructive lessons as we contemplate things to come. This course will explore this history, beginning with eschatology and millenarian movements. In part two, students will learn how different conceptual frameworks can be applied to assessing and managing risk, and understanding how people perceive or misperceive danger. They will learn how they can be applied to identify the most important challenges, drawing insights from different disciplinary approaches. The third and main part of the course will consist of comparative and connected analyses of the age-old apocalyptic threats -- war, pestilence, and famine -- in their modern forms, i.e. nuclear armageddon, pandemics, and ecological collapse. By examining them together, we can compare the magnitude and probability of each danger, and also explore their interconnections. We will see, for instance, how nuclear testing helped give rise to the environmental movement, and how modeling the aftereffects of nuclear exchanges helped advance understanding of climate change. Similarly, scenario exercises have shaped threat perceptions and disaster-preparedness for pandemics and bio-warfare as much as they did for nuclear war and terrorism. Readings and discussions will explore how planetary threats are interconnected, and not just in the techniques used to predict and plan for them. Applying nuclear power to the problem of global warming, for instance, could undermine longstanding efforts to stop nuclear proliferation. Climate change and mass migration, on the other hand, create new pandemic threats, as a more crowded and interconnected world becomes a single ecosystem. Yet billions spent on building up defenses have created more capacity and opportunity for bio-terrorism. Who would actually use a nuclear or biological weapon? Perhaps a millenarian group hoping to ride death, the fourth horse of the apocalypse, straight to heaven Fall 2022: HIST GU4727 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 4727 001/10604 W 10:10am - 12:00pm Room TBA Matthew Connelly 4.00 0/15 HIST GU4779 AFRICAN FRANCE, FRENCH AFRICA. 4.00 points.

CC/GS/SEAS: Partial Fulfillment of Global Core Requirement Graduate students must register for HIST G6998 version of this course. This survey lecture course will provide students with a broad overview of the history of South Asia as a region - focusing on key political, cultural and social developments over more than two millennia. The readings include both primary sources (in translation) and secondary works. Our key concerns will be the political, cultural and theological encounters of varied communities, the growth of cities and urban spaces, networks of trade and migrations and the development of both local and cosmopolitan cultures across Southern Asia. The survey will begin with early dynasties of the classical period and then turn to the subsequent formation of various Perso-Turkic polities, including the development and growth of hybrid political cultures such as those of Vijayanagar and the Mughals. The course also touches on Indic spiritual and literary traditions such as Sufi and Bhakti movements. Near the end of our course, we will look forward towards the establishment of European trading companies and accompanying colonial powers Fall 2022: HSME UN2810 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HSME 2810 001/15043 T Th 10:10am - 11:25am Room TBA Manan Ahmed 4.00 1/60 CLCV UN3008 The Age of Augustus. 3 points. The reign of the first Roman emperor, Augustus (27bce-14ce), has been seen as a Roman revolution, both political and cultural. Rome had for centuries been governed as a Republic, but a series of increasingly divisive civil wars allowed Augustus to create a new political system in which he exercised sole rule as the ‘first citizen’ within a ‘Restored Republic’. Augustus’ reign lasted more than 40 years, and established a model of autocratic rule that would last for four centuries. During this time there were profound changes in the political, social, and cultural structures of Rome. In this course, you will examine the nature of these changes, Augustus’ political strategies, military activities, and religious initiatives through his own writing, the accounts of (often hostile) historians and a range of literary and archaeological sources, including Roman poetry. Ultimately, we will address the question: how did Augustus achieve the seemingly paradoxical feat of becoming a monarch within a republican system?

Priority is given to EALAC and History majors, as well as to those who have done previous coursework on Japan. From Godzilla to Pokemon (literally, pocket monster) toys, Japanese monsters have become a staple commodity of late-capitalist global pop culture. This course seeks to place this phenomenon within a longer historical, as well as a broader cross-cultural, context. Through an examination of texts and images spanning over thirteen centuries of Japanese history, along with comparable productions from other cultures, students will gain an understanding not only of different conceptions and representations of monsters, ghosts, and other supernatural creatures in Japan, but also of the role of the monstrous in the cultural imagination more generally. The course draws on various media and genres of representation, ranging from written works, both literary and scholarly, to the visual arts, material culture, drama, and cinema. Readings average 100-150 pages per week. Several film and video screenings are scheduled in addition to the regular class meetings.

For centuries, New York City has served as a primary gateway city for immigrants to the United States. In the early twentieth century, according to the 1910 Census, New York City’s population was roughly 40％ foreign-born. The problems these immigrants presented to government officials, doctors, religious leaders, industrialists, the police, and educators in New York City transformed not only the local debate on immigration but the national discussion of “Americanization” as well. According to the most recent census, approximately 40％ of the city's population is foreign-born. Like their predecessors at the turn of the twentieth century, contemporary immigrants, arriving from the Caribbean, Africa, Central America, Asia, and Europe, have posed serious challenges to the civic, educational, and political institutions of New York City. How are these foreign-born residents reshaping the city today? This seminar explores the intersection of immigration, race, culture, and politics in New York City, both from the perspective of history and in relation to contemporary realities as it explores the forces shaping the century-old encounter between immigrants and New York City Fall 2022: AMHS UN3462 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment AMHS 3462 001/10617 Th 2:10pm - 4:00pm Room TBA Rebecca Kobrin 4.00 17/15 CSER UN3928 Colonization/Decolonization. 4 points.

The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the basic issues and problems in the study of early Chinese civilization, some theoretical and others methodological. Through the review of a long series of debates the course offers a quick entrance both to this early period of history and to these studies. Organized around problems, the course encourages critical thinking and contesting arguments and helps the students weigh different positions addressing the problems. By doing so, the course guides the students to search for frontline questions and to probe possible ways to solve the problems. The course deals with both the written records (inscriptional and textual) and the material evidence, and the student can well expect this course to serve as also updates of the most fascinating archaeological discoveries in China made in the past decades. The course is designed as an upper-level undergraduate and MA course; therefore, it is recommended that undergraduate students should take "ASCE V2359: Introduction to East Asian Civilizations: China" before participating in this course.

This course surveys the history of the Mediterranean world and northern Europe from the Late Roman Empire to the eleventh century. We will begin (Part 1) by considering the interconnected Roman world of Late Antiquity, focusing on the changes brought about by Christianity. The second half (Part 2) will trace the emergence of new religious and political communities around the Mediterranean and in Northern Europe. Special attention will be given to the circulation of people, products and ideas across Europe and the Mediterranean and the changes that this brought about. This course emphasizes the diverse but fragmentary textual and material evidence that survives from the period and the problems of interpreting this evidence. Students will begin acquiring the skills of a historian and learn why and how other historians have studied the period. No previous background in medieval history is required.

This course will explore the struggle to control the continent of North America from an Indigenous perspective. After a century of European colonization Native peoples east of the Mississippi River Valley formed a political confederation aimed at preserving Native sovereignty. This Native confederacy emerged as a dominant force during the Seven Years War, the American Revolution, and the War of 1812. At times Native political interests aligned with the French and British Empires, but remained in opposition to the expansion of Anglo-American colonial settlements into Indian country. This course is designed to engage literature and epistemology surrounding these New World conflicts as a means of the colonial and post-colonial past in North America. We will explore the emergence of intersecting indigenous and European national identities tied to the social construction of space and race. In this course I will ask you to re-think American history by situating North America as a Native space, a place that was occupied and controlled by indigenous peoples. You will be asked to imagine a North America that was indigenous and adaptive, and not necessarily destined to be absorbed by European settler colonies. Accordingly, this course we will explore the intersections of European colonial settlement and Euro-American national expansion, alongside of the emergence of indigenous social formations that dominated the western interior until the middle of the 19th century. This course is intended to be a broad history of Indigenous North America during a tumultuous period, but close attention will be given to use and analysis of primary source evidence. Similarly, we will explore the necessity of using multiple genres of textual evidence – archival documents, oral history, material artifacts, etc., -- when studying indigenous history Spring 2022: HIST UN1512 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 1512 001/14400 T Th 11:40am - 12:55pm 413 Kent Hall Michael Witgen 4.00 27/50 HIST UN1786 History of the City in Latin America. 4 points.

Readings, lectures, and discussion sections will examine the concentration of people in commercial and political centers from the beginnings of European colonization in the fifteenth century to the present day and will introduce contrasting approaches to the study of urban culture, politics, society, and the built environment. Central themes include the reciprocal relationships between growing urban areas and the countryside; changing power dynamics in modern Latin America, especially as they impacted the lives of cities’ nonelite majority populations; the legalities and politics of urban space; planned versus unplanned cities and the rise of informal economies; the way changing legal and political rights regimes have affected urban life; and the constant tension between tradition and progress through which urban society was formed.

Standing at the intersection of the religious, cultural, and scientific upheavals within early modern Europe, the study of print and its intersection with culture allows students to learn how shifts in technology (much like those we are witnessing today) affect every aspect of society. This course will examine the signal cultural, political, and religious developments in early modern Western Europe, using the introduction and dissemination of printed materials as a fulcrum and entry point. From the sixteenth century Europeans were confronted with a technological revolution whose cultural consequences were incalculable and whose closest parallel might be the age of electronic information technology in our own day. From the Reformation of Luther, to the libelles of pre-revolutionary France, from unlocking the mysteries of the human body to those of the heavens, from humanist culture to the arrival of the novel, no important aspect of European culture in the sixteen- through eighteenth centuries can be understood without factoring in the role of print: its technology, its marketing and distribution channels, and its creation of new readers and new "republics." This course will examine key political, religious, and cultural movements in early modern western European history through the prism of print culture.

For much of modern history Germany was Europe’s battlefield. Its soldiers wrote themselves into the annals of military history. But it was also a place where war was discussed, conceptualized and criticized with unparalleled vigor. Nowhere did the extreme violence of the seventeenth century and the early twentieth century leave a deeper mark than on Germany. Today, as we enter the twenty-first century, Germany is the nation that has perhaps come closest to drawing a final, concluding line under its military history. This course will chart the rise and fall of modern militarism in Germany. For those interested in military history per se, this course will not hold back from discussing battles, soldiers and weapons. But it will also offer an introduction to German history more generally. And through the German example we will address questions in political philosophy that haunted modern European history and continue to haunt America today. How is state violence justified? How can it be regulated and controlled? What is its future?

Nineteenth-century Britain has traditionally been portrayed as the dominant power in the world of its time: one that forged a path towards various kinds of ‘modernity’ at home, while ruthlessly subjugating and exploiting the peoples subject to its colonial empire. In this course, we will take a sceptical look at these claims. How coherent a political entity was ‘Britain’—a monarchy composed of at least four distinct and fractious nations, presiding over a scattered empire of trade, conquest and settlement? Who in Britain really benefited from the prosperity made possible by the dramatic industrial and imperial expansion that characterised the period? What forms of freedom, and what kinds of social control, were made possible by Victorian ideologies of ‘liberal’ government and laissez-faire economics? Why were British elites so often uncertain and divided when it came to questions of imperial rule—especially in Ireland, the oldest and nearest dependency of the empire? In the course of asking these questions, we will of course be learning about the history of Britain itself, alongside the parts of the world it interacted with during the nineteenth century: something that, thanks to a wealth of primary sources (many of them now online) and a strong tradition of sophisticated historiography, will be a highly rewarding intellectual experience. We will also, however, be learning and thinking about other things—the histories of capitalism, religion, gender, empire, fossil fuels, migration, agriculture, slavery and political ideology, among others—that are of a much more general, and contemporary relevance. We do not have to buy into simplistic narratives of nineteenth-century Britain’s importance or distinctiveness to recognize it as an interesting place for thinking through some of the central problems of global history and modern politics Spring 2022: HIST UN2342 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 2342 001/12649 T Th 1:10pm - 2:25pm 517 Hamilton Hall James Stafford 4.00 24/75 HIST UN2353 Shadow of the Sun King: Early Modern France. 4.00 points.

Topics to be addressed include the rise of the Bourbon monarchy, the crystallization of absolutism as a political theology, the spectacular rise and collapse of John Law’s financial system, the emergence of the philosophe movement during the Enlightenment, and the gradual de-legitimation of royal power through its association with despotism. Thematically, the course will focus on shifting logics of representation—that is, the means by which political, economic, and religious power was not only reflected, but also generated and projected, through a range of interrelated practices that include Catholic liturgy, courtly protocols, aristocratic codes of honor, financial experimentation, and the critical styles of thinking and reading inculcated by the nascent public sphere Spring 2022: HIST UN2353 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 2353 000/12704 T Th 4:10pm - 5:25pm 413 Kent Hall Charly Coleman 4.00 28/50 HIST UN2377 INTERNATIONAL & GLOBAL HISTORY SINCE WWII. 4 points.

This lecture explores major topics in modern American history through an examination of the American film industry and some of its most popular films and stars. It begins with the emergence of “Hollywood” as an industry and a place in the wake of WWI and ends with the rise of the so-called ‘New Hollywood’ in the 1970s and its treatment of the 1960s and the Vietnam War. For much of this period, Hollywood’s films were not protected free speech, making movies and stars peculiarly reflective of, and vulnerable to, changes in broader cultural and political dynamics. Students will become familiar with Hollywood’s institutional history over this half-century in order to understand the forces, both internal and external, that have shaped the presentation of what Americans do and don’t see on screens and to become skilled interpreters of American history at the movies.

Lect: 1.5. Lab: 1.5. Data-empowered algorithms are reshaping our professional, personal, and political realities, for good--and for bad. "Data: Past, Present, and Future" moves from the birth of statistics in the 18th century to the surveillance capitalism of the present day, covering racist eugenics, World War II cryptography, and creepy personalized advertising along the way. Rather than looking at ethics and history as separate from the science and engineering, the course integrates the teaching of algorithms and data manipulation with the political whirlwinds and ethical controversies from which those techniques emerged. We pair the introduction of technical developments with the shifting political and economic powers that encouraged and benefited from new capabilities. We couple primary and secondary readings on the history and ethics of data with computational work done largely with user-friendly Jupyter notebooks in Python.

The purpose of this course is to provide students with an historical understanding of the role public health has played in American history. The underlying assumptions are that disease, and the ways we define disease, are simultaneously reflections of social and cultural values, as well as important factors in shaping those values. Also, it is maintained that the environments that we build determine the ways we live and die. The dread infectious and acute diseases in the nineteenth century, the chronic, degenerative conditions of the twentieth and the new, vaguely understood conditions rooted in a changing chemical and human-made environment are emblematic of the societies we created. Among the questions that will be addressed are: How does the health status of Americans reflect and shape our history? How do ideas about health reflect broader attitudes and values in American history and culture? How does the American experience with pain, disability, and disease affect our actions and lives? What are the responsibilities of the state and of the individual in preserving health? How have American institutions--from hospitals to unions to insurance companies--been shaped by changing longevity, experience with disability and death?

During the 2020 US presidential election and the years of the COVID-19 pandemic, science and “scientific truths” were fiercely contested. This course provides a historical perspective on the issues at stake. The course begins with an historical account of how areas of natural knowledge, such as astrology, alchemy, and “natural magic,” which were central components of an educated person’s view of the world in early modern Europe, became marginalized, while a new philosophy of nature (what we would now call empirical science) came to dominate the discourse of rationality. Historical developments examined in this course out of which this new understanding of nature emerged include the rise of the centralized state, religious reform, and European expansion. The course uses this historical account to show how science and pseudoscience developed in tandem in the period from 1400 to 1800. This historical account equips students to examine contemporary issues of expertise, the social construction of science, pluralism in science, certainty and uncertainty in science, as well as critical engagement with contemporary technologies Spring 2022: HIST UN2978 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 2978 001/12839 T Th 4:10pm - 5:25pm 614 Schermerhorn Hall Madisson Whitman, Pamela Smith 4.00 64/95 HIST 2978 AU1/19997 T Th 4:10pm - 5:25pm 614 Schermerhorn Hall Pamela Smith, Madisson Whitman 4.00 20/21 Fall 2022: HIST UN2978 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 2978 001/10637 T Th 4:10pm - 5:25pm Room TBA Madisson Whitman, Pamela Smith 4.00 35/90 HIST UN3012 African Voices ＆ Colonial Documents: Uganda. 4.00 points.

This course examines the history of middle-class status in America, from the early days of professionalization and corporate bureaucracy, to the progressive era political mobilization, to the mid-century consumerist era, to the present white collar precariat. By looking at cultural habits, social organization, and political engagement, and by examining materials from living room furniture to avocado toast, we'll chart the rise and fall of the most sought-after class denomination in American history.

This course examines the experience of people living in the Soviet Union via things. Objects under socialist regimes were supposed to be transformative, turning yesterday’s backwards peasants into new communist men and women. Communism promised unheard of abundance, but those who lived under it often suffered from severe shortages. Things from outside of the communist world often took on an aura of forbidden fruit. People learned a variety of tricks to survive, and today are even nostalgic for many of its trappings.

Over the last two decades scholars in the humanities and social sciences have embraced “the animal turn”: by asking questions about the place of animals in human societies and about animals’ experiences in various times and places they have instigated a field that has come to be known as Animal Studies. This research has expanded the range of analytical tools we have at our disposal to examine social worlds and to study meaning, representation, agency, and context and it also encouraged us to re-consider fundamental questions about the human–animal divide: what it is, where it is, and what its significance is. Moreover, it has become evident that animals are not just passive recipients of human action, but at times they can act as autonomous agents that can contributing the shaping of the world that we share with them. Although this course adopts a perspective which is first and foremost historical, it also emphasizes the field’s interdisciplinary embedding and intersectional potentials. It shows that the study of historical developments through the lens of animals is not only intellectually rewarding in its own right, but it also provides new perspectives on a range of crucial topics, such as the history of war, capitalism, colonialism, consumption and entertainment. The majority of accounts in the field addresses developments in the Anglophone world. While also paying attention to the results of that research, the regional focus of this course will be on East Central Europe. After the first three sessions that serve as an introduction to the field, a number of case studies will reveal that animals have always been an integral part of the region’s social, cultural and economic life and that studying them in a historical perspective provides potentials for nuancing or even revising established knowledge on the history of East Central Europe Spring 2022: HIST UN3252 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 3252 001/15520 T 2:10pm - 4:00pm 1219 International Affairs Bldg Monika Baar 4.00 7/15 HIST UN3258 Disability Histories of Europe in the Twentieth Century. 4.00 points. Approximately 10％-15％ of the world’s population is estimated to have a disability and this number is expected to rise in the next decades. Moreover, as the saying goes: everyone is just one accident away from disability. Although the potentials of the concept as a category of historical analysis are comparable to those of class, race, gender, sexuality and ethnicity; until recently, the history of people of disabilities has remained a rather neglected field and its promise to enrich and revise mainstream narratives on European history has not sufficiently been explored. This course responds to calls to bring disability from the margins to the center of historical inquiry. Rather than treating disability as merely a medical impairment, it will explore its historical and cultural variability.Unlike the overwhelming majority of academic accounts and courses which study the Anglophone world, this course will primarily focus on (continental) Europe, while also paying attention to global aspects. It is not restricted to one particular type of disability; instead, it historicizes the emergence of various categories and classifications. Topics will include disability and war, the Cold War, welfare, social movements and disability rights, culture and identity, the Deaf community, disability as a concern of global governance and global health. Special attention will be paid to regions that often remain peripheral in comprehensive studies, such as Eastern and Northern Europe. In doing so, the course seeks to reveal how the application of disability as an analytical tool can contribute to rethink the overall dynamics of European history Spring 2022: HIST UN3258 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 3258 001/15448 W 2:10pm - 4:00pm 1201 International Affairs Bldg Monika Baar 4.00 10/15 HIST UN3272 Modern Southeast Asian History. 4 points.

Priority given to majors and concentrators, seniors, and juniors. In the decades since the publication of Silent Spring and the rise of the environmental movement, public awareness of the impact of industrial products on human health has grown enormously. There is growing concern over BPA, lead, PCBs, asbestos, and synthetic materials that make up the world around us. This course will focus on environmental history, industrial and labor history as well as on how twentieth century consumer culture shapes popular and professional understanding of disease. Throughout the term the class will trace the historical transformation of the origins of disease through primary sources such as documents gathered in lawsuits, and medical and public health literature. Students will be asked to evaluate historical debates about the causes of modern epidemics of cancer, heart disease, lead poisoning, asbestos-related illnesses and other chronic conditions. They will also consider where responsibility for these new concerns lies, particularly as they have emerged in law suits.

The superpower competition between the US and the USSR dominated international affairs during the second half of the twentieth century. Though this Cold War was born from ideological differences and initially focused on Europe, it soon became entangled with the concurrent global process of decolonization. In this way, the US-Soviet rivalry shaped events on every continent. This course will examine the intersection of the superpower competition and the emergence of the postcolonial world. Through course readings and class discussion, students will examine the global dimensions of the Cold war.

This course introduces students to a variety of mediated numerical practices employed by a variety of actors and institutions in the US to make legible individuals and coteries both at home and abroad in the 20th and 21st centuries. Attention is given to how statistical innovations and infrastructures were used to measure and justify social claims about race, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic class, and how these practices changed the very definitions of the social phenomena they purported to describe. While emphasis is on the US after 1945, the course begins at the outset of the 20th century in which a variety of statistical practices were developed to facilitate decision making under uncertainty. Topics include eugenics, the US census, public health, citizenship, histories of computing, Cold War rationality, history of the social sciences, criminal justice, civil rights, advertising, modernization theory, the military-industrial complex, artificial intelligence, machine learning, free press, and censorship.

In this course you will be asked to re-think American history. That is, we will approach the history of America as a continental history. This will require that we think of North America as a New World space, a place that was inhabited and occupied by indigenous peoples, and then remade by the arrival and settlement of Europeans. You will be asked to imagine a North America that was indigenous and adaptive, as well as colonial and Euro-American. This approach to the study of North American history is designed to challenge the epistemology and literature of the history of colonization and American expansion, which displaces Native peoples from the central narrative of American history by placing them at the physical margins of colonial and national development. Instead we will explore the intersection and integration of indigenous and Euro-American national identity and national space in North America and trace their co-evolution from first contact through the early nineteenth century Spring 2022: HIST UN3501 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 3501 001/15461 W 4:10pm - 6:00pm 522c Kent Hall Michael Witgen 4.00 10/15 HIST UN3517 The Historical Imagination in Caribbean Literature. 4.00 points. Caribbean literature offers complicated and vivid portrayals of the Caribbean’s past, and grapples with difficult histories lived by its people that compromised colonial archives can only partially capture. Literary works far exceed the limited narratives of Caribbean history by imagining entire worlds that official documents could never contain, rich selves, cultures and communities built by many generations of Caribbean people. This course is aimed at bringing forth a broader understanding of Caribbean history by examining a body of creative works by feminist and womanist writers that continuously remain attuned to the complexities of the past, which are either underrepresented or absent in the record. Chosen literary texts will also be paired with historical works that will illuminate and contextualize the multiple themes with which these Caribbean authors frequently engage, including slavery, and colonialism, racism and colorism, migration and immigration, gender and sexuality, poverty and globalization. From these pairings, students will explore both the divergences and alignments in how writers and historians approach the work of retelling the past, and will acquire reading and writing skills that will foster thoughtful critical analysis of the ever-changing contours of the Caribbean’s history HIST UN3529 Landscapes of American Modernity, 1880-1940. 4.00 points. This course examines the transformation of rural and urban landscapes in the U.S. in the critical era of industrial consolidation, 1880-1940. We investigate the creation of an infrastructure for agriculture that transformed natural environments; the changing vernacular architecture of domestic and industrial workplaces; the development of central downtowns as sites of office buildings, department stores, and civic centers; the spatial instantiation of the Jim Crow segregationist regime in the North as well as the South; the relation between real estate and finance that fueled the Great Depression; and the development of New Deal policies that underwrote public works—including highways-- and public housing, while also subsidizing home ownership, agribusiness, and segregation (the historical context for debates over the “Green New Deal.”.

A study of the French Atlantic World from the exploration of Canada to the Louisiana Purchase and Haitian Independence, with a focus on the relationship between war and trade, forms of intercultural negotiation, the economics of slavery, and the changing meaning of race. The demise of the First French Colonial Empire occurred in two stages: the British victory at the end of the Seven Years War in 1763, and the proclamation of Haitian Independence by insurgent slaves in 1804. The first French presence in the New World was the exploration of the Gulf of St. Lawrence by Jacques Cartier in 1534. At its peak the French Atlantic Empire included one-third of the North American continent, as well as the richest and most productive sugar and coffee plantations in the world. By following the history of French colonization in North America and the Caribbean, this class aims to provide students with a different perspective on the history of the Western hemisphere, and on US history itself. At the heart of the subject is the encounter between Europeans and Native Americans and between Europeans and Africans. We will focus the discussion on a few issues: the strengths and weaknesses of French imperial control as compared with the Spanish and the British; the social, political, military, and religious dimensions of relations with Native Americans; the extraordinary prosperity and fragility of the plantation system; evolving notions of race and citizenship; and how the French Atlantic Empire shaped the history of the emerging United States Spring 2022: HIST GU4110 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 4110 001/13082 W 2:10pm - 4:00pm 311 Fayerweather Pierre Force 4.00 10/15 HIST GU4229 POLITICS ＆ SEXUALITY IN THE COLD WAR. 4.00 points. The course presents new approaches for revisiting the study of this key period, moving away from more conventional angles to focus on global dynamics by looking at Latin America through the lens of sexuality and family. From this perspective, it will map out different problems and it will prompt a stimulating debate, allowing for discussions on generational as well as gender clashes, everyday life, and affective and emotional bonds, but also on the political strategies of the forces in conflict, public policies and cultural interventions. Discussions will underline interpretative and methodological dilemmas in relation with the historical reconstruction. Particularly, it will consider the relation between political and socio-cultural processes and the connection between the “longue durée” and contingency of the historical events. The course will allow students to explore these problems by themselves and promote their active participation, requesting different type of production from them such as oral intervention, an essay, etc. To sum up, this course offers the opportunity to rethink the Cold War, which still stir sensitivities and which is part of the political agenda even today, in a deeper and more complex way Spring 2022: HIST GU4229 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 4229 001/14341 W 2:10pm - 4:00pm 802 International Affairs Bldg Isabelle Cosse Larghero 4.00 10/15 HIST GU4231 Eastern Europe’s Cold War . 4 points. This seminar explores the Cold War's impact on Eastern Europe (1940s-1980s) and Eastern Europe's Cold War-era engagements with the wider world. We will address the methodologies used by historians to answer questions like these: What was the Cold War? What did it mean, and for whom? We will also look at the Cold War as something more than a series of events; we will consider its value, uses, and limits as a device for framing the second half of the twentieth century.

How does law shape the way that people live together in society, and how do changes in society bring about changes in the law? How is law lived on the ground, and how did its subjects think about it and use it for their own purposes? In this class, we will read recent and significant scholarship in the history of the early American republic (c. 1776-1840) that explores these questions, drawing on the history of the law and legal sources. Although this class will touch on some of the better-known arguments among scholars of legal history, its approach will be more practical than theoretical. Its primary focus will not be on the evolution of American law as a conceptual matter, or on philosophical arguments about the nature of the law. Rather, students in this class will read in order to become better researchers: to learn more about how law worked in the early American republic, about the institutions through which it operated, about how it changed over time, and how it formed (and was formed by) American society. This reading-intensive class is intended for graduate students and advanced undergraduate students who are interested in the history of the law, or in conducting research projects that draw extensively on legal sources. For undergraduates, previous coursework in US history is strongly recommended Spring 2022: HIST GU4489 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 4489 001/14076 M 2:10pm - 4:00pm 329 Uris Hall Hannah Farber 4.00 16/15 HIST GU4509 PROBLEMS IN INT'L HISTORY. 4.00 points. The object of this course is to illuminate how histories of the realm we think of as "international" are structured by means of key concepts, foundational concepts that form semantic fields of politics and policy. The seminar will chiefly be devoted to some ways of this in the empirical context of what is now being called the subfield of ‘the U.S. in the World.’ Spring 2022: HIST GU4509 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 4509 000/12862 T 4:10pm - 6:00pm 301m Fayerweather Anders Stephanson 4.00 10/15 HIST GU4511 The Philosophical Life. 4.00 points. The history of philosophy is not only the story of how particular concepts and doctrines — regarding cosmology, metaphysics, mind, language, ethics, politics — developed in the past. It also is the story of different conceptions of the philosophical life itself. In recent decades historians and philosophers have become increasingly interested in this subject. This seminar is devoted to examining different themes and episodes in this history, from antiquity to the present. In the spring of 2022 we will focus on ideas about the philosophical life in classic modern thinkers, from Bacon to Kant Spring 2022: HIST GU4511 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 4511 001/14079 M 12:10pm - 2:00pm 522c Kent Hall Mark Lilla 4.00 6/15 HIST GU4532 TOPICS IN AMERICAN CIVIL WAR AND RECONSTRUCTION. 4.00 points. Few events in American history can match the significance of the American Civil War and Reconstruction and few left a better cache of records for scholars seeking to understand its signal events, actors, and processes. Starting with the secession of eleven southern states, white southerners’ attempts to establish a proslavery republic (the Confederate States of America) unleashed an increasingly radical, even revolutionary war. Indeed, as the war assumed a massive scope it drove a process of state building and state-sponsored slave emancipation in the United States that ultimately reconfigured the nation and remade the terms of political membership in it Spring 2022: HIST GU4532 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 4532 001/13181 W 10:10am - 12:00pm 301m Fayerweather Stephanie McCurry 4.00 16/15 HIST GU4711 OCCULT IN THE MUSLIM PAST. 4.00 points. This seminar is designed to explore the rich but sorely understudied occult scientific lore in the pre-modern Islamic world. For over a millennium, from the seventh through even the twenty-first century, and spanning a broad geographical spectrum from the Nile to Oxus, different forms and praxis of occult scientific knowledge marked intellectual and political endeavors, everyday lives and customs, and faith-based matters of individuals constituting the so-called Islamicate world. However, despite the impressive array of textual, material, and visual sources coming down to us from the Muslim past, the topic has been severely marginalized under the post-Enlightenment definitions of scientific knowledge, which also shaped how the history of sciences in the Islamicate world was written in the last century. One of this seminar’s main objectives is to rehabilitate such biased perspectives through a grand tour of occult knowledge and practice appealed in the pre-modern Muslim world. Over the semester, by relying on a set of secondary studies and translated primary sources, we will revisit the question of the marginalization of Islamicate occult sciences, explore the actors’ definitions and discussions about the epistemic value of these sciences, trace their social and political implications in everyday life and imperial politics, and examine the key textual, technical, and material aspects of the occult tradition. In several of our sessions, we will have hands-on practice to better familiarize ourselves with the instructed techniques and methods in different branches of occult sciences. We will also regularly visit the Columbia University Rare Book ＆ Manuscript Library to view texts and materials available in our collection Spring 2022: HIST GU4711 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 4711 001/12821 W 10:10am - 12:00pm 311 Fayerweather Tunc Sen 4.00 11/15 HIST GU4723 Politics of Archaeology. 4.00 points. “Who owns antiquities?” “Who owns culture?” These questions that appear frequently today in both popular and scholarly discourse are deeply embedded in political issues and have a long history, going back to the nineteenth century. The seminar will investigate the origins of the battles over antiquities and their links empire building, colonialism, Orientalism, modernity, power, identity construction, racial hierarchies, and money. The chronological frame is from the 1850s to1914 and the geographical focus in the Ottoman Middle East, which was the major theater of contestations. We will look closely into two areas: archaeological excavations and museums. If objects were unearthed (“discovered”) in the first, they were displayed in the second; the Middle East was crowded with the first, while the major museums were in the West, with the exception of the Museum of Antiquities in Istanbul. We will also consider the vast and complex human landscape around the antiquities. In addition to archaeologists, this community included emperors, sultans, diplomats, spies, artists, inspectors, bureaucrats, technocrats, and workers, hence a cohort of individuals from many nationalities, economic strata, ethnic groups, and religions Spring 2022: HIST GU4723 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 4723 001/14077 M 2:10pm - 4:00pm 311 Fayerweather Zeynep Celik 4.00 15/17 HIST GU4926 Spatial History Lab. 2 points.

This course introduces undergraduate and graduate students to the materials, techniques, contexts, and meanings of skilled craft and artistic practices in early modern Europe (1350-1750), in order to reflect upon a series of topics, including craft knowledge and artisanal epistemology; the intersections between craft and science; and questions of historical methodology in reconstructing the material world of the past. The course will be run as a “Laboratory Seminar,” with discussions of primary and secondary materials, as well as hands-on work in a laboratory.

State Power ＆ Popular Resistance in Global Historical Perspective. 4.00 points. The Covid-19 pandemic showed that states had various ways of mobilizing their populations and imposing regulations. Some resorted to authoritarian measures, others to suasion, voluntary participation, or social pressure. People's compliance or resistance to these requirements greatly varied across countries and regions, as in the case of face-mask or vaccination mandates. Whatever the circumstances, trust in the state and law obedience played a crucial role for anti-epidemic policy and its effectiveness. This raises a fundamental historical issue about how states build legitimacy and compliance over time and space, despite facing numerous popular resistances and oppositions. How are state obligations such as vaccination, conscription, taxation, compulsory education, social insurance, etc., implemented, respected, or contested? Is it a mere story of violence and power, or does it also imply collective negotiation, voluntary participation, and consent? Why are some states fiercely resisted by their population, while others inspire trust and compliance? The goal of this discussion seminar is to explore this puzzle through the lenses of comparative and global history, in a longue durée perspective and in close interaction with social sciences (anthropology, political science, sociology, and psychology). Each session will be devoted to one facet of the state, bringing together European, American, and imperial situations and case studies Spring 2022: HIST GU4971 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment HIST 4971 001/15587 T 10:10am - 12:00pm 311 Fayerweather Nicolas Delalande 4.00 13/18 Spring 2022 Cross-listed Courses PLEASE READ: The passage below lists *all* sections being offered by a Columbia instructor for a given course, including sections which *do not* count for History students.

Some of the themes we will analyze include conceptions of home and nation; the use, creation, and politics of language; intergenerational relationships between women; the rites and rights of girlhood and womanhood; and intersecting identities. We will specifically address how Caribbean women scholars/activists/artists critique racism, sexism, classism, heterosexism, colonialism, neocolonialism, and tourism within Caribbean sociocultural landscapes. In addition, we will analyze how Caribbean women/womyn frame and interrogate the politics of slavery, emancipation, freedom, resistance, rebellion, and independence during different historical eras.
