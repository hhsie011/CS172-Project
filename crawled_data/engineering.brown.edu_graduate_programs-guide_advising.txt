Our graduate programs are designed to bring students to the forefront of knowledge in their respective fields, and to advance that knowledge for the benefit of society. To accomplish this, a close working relationship is typically needed between a graduate student and his or her primary faculty advisor. In the Ph.D. program in particular, the student/advisor relationship is key to a successful and enjoyable graduate experience. The main function of the Committee for Graduate Studies is to assist students in finding appropriate advisors, to monitor academic progress, and to offer advice on problems that may arise.
