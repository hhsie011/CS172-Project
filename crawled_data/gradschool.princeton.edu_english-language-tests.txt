Please view our English Language Proficiency policy for more information. The two internationally recognized tests of English language proficiency which we accept are Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or the International English Language Testing System (IELTS). The following applicants must submit valid TOEFL or IELTS scores: Applicants whose native language is not English. Native language is defined as the language spoken in one's family, community, and nation. (English must be the native language of the nation.) Applicants whose native language is not English and who have earned an undergraduate degree from a college/university in a country where the native language is not English. Applicants whose native language is not English and who have earned a master's degree in the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, or Anglophone Canada. Applicants whose native language is not English but studied for less than three years at a college/university in the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, or Anglophone Canada. The only exemption for this requirement is if the native language is not English, but the applicant has or will have studied for a minimum of three years towards a bachelor's degree or a Ph.D. in the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, or Anglophone Canada before enrollment. Receiving a bachelor's degree in a country that lists English as an official language such as India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Nigeria, or Singapore does not exempt an applicant from the English language proficiency requirement. Still not sure if you need English language proficiency test? There is no place in our application for you to self-report required test scores as we only accept the official score reports sent from the test administrator.
