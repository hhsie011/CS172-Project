At its heart, the program considers dentistry a specialty of medicine. A solid understanding of the human body shapes the foundation of the program. In an environment of excellence, shared with Harvard Medical School classmates in the study of the basic sciences, students gain an appreciation of the human mind, body, and spirit. The opportunity to learn firsthand the importance of the doctor-patient relationship, and participation in research, results in a deep understanding of the synergy of oral health and general health. The Pathways curriculum is presented in an interdisciplinary format that fosters independent learning, critical thinking, and lifelong learning skills important to health-care professionals. The curriculum incorporates new pedagogy and utilizes flipped classrooms and team-based group activities to enhance the academic environment for learners. The inclusion of a first-year primary care medical rotation as part of the introduction to clinical dentistry fulfills the school’s vision of transforming dentistry by removing the distinction between oral and systemic health. This unique collaborative learning environment stimulates and challenges students to learn, think and apply their knowledge of science in new ways.
