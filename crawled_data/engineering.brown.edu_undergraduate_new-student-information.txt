The suggestions on this page are intended only to help you to understand some of your options. There are many ways to start the engineering curriculum, and your freshman advisor will work with you to design a program that fits your goals. First Semester Courses During your first semester, you could consider taking the following courses: ENGN0030 (Introduction to Engineering) or ENGN0031 (Honors Introduction to Engineering) or ENGN0032 (Introduction to Engineering - Design) A mathematics course (eg MA0100, 0190, 0200) Either a computer science course (eg CSCI0110, 0150, 0170, or 0190), a chemistry course (eg CHEM0330), or a neuroscience course (eg NEUR 0100) depending on your interests An elective from the humanities and social sciences Second Semester Courses For the second semester, you could consider taking: ENGN0040 (Dynamics and Vibrations) or ENGN0520 (Circuits and Signals) A mathematics course (eg MA0180, 0200, 0540, or APMA0330) Either a computer science course (eg CSCI0160, 0180, or APMA0160), a biology course (eg. BIOL0200), or a chemistry course (eg CHEM0330 or 0350), depending on your interests An elective from the humanities and social sciences Course Information Review some brief information and suggestions about these courses by subject area. Engineering courses ENGN0030/ENGN0031/ENGN0032: (Introduction to Engineering / Honors Introduction to Engineering / Introduction to Engineering - Design), is the first course in the engineering core curriculum and is required of all engineering concentrators. The purpose of the course is to introduce students to the profession of engineering and the important role engineers play in society. The course begins with the consideration of engineering design and introduces a number of topics and tools that are fundamental to engineering. These include vectors, computer aided design (SolidWorks), and basic programming (Matlab). Particular attention is then focused on analysis of static structures, but topics also include professional ethics and the social responsibility of engineers. ENGN 0030 should be taken by first-year students considering a concentration in engineering, as well as students just curious about engineering and design. Students should be enrolled in MATH 0100 or higher. Students should enroll in ENGN 0031 if they are enrolled in MATH 0190 (or an equivalent or higher level math course) and have completed AP Physics (or equivalent). Any questions on placement can be addressed to Prof. Karen Haberstroh. ENGN 0031 will introduce scientific computing with statics as a primary source for applications. Using MATLAB as a programming language, topics covered in section include: variables, decision statements, looping statements, functions and recursion, strings and data structures, complexity and algorithm analysis, advanced visualization, and File I/O. Programming examples and assignments for applications in statics, numerical optimization and combinatorial optimization are included. Because of the Matlab focus in ENGN0031 section, students pursuing concentrations in mechanical, electrical or materials engineering who successfully complete this honors course may substitute an approved engineering/computer science course for introductory computer science requirement. All students (whether registered for ENGN0030 or ENGN0031) will be required to complete a set of training modules and three design projects in the Brown Design Workshop. These will all be performed as team-based activities (across the two classes), and led by an undergraduate mentor. ENGN0032 is is an introduction to the engineering profession with an emphasis on design. This class is designed for students who have a strong interest in design or are unsure of their interest in engineering. Students should be enrolled in MATH 0100 or higher. How to choose between ENGN 0030, 0031 or 0032? The answer is that all three courses serve the same purpose of being an introduction to engineering, and all are considered equivalent in terms of satisfying the requirements of an engineering concentration. The distinction between ENGN 0030 and ENGN 0031 is based upon mathematics preparation, as noted above. The distinction between ENGN 0032 and the other two courses is simply in the mode of delivery of the material - ENGN 0032 emphasizes the design aspects of engineering, whereas the other two courses tend to emphasize some more traditional fundamental underpinnings and tools of the engineering profession. While distinct from one another, all three courses are designed to prepare a student for all of the following courses in the engineering core program. ENGN0040: (Introduction to dynamics and vibrations) covers Newtonian physics and its applications in engineering. You also learn how to use the computer program MATLAB; and complete four design projects. MA0200 is a co-requisite; if you are following a different math sequence you can request an over-ride from the course instructor. ENGN0520: (Circuits and Signals) covers electrical circuits and their applications. It makes extensive use of differential equations. ENG0520 is a good choice if you have a strong interest in computer engineering or electrical engineering, and took MATH0200 in your first semester. Math courses Math is likely to be of interest to anyone considering engineering. Four math/applied math courses are required for an engineering Sc.B., and many engineering courses have mathematics prerequisites. You can select a course that fits your background and interests. The Department of Mathematics can help you choose the right starting point. Your options include: MATH 0190 is the starting course for many engineering students. It covers vectors; calculus; and infinite series. MATH 0200: covers multivariable calculus. More advanced students (e.g. those with 4 or 5 on the BC exam) often start in this course. MATH 0100: is an intermediate calculus course. This class is a good choice if you have only one semester of calculus, or do not feel ready for MA0190. MATH 0090: Take this course if you have not yet taken any calculus. MATH 0350: A more theoretical and challenging calculus course for students with special interest in math. MATH 0520/0540 (linear algebra) or APMA 0330 (differential equations) may be of interest if you have taken university level calculus courses already. Note that MA0100 or higher is a pre-requisite for EN0030. If you start in MA0090 you should use your first year to strengthen your math. You could also consider taking other chemistry and computer science courses; and can start the engineering sequence in sophomore year. You will still have plenty of time to complete the engineering requirements. Chemistry courses Chemistry is also a very useful course for engineers. It is required (or meets a requirement) for all engineering concentrations. The Chemistry department can help you choose and enroll in the best course. Briefly: CHEM 0330 (equilibrium, rate and structure) is the recommended course for engineers, but you must meet some prerequisites to enroll in this course (see the instructions from the chemistry department for details). Briefly, to enroll in CHEM0330, you must either: Have a score of 4 or 5 on AP chemistry, or Pass the chemistry placement exam (Details and registration). The test is not hard, but you will find it helpful to spend some time reviewing chemistry during orientation week to make sure you get a good score. If you have advanced chemistry (A levels; a prior University course in chemistry, or IB) you can enroll in a higher level course. If you have no chemistry you can enroll in CHEM0100, but note that CHEM0100 cannot be used to meet concentration requirements in engineering. CHEM 0350 (Organic Chemistry) is often taken in the first year by engineering students interested in biomedical engineering; chemical and biomedical engineering; as well as pre-medical students. Computer Science courses Computer Science: Programming skills are essential for all engineers, and if you are interested in computer engineering or computer science, you will certainly want to start taking CSCI courses in your first year. The Department of Computer Science offers guidelines to help you select computer science courses. Some good courses to consider include: CSCI0150/0160 or CSCI0170/0180 or CSCI0190 are intended to provide a rigorous introduction to computer science and programming for students with a special interest in the subject. They are required for students interested in computer engineering. All engineers will find the material in these courses very valuable. CSCI0110 is a new introductory course that focuses on data. Students work in a combination of programming languages (Pyret and Python) to begin to learn how different programming tools are suited to different tasks. APMA0160 is offered in the spring for students in any discipline seeking an introduction to scientific computing, and it includes instruction for programming in MATLAB. Biology courses Biology is playing an increasingly important role in all areas of engineering. If you are interested in biomedical engineering, biology, or the bio-related tracks of the other engineering programs, you will probably be hoping to start taking biology courses during your first year. Some of the options include: NEUR 0010 The Brain: An Introduction to Neuroscience BIOL 0200 The Foundations of Living Systems A high score in AP Biology usually allows you to place out of BIOL 0200. Make sure you discuss your choices carefully with your advisor to ensure that you prepare correctly, leave yourself maximum flexibility, and preferably are not registered for a semester filled with only heavy math and science courses. Physics courses Using introductory physics courses for Engineering concentration credit If you are trying to choose between Physics and Engineering, the Engineering/Physics ScB degree might be of interest to you. In Engineering/Physics, you can take PHYS0050 and PHYS0060, PHYS0070 and PHYS 0160, or ENGN0030/0031 and ENGN0040 in Freshman year. All these choices will satisfy concentration requirements, and you will be able to choose Engineering or Physics versions of many other courses in the program. The Engineering/Physics program will give you an excellent grounding in applied solid-state physics. In other Engineering concentrations, PHYS courses (other than those explicitly listed in the concentration requirements) do not automatically meet Engineering concentration requirements. PHYS courses can always be used for advanced placement - so for example if you have taken PHYS0070, you can replace either ENGN0030 or ENGN0040 with a more advanced Engineering course. But in ABET accredited programs PHYS can only be substituted for ENGN if the overall plan of courses contains enough engineering classes to meet ABET credit hour requirements. Course substitutions always need approval from the relevant concentration adviser. The table below provides a rough guide to whether Engineering concentrations will be able to approve substitution of Physics for Engineering.
