While the benefits elections you make during Open Enrollment each fall generally remain in effect until the end of the plan year (December 31), you may make limited changes to your benefits outside of Open Enrollment due to a Qualified Life Status Change. Examples of Qualified Life Status Changes: Change in legal marital status: Marriage, death of spouse, divorce or annulment Change in dependent status: A dependent under the age of 26 who is no longer a full-time student Change in Medicare eligibility: Becoming eligible for Medicare How to Make a Benefits Change If you experience a Qualified life Status Change, you must make your benefits changes within 31 days of the event. All benefits changes must comply with IRS regulations and be consistent with the nature of your Qualified Life Status Change. To make changes to your retiree benefits, please contact the Columbia Benefits Service Center at 212-851-7000.
