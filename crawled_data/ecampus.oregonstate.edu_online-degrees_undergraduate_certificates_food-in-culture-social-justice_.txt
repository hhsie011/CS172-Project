Earning your Undergraduate Certificate in Food in Culture and Social Justice online from Oregon State University will position you to help create a more equitable world through food by identifying and promoting food justice on a community, state or national level. This interdisciplinary program draws from the expertise within OSU’s College of Liberal Arts and College of Agricultural Sciences to deliver unique insights that appeal to professionals who are interested in food and social justice. The certificate is delivered online by Oregon State Ecampus, a nationally ranked leader in online education. The FCSJ curriculum and professors provided me with strong critical thinking skills, the ability to see my connection to the food system, and how my choices impact people, places and cultures. – Emma, 2018 graduate Coursework Through the lens of social justice and with the aim of nourishing communities so they can thrive, the 28-credit FCSJ certificate coursework examines the role that economic, social and political institutions contribute to the disparities of access to food. This program distinguishes itself from other, more common online food programs that focus on food science, quality and processes. Oregon State’s FCSJ certificate examines food as more than simple nourishment, delving into topics such as: how self-sufficient and sustainable food practices are utilized the history of particular food commodities when and how we eat and food practices within subcultures As a student in the program, you’ll select from courses in liberal arts and agricultural sciences. The courses will impart the skills needed to operate in an analytical framework as you solve complex situations and engage with communities. The program includes a 1-credit service learning experience where you’ll have the opportunity to engage in your local community.
