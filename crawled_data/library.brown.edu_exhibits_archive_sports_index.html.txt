Remembering Brown Sports An Exhibition from the Edward North Robinson Collection of Brown Athletics By Martha Mitchell This exhibit was on display at the John Hay Library from October 31 to December 31, 2001. View Exhibit (no frames) Slideshow view (frames) The Edward North Robinson Collection of Brown Athletics was established in 1943 by Coach Robinson's friends who purchased the library of the Boston Athletic Association and also donated their own scrapbooks, photographs, and other memorabilia. The Collection consists of over 30,000 team, action, and individual photographs, over 900 motion picture films and a vast array of cartoons, files of media guides and programs, and records of Brown athletic associations and facilities. In December 2000, an endowment was created by Coach Robinson's grandson, Jackson Robinson '64 for the preservation, enhancement, and promotion of the Collection. Support from the fund will make possible the restoration and copying of motion picture films and the ongoing work of collecting material and compiling sports statistics. Interested persons are invited to add their contributions to this fund. We should also be pleased to receive additions to the Collection, such as photographs, athletic programs, and other items from former athletes and collectors of Brown athletic memorabilia. The Robinson Collection takes its place among the more than one million items in the University Archives, which document the history of Brown University from its founding in 1764 to the present day. The Archives are the repository of official University records, University publications, and audio-visual material relating to Brown. The Archives are located in the John Hay Library, and welcome visitors and researchers Monday through Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Brown University Archives Box A | Brown University | Providence, Rhode Island 02912 401.863-2148 (telephone) | 401.863.2093 (fax) | hay@brown.edu exhibits home | special collections home | library home Site Design: Gwendolyn Fuertes, Class of 2005 and Jennifer A.
