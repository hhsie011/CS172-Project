The focal point of this work is Keller’s paper cast of the Villa Rotunda in Vicenza, Italy, which is theatrically hidden behind the excerpt from Palladio’s Four Books. Ottavio Bertotti Scamozzi’s adaptation of Palladio’s Four Books, part of the historic Fogg Collection at FAL, is also exhibited. These two books are paired not only to highlight Palladio’s importance to artists and architects over the last four hundred years but to also highlight the connections between FAL’s collections.
