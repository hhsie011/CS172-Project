About the Columbia Institute for Ideas and Imagination The Columbia Institute for Ideas and Imagination will open its doors in Paris in fall 2018. Its annual cohort will comprise seven Columbia University faculty fellows and seven fellows - scholars, writers and creative artists - from outside the USA. Its purpose is to question the established ways in which knowledge is defined, produced, and taught. The Institute encourages applications in all disciplines and on any topic from candidates interested in participating in a creative community of scholars, artists, and thinkers. The fellows will each receive $37,500 per term, or $75,000 for a full academic year (September through May), an office at the Institute in Paris, and access to Columbia’s libraries and various research facilities in Paris and in Europe. We welcome projects from those working in any area of the humanities, the humanistic social sciences, and conceptual dimensions of the natural and applied sciences, as well as visual artists, filmmakers, writers, and other creative thinkers. Recent PhDs are also invited to apply. We are especially keen to receive applications from non-US based candidates. In order to be eligible to apply, Columbia faculty should indicate their school and departmental affiliation. Other scholars must have received their doctorate and demonstrate a record of publication; creative writers (novelists, poets, playwrights, journalists, essayists) must demonstrate a record of publication; visual artists, musicians, and performers must have a significant body of work that has been exhibited or performed in public. We welcome group projects although each participant in the group must apply individually and will be considered on his or her own merits.
