Columbia Transportation provides information and tools to help you find carpool partners and to learn about the incentives that support carpooling. Car sharing allows individuals to live without owning a car, but allows them to get convenient access to a car when needed. Columbia has partnered with Zipcar to offer a car sharing service at a discounted price for University affiliates. This initiative saves space, and user fees incentivize members to only use a car when they really need one. Visit the Columbia Transportation website to review all of the carpooling, ride sharing, and car sharing options available.
