I had a wonderful and caring pediatrician who took care of me from infancy until I graduated from college. I still remember feeling devastated when he told me it was time to find a doctor who cared for adults! That continuity of care was so important to my development, and it is what I love most about being a pediatrician. I get to watch my patients grow up and make sure they stay healthy along the way. I am a general pediatrician at Columbia West Side Pediatrics on West 86th Street, where I see children of all ages, from birth through adolescence. I have a special interest and expertise in caring for babies born prematurely or with complex medical conditions who require hospital admission after birth. NICU graduates often need more frequent follow up care during their first year of life, as well as coordination of care with multiple subspecialists. Being a part of the larger Columbia medical community gives me the ability to provide the highest level of care for these infants. I am also passionate about supporting parents during this journey, as they often have had a very stressful introduction to parenthood. My favorite appointments are the annual check-ups for my former premature patients who are now school aged. I ask their parents, "Do you remember how small she used to be?" And their parents often respond, "Do you remember how terrified I was?" So much of being a good pediatrician goes beyond the medicine that was taught in medical school and residency. Pediatricians also have to be able to offer guidance and support for issues such as poor sleep, picky eating, problem behaviors, and school concerns. These issues are as important to recognize, diagnose, and treat as ear infections and asthma. Drawing on my experienceraising my own three children in New York City, I enjoy partnering with parents to guide them through both the delights and challenges of raising children in this great city.
