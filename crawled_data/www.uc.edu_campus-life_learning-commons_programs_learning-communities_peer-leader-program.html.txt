Peer Leaders are responsible for leading Learning Community meetings each week with content focused on the First Year Target Learning Areas, planning and implementing social events for LC students, and providing individual and small group mentoring. Peer Leaders attend weekly meetings, have weekly office hours, and develop lesson plans to meet the needs of their students. Peer Leaders must have experience and the academic background needed to address the academic needs and interests of their students. An important role of Peer Leaders is collaborating with faculty, advisors, organizations, and others to give students a high quality LC experience that prepares them for subsequent academic accomplishments. "My experience as a Peer Leader is one that I wouldn't change for the world. It has gotten me so much more involved on campus both with knowing more about ongoing events and movements, as well as letting me meet very involved people on campus. I've felt personally responsible for helping my students strive. Being a Peer Leader has made me want to be a better role model and make the most out of my college years.” A&S Peer Leader Learning Commons 2510B French Hall West 513-556-3244 Fax: 513-556-0823 learningcommons@uc.edu UC Tools Canopy & Canvas One Stop Email Catalyst Shuttle Tracker IT Help UC VPN Bearcats Landing About Us Maps & Directions Jobs News Diversity Governance & Policies Directory Events Calendar University of Cincinnati | 2600 Clifton Ave. | Cincinnati, OH 45221 | ph: 513-556-6000 Alerts | Clery and HEOA Notice | Notice of Non-Discrimination | eAccessibility Concern | Privacy Statement | Free Speech | Copyright Information © 2020 University of Cincinnati Learning Commons 2510B French Hall West 513-556-3244 Fax: 513-556-0823 © 2020 University of Cincinnati scroll up to the top
