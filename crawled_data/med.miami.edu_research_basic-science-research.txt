Alumni Giving Home Research Basic Science Research Basic Science Research Improving our understanding through basic research Basic science research sounds simple. It is chiefly a curiosity-driven field, where researchers work to fill in gaps of scientific knowledge. But it is the bedrock to all understanding of the human body, advancements in scientific discovery, and innovations in medical technology and treatments. In basic science and clinical departments across the Miller School of Medicine, researchers are studying cell biology, immunology, biochemistry, pharmacology, microbiology, and genetics in all organisms, from bacteria to humans. Basic science research leads to scientific discovery, the process or product of successful scientific inquiry. It includes scientific activities from observation to laboratory experiments and data mining. Our discovery scientists work together to propel innovation and uncover the mysteries of biomedical science, which we later apply in a clinical setting. Here at the Miller School, we offer a dynamic learning environment, where scientists at all levels work together to address gaps in understanding across the spectrum of medical science specialties. We offer a variety of core and shared facilities, internal awards to facilitate externally funded grants, research education and training, career development, and grant writing assistance, among many other services to foster the success of our investigators.
