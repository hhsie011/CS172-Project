Grants can come from federal and state governments, as well as from Georgia Tech. Only undergraduates who have not previously received a bachelor's degree are eligible. Grants are awarded to those who exhibit exceptional financial need and apply for aid by the priority deadline. Several types of grants are described below. Federal Pell Grant Pell Grants are awarded to eligible undergraduate students who do not have a bachelor's degree. Award amounts are based on the assumption of 12 eligible hours per semester.
