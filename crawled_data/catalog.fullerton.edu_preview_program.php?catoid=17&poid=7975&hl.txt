Print Degree Planner (opens a new window) | Print-Friendly Page (opens a new window) Facebook this Page (opens a new window) Tweet this Page (opens a new window) (30 UNITS) The curriculum for a master’s degree in accountancy is designed for students with an undergraduate degree in accounting. In addition to 12 units of required accounting courses, six units of accounting electives, nine units in an area other than accounting, and a terminal research-project course are required. Students not holding an undergraduate degree in accounting or business are welcome to apply but will have additional requirements to satisfy as described below in the Curriculum section. Most graduate courses in the Mihaylo College of Business and Economics require “classified MCBE status” and are open only to students with classified standing in the MBA, M.S. in Accountancy, M.S. in Taxation, M.S. in Information Systems, or M.A. in Economics programs. Admission Requirements Admission is competitive. Students must meet the CSU requirements for admission to a master’s degree program. Please consult the Graduate Admissions section in this catalog for complete information. In addition, applicants will be evaluated based on the following: the GMAT or GRE are not required, but strongly recommended for applicants with GPAs less than 3.3 on a 4.0 scale; a bachelor’s degree in Business Administration with an accounting concentration or in accounting (equivalent to the degree and concentration as offered at CSUF) with at least an overall cumulative GPA of 3.0 (B). Courses in the major are to be no more than seven years old, and courses in the accounting concentration no more than five years old. Courses in the major (including the accounting concentration) with grades lower than “C” (2.0) must be repeated. Applicants who have a bachelor’s degree in a field other than Business Administration with an accounting concentration or accounting may be considered for admission. If admitted, such students will be required to complete additional courses or demonstrate proficiency as described in the next section (Curriculum); a minimum score of 570 on the paper-based, or 88 on the Internet-based (iBT) TOEFL is required (for international students); and a recommendation from the M.S. Accountancy Admissions Committee based upon a review of the above requirements, the student’s “Statement of Purpose” and prior work experience. Additional coursework may be required of admitted students who holistically satisfy the criteria but are weak in one of the above areas. M.S.
