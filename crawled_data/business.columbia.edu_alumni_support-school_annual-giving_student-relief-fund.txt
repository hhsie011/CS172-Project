We are creating a series of internship and research opportunities with the School’s Centers and faculty to help students as the economic effects of the pandemic unfold. During this time of uncertainty, we also are calling upon our alumni to partner with us. Members of the classes of 2020 and 2021 have reported that their summer internship and job offers are being rescinded or deferred, and we expect more students will have similar experiences in the weeks and months ahead. In response, the School is co-funding, with the help of contributions from generous donors, an initiative that addresses this critical need. The Student Relief Fund will help these students get through this difficult time with resources and employment opportunities. Our students need your help. Many of you in our community have previously experienced similar economic hardships during times of economic uncertainty. Now we are asking our network to come together and give back. Your contributions to the Student Relief Fund will have an unprecedented, immediate, and essential impact on our students, and will ensure the continued strength of our community as we persevere together. To make a gift in support of CBS students enduring economic hardship, or to post an internship opportunity for current students, please contact Helen Schreiber, Associate Director, at [email protected] or 212-851-4312.
