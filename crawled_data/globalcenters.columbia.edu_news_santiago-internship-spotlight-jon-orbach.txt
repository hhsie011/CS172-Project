Coming from a South African background, I was instantly enchanted with how much of a global unifier it is — it’s a point of connection in almost every corner of the world. Walk around Johannesburg in an Arsenal shirt, and you’ll see what I mean. “And when you look at the greats of world soccer, you find representation from all across both the developed and developing world. “They all have one thing in common, and it isn’t initial socioeconomic status. Whether they’re from Rotterdam or Rocinha, they’re the legends they are today because of their skill and determination. “As someone who’s constantly looking for ways to communicate with people of all origins, I find soccer an incredibly fun, useful and meaningful connector.” Internship: Institute of International Studies - Universidad de Chile “I'm enjoying my internship very much. Although it deals with heartbreaking material, the work I do contributes to a study for a good cause: it monitors the response of the Argentinian and Chilean governments' response to combat violence against women during the pandemic. Essentially, I transfer data from files and news articles into a spreadsheet, turning qualitative info quantitative, reading and confirming the news in the process. My supervisor, Tatiana Rein Venegas, Director of the Graduate School, is incredibly supportive and available, and the team is fantastic. I've really enjoyed my time with the Universidad de Chile so far, and I'm really happy that this is where I am this fall.” Tags Santiago Center Stories Santiago Internships Columbia Journalism School Instituto de Estudios Internacionales - Universidad de Chile Jon Orbach Tatiana Rein Venegas News May 26, 2022 Book Talk: A Slave Between Empires May 25, 2022 Alumni Spotlight: Gonzalo Mena May 24, 2022 Paris Center Stories: Translating Theater and Acting in Paris, Summer 2022 May 18, 2022 Book Talk: Your Sons Are at Your Service May 18, 2022 Academics from Chilean University UAI Visit Columbia to Strengthen Relationship with SEAS Columbia Global CentersAmman / Beijing / Istanbul / Mumbai / Nairobi / Paris / Rio / Santiago / Tunis Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
