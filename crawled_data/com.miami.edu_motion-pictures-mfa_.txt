Directing the Camera An introduction to directing actors in low budget, independent films utilizing traditional, modern and evolving directorial techniques used by independent and traditional film makers: analyzing and orchestrating scripted material, developing a directorial concept, creating indelible characterizations, building a visual image, auditioning and casting the talent, blocking and directing the untrained amateur or highly skilled professional actor. Documentary Production An introduction to the documentary genre including the production of a documentary from start to finish. Film Directors This course will address the conditions of authorship in film through an intensive study of the films of two or more directors, whose careers will serve as case studies. These directors will be historically important and their work will represent significant achievements in the art of film. Media Activism In this course, students will examine the role of media in shaping social reform to document social issues such as poverty, human rights, social inequities, the environment, and powerless groups. We will review the philosophy and history of media as activism ranging from photography, documentary, cinema, the Internet, social media and newer forms of media. Emphasis is placed on developing a critical understanding of current media advocacy practices with a conscious goal; awareness, change minds, to affect policy, and action. At the end of the semester, students will have a fully developed project concept. Narrative Production An introduction to film and digital production techniques on narrative projects. Emphasis on collaboration, group process and social purpose. Students will be expected to produce a short film abroad as part of this course.
