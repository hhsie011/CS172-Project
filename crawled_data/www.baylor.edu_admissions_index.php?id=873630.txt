Courses in the Film & Digital Media Department are designed to provide students with a broad-based understanding of this field, enabling them to become ethical, articulate, creative and innovative leaders in media production, media management and media studies. This minor is for students interested in the management side of the film industry. Most degree programs at Baylor do not require a student to select a minor area of study. Students may choose to minor in a field that supplements their major. Or, they may choose to pursue an area of academic interest completely outside their major. For example, a Communication Studies major may minor in media management, which would help them gain management experience. Courses a student might take include Visual Literacy: Sight, Sound, and Motion, Media and Society, or Writing for Media Markets. For more information, call the Film and Digital Media Department at (254) 710-1621. Why Baylor Academics Undergraduate Catalog Honors College Study Abroad Paul L.
