In honor of her father, a 1949 graduate of Clemson and renowned teacher, coach and principal, Moore and her husband, Richard Rainwater, gave a $10 million endowed gift to Clemson's educational leadership and teacher education efforts. The gift led to the creation of the Eugene T. Moore School of Education, home to renowned classroom and clinical training for pre-service teachers, professional mentoring of early-career teachers, and cutting-edge continuing education for in-service teachers. About the Moore Family Distinguished Friends In 2019, the College of Education began an annual tradition of presenting a Distinguished Friend of the College of Education Award. This award honors an individual, partner or program who has provided support over time to benefit the College of Education. The College has presented the award twice since its inception – to principal donor Darla Moore and to Calvin "Chip" Jackson, a longtime supporter and friend who was instrumental in the evolution of College and its advisory and advancement boards. Award Video - Darla Moore Award Video - Chip Jackson Advancement Board The College of Education Advancement Board partners with the College to seek resources and networking opportunities that support innovative projects, partnerships, scholarships and research.
