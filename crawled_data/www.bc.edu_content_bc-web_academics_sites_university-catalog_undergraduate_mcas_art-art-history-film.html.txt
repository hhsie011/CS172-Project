Art History Courses Film Courses Studio Art Courses Art, Art History, and Film Faculty Art, Art History, and Film Website Print Open All Close All Major Requirements: Art History Major Requirements: Art History Art history encompasses the study of images, objects, and buildings from a broad range of historical periods and geographical regions, providing a doorway into many rich and diverse cultures throughout the world. It is about vision in the broadest sense, how people saw themselves in the past, and how we see ourselves in the present and future. Art history understands art as an instrument of power and recognizes its potential for influencing contemporary social issues. By honing skills of careful observation, critical analysis, historical research, and written communication, a degree in art history provides students with tools to interpret the past in a wide variety of cultural contexts and teaches them how to be more critical participants within our media-saturated world. Through the close study of objects, art history cultivates a greater aesthetic awareness by considering questions of beauty, quality, and value across time and space. The teaching and research of our faculty cover the arts of Africa, Asia, Europe, the Americas, and the Islamic world, from ancient to contemporary times. Professors actively participate in interdisciplinary collaboration through co-teaching, joint research projects, workshops, conferences, and museum curation. Students are encouraged to think across geographic and disciplinary boundaries by studying the visual cultures of multiple regions and by taking courses in complementary fields, such as studio art, philosophy, sociology, history, and religion. Art history courses make use of the rich collections of Boston College’s McMullen Museum of Art and numerous other cultural institutions across the city, including the Museum of Fine Arts, Institute of Contemporary Art, and Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, as well as the built environment of historic Boston. Students frequently engage in summer internships and study abroad, enhancing traditional classroom learning through first-hand experience. The skills of observing, reading, and writing offered through an art history degree not only enrich life, but are fundamental to many future career paths. Alumni of the department have gone on to work in academia, art criticism, architecture, museums, art conservation, cultural preservation, intellectual property law, and at commercial galleries and auction houses. Because art history contributes to the broad intellectual foundation that constitutes a liberal arts education, the skills acquired are also transferable to many areas outside the discipline. The Art History major requires 11 courses (33 credits): ARTH1101 Intro to Art History I: Prehistory to Middle Ages ARTH1102 Intro to Art History II: Renaissance to Modern Two of the following three courses: ARTH2212 East Asian Art and Architecture, ARTH2213 Islamic Art and Architecture, ARTH2250 Introduction to African Art and Visual Culture One Studio Art (ARTS) course or ARTH4314 The Materials of Art and their Conservation Elective 1 (2000 or 3000 level) Elective 2 (2000 or 3000 level) Elective 3 (3000 or 4000 level) Elective 4 (3000 or 4000 level) Elective 5 (3000 or 4000 level) ARTH4401 Seminar in Art Historical Research (must be taken in the fall semester of junior or senior year) OPTIONAL Thesis: Students sign up for an Independent Study with a faculty advisor in the spring semester of their senior year. Students who write a senior thesis are eligible for departmental honors. The Art History major can also be completed with a concentration in Museum Studies, which requires a minimum of 12 courses (36 credits): ARTH1101 Intro to Art History I: Prehistory to Middle Ages ARTH1102 Intro to Art History II: Renaissance to Modern Two of the following three courses: ARTH2212 East Asian Art and Architecture, ARTH2213 Islamic Art and Architecture, ARTH2250 Introduction to African Art and Visual Culture ARTH4314 The Materials of Art and Their Conservation ARTH4370 Museum of Art: History, Philosophy, and Practice Course One of the following courses: MGMT1021 Organizational Behavior, MGMT2123 Negotiation, MGMT2127 Leadership, MGMT2132 Managing Change, MGMT2133 Leading High Performance Teams, MGMT2265 Globalization, Culture, and Ethics Elective 1 (2000 or 3000 level) Elective 2 (2000 or 3000 level) Elective 3 (3000 or 4000 level) Elective 4 (3000 or 4000 level) ARTH4401 Seminar in Art Historical Research (must be taken in the fall semester of junior or senior year) Major Requirements: Film Studies Major Requirements: Film Studies The Film Studies major applies the liberal arts tradition to the present-day culture of images and technologies. Courses in film history, theory, and criticism enable students to become active, selective, and ethical participants in a world progressively more dominated by the media of visual communication. Research-based studies in American and world cinema explore the mutual influence of the films and their respective diverse cultures and historic periods. Familiarity with several of the great films and filmmakers provides a basis for understanding the relationship between contemporary artists and industrial society. Each student will have an opportunity to apply this theoretical knowledge to the experience of film making and exhibition both through programs in scripting, photography, production, and digital editing, and through an extensive internship program in the Boston area. Students are encouraged to widen and deepen their understanding of the medium through additional courses in Art History, Studio Art, Theater, and Communication. While this Film Studies major provides a solid foundation for further studies and professional involvement in the industry, it also offers the liberal arts student a broad-based preparation for other career options. For more information, contact Prof. John Michalczyk, Director, Film Studies major Coordinator, Devlin Hall 420, 617-552-3895, john.michalczyk@bc.edu.

Students interested in the Film Studies minor may contact the Director, Professor John Michalczyk, Film Studies minor Coordinator, Devlin Hall 420, 617-552-3895, john.michalczyk@bc.edu. Studio Art Minor Studio Art Minor The minor in Studio Art offers students the opportunity to pursue a course of study in ceramics, design, digital arts, drawing, mixed media, painting, or photography. There are features of the minor program that resemble, in an abbreviated way, successful aspects of our majors' studio art program. The required Senior Minor Projects class, for example, will function analogously to our Senior Project. This curriculum of six courses is designed to encourage an in-depth investigation of one medium, rather than a generalized sampling of many. The course structure aims at having the individual student develop the artistic techniques and conceptual visual sensibility necessary for working as an artist today. It should be noted students will not be permitted to begin the Studio minor after their junior year. Students who are interested in declaring a minor can contact Professor Hartmut Austen, Studio Art minor Coordinator, Devlin Hall 414, hartmut.austen@bc.edu. Information for First-Year Majors Information for First-Year Majors First-Year Art History majors should take ARTH1101 Art from Prehistoric Times to the High Middle Ages with ARTH1103 Art History Workshop. First-Year Studio Art majors are advised to select two studio courses from ARTS1101, ARTS1102, ARTS1104, ARTS1107, ARTS1150, ARTS1155, or ARTS1161 before taking ARTS1103. First-Year Film Studies majors should take FILM2202 Introduction to Film, a required foundation course to ground the student in film language, history, and criticism. Information for Study Abroad Information for Study Abroad The Boston College Art, Art History, and Film Department offers study abroad options for Art History, Film Studies, and Studio Art majors. The department assists students with their options under close supervision, as well as providing encouragement. The Art, Art History, and Film Department believes strongly that study abroad is worthwhile, exposing students to not only other cultures but other forms and traditions of artistic expression. At the same time, it cautions students to consider their growth and development in their specific major and to integrate study abroad with their chosen area of concentration in consultation with their department advisor.
