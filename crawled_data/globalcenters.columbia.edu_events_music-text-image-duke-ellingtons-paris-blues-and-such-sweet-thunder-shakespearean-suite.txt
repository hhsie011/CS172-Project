8:30 PM 4, rue de Chevreuse, 75006 Paris This talk (a Mercredi de l'institut exceptionally on a Thursday) , entitled Music, Text, Image: Duke Ellington’s Paris Blues and Such Sweet Thunder (the Shakespearean Suite) offers a slide-and-music overview of two projects by the composer Duke Ellington: Such Sweet Thunder (his Shakespearean suite, 1957) and Paris Blues (his movie soundtrack, 1960). In both cases Ellington translated complex visual and literary material into his own musical idiom. Despite what Ellington considered the highly promising beginnings of Paris Blues (in early scripts), ultimately he found himself seriously at odds with that movie, and began to fight against it with his music. What was it about Paris Blues that Ellington rejected? What was his musical rejoinder? And what was Ellington’s sense of Shakespeare? How did he revise Shakespeare, too, for his own purposes?
