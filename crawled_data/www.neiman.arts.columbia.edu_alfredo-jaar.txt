I had been fascinated with Life Magazine since I moved to New York in 1982. I created a series of exercises around them, based on my interest on what I called then the politics of images. I felt Life Magazine was the perfect tool to reveal and present my ideas around representation of politics and race in American media. When it was announced that it would cease to publish in 1996, I decided to release these Life Magazine based works. Five found images in LIFE Magazine, December 5, 1969 is exactly what the title of the work announces. In that particular issue of the magazine, I had found the extraordinary, haunting photographs of the My Lai massacre. In analyzing the contents of the magazine, I discovered four other photographs that I felt resonated in particularly powerful ways with that photograph. And that work was born.” Learn more about this artist: Artist's Website Art21 Tate Guggenheim View fullsize Alfredo Jaar Five images found in LIFE Magazine, December 5, 1969 1995-2021 Portfolio with one solar plate etching, one Epson pigment print, two Epson pigment prints on surface gampi with screenprint and one photogravure 15-9/16 x 23-3/8 inches 15-9/16 x 22-1/16 inches 15-9/16 x 21-1/8 inches 15-9/16 x 18-9/16 inches Edition: 24 $18,000 Sign up to receive news and updates.
