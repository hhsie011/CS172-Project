Do you accept Score Choice or do you superscore standardized testing? We do accept Score Choice, and will superscore within both the SAT and ACT. What standardized tests do you require? For all applicants in the 2022-2023 admission cycle, Brown is test optional. This change is for the 2022-2023 academic year only. More updates and information can be found on our Standardized Tests webpage. English Proficiency: We highly recommend that international applicants who are safely able to do so take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), the International English Language Testing System (IELTS), or the Duolingo and arrange for Brown to receive the official results. A minimum score of 100 on the TOEFL internet-based exam or 600 on the paper-based exam, a minimum score of 8.0 on the IELTS, or a minimum score of 125 on the Duolingo is expected in most cases. Do you accept "expired" or older SAT or ACT scores? Technically speaking, standardized test scores do not expire, though those that are from more recent exams tend to be most representative of you as a student at the time of your application. If you have an older SAT or ACT that you would like to submit, you are welcome to self-report your score through the Common Application, regardless of the year in which you completed the test. Please note that this year, Brown is test-optional for first year students in the 2022-23 admission cycle. More information about our testing policies this year can be found here. If I want to include test scores as a part of my application, when is the deadline to submit my scores? Since Brown is test optional for first year applicants in the 2022-2023 admission cycle, test scores are not a required component of the first-year application this year. If you would like to include test scores for review in your application and are applying Early Decision, testing must be completed by the last October test date to ensure receipt of scores. If you are applying Regular Decision, testing must be completed by the last December test date to ensure receipt of scores. Are there minimum standardized test requirements or expectations for applicants? There are no minimum standardized test requirements, and we review all applications regardless of any test scores provided. While we do receive many applications from students with high test scores, we consider standardized test scores in the context of all the other information we have about a candidate. Test scores are one way to demonstrate academic potential, but applicants may show their preparedness for the rigors of Brown in a variety of ways. How does Brown evaluate standardized tests? We look at your test scores along with other information about your academic promise as we read your complete application. We do not attempt to assess test results in a formulaic way. If you have taken tests more than once, we concentrate on your highest scores. How do I submit standardized test results? If you have test scores to report, please either self-report your scores through the Common Application, upload them via your Brown Applicant Portal or have official test scores sent directly to Brown. To have scores sent to Brown, you will need to provide our institutional code numbers: For the SAT, Brown's code number is 3094 For the ACT, Brown's code number is 3800 For the TOEFL, Brown's code number is 3094 My high school transcript includes test scores that I did not want to send to Brown. Will you remove them from my application? Only testing that is reported by the applicant, either through self-reporting or official score reports, will be included in our review of your application. We will not consider test scores included on transcripts unless you direct us to do so.
