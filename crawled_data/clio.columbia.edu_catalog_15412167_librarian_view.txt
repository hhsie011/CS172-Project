The artist painted it either during or shortly after his second trip in 1857. The craggy structure in front of Cotopaxi probably represents the dormant and heavily eroded stratovolcano Rumiñawi. 520 |a This painting shows the volcano Cotopaxi in Ecuador spewing lava, ash, and smoke. From an elevated hillside, the viewer looks across an extensive green plain toward the majestic geological formation that rises in the distance. The contrast between the smoking cone and the craggy mountains before it contributes to the striking quality of the image. 541 1 |a Gift of Dr. Alan W.
