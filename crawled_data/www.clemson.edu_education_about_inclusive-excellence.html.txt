Over the years, the College has demonstrated a commitment to these values with long-standing programs such as Call Me MISTER® and ClemsonLIFE™and new degree programs and innovative initiatives that focus on race, rurality and poverty. In these efforts, the College seeks to develop actions that will contribute to our goal of making P-20 education an institution enhancing inclusive excellence. The College of Education understands Inclusive Excellence as an active process through which the College achieves excellence in learning, teaching, student development, organizational functioning, and engagement in local and global communities by surfacing inequities experienced by internal and external constituents, integrating equity and educational quality efforts, and building theory and context-based practices for sustained organizational change. This definition and operationalization is drawn from several resources including the University of Southern California Center for Urban Education, Association of American Colleges and Universities, National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education and Teaching for Diversity and Social Justice. Evening of Inclusive Excellence Series Throughout Spring 2021, the College held a “Evening of Inclusive Excellence” virtual panel series featuring educators, researchers and counselors who offered ideas supporting inclusive excellence in PK-12 settings. Topics in the three-part series included social-emotional learning, student discipline, teacher mental health, and culturally responsive curriculum. A session specific to ethics and ethical decision-making for inclusive excellence was co-sponsored by the Rutland Institute for Ethics’ student ethics committee, Creating Habits and Norms Guiding Ethical Decisions (CHANGE). Our Initiatives Special Advisor to the Dean for Diversity and Inclusive Excellence Natasha Croom Natasha Croom, Ph.D., is the Special Advisor to the Dean for Diversity and Inclusive Excellence. In this role, Dr. Croom serves under the leadership of George J. Petersen, founding dean of the College of Education, and plays an important role in coordinating communications and planning and executing projects for the college. She works closely with college leadership, faculty, staff and district partners to manage and implement activities that result from the College of Education Task Force on Diversity and Inclusive Excellence. This work includes but is not limited to producing and reviewing communications, conducting specific research and analysis on task force projects and activities, providing regular briefings to the dean, and supporting his undertaking special projects. Dr. Croom’s research uses critical theoretical frameworks and qualitative inquiry practices, and her scholarship centers the experiences of women of color in analyses of institutional practices and policies related to faculty advancement, student development and intersectional identity development in post-secondary environments. Her work has been featured in a wide variety of publications and journals, and she is an active member of the Association for the Study of Higher Education and NASPA-Student Affairs Administrators in Higher Education. Croom earned a Ph.D. in Educational Leadership in Higher Education from Iowa State University. She earned a Master of Science in Education in Higher Education Administration and a bachelor’s degree in psychology from Texas A&M University. Task Force for Diversity and Inclusive Excellence The College's Task Force for Diversity and Inclusive Excellence work with the Special Advisor to the Dean to develop initiatives fostering strategic inclusion and equity.
