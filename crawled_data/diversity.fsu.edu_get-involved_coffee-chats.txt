Lawton Distinguished Professor Quicklinks Make a Report Strategic Plan Anti-Racism Resources Coffee Chats The Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Office (Office of Human Resources) is excited to announce a new initiative: Coffee Chat Coffee Chat, hosted by the HR-EDI Office, aims to build a more inclusive and interconnected community on campus and the greater Tallahassee area. Separate from the EDI Lunch & Learn Series (intended to promote resources on campus that support underrepresented faculty, staff, and students), “Coffee Chat” is intended to foster relationships and build connections both across campus and the local area. Coffee Chat will be hosted on the first Friday of the month from 8:30am EST – 9:00am EST. Guests will range from university faculty, staff, and community entities. Each Coffee Chat guest will answer the following three questions: What’s new? What should we learn? What should we share? Coffee Chat is a part of the HR-EDI Office’s effort to foster a diverse, inclusive, and equitable campus community in alignment with the Diversity & Inclusion goal of the university’s strategic plan. We believe that goal extends beyond the campus grounds and that part of employee belonging is connecting to the community beyond the workplace. If you have ideas for future Coffee Chat sessions, please email Annie Grier, agrier@fsu.edu.
