Gil, who teaches at Universidad Católica´s School of Engineering, is a researcher at the government-funded National Research Center for Integrated Disaster Risk Management (CIGIDEN) and the Outreach Director of the recently created Chilean Technological Institute for Disaster Resilience (ITReND). She is working as part of the team of the PGIF-funded project entitled “An Examination of Disaster Management and Recovery in Post-Disaster Chile” under the leadership of Columbia’s Malo Hutson, Associate Professor in Urban Planning at GSAPP and Director of the Columbia World Projects. During her visit to campus, she presented her work on the social construction of risk at the National Center for Disaster Preparedness of the Earth Institute, where she also had the chance to discuss ITReND´s new role in making Chile more resilient, and also, the possibilities for the new institute to become a global referent in connecting academia with decision makers. At Columbia, Gil also met with John Furlow, Deputy Director of the International Research Institute for Climate and Society, and several members of his team to discuss possible academic side-events during COP25 to be held in Chile in early December.
