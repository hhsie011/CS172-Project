While the University remained open, for the remainder of the academic year, students were allowed to attend classes or work in the anti-war movement, or both. Final exams were optional and Campus Dance was cancelled. The introduction of open discussion workshops during the reunion weekend would become an ongoing tradition: Commencement Forums.
