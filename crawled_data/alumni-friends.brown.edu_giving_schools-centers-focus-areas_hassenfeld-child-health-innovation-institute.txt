The institute has established powerful research teams and built upon collaborative work with key players in child health throughout the state of Rhode Island. The institute's goal is to translate novel research into policy and practice that: Improves tools to screen newborns for developmental risks Addresses environmental risks for asthma and create targeted interventions Provides more comprehensive understanding of autism disorders and treatment options Develops and deliver programs to help children and their families maintain healthy weight “ The world’s greatest resource is our children. My hope is that when we look back — 10, 20 or 30 years from now — we will have created global solutions to children’s health conditions, bringing smiles where there were tears. ” Alan G. Hassenfeld philanthropist, retired chairman and CEO, Hasbro Hassenfeld researchers from Brown, the Warren Alpert Medical School and the School of Public Health work with community partners to apply the full range of their expertise — scientific, medical and social — to make an impact on these challenges to child health and train the next generation of child health leaders.
