Materials in South Asian languages using Perso-Arabic script are under the purview of the Middle Eastern Division in Widener. If published in the Americas or Europe, collections about South and Southeast Asia are under the purview of librarians covering these geographic areas of publication. Since 2013, Widener has expanded acquisitions to build a core collection of materials in Bengali, Burmese and languages spoken by ethic minorities of Myanmar, Chinese (for Southeast Asia), Hindi, Indonesian, Khmer, Lao, Malay, Nepali, Tagalog, Tamil, Thai, and tribal languages of Northeast India.
