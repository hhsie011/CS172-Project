If you drop a class after the term begins, you may receive a partial refund of your tuition and fees. For your possible tuition refund when dropping or withdrawing from a class, please refer to the academic calendar and the drop/withdraw refunds schedule. Requesting a refund If you feel that you have a legitimate, documented reason to petition for a refund of Ecampus tuition and fees, contact the Ecampus student services at 800-667-1465 (option 1) or via email for instructions and assistance with this formal process. Requests for refunds for all courses must be in writing. Refunds are granted in accordance with OSU Academic Regulations 11 and 12. Refunds are based on assessed tuition, course fees and mandatory fees, and are calculated from the date you officially drop, withdraw or cancel your registration or reduce your class load, not the last date of class attendance. Read more about withdrawing for the term. Refund processing Refunds will be processed as a credit on your account. A check will be issued to you for any remaining credit balance after accounts receivable and financial aid repayments have been satisfied. Allow about two weeks for processing a refund. Your refund will be sent to your current mailing address. Be sure to update your current mailing address online in MyOregonState. For more information about your refund or refund check, please contact Ecampus student services at 800-667-1465 (option 1) or via email. Late fees Late registration fees – $50 and $100 A late registration fee of $50 will be assessed for all initial registrations during the first two weeks of classes. Initial registration after the second week of classes will be assessed a late fee of $100. Registration change – $20 per course added You will be charged a $20 fee to add classes after Week 2 of the term. There is no charge to change registration during the add/drop period: add, drop, withdraw from a course, change credits, change grade option or change to audit. The course fee to audit a course is the same as regular fees in all classes. Please note that late registration fees still apply.
