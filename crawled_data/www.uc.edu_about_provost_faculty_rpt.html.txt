Criteria and procedures are developed at the unit level and are subject to approval of the dean and provost. The review process typically requires independent reviews by a unit committee, a unit head, a college committee, the dean, and the provost. Faculty should work closely with their unit heads in order to ensure that they meet all dossier submission deadlines and requirements.
