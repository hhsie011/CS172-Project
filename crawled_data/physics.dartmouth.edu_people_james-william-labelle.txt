Rodgers Professor Department Chair Jim LaBelle is an experimental space plasma physicist. He has been at Dartmouth since 1989. He earned his undergraduate degree in physics from Stanford University (1980), followed by masters and doctorate degrees in applied physics from Cornell University (1982 and 1985). He did post-doctoral work at the Max-Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching, Germany (1985-7) and at Utah State University in Logan, Utah (1987-9). He is a member of the American Geophysical Union and the International Union of Radio Scientists. He has had visiting fellowships at the Max-Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (1997, 2000-2001) and at the University of Sydney (2008). He has also done stints as visitor at Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Expaciais San Jose dos Campos Brazil (1993), European Incoherent Scatter Scientific Association Tromso Norway (2001), and the South African National Space Agency Hermanus (2016). In 2010, he was appointed to the inaugural Lois L. Rodgers Professorship at Dartmouth.

These experiments include DC-5MHz wave experiments, particle experiments, Langmuir probes, magnetometers, and wave-particle correlators. Ground-level radio receivers at: South Pole Station, Antarctica; Churchill, Manitoba; and Toolik Lake, Alaska. Measuring polarization and arrival bearings of auroral radio emissions including auroral hiss, medium frequency burst, 2fce/3fce/4fce/5fce roar, ground-level Auroral Kilometric Radiation, other natural emissions, lightning-generated atmospherics, and man-made broadcast signals. Ground-level antenna/preamps/digital receivers deployed at Dartmouth College, Siena College, University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, Jenny Jump NJ (associated with NJIT), Cornell University, Schenectady NY, and Massena NY, to measure gravity waves and TIDs via Doppler sounding using commercial radio signals. Participation in two upcoming satellite missions: AERO/VISTA, twin satellites carrying a wave vector sensor to measure auroral radio emissions as well as perform interferometry; TRACERS to investigate character and consequences of reconnection in the polar cusps. Participation in proposed ARCS satellites, up to 32 cubesats to be flown in an array through the aurora (PI Professor Kristina Lynch).

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Physics and Astronomy Undergraduate Overview Information for New Students Physics Major Astronomy Major Engineering Physics Major Undergraduate Awards Honors Recent Senior Theses Undergraduate Requirements Physics and Astronomy Course Offerings Physics Society Student Research Opportunities Careers in Physics and Astronomy Astronomy and Your Career Undergraduate Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Graduate Overview Graduate Awards Apply Financial Aid Degree Requirements Courses Recent PhD Graduates Graduate Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Foreign Study Overview Astronomy FSP in South Africa Research Overview All Projects Astrophysics Current Projects Particles, Fields, Gravitation, and Cosmology Current Projects Gravitational Quantum Physics Quantum and Condensed Matter Current Projects Plasma and Space Physics Current Projects Resources Overview Weather Archive News & Events News & Events Colloquia Physics and Astronomy Colloquia Colloquium Archives (before 2017) Symposiums Symposium on Charles Young's 1869 Discovery of Coronium Jay Lawrence Symposium Archive Pressure of Light Symposium Public Lecture Archives Public Observing People Faculty & Staff Students Alumni Advisory Board Membership Directory Committee Assignments Department Chair Diversity Statement Graduate Advisor Undergraduate Advisor My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
