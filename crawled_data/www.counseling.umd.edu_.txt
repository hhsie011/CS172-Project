Per President Pines' announcement on 2/25/2022 regarding the masking mandate in areas where health care-related services are provided, the masking mandate remains in effect in all areas of the Counseling Center in the Shoemaker Building. As the University transitions back to in-person instruction, the Counseling Center and its constituent offices will offer services in a hybrid (in-person and teleservices) format. Please visit each office's website to find out more information about how that office is delivering its services. Face masking is required in the Counseling Center at all times regardless of your vaccination status. Check Out Our Video Counseling Service staff share about the services we offer.
