The program envisions a space where survivors feel held, understood without having to explain themselves, and given space to breathe and connect with one another in profoundly spiritual and experiential ways. Through its multi-faceted approach to mindfulness, movement and nurturing of one’s body, this program hopes to aid survivors to recognize and cherish their innate capacity to transcend trauma while being connected to a caring community of allies. Qi Gong is a form of energy work within Traditional Chinese Medicine. It focuses on mindful awareness of the body and mind as you practice gentle, sequenced movements. In this workshop, you will engage in a brief introduction to Qi Gong, followed by some deep breathing before engaging in a 30 minute guided Qi Gong exercises. Participants are encouraged to follow along with the exercises as they are comfortable. Participants can expect to feel more connected to their bodies as we work to cultivate a sense of safety from within. You will be encouraged to stand up and move within a small area during this workshop. No other materials are needed and no prior experience with Qi Gong is necessary.
