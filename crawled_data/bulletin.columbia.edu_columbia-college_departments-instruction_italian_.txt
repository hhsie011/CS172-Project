Prof. Pier Mattia Tommasino, 513 Hamilton; 212-854-0747; pmt2114@columbia.edu A major in Italian offers students the opportunity to study Italian literature and culture in an intimate, seminar setting with the close supervision of the department’s faculty. In addition, the prerequisite and corequisite sequence of language courses is designed to give students a command of written and spoken Italian. Majors must complete 30 points and concentrators must complete 24 points. All majors and concentrators are required to take two semesters of Advanced Italian (ITAL UN3335 Advanced Italian-ITAL UN3336 Advanced Italian II: Italian Language & Culture, ITAL UN3337 Advanced Italian Through Cinema, ITAL UN3338 Italiana. Introduction to Italian Culture, the High, the Low, and the In-between, ITAL UN3339 Learning Italian in Class and Online: A Telecollaboration with Italy. ITAL UN3645 Grand Tour in Italy, ITAL UN3341 Art Itineraries: Italian through Art, ITAL UN3342 Business Italian and the Made in Italy Excellence: Learning Italian for trade and industry, or ITAL UN3232 Senza frontiere. Lingua e cultura italiane dall’Ottocento ad oggi tra emigrazione ...) as well as one of the following two sequences: Introduction to Italian Literature I and II (ITAL UN3333-ITAL UN3334) provides an overview of major authors and works in the Italian literary tradition from the Middle Ages to the present; Italian Cultural Studies I and II (ITAL GU4502-ITAL GU4503) is an interdisciplinary investigation into Italian culture and society from national unification in 1860 to the present. In consultation with the director of undergraduate studies, majors select six additional courses (concentrators select four additional courses) from the department’s 3000- or 4000-level offerings or from other humanities and social science departments with a focus on Italian culture. Students who have taken courses in Italian Literature, Italian History, and/or Italian Culture while abroad should consult with the Director of Undergraduate Studies to determine if the courses may be applicable to the major. Highly motivated students have the opportunity to pursue a senior thesis under the guidance of a faculty adviser in an area of Italian literature or culture of their choosing. The senior thesis tutorial, ITAL UN3993 Senior Thesis/Tutorial, will count for 3 points. Departmental courses taught entirely in English do not have linguistic prerequisites and students from other departments who have interests related to Italian culture are especially welcome to enroll. Italian language instruction employs a communicative approach that integrates speaking, reading, writing, and listening. Courses make use of materials that help students to learn languages not just as abstract systems of grammar and vocabulary but as living cultures with specific content. Across the levels from elementary to advanced, a wide range of literary, cultural and multimedia materials, including books, film, and opera, supplement the primary course text. The sequence in elementary and intermediate Italian enables students to fulfill the College’s foreign language requirement and thoroughly prepares them for advanced study of language and for literature courses taught in Italian. Specialized language courses allow students to develop their conversational skills. For highly motivated students, the department offers intensive elementary and intensive intermediate Italian, both of which cover a full year of instruction in one semester. Courses in advanced Italian, although part of the requirements for a major or a concentration in Italian, are open to any qualified student whose main goal is to improve and perfect their competence in the language. Outside the classroom, the Department of Italian organizes a weekly Caffè e conversazione where students at all levels can converse with fellow students and faculty members over Italian espresso and cookies. Students can also attend the Serata al cinema, Italian film viewings scheduled in the evening throughout the academic year, in which faculty and graduate students introduce each film and then conclude with a question and answer session. In addition, the student-run Società Italiana (culasocieta@gmail.com) organizes events such as pasta-making workshops, movie nights, and costume parties. Advanced Placement The department grants 3 credits for a score of 5 on the AP Italian Language exam, which satisfies the foreign language requirement. Credit is awarded upon successful completion of a 3000-level (or higher) course with a grade of B or higher. This course must be for at least 3 points of credit and be taught in Italian. Courses taught in English may not be used for language AP credit. The department grants 0 credits for a score of 4 on the AP Italian Language exam, but the foreign language requirement is satisfied. Casa Italiana A wide range of cultural programs are sponsored by the Italian Academy for Advanced Studies in America, located in Casa Italiana. These programs, which include the activities of the Columbia Seminar on Modern Italian Studies and the Italian Academy Film Festival, enrich the learning experience of the student and offer opportunities to meet distinguished Italian and Italian-American visitors to the University. The Paterno book collection is housed in Butler Library and contains valuable resources on Italian literature and culture. For inquiries into the department and its undergraduate and graduate degrees offered, please contact 212-854-2308 or italian@columbia.edu. Language Resource Center The Language Resource Center (LRC) provides resources for intensive practice in pronunciation, diction, and aural comprehension of some twenty-five modern languages. LRC exercises are closely coordinated with the classroom's work. Coordinated tape programs and on-line audio are available and mandatory for students registered in elementary and intermediate Italian language courses. Taped exercises in pronunciation and intonation, as well as tapes of selected literary works, are also available to all students in Italian courses. Electronic Classrooms Language instruction courses meet at least once a week in a multimedia-equipped electronic classroom in order to facilitate exposure to Italian arts such as music, opera, and film, and for other pedagogical uses. Departmental Honors Majors in Italian literature or Italian cultural studies who wish to be considered for departmental honors in Italian must: (1) have at least a 3.6 GPA in their courses for the major; and (2) complete a senior thesis or tutorial and receive a grade of at least A- within the context of the course ITAL UN3993 Senior Thesis/Tutorial. Normally no more than one graduating senior receives departmental honors in a given academic year.

The works of the artists will be studied and discussed with the intent of developing knowledge of the main features of artistic and cultural movements and of the appropriate vocabulary and terminology to describe and talk about them. A particular emphasis will be put to oral and written productions: various kinds of texts and genres will be practiced (description, narration, critical analysis). Students will learn how to describe and interpret a work of art, examine the main characteristics and the techniques used by the artists and will be able to look for themes recurring in the artistic productions. The artists covered during the course will be introduced along the lines of their unique artistic, historical and socio-cultural relevance through different sources: images, scholarly essays, literature, video and music. Two visits to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and to CIMA (Center for Modern Italian Art) will be organized. In Italian.

Everywhere in the world, the expression ‘Made in Italy’ evokes the idea of quality, elegance and unique taste. From food to wine, from artisanal craftmanship to fashion, from the automobile industry to the design, ‘Made in Italy’ means creativity, durability, and a guarantee of excellence. Today, Italy is the fourth largest economic power in Europe and many countries like the USA have long established economic relationships and partnership with it. While the English language has been increasingly used during these economic exchanges, a basic knowledge of Italian terminology within a context of commerce and trade is an important asset and a useful resource. Developing a strong understanding of the Italian business environment and its culture offers useful advantages for all those who want to create ties with or plan to work in the Italian business world in the future. The course is open to all students who have completed the Italian intermediate level and would like to have an introduction to Italian language used for work and business. The course will be conducted as an intensive practice in the spoken and written language through assigned topics focusing on Italian business and related cultural themes. It will provide an overview of the job market world and the business environment in Italy, giving students the main tools to explore and interact appropriately in a professional environment. During the second half of the semester, the course will introduce students to the Made in Italy excellence and the history responsible for Italian Style’s world-renowned fame and high-demand. Students will learn how the concept of Made in Italy originated, look at the history of Italian style and its international value. The lessons in the second half of the semester will be integrated with interviews of people in Italy and in New York City working in businesses that sell or advertise Italian products. The interviews (one per week) will provide a direct look into the areas that are being discussed in class, so that students will have the opportunity to learn firsthand what it means to work in a business in Italy or with Italy, and with Italian products Fall 2022: ITAL UN3342 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment ITAL 3342 001/12947 T Th 2:40pm - 3:55pm Room TBA Federica Franze 3.00 15/16 ITAL UN3642 Road Trips: Travel in Italian Cinema. 3 points.

Prerequisites: Note: Italian is the language of instruction. Course Description This course proposes a virtual tour of the country’s most famous sites, looking at the ways in which what is local and peculiar, diverse and marginal, contributes its distinctive style and character to the overall unity and uniqueness of Italy. Each week we consider a different aspect of Italy’s richness and variety: from the evolution of its language/s and dialects to its humor; its art and landscapes; the music from ancient times to current pop songs; its cinema and web serials, its cuisine, the contributions of migrants, and much more. The course is highly interdisciplinary and will assist students in the development of their linguistic and cultural skills, while tracing the origins of most mainstream Italian cultural phenomena, and imparting an awareness of modern Italy's multiculturalism.    CLIA GU3660 Mafia Movies: From Sicily to The Sopranos. 3 points.

This seminar examines the many meanings of fashion, design, and style; how values underlying fashion are selected, preserved, denied, reinvented or rethought; how the symbolic meanings and ideological interpretations are connected to creation, production and consumption of fashion goods. Based on an anthropological perspective and framework, this interdisciplinary course will analyze ways in which we can understand fashion through the intersections of many different levels: political, economic, aesthetic, symbolic, religious, etc. The course will study how fashion can help us understand the ways in which tradition and innovation, creativity and technology, localism and globalization, identity and diversity, power and body, are elaborated and interpreted in contemporary society, and in relation to a globalized world.

This seminar examines the many meanings of food in Italian culture and tradition; how values and peculiarities are transmitted, preserved, reinvented and rethought through a lens that is internationally known as “Made in Italy”; how the symbolic meanings and ideological interpretations are connected to creation, production, presentation, distribution, and consumption of food. Based on an anthropological perspective and framework, this interdisciplinary course will analyze ways in which we can understand the ‘Italian taste’ through the intersections of many different levels: political, economic, aesthetic, symbolic, religious, etc. The course will study how food can help us understand the ways in which tradition and innovation, creativity and technology, localism and globalization, identity and diversity, power and body, are elaborated and interpreted in contemporary Italian society, in relation to the European context and a globalized world.

In the 1970s and 1980s a group of young Italian historians transformed the methods of historical inquiry and narrative. This class explores the origins, the diffusion, as well as the debate around Italian Microhistory across Europe and the United States. In particular, we will focus on “cultural” and “social” Microhistory and its evolution in Italy, France, and the US. We will read masterpieces such as Carlo Ginzburg’s The Cheese and the Worms, as well as Nathalie Zemon Davis’s The Return of Martin Guerrre. Also, we will analyze the current application of microhistorical methods to contemporary global history and the genre of biography. Topics include pre-modern popular culture and literacy, minority and marginality, the Inquisition, individual and collective identities, and the relation between the pre-modern Mediterranean, Europe and the world. In Italian. CLIA GU4021 The Age of Romanticism Across the Adriatic. 3 points. Prerequisites: Knowledge of Italian desirable but not necessary This interdisciplinary seminar will study Romanticism as a literary trend, as much as a historical phenomenon and a life attitude. Romanticism is viewed here as the sum of the different answers to the sense of insecurity, social alienation and loneliness, provoked by the changing and frail world of the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth century. We will investigate the Romantic ideology in relation to the trans-Adriatic world of Italy and Greece, an area that entered modernity with the particular lure and burden of antiquity, as well as through revolutionary upheaval. Students will be invited to read authors like Vittorio Alfieri, Ugo Foscolo, Silvio Pellico, Giacomo Leopardi, Alessandro Manzoni, Massimo d’Azeglio, and to reflect on themes such as Nostalgia and Nationalism, the Discovery of the Middle Ages, the Historical Novel, the Invention of Popular Tradition, the Fragmented Self, Autobiographical and Travel Writing, the Brigand Cult, Hellenism, Philhellenism, Orientalism and Balkanism, and others. CLIA GU4022 Diasporas in Italian and Transnational History. 3 points. Some years ago the word Diaspora referred to Jews and was spelled with a capital D. Today, almost every ethnic group, country, or separatist movement has its diaspora. Usually, these diasporas are presented as pieces of national life scattered here and there, in places far away from the national core. In this seminar, however, we will treat diasporas not as an emblem of national unity but as an expression of diversity, of a multiplicity of loyalties and belongings. By combining history, literature, film, and cultural studies, and by approaching the topic through the lens of transnationalism, we will study topics such as Mobility and Nationalism, Diasporas in Intellectual History, The Mediterranean in Motion, Italian Migration, Mobile Italy and its Colonies, Displacements in the Eastern Mediterranean, Lost Cosmopolitanisms in the Middle East, Emigration from Eastern Europe, and Mediterranean Refugees and Memory. The aim is to turn our gaze away from the territorially defined countries, towards a view of the world in which countries are ship-like territories. ITAL GU4022 The Qur'an in Europe. 3 points. CC/GS/SEAS: Partial Fulfillment of Global Core Requirement Is the Qur’an translatable? Was the Qur’an translated? Are non Arabic-speaking Muslims allowed to translate the Qur’an? And what about non-Muslims? Did Muslims and non-Muslims collaborate in translating the text of the Qur’an into Latin and European vernaculars? This course focuses on the long history of the diffusion of the Qur’an, the Scripture of the Muslims, and one of the most important texts in the history of humanity. We will focus on reading and translation practices of the Qur’an in Europe and the Mediterranean, from the Middle Ages to the contemporary world. We will explore how European Muslims, such as Iberian moriscos, European Jews, as well as Orthodox, Protestants and Catholics read, copied, collected, translated and printed the Qur’an. We will also explore why the Qur’an was confuted, forbidden, burned and even eaten, drunk and worn along eight centuries of the history of Europe. This long excursus, based on a close reading of the Qur’an and on the discussion of the major themes this close reading proposes, will help us to understand the role of Islam and its revelation in the formation of European societies and cultures.

This course will study various forms of travel writing within, from, and to the Mediterranean in the long nineteenth century. Throughout the semester, you will read a number of travel accounts to develop your understanding of these particular sources and reflect on the theoretical discussions and the themes framing them, namely orientalism, postcolonial studies, imaginative geographies, literature between fiction and reality, Romantic and autobiographical writing, gender, sexuality and the body, the rise of archeology, adventurism, mass migration and tourism. We will focus on Italian travel writers visiting the Ottoman Empire and the Americas (Cristina di Belgioioso, Gaetano Osculati, Edmondo de Amicis) and others visiting the Italian peninsula (Grand Tourists, Madame De Staël), and we will study the real or imaginary travels of French, British and American writers to the Eastern Mediterranean and to antique and holy lands (Jean-Jacques Barthélemy, Count Marcellus, Austen Henry Layard, Lord Byron, Mark Twain), as well as Arabic travel writers to the West (Rifāʻah Rāfiʻ al-Ṭahṭāwī). CLIA GU4024 Nationalism in Theory and History. 3.00 points. Were nations always there? Are they real or imagined? Do they come before or after nationalism and the state? How did we pass from a world of empires, duchies, and city-states to a world of nation-states? Where does legitimacy reside if not in God and his endowed kings? Is the modern world really ‘disenchanted’? How did we come to understand time, space, language, religion, gender, race, and even our very selves in the era of nations? Are we done with this era, living already in postnational times? This course will combine older theories of nationalism (Gellner, Anderson, Hobsbawm, Smith) with recent approaches of the phenomenon after the ‘Imperial/Global/Transnational Turn’ (Bayly, Conrad, Innes, Isabella, Reill, Stein etc.) and late studies in Gender, Race, Culture and Nationalism, in order to offer new answers to old questions. We will talk about many places around the world, but the main stage where we will try out our questions is Italy and the Mediterranean CLIA GU4025 Italian Migrations. 3.00 points. This course will offer an account of the multiple migrations out, in and through Italy since 1800. By combining history, literature, and film, and by approaching the topic through the lens of transnationalism, we will study different topics of Italian mobility, such as Exile and the Risorgimento, The Mediterranean in Motion, Migrants’ Experiences at Sea, The Great Italian “Exodus” to the Americas, Mobile Italy and its Colonies, The Lost Italian “Cosmopolitanisms” of the Middle East, Postwar Italian “National Refugees”, and Contemporary Migration to Italy. We will read masterpieces of Italian literature both by Italian-American authors and by contemporary migrants to Italy. We will watch some of the most important films and documentaries on these topics. And we will think about how such phenomena as Italian mass emigration in the long nineteenth century, Fascist colonialism and resettlement of populations in the twentieth century, postwar refugees, and contemporary immigrants to Italy are all intrinsically interconnected and make part of the same story. Overall, the aim of this course is to turn our gaze away from the territorially defined Italy, towards a view of Italy as a space on the move ITAL GU4043 Italian Renaissance Literature and Culture. 3 points. This course on Italian Renaissance literature and culture will pay special attention to the crossing of boundaries, whether socio-cultural, religious, linguistic, gendered, ethnic, or strictly geographical, in a range of fourteenth- to early seventeenth-century texts in a variety of genres, including travelogue, chivalric epic poetry, comedy, dialogues, and the novella, as well as political, philosophical, and scientific writing. Authors covered include Marco Polo, Leonardo Bruni, Pico della Mirandola, Boiardo, Ariosto, Machiavelli Castiglione, Beolco, Giraldi Cinzio, Tasso, Moderata Fonte, Tarabotti, and Galileo. In English. ITAL GU4055 Anthropology of Contemporary Italy: Pluralism, Creativity and Identity. 3 points. This seminar examines ways in which Italy is understood and represented by Italians and non-Italians. It will analyze the formation of multiple discourses on Italy, how Italian culture and society are imagined, represented and/or distorted. Based on an anthropological perspective, this course will examine ways in which we can understand Italy through the intersections of pluralism, ethnicity, gender, and religion. The course will study how Italy strives for political and economic unity, while there is a concurrent push toward inequality, exclusion, and marginalization. Moreover, the course will analyze the revitalization of nationalism on one hand of regionalism on the other, and will focus on the concepts of territory, identity, and tradition. Short videos that can be watched on computer and alternative readings for those fluent in Italian will be assigned. There are no pre-requisites for this course. ITAL GU4057 ANTHROPOLOGY OF ITALIAN FOOD, FASHION, & DESIGN. 3 points. Not offered during 2022-23 academic year. This colloquium examines the many meanings of food, fashion, designs, trends, and style, especially in Italian culture and tradition; how values and peculiarities are transmitted, preserved, reinvented, and rethought through a lens that is internationally known as "Made in Italy' ; how the symbolic meanings and ideological interpretations are connected to creation, production, and consumption of goods. Based on an anthropological perspective and framework, this interdisciplinary course will analyze ways in which we can understand the 'Italian style' through the intersections of many different levels: political, economic, aesthetic, symbolic, religious, etc. The course will study how fashion, food, and design can help us understand the ways in which tradition and innovation, creativity and technology, localism and globalization, identity and diversity, power and body, are elaborated and interpreted in contemporary Italian society, in relation to the European context and a globalized world. Short videos that can be watched on the computer and alternative readings for those fluent in Italian will be assigned. ITAL GU4086 Castiglione and the Italian Renaissance Court. 3 points. Focus on Castiglione’s Book of the Courtier as educational treatise, philosophical meditation, sociopolitical document, and book of courtly manners; other courtly writings of the period, from Della Casa’s Galateo to Ariosto’s Satires to Bembo’s Asolani. Lectures in English; text in Italian, although comparative literature students who can follow with the help of translations are welcome. ITAL GU4089 Petrarch's Canzoniere. 3 points. This course presents a reading of Petrach's Canzoniere and a theory of the lyric sequence as a genre. In this course we examine Petrarch as he fashions himself authorially, especially in the context of Ovid, Dante, and previous lyric poets. We bring to bear ideas on time and narrative from authors such as Augustine and Ricoeur in order to reconstruct the metaphysical significance of collecting fragments in what was effectively a new genre. We will consider Petrarch's lyric sequence in detail as well as read Petrarch's Secretum and Trionfi. Lectures in English; text in Italian, although students from other departments who can follow with the help of translations are welcome. ITAL GU4091 Dante's <i>Divina Commedia</I> I. 4 points. ITALIAN MAJORS AND ITALIAN DEPT GRADUATE STUDENTS MUST REGISTER FOR SECTION 001.Not offered during 2022-23 academic year. Prerequisites: SECTION 001: reading knowledge of Italian. SECTION 002: none. A year-long course in which the "Commedia" is read over two consecutive semesters; students can register for the first, the second, or both semesters. This course offers a thorough grounding in the entire text and an introduction to the complexities of its exegetical history. Attention not only to historical and theological issues, but also to Dante's mimesis, his construction of an authorial voice that generations of readers have perceived as "true," and the critical problems that emerge when the virtual reality created in language has religious and theological pretensions. SECTION 001: Lectures in English, text in Italian; examinations require the ability to translate Italian. SECTION 002: Lectures in English, examinations in English; students who can follow lectures with the help of translations but who cannot manage the Italian should register for this section.

ITAL GU4100 Narratives of Modernity. 3 points. In revisiting two major authors of the Italian modern novel, the course investigates the relation between fiction and the "conditions of modernity" (personal risk, anxiety and lack of control on reality, secularization, to name a few). Special attention will be paid to the response of the novelistic discourse to modernity, and to Italy's peculiarly peripheral position in the modern world. Primary texts will be read in Italian, while theoretical references will be in English. ITAL GU4109 Writing the Self: the Tradition of Autobiography in Italy, 19th-20th Centuries. 3 points. Against the backdrop of the heated critical debate on the boundaries and limitations of the autobiographical genre, this course addresses the modern and contemporary tradition of autobiographical writings, focusing in particular (but not exclusively) on exploring and positing the potential difference between male and female autobiographers. More specifically, we will question the adequacy of the traditional model of autobiographical selfhood based on the assumption of unified, universal, exemplary and transcendent self to arrive at an understanding of women's autobiography. Topics to be addressed include: the crisis of the subject, "je est un autre", the "man" with a movie camera, strategies of concealment and disclosures. Authors to be studied include: D'Annunzio, Pirandello, Svevo, Fellini, Moretti, Ortese, Ginzburg, Manzini, Cialente, Ramondino. In Italian ITAL GU4140 Fictionalizing History: Fascism in Literature and Film. 3 points. Not offered during 2022-23 academic year. The course aims at providing students with a broad knowledge of the political and cultural issues affecting Italy in the crucial, dramatic years between 1922 and 1945. Against the backdrop of Mussolinï's politics, our investigation examines the complex, multifaceted ways the dictatorship has been portrayed in fiction and cinema. Our research will require the evaluation of written texts and films produced both during this period and after it. We will analyze some fundamentals of the fascist doctrine and the most prominent strategies through which Fascism succeeded in creating a popular consensus (i.e., social projects and sophisticated techniques of propaganda). Then we will proceed alternating the analysis of historical documents with literary and cinematic works authored by Moravia, Vittorini, and Fellini, among others.

Prerequisites: Knowledge of Italian is necessary for this course. This course will examine the history of the Italian Risorgimento by following the major historiographical trends of the recent decades. First, it will approach the Risorgimento through the prism of cultural and intellectual history by investigating a series of topics, such as the discursive patterns of the ‘Risorgimento canon’, the gendered tropes of nationalism, the creation of a new public sphere through operas, festivals and plebiscites, the connection of nationalism with religion, and the relation of empire to nation and liberalism. Second, it will look at the Risorgimento through the eyes of local and regional history by examining local patriotisms, revolutions and civil wars and the division between North and South. Finally, it will offer a new topography of Italian history by placing the Risorgimento in its Mediterranean and global context and by exploring its international aspects: the global icons that it produced (i.e. Garibaldi, Mazzini); the networks of exiles in other Mediterranean and European countries; the war volunteers; and the connection of Italian patriots with the wave of liberalism and revolution that swept the globe from India to Latin America. CLIA GU4300 Renaissance Orientalism. 3.00 points. This course offers an overview of the scholarly debate about the Renaissance during the last twenty years (2001-2021), with a particular focus on the relationship between early modern Italy, Europe, and Muslim Eurasia. This class intends to give students insight into and philological tools to engage the current debate about the revision of the concept—and the period—of the Renaissance (broadly 1350-1570). We will read both primary (Petrarch, Pico della Mirandola, Galateo, Leonardo Bruni, Leo Africanus) and secondary sources in order to understand the main trends of philological and historical research about early modern Eurasia in the last twenty years. We will read about how Petrarch’s anti-Arabism has been analyzed and used by twentieth-century Medievalists. We will explore how Said’s Return to Philology influenced the study of the transmission of texts in the Early Modern World. Also, we will try to understand the role of Islam, Muhammad, and the Ottoman Empire in the evolution of European political thought. Similarly, we will dive into Early Modern European representations of the Muslim Other, as well as into Arabic travel writing about Early Modern Europe. The main goal of this class is to discuss with the students about what happened in the field of Renaissance studies in the last two decades, roughly between September 11, 2001 and our current “post”-pandemic world, with a particular attention to the study of literary texts, intellectual and cultural history, the history and theory of translation.

The course examines some of the most important novels that belong to Italy's period of major social and economic transformations. Only after WWII Italy finally becomes a modern nation, i.e. a republic based on truly universal suffrage, and an industrialized country. Such accelerated progress, though,causes deep social instability and mobility which obviously results in heavy psychological pressures on the people: adaptation becomes crucial and inevitable. Fiction therefore resumes the task to represent such awkwardness of integration into a modern bourgeois society that, contrarily to its European and American counterpart, is extremely tentative and insecure per se, since it's political identity has extremely precarious grounds. Among other authors, primary readings include Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa's The Leopard and Italo Calvinos's If on a Winter's Night a Traveler. Primary Readings in Italian. ITAL GU4420 The Window On the World: Reassessing Italian Neorealism. 3 points. Not offered during 2022-23 academic year. Roberto Rossellini, Vittorio De Sica, Luchino Visconti and other Italian filmmakers challenged modes of film production in vogue in the 1940s and 1950s, both in theoretical and practical terms. This course will analyze both the feature films and the theoretical writings of such directors as those mentioned and others, in order to investigate the modes of representation of reality in the immediate postwar years, their relation to the identity of the newborn Italian Republic, and their significance in post-WWII filmmaking. All readings and lectures in English; Films in Italian or French, with English subtitles. CLIA GU4499 Mediterranean Humanities I. 3.00 points. Mediterranean Humanities I explores the literatures of the Mediterranean from the late Middle Ages to the Early Nineteenth Century. We will read Boccaccio, and Cervantes, as well as Ottoman poetry, Iberian Muslim apocalyptic literature, and the Eurasian connected versions of the One Thousand and One Nights. We will dive into the travel of texts and people, stories and storytellers across the shores of the Middle Sea. Based on the reading of literary texts (love poetry, short stories, theater, and travel literature), as well as letters, biographies, memoirs, and other ego-documents produced and consumed in the Early Modern Mediterranean, we will discuss big themes as Orientalism, estrangement, forced mobility, connectivity, multiculturalism and the clash of civilizations. Also, following in the footsteps of Fernand Braudel and Erich Auerbach, we will reflect on the Mediterranean in the age of the first globalization as a laboratory of the modern global world and world literature Fall 2022: CLIA GU4499 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment CLIA 4499 001/15472 W 2:10pm - 4:00pm Room TBA Pier Mattia Tommasino 3.00 0/22 CLIA GU4500 Mediterranean Humanities. 3.00 points. What is the Mediterranean and how was it constructed and canonized as a space of civilization? A highly multicultural, multilingual area whose people represent a broad array of religious, ethnic, social and political difference, the Mediterranean has been seen as the cradle of western civilization, but also as a dividing border and a unifying confluence zone, as a sea of pleasure and a sea of death. The course aims to enhance students’ understanding of the multiple ways this body of water has been imagined by the people who lived or traveled across its shores. By exploring major works of theory, literature and cinema since 1800, it encourages students to engage critically with a number of questions (nationalism vs cosmopolitanism, South/North and East/West divides, tourism, exile and migration, colonialism and orientalism, borders and divided societies) and to ‘read’ the sea through different viewpoints: through the eyes of a German Romantic thinker, a Sephardic Ottoman family, an Algerian feminist, a French historian, a Syrian refugee, an Italian anti-fascist, a Moroccan writer, an Egyptian exile, a Bosnian-Croat scholar, a Lebanese-French author, a Cypriot filmmaker, an Algerian-Italian journalist, and others. In the final analysis, Med Hum is meant to arouse the question of what it means to stand on watery grounds and to view the world through a constantly shifting lens ITAL GU4502 Italian Cultural Studies I: From Unification to World War I. 3 points. An interdisciplinary investigation into Italian culture and society in the years between Unification in 1860 and the outbreak of World War I.

This course is designed for those curious about the structure of Hungarian - an unusual language with a complex grammar quite different from English, or, indeed, any Indo -European language. The study of Hungarian, a language of the Finno-Ugric family, offers the opportunity to learn about the phonology of vowel harmony, the syntax of topic-comment discourse, verb agreement with subjects and objects, highly developed case systems and possessive nominal paradigms. In addition to its inflectional profile, Hungarian derivation possibilities are vast, combinatory, and playful. During the semester we will touch upon all the important grammatical aspects of Hungarian and discuss them in relation to general linguistic principles and discourse, and finally, through some text analysis, see them in action. Although the primary discussion will center on Hungarian, we will draw on comparisons to other Finno-Ugric languages, most notably Finnish and Komi; students are encouraged to draw on comparisons with their own languages of interest. No prerequisite. Counts as Core Linguistics.
