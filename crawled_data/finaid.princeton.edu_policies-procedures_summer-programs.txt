If you receive Princeton need-based aid during the academic year, you may contact our office to request a subsidized student loan for approved summer programs. For Princeton programs, you may borrow up to the cost of the program, less any other funding already provided. For non-Princeton programs that have been approved for course credit, you may borrow up to the cost of tuition and mandatory fees. Please see our Summer Program FAQ for more information or contact our office to review your summer funding eligibility.
