Make Your Gift Today CANADA Canadian tax law allows Canadians to make tax-deductible gifts directly to certain American charities, including Harvard University. Alumni and Development Services will automatically send donors with a Canadian address a tax receipt with language required by the Canadian tax authorities. MEXICO Since the implementation of NAFTA, Mexican law recognizes tax-deductible gifts to American charities with respect to U.S. source income. Gifts may be in pesos or American dollars, and the University’s standard gift acknowledgement form allows donors from Mexico to benefit from the tax deduction. UNITED KINGDOM Gifts from alumni residing in the United Kingdom can be tax-deductible.
