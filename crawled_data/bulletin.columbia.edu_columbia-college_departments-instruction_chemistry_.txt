Biology: Prof. Brent Stockwell, 1208 Northwest Corner Building; 212-854-2919; stockwell@biology.columbia.edu Chemistry: Prof. Virginia Cornish, 1209 Northwest Corner Building; 212-854-5209; vc114@columbia.edu Chemistry, the study of molecules, is a central science interesting for its own sake but also necessary as an intellectual link to the other sciences of biology, physics, and environmental science. Faculty find the various disciplines of chemistry fascinating because they establish intellectual bridges between the macroscopic or human-scale world that we see, smell, and touch, and the microscopic world that affects every aspect of our lives. The study of chemistry begins on the microscopic scale and extends to engage a variety of different macroscopic contexts. Chemistry is currently making its largest impact on society at the nexus between chemistry and biology and the nexus between chemistry and engineering, particularly where new materials are being developed. A typical chemistry laboratory now has more computers than test tubes and no longer smells of rotten eggs. The chemistry department majors are designed to help students focus on these new developments and to understand the factors influencing the nature of the discipline. Because the science is constantly changing, courses change as well, and while organic and physical chemistry remain the bedrock courses, they too differ greatly from the same courses 40 years ago. Many consider biochemistry to be a foundation course as well. Although different paths within the chemistry major take different trajectories, there is a core that provides the essential foundation students need regardless of the path they choose. Students should consider majoring in chemistry if they share or can develop a fascination with the explanatory power that comes with an advanced understanding of the nature and influence of the microscopic world of molecules. Students who choose to major in chemistry may elect to continue graduate study in this field and obtain a Ph.D. which is a solid basis for a career in research, either in the industry or in a university. A major in chemistry also provides students with an astonishing range of career choices such as working in the chemical or pharmaceutical industries or in many other businesses where a technical background is highly desirable. Other options include becoming a financial analyst for a technical company, a science writer, a high school chemistry teacher, a patent attorney, an environmental consultant, or a hospital laboratory manager, among others. The choices are both numerous and various as well as intellectually exciting and personally fulfilling. Advanced Placement The department grants advanced placement (AP) credit for a score of 4 or 5 or the equivalent. The amount of credit granted is based on the results of the department assessment exam and completion of the requisite course. Students who receive permission to register for CHEM UN1604 2ND TERM GEN CHEM (INTENSIVE) are granted 3 points of credit; students who receive permission to register for CHEM UN2045 INTENSVE ORGANIC CHEMISTRY-CHEM UN2046 INTENSVE ORG CHEM-FOR 1ST YEAR are granted 6 points of credit. In either case, credit is granted only upon completion of the course with a grade of C or better. Students must complete a department assessment exam prior to registering for either of these courses. Programs of Study The Department of Chemistry offers four distinct academic major programs for undergraduates interested in professional-level training and education in the chemical sciences: chemistry, chemical physics, biochemistry and environmental chemistry. For students interested in a program of less extensive study and coursework, the department offers a concentration in chemistry. Course Information The results of the department assessment exam are used to advise students which track to pursue. The Department of Chemistry offers three different tracks. Students who wish to take Track 2 or 3 classes must take the department assessment exam. Students who wish to pursue Track 1 classes do not need to take the assessment exam. Track Information In the first year, Track 1 students with one year of high school chemistry take a one-year course in general chemistry, and the one-term laboratory course that accompanies it. In the second year, students study organic chemistry, and take organic chemistry laboratory. Students who qualify by prior assessment during orientation week can place into the advanced tracks. There are two options. Track 2 students take, in the fall term, a special one-term intensive course in general chemistry in place of the one-year course. In the second year, students study organic chemistry and take organic chemistry laboratory. Track 3 students take a one-year course in organic chemistry for first-year students and the one-term intensive general chemistry laboratory course. In the second year, students enroll in physical chemistry and the organic chemistry laboratory course. Additional information on the tracks can be found in the Requirements section. Additional Courses First-year students may also elect to take CHEM UN2408. This seminar focuses on topics in modern chemistry, and is offered to all students who have taken at least one semester of college chemistry and have an interest in chemical research. Biochemistry (BIOC GU4501, BIOC GU4512) is recommended for students interested in the biomedical sciences. Physical chemistry (CHEM UN3079-CHEM UN3080), a one-year program, requires prior preparation in mathematics and physics. The accompanying laboratory is CHEM UN3085-CHEM UN3086. Also offered are a senior seminar (CHEM UN3920); advanced courses in biochemistry, inorganic, organic, and physical chemistry; and an introduction to research (CHEM UN3098).

The second goal is to prepare students to apply these methods themselves to their own research projects. The course will be divided into seven modules: (i) solution thermodynamics; (ii) hydrodynamic methods; (iii) statistical analysis of experimental data; (iv) basic quantum mechanics; (v) optical spectroscopy with an emphasis on fluorescence; (vi) nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; and (vii) light-scattering and diffraction methods. The first three modules will be covered during the fall term. In each module, the underlying physical theories and models with be presented and used to derive the mathematical equations applied to the analysis of experimental data. Weekly recitations will emphasize the analysis of real experimental data and understanding the applications of biophysical experimentation in published research papers.

This course was upgraded from 2.5 to 4.5 and assigned a new number. Prerequisites: Organic chemistry and biology courses, neuroscience or neurobiology recommended, but not required. The study of the brain is one of the most exciting frontiers in science and medicine today. Although neuroscience is by nature a multi-disciplinary effort, chemistry has played many critical roles in the development of modern neuroscience, neuropharmacology, and brain imaging. Chemistry, and the chemical probes it generates, such as molecular modulators, therapeutics, imaging agents, sensors, or actuators, will continue to impact neuroscience on both preclinical and clinical levels. In this course, two major themes will be discussed. In the first one, titled "Imaging brain function with chemical tools," we will discuss molecular designs and functional parameters of widely used fluorescent sensors in neuroscience (calcium, voltage, and neurotransmitter sensors), their impact on neuroscience, pros and cons of genetically encoded sensors versus chemical probes, and translatability of these approaches to the human brain. In the second major theme, titled "Perturbation of the brain function with chemical tools," we will examine psychoactive substances, the basics of medicinal chemistry, brain receptor activation mechanisms and coupled signaling pathways, and their effects on circuit and brain function. We will also discuss recent approaches, failures and successes in the treatment of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Recent advances in precise brain function perturbation by light (optogenetics and photopharmacology) will also be introduced. In the context of both themes we will discuss the current and future possibilities for the design of novel materials, drawing on the wide molecular structural space (small molecules, proteins, polymers, nanomaterials), aimed at monitoring, modulating, and repairing human brain function. This course is intended for students (undergraduate and graduate) from the science, engineering and medical departments.
