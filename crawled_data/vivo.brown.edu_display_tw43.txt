She has since maintained a strong interest in improving emergency department (ED) patients' lives by identifying best practices for acute care delivery. Her overall research interest encompasses the equitable delivery of acute care and ED resource use, especially pertaining to patients presenting with acute exacerbations of a chronic illness. These patients often receive stigmatized or biased care in the ED. While stigmatized care is not unique to the ED, the ED environment provides a unique opportunity to identify solutions and methodologies to providing unbiased and destigmatized treatment.
