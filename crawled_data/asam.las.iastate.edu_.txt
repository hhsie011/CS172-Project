Iowa State University Asian American Studies Program Menu Toggle Search Toggle Search Home About Courses APLP Fellowships Contact Us Home Welcome Initiated in 1999 in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, the Asian American Studies Program at Iowa State University seeks to develop curriculum and research that give an account of the cultures and collective experiences of Americans who trace their ancestry to Asian countries. These areas of development will be responsive to the interests of a student constituency and larger state community in which the Asian American population is steadily growing. In addition to the Program’s academic agenda, the Program faculty will take a leading role in planning and organizing campus activities that foster recognition of and due respect for the Asian American arts, literature, and heritage. Such activities will include lectures, symposia, and participation in other programming related to diversity.
