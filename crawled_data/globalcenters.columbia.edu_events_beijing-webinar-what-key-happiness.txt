It seems to be an odd question, but this is not only the subject that ancient and modern philosophers ponder, but also the question that each of us must face. On June 8, join us for a discussion to dive into the science of happiness, what the definition is, and why it is important. You will hear straight from Professor Dongmao WEN, Professor in the Department of Education Leadership and Policy at the Graduate School of Education at Peking University, on happiness and happiness education, how to create a fulfilling and significant life, and how to increase your happiness intelligence from an academic, theoretical, and interdisciplinary perspective. Professor Wen was also a visiting scholar of Columbia University's Teachers College. What you will learn: Is happiness related to life satisfaction or success? Can technology make us happier? Are people with higher education happier? How to increase your happiness through education? Previously, Beijing Center initiated our first discussion on fulfillment and happiness particularly among the middle-aged to understand struggles, reflections, thinking, and opportunities after the COVID-19 pandemic.
