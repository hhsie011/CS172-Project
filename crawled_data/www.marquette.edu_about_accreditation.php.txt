Marquette.edu // About Marquette // Accreditation An educational institution is only as strong as the level of excellence it demands of itself — not to mention its faculty and students. Marquette is accredited through The Higher Learning Commission which last affirmed the university’s accreditation in 2014 and has scheduled the next comprehensive evaluation for the 2023-24 academic year. Thanks to Marquette's consistently high standards, specific academic programs also are accredited through numerous other organizations and associations. These accreditations assure students that Marquette's academic excellence is nationally recognized. In addition, students have the security of knowing that Marquette's credits can transfer to comparable institutions of learning, just as incoming transfer students can be assured that Marquette is likely to honor most credits earned at a similarly accredited college or university.

The Higher Learning Commission is located at 230 South LaSalle Street, Suite 7-500, Chicago, Illinois 60604, and can be reached at (800) 621-7440.
