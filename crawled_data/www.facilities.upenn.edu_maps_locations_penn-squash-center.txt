Planning Strategy: The renovation to Penn's squash courts improved the area's circulation and connectivity and enhanced the spectator experience by relocating columns, renovating mezzanine seating, and updating lighting and design features. Program: The renovation increased the number of squash courts from 10 to 12, featuring two new glass exhibition courts. The lobby was expanded to include a squash hall of fame, as well as new restrooms with full ADA accessibility. It also improved spectator seating and provided separate men's and women's team rooms and coaches offices.
