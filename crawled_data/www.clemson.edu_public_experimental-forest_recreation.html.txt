None of this trail system is managed exclusively for public recreation use. The trails are a component of a working forest used for teaching, research and extension education for natural resource management. The trail system allows for the study and improvement in construction design and maintenance of recreational use. It also allows for the evaluation of user attitudes and study of the impacts of recreation on the ecosystem. No University or State allocated funds are used to manage the CEF. Other maps of the Clemson Experimental Forest Trail System are found here.
