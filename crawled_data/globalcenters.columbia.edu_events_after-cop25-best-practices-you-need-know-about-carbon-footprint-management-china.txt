4:30 PM Columbia Global Centers | Beijing, No. 26, 1F Core Plaza, 1 Shanyuan Street, Zhongguancun, Haidian District, Beijing The 25th UN Climate Change Conference COP25, taking place in Madrid, Spain from December 2-13, 2019, brought together global ambitions and efforts to combat climate change. During the Conference, a side event entitled "Business Climate Action: Empowerment & Innovation" were hosted by Vanke Foundation in collaboration with C Team and SEE Foundation to showcase the best practices of carbon footprint management in China. On this occasion, Columbia Global Centers | Beijing invites China Business Climate Action for a press conference with a sharing session on "2019 Business Climate Action Cases" on December 19 in Beijing. This special program will bring you the latest news of COP25 and share the governance cases of Chinese enterprises. These cases represent the initiatives and innovations of corporations and industries in the fields of green energy, green building, green transportation, green finance, green manufacturing, green supply chain, driving green consumption, carbon management, carbon information exposure, etc. Although they cannot fully reflect the breadth and depth of climate actions taken by corporations and industries in China, the corporate responsibilities and missions presented in the cases as well as the direction and potential of green innovation have all strengthened our confidence in coping with climate change. We cordially invite you to the conference to discuss this topic in depth.
