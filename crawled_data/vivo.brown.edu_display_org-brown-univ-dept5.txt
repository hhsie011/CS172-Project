Brown's socio-cultural and linguistic anthropologists are engaged in ethnography across the globe. The department's anthropological archaeologists are focused in the study of the material remains of the ancient, historic, and modern Americas. Current faculty and students are especially engaged in research related to issues of power, violence, politics, health, and population. The photographs found throughout the department website were taken by our faculty during their fieldwork.
