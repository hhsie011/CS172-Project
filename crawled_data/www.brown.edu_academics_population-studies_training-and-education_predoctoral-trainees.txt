The PSTC does not grant degrees, but rather provides students with mentoring from faculty, outstanding facilities, and financial support for research, fieldwork, and developmental activities. Predoctoral students in the departments of Anthropology, Economics, Political Science, Public Health, and Sociology who have population studies interests may apply to the PSTC training program. To affiliate with the PSTC, graduate students must apply to the training program and reapply annually to maintain membership each spring. With an excellent placement record, graduating trainees are hired into both academic and private sector positions. Recent placements include Boston College, Brown University, Columbia University, NYU Abu Dhabi, UCLA, Vanderbilt University, Ford Motor Company, RTI International, and World Bank. The PSTC’s training program is supported in part by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). Trainee Projects Reconstructing Asian Americans Human wellbeing, inequalities, and environmental change Infectious disease and Burkina Faso Farmworkers and migration Water quality and availability in India Emergency food assistance Challenges in education Forced migration, humanitarianism, and refugee social services Cardiovascular disease and social determinants of health Using cell phone data to track disease Pollution exposure and health Job mobility, household structure, and migration in South Africa Mortality rates among white Americans Experiences amongst Eritrean exiles and refugees Spotlight Gang Violence and Forced Displacement in Colombia My dissertation looks at forced displacement in Colombian cities. In the peripheral neighborhoods of several Colombian cities, families and individuals are forced to flee their homes, due to drug-related gang violence…. As political science rarely treads the territory of migration, PSTC has been of great help in my academic development. I have been introduced to many of the literatures and ways of thinking needed to rigorously approach the study of forced migration. - Jerome Marston, Predoctoral Trainee in Political Science Read more Back to top Explore Brown University Search Brown Show/Hide Learn More About Brown Academics Admission Research Campus Life Find A to Z Index People Directory Information for Students Faculty Staff Families Alumni Friends & Neighbors Top Destinations Global Brown Watson Institute Graduate School Alpert Medical School School of Public Health School of Engineering Population Studies and Training Center Population Studies and Training Center Brown University Box 1836 68 Waterman St. Providence, RI 02912 Phone: 401-863-2668 Email [email protected] Giving to Brown Brown University Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA Phone: 401-863-1000 Maps & Directions / Contact Us © 2022 Brown University Connect: [email protected] Facebook Twitter YouTube Instagram iTunes U Google+ LinkedIn SnapChat
