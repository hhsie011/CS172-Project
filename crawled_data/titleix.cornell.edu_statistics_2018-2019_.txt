The statistics are anonymized consistent with the privacy provision in the policy. Effective June 1, 2019, the university implemented new Procedures to address alleged violations of Cornell Policy 6.4 where the respondent was a member of the faculty or staff. For more information, see the Procedures. Respondent Prohibited Conduct Procedure Employee Where the respondent is an employee who is alleged to have committed protected-status harassment, including sexual and gender-based harassment, dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, sexual exploitation, stalking, aiding prohibited conduct, attempting to commit prohibited conduct, violating an interim measure, and retaliation. “Procedures for Resolution of Reports Against Employees Under Cornell University Policy 6.4,” available at https://titleix.cornell.edu/files/2019/11/Procedures-for-the-Resolution-of-Reports-Against-Employees-Under-University-Policy-6.4-10.11.2019.pdf Faculty Member Where the respondent is a faculty member who is alleged to have committed prohibited discrimination, and retaliation. “Procedures for Resolution of Reports of Prohibited Discrimination Against Faculty Under Cornell University Policy 6.4,” available at https://cpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/blogs.cornell.edu/dist/6/7016/files/2019/05/Procedures-for-Resolution-of-Reports-of-Prohibited-Discrimination-Against-Faculty-Under-Cornell-University-Policy-6.4-6.1.2019-3.pdf Staff Member Where the respondent is a staff member who is alleged to have committed prohibited discrimination, and retaliation. “Procedures for Resolution of Reports Against Staff Under Cornell University Policy 6.4,” available at https://cpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/blogs.cornell.edu/dist/6/7016/files/2019/05/Procedures-for-Resolution-of-Reports-of-Prohibited-Discrimination-Against-Staff-Under-Cornell-University-Policy-6.4-6.1.2019-2.pdf Prior to the June 1, 2019, transition, reports and Formal Complaints of alleged prohibited discrimination, retaliation, and protected-status harassment made against staff and faculty were received by the Office of Workforce Policy and Labor Relations. The information contained herein accounts only for reports and Formal Complaints received by the Office of Institutional Equity and Title IX during the 2018-2019 academic year. Although the total number of reports and Formal Complaints received during the 2018-2019 academic year appear to have decreased from the 2017-2018 academic year, this variation in the data simply reflects changes in the office’s internal practices for counting and tracking reports. With that said, the university has seen a fairly steady increase in the number of reports and Formal Complaints since the 2015-2016 academic year. Please note that this overall increase does not suggest an increase in violence or prohibited conduct; rather, it suggests that members of the community are now sharing their experiences more openly. This allows the university to address the individualized needs of those reporting, as well as the safety of the community as a whole. Reports During the 2018-2019 academic year, the Office of Institutional Equity and Title IX received 366 reports of alleged Policy 6.4 violations. This number includes reports of sexual or related misconduct, protected-status harassment, prohibited discrimination and retaliation against students, staff, faculty, unaffiliated individuals, and unknown or unidentified individuals. There can be multiple allegations of prohibited conduct in a single report. Prohibited Conduct Number of Reports Aiding Prohibited Conduct 1 Attempting to Commit Prohibited Conduct 7 Dating and Domestic Violence 53 Discrimination 10 Harassment (Including Sexual and Gender-Based Harassment) 124 Retaliation 12 Sexual Assault 135 Sexual Exploitation 33 Stalking 45 Violating an Interim Measure 8 Note: Reports of alleged bias and Policy 6.4 violations that did not involve sexual and/or related misconduct prior to June 1, 2019 were received by the Office of Workforce Policy and Labor Relations and the Department of Inclusion and Workforce Diversity.
