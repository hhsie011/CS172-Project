Magazine Outreach Ways to Give Clemson Home College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences Academics Graduates Current: Program Contacts Departmental Program Contacts Pathways to Graduate School Many programs at Clemson University have a fast track option for a Combined Bachelor-to-Graduate Plan for currently enrolled seniors. Depending upon the individual program offerings, a combined plan may be either a bachelor's-to-master's track or a bachelor's-to-doctoral track, reducing the time required to complete both degrees. Additionally, Clemson University hosts several Ph.D. programs that qualify as "direct entry"; students who already hold a bachelor's degree (from any institution) may apply directly to select doctoral programs with no master's degree prerequisite. We offer full-time traditional research-based graduate programs along with part-time applied degree programs designed for professionals working in a variety of STEM industries. Off-Campus learning is offered for master's, doctorate, and certificate programs. Traditional in-person opportunities are available at multiple campuses across the state. In addition, Clemson University continues to expand its online-based and hybrid programs. Each Fall, we offer a two-day recruitment event about Clemson's engineering and science graduate programs. The STEM ALL IN program is a diversity recruitment initiative designed to allow talented students from underrepresented populations to visit our faculty, staff, and students early in the application process to learn about STEM-related research opportunities at Clemson. Bachelor-to-Graduate Off-Campus Programs STEM All-In Outreach Clemson Online Programs Grad School Inquiry Form Associate Dean for Inclusive Excellence and Graduate Studies The Associate Dean for Inclusive Excellence and Graduate Studies leads a team focused at the graduate level on inclusion, equity, and diversity issues and supporting current students in their progress toward their degrees. A goal of the office is to see more underrepresented students complete the undergraduate curriculum successfully to be masters and Ph.D. students in the next five years, with a more reaching goal of those same students to be professors, doctors, and leaders in their chosen disciplines. DR. MELISSA SMITH, a professor of electrical and computer engineering, joined Clemson in 2006. She received her Ph.D. in 2003 in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Tennessee, where she specialized in performance modeling for high-performance computing systems. Prior to joining Clemson University, she was a research associate at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Smith received the YMCA Stratford Award for Diversity and Inclusion in 2017. View Profile Tonyia Stewart, M.Ed. Director of Graduate Recruitment & Inclusion Phone: (864) 656-9783 tonyias@clemson.edu Graduate student support has been Tonyia's focus since 2012.
