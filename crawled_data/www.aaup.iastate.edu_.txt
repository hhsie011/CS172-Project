Redbook Committee A Contact Us Links Iowa State University Chapter "Academic Freedom for a Free Society" From the President Welcome to the website of the AAUP Chapter at Iowa State University! Our local chapter has been active recently in addressing how budget cuts and policy planning affect faculty members, the rights of faculty as members of the professoriate, and, as always, academic freedom and due process. Of particular concern to the local Chapter has been the need to maintain and strengthen shared governance between faculty and various levels of the academic administration. This goal of the ISU Chapter of AAUP is achieved by working in close collaboration with the leadership of the Faculty Senate, as well as with academic administrators to ensure that the faculty voice is heard and listened to. -Dr. Heimir Geirsson, Professor and President of the ISU Chapter About the AAUP The AAUP is an organization focused on preserving the faculty voice within academia, advancing academic freedom and shared governance, and establishing a standard of fundamentals in professional values and higher education. In the pursuit of these goals, the AAUP seeks to ensure the contribution of higher education, toward the common good.
