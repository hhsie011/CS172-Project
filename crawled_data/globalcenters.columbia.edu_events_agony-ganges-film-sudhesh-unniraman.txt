For far too long, we have ignored the gap between the ritual purity of the River Ganga and its actual levels of cleanliness. So, how do you present an age-old problem in the light of new challenges such as climate change? This documentary from 2008 uses the spiritual and religious symbolism of the river, coupled with scientific data, to stress upon the threats to the river. The film artistically captures the dual challenge of those who depend on the river, but also contribute to its decline. It was recognized as the Best Film on Environment and Nature at the Inkafest Environment Film Festival (Peru), 2009. The filmmaker, Sudhesh Unniraman, is an alumnus of Jamia Milia Islamia University with over two decades of experience creating media projects on social issues of contemporary Indian society. Date and Time: August 20, 2017 from 3-5pm Venue: Nehru Science Centre, Dr. E. Moses Road, Worli, Mumbai The film screening is being organized as part of The River Ganga: India's Iconic Water Machine - an exhibition by Anthony Acciavatti from the Graduate School of Art, Architecture and Planning at Columbia University. The screening will be followed by a discussion with Acciavatti and Unniraman, moderated by Ravina Aggarwal, Director, Columbia Global Centers | Mumbai.
