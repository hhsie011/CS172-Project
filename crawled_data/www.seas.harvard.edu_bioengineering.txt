In bioengineering we integrate fundamental engineering disciplines such as thermodynamics and fluid mechanics with the physical and life sciences while drawing on mathematics and computational sciences. This convergence allows us to understand the operation of living systems and to design novel solutions to critical problems in medicine and biology. Bioengineers at Harvard are making advances in bioinspired robotics and computing; biomechanics and motor control; cell and tissue engineering, biomaterials and therapeutics. By leveraging our intellectual communities and world-class resources we are at the forefront of discovery and innovation. Our students and researchers collaborate with schools, centers and initiatives across the greater bioengineering community in Boston, including the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, the Broad Institute, the Center for Nanoscale Science, the Center for Brain Science, Harvard Move Lab, the Harvard Stem Cell Institute, the Quantitative Biology Initiative, the Martinos Center, as well as the Harvard Medical School and Chan School of Public Health. We offer graduate and undergraduate degrees and provide cutting-edge research opportunities for our students.
