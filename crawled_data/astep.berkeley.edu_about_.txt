The program aims to accomplish this by: Transformative seagoing experiences that broaden perspectives on the role of the oceans as a driver of global and environmental change Guiding cohorts of students to produce a series of charismatic multimedia products to communicate the impacts of global change within their own diverse communities Training and mentoring students to become effective ambassadors, disseminating exciting and relevant geoscience information across broad audiences.
