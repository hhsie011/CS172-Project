After eclipsing an initial goal of $3 billion in Fall 2021 more than a year ahead of schedule, Brown University has set a revised target of $4 billion and established a new end date of Dec. 31, 2024, for BrownTogether, the most ambitious fundraising campaign in its history. The University has raised $212.5 million above the original campaign goal during this early phase of the extension with the support of Brown alumni, parents and friends. Among key priorities during the extended campaign, the University will focus on raising funds for research and teaching in medicine, public health, engineering and the arts, as well as student financial aid, Brown Athletics and transforming its career services program. “ We have ambitious plans to advance our research and scholarship in new ways, improve the student experience and strengthen our approach to preparing students for lives and careers that serve the world. ” Christina H. Paxson President of Brown University Brown also will continue to seek support for original campaign priorities that have seen momentum toward funding goals, but where there is a need for additional fundraising — areas including but not limited to the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, the Center for the Study of Race and Ethnicity in America, the Center for the Study of Slavery and Justice and the Pembroke Center, as well as the Brown Annual Fund. “The remarkable generosity of our community has strengthened financial support for students, enabled innovative education and research across campus, and amplified the positive impact our scholars make in the world,” said Brown President Christina H. Paxson. “Building on that incredible momentum, we’ve now set our sights even higher. We have ambitious plans to advance our research and scholarship in new ways, improve the student experience and strengthen our approach to preparing students for lives and careers that serve the world.” The revised fundraising target and timeline and extended priorities were established by Brown’s senior leaders in consultation with the Corporation of Brown University, and the campaign will continue under the leadership of Chancellor Samuel M. Mencoff and campaign co-chairs Joan Wernig Sorensen, Theresia Gouw and Ralph Rosenberg. The extension builds on the priorities outlined when the University launched BrownTogether in 2015, aligned with the vision of the Building on Distinction strategic plan approved by the Corporation in 2013 and launched in 2014.
