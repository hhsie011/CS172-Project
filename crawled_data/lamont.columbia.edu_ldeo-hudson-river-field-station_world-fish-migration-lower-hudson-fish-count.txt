On World Fish Migration Day, organizations from around the world coordinate their own event around the common theme of: CONNECTING FISH, RIVERS AND PEOPLE. Environmental organizations of the Lower Hudson and Harbor have come together to put on our own family-friendly, free fishing events for the public to engage in the wonders of the Hudson River! Event times vary by site so please check the details below. 2022 Fishing Sites üêü Event Host Sites, please submit your 2022 data via this Google form. Each site is hosting a public fishing event to enhance our understanding of both migratory and resident fish that are part of our estuary. Each site will collect data during the fish count to support better understanding of the biodiversity of the lower Hudson and to compare the species richness and abundance to prior year spring fish counts and those that occur during other times of the year. The WFMD event builds on spring public fish count events that were organized from 2015 through 2019 as part of the World Science Festival. Those data are shared here as part of our long term data history with 2022 added after the event! üêü Annual Lower Hudson and Harbor Fish Count Data Contact Margie Turrin, Director of Educational Field Programs Laurel Zaima, Education and Outreach Coordinator Fish Count Data üêü 2022 Data Submission Form for Event Host Sites üêü Annual Lower Hudson and Harbor Fish Count Data Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory61 Route 9W ¬∑ Palisades, NY 10964 Phone 845-359-2900 Contact Us [email protected] Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ¬©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
