February 17, 2015 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM Please join Aromar Revi and Ayfer Bartu Candan for a talk on cities, sustainability and climate change. Aromar Revi is a thought leader on urbanization, having planned two-thirds of India’s states. He directs the Indian Institute for Human Settlements, co-authored the urban section of the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) reports and leads the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network (UN SDSN) group on Sustainable Cities. According to Aromar Revi, “cities are the most important creation that humankind has created over the last 5000 years, but also the most deeply confounded one.” This is particularly true at a time when climate change, urbanization, and inequality present deeper and more complex problems. But what if cities are put at the heart of the development agenda? What opportunities might cities present for a different economic, social and human development path, one that ensures greater sustainability and inclusion? How might the energy of mega-cities and regions be harnessed for the greater good? Revi will reflect on these questions, present the global campaign underway for the Urban SDG (Sustainable Development Goal), explain why this campaign is critical for Istanbul, and talk about how to get involved. Moderated by: Prof. Ayfer Bartu Candan of Boğaziçi University Aromar Revi is Director of the Indian Institute for Human Settlements (IIHS) – India’s first prospective National University for Research and Innovation to address challenges of urbanization through an integrated program of education, research, consulting and advisory services.

He is a Coordinating Lead Author of the IPCC Assessment Report 5 on Urban Areas and co-PI of a 5-year international multi-million dollar Climate Adaptation research program that spans India and Africa.  He is one of South Asia’s most experienced risk and disaster management professionals having led teams to plan & execute rehabilitation programs for ten major earthquakes, cyclone and flood events affecting over 5 million people and is on the Advisory Board of UNISDR' Scientific & Technical Advisory Group & its bi-annual Global Assessment of Risk.   Aromar has led over 100 major research, consulting & implementation assignments in India and abroad; has published 60 peer-reviewed publications and books; lectured & taught at over 35 of the world’s leading Universities and think tanks across 6 continents; helped structure, design & review development investments of over $ 8 billion; worked on 3 of the world’s 10 largest cities; and across all of India’s 29 states and in multiple international projects in half a dozen countries.
