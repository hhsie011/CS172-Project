For example, how do we maintain a long-term relationship living in different states? How do we communicate differences in economic class in our intimate relationships? What if you want to get married young or what if you want to stay in a long-term relationship but are not interested in marriage? These questions and more will be explored during our Purple Table Talk - a roundtable conversation examining what it takes to build a thriving relationship. Members of the Columbia community will explore their diverse lived and professional experiences in navigating intimate relationships. Participants will have opportunities for reflection, values exploration, learning, and connecting with members of the Columbia University community. Panelists will include professional staff from Greek life, Student Engagement, Sexual Violence Response, and Religious Life. There will also be an opportunity to connect with panelists through small group discussions. We hope you will join us!
