Individuals NOT Eligible The automatic extension rule does NOT apply to nationals of countries the U.S. has identified as sponsors of terrorism. As of 04/24/2017 the three countries identified as sponsoring terrorism are: Iran, Sudan and Syria. Although Iraq, Libya and North Korea are not on the list, students from these countries are strongly urged not to attempt to use this benefit. In addition, aliens who apply for a new visa while abroad are not eligible to re-enter the U.S. under Automatic Extension of Visa Validity. Likewise, individuals who are out of status in the U.S. or whose visa has been canceled are not eligible for this benefit. Most port of entry officials will require a current valid visa for Mexican and Caribbean students to re-enter the U.S. if coming from their home country.

Cuba is NOT included. Individuals that changed to F or J status while in the U.S. An individual who entered the U.S. in a classification other than F or J, but whose status was subsequently changed to F or J may be eligible for "automatic extension and conversion of visa" (whether expired or not) to the changed classification as long as the above criteria are met. Other Nonimmigrants Individuals in many other non-immigrant classifications may also be eligible for automatic extension of their visa. Please consult an international student advisor for details.
