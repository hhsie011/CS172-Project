Each semester that a student chooses to participate, they will need to complete Tuition Payment Plan enrollment and pay a $35 non-refundable enrollment fee. Students Log in to Catalyst Click the "My Finances" tile Select "Billing Information" on the left side of the page Click "Payment Plan Enrollment" Follow the prompts Those with Delegated Access are not able to complete the payment plan enrollment process. However, no payment is due right away. Once a student enrolls a parent/guest can then log in to view the payment schedule and initiate payment.

These dates cannot be changed. However, we do allow a 16-day grace period from all scheduled due dates without penalty. Monthly installments will be determined by taking charges due minus any pending aid and evenly disbursing the remaining charges over three installments. The $35 enrollment fee is added to the first installment. Each monthly installment requires the payee to log in and complete a payment transaction. We do not offer automatic bill pay. When paying online, the full balance of your account will automatically transfer. You will need to change this dollar amount to that of your installment by selecting "make a payment" and changing the dollar amount on the "How much would you like to pay?" screen. Scheduled due dates and installment amounts can be found by viewing the semester term bill or by viewing your charges due: Students: Log in to Catalyst Select the "My Finances" tile Click the red "Account Inquiry" button found in the "Account Summary" Click the "Charges Due" hyperlink Parent/Guest with Delegated Access: Log in to Catalyst Select the "Delegated Access" tile Click "Financial" on the left side of the page Click "View Charges Due" Additional Details Payment Plans are term specific and enrollment is required each term. Once enrolled in the payment plan, the $35 enrollment fee is non-refundable. Please use caution when enrolling. The 3-pay option is the only tuition payment plan available. We do not offer an annual payment plan. All students are eligible to enroll in the payment as long as their charges are for the current semester and at least $200 after aid disburses.
