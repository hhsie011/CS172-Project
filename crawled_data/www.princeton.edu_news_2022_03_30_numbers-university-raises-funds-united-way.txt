Proceeds support the United Way of Greater Mercer County’s education, financial stability, food insecurity and health programs. Sixty-two employees served as campaign volunteers in more than 40 University departments. In addition to organizing fundraising events, several volunteers held children’s book drives to support UWGMC literacy programs. The campaign raised $106,999.50 in contributions from faculty, staff and retirees -- $90,589.50 from the main campus, $1,810 from the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, $14,600 from retirees. The University matched gifts with 15 cents on the dollar for every payroll deduction contribution and 10 cents on the dollar for all other gifts, for a total University contribution of $14,467.58. In addition to supporting the United Way of Greater Mercer County’s Community Impact Fund, employees elected to distribute their donation directly to UWGMC programs. Employees helped provide meals to the Strike Out Hunger campaign, supply education kits for local school children, fund college admission support, and support families to bridge the digital divide by providing internet access. All donations will be distributed to United Way programs in Mercer County or employees’ home communities, or to other health and human services agencies that were designated by individual donors.
