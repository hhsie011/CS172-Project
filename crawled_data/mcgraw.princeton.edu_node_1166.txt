To open up class time for structured activities and to make the work done out of class more intentional, faculty “flip” their classes. This particular technique inverts the activities that conventionally take place in and out of the classroom. Students encounter new course material in the online setting, where they view video lectures and complete assignments to process new ideas and check their understanding. The work done out of class prepares students to engage in activities in class with their peers, professors, and AIs. In this way, online learning can enhance the role of faculty in the classroom. As Princeton faculty experiment with online teaching, we are gathering evidence that combining an online learning environment with an active classroom enlivens a course and intensifies learning. The recent experiments in flipping classes also have also revealed new teaching challenges, including introducing a new perspective on learning to your students. We offer these tip-sheets based on four key lessons learned from recent faculty projects: Integrating Your Online and Flipped Classroom Environment Making the Most of the Online Environment in Your Flipped Class Planning Structured Activities for the Flipped Classroom Flipping Yours and Your Students' Perspectives on Learning McGraw Center staff are available to consult individually with faculty on designing effective activities for their flipped classes as well as for creating interactive online course environments.
