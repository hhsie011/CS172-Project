Attending to both national and transnational contexts, scholars with a wide range of disciplinary expertise convene at the center to confront real-world problems and advance justice and transformational change. As a result of this multidisciplinary mission, the center fosters critical, collaborative scholarship on questions of gender and difference. Its unique array of programs and resources includes: The Pembroke Seminar, a year-long advanced research seminar An undergraduate concentration and graduate certificate in Gender and Sexuality Studies Public conferences and lectures International partnership projects Postdoctoral fellowships Seed grants and fellowships for Brown faculty and students in any discipline whose work concerns gender or sexuality A noted academic journal, differences The Pembroke Archives, dedicated to feminist and queer scholarship and the history of women at Brown and in Rhode Island Scholars at every level are essential to these efforts. But postdoctoral fellows—those who have just completed their Ph.D.—play a critical role in the center’s intellectual community. They bridge professors’ innovative explorations and those of graduate and undergraduate students; teach undergraduate courses of their own design; benefit from research and conference funding; and develop professionally through faculty mentorship. “ Pembroke Center postdoctoral fellows bring cutting-edge ideas to our research agenda and into the undergraduate curriculum. They also offer invaluable mentorship to students in the program. ” Leela Gandhi Shauna McKee Stark ’76, P’10 Director of the Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women, John Hawkes Professor of the Humanities and English The Pembroke Center's groundbreaking research is timely and relevant and its archives preserve women’s and LGBTQ history for future generations. Your gift will enable this work and directly enhance education, advising, and mentoring for students and scholars. Why give now?
