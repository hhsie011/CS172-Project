undergraduate and graduate or professional schools and colleges. These programs enable academically qualified students to earn a bachelor's and an advance degree - graduating sooner than they would have completing two distinct programs. +1 Undergraduate/Graduate Accelerated Programs Eligible undergraduate students use up to 12 specified graduate credits approved by the school/college to fulfill requirements for their undergraduate degree. Upon graduation from their undergraduate program, students move seamlessly into their graduate program, which they complete, in most cases, in one additional year. Students should meet with their advisor as soon as possible to discuss requirements for eligibility and the application process.
