These courses include SPAN 1, 2, 3 and other upper division courses. Ideally the paperwork (syllabi, grades, course work when applicable) should be submitted to the Registrar’s Office by the end of the summer before matriculation. Once submitted, the Registrar’s Office then prepares a document that goes to the individual departments for approval. These transfer credits can be granted for equivalent courses (courses similar in content, hours etc. to Dartmouth courses), or non-equivalent courses (courses that are not quite the same as Dartmouth courses, but courses that merit a credit). The designated person/s in the department (chair, major/minor advisor and/or the Language Program Director) will make a final decision as to which courses can be awarded transfer credit, and will send the approved and signed documents back to the Registrar’s Office as soon as they are approved. The chair signs off on all transfer credit. Matriculated Dartmouth students Incoming first-year and already matriculated Dartmouth students are not eligible for transfer credits for courses numbering 1, 2, or 3, which means that they cannot fulfill their language requirement with transfer credits taken before or after they matriculate. They can ask to take a qualifying exam (oral interview and written composition, or the internal placement exam with the Language Program Director or a qualified member of the department) in order to determine their language placement after taking language courses at another university or abroad, but they will not receive credit for SPAN 1, 2, or 3 taken at other institutions. The chair signs off on all transfer credit for courses above SPAN 3. Intermediate Courses Taken Before Matriculating at Dartmouth Paperwork (syllabi, grades, course work when applicable) should be submitted to the Registrar’s Office by the end of the first term on campus. Once submitted, the Registrar’s Office will prepare a document that goes to the Spanish and Portuguese department for approval. Transfer credits may be granted for equivalent courses (courses similar in content, hours etc. to Dartmouth courses), or non-equivalent courses (courses that are not quite the same as Dartmouth courses, but courses that merit a credit). The chair signs off on all transfer credit. Intermediate Courses Taken Elsewhere After Matriculating Paperwork (syllabi, course descriptions) should be submitted to the Registrar’s Office the term before the student will be off campus. Once submitted, the Registrar’s Office will prepare a document that goes to the Spanish and Portuguese department for pre-approval. Students must bring back course work (syllabi, work submitted for the courses, transcripts with grades). Transfer credits may be granted for equivalent courses (courses similar in content, hours etc. to Dartmouth courses), or non-equivalent courses (courses that are not quite the same as Dartmouth courses, but courses that merit a credit). The chair signs off on all transfer credit. LSA Equivalent Courses and Higher-level Language Courses Paperwork (syllabi, course descriptions) should be submitted to the Registrar’s Office the term before the student will be off campus. Once submitted, the Registrar’s Office will prepare a document that goes to the Spanish and Portuguese department for pre-approval. Students must bring back course work (syllabi, work submitted for the courses, transcripts with grades). Transfer credits may be granted for equivalent courses (courses similar in content, hours etc. to Dartmouth courses), or non-equivalent courses (courses that are not quite the same as Dartmouth courses, but courses that merit a credit). The chair signs off on all transfer credit. Contact person at the Registrar’s Office is Bethanne Tillotson. CASA Program Courses Students interested in studying Spanish abroad may apply to go on our Department-based LSAs, LSA+s and FSPs and/or look into the CASA (Consortium for Advanced Studies Abroad) programs. Currently LALACS sponsors the CASA program in Havana, Cuba. REQUIREMENTS The main requirement to go on this program upon acceptance is fluency in Spanish. Non-native speakers must have completed Spanish 20 or the equivalent. Heritage speakers of Spanish who are unsure of their competence in the language should contact the Minor/Major advisor. All Spanish minors can request up to 1 (one) credit towards the minor for a course taken only in Casa de las Américas through CASA. All Spanish majors can request up to 2 (two) credits towards the major for two courses taken in Casa de las Américas in Havana through CASA. (Note the department will only honor courses taken in Casa de las Américas, not Universidad de la Habana). Please refer to this website to see the list of courses in Casa de las Américas that will guarantee credit in Spanish. Upon completion of the CASA program, students can request their Spanish credit(s) by emailing our major/minor advisor with copy to the chair of the Department of Spanish and Portuguese, indicating the following information: Name and last name of student Dartmouth ID Number of Spanish credits requested (1 for minor/ 2 for major) Title(s) of course(s) specifying name of professor Departments African and African American Studies Anthropology Art History Asian Societies, Cultures, and Languages Program Biological Sciences Chemistry Classics Cognitive Science Comparative Literature Computer Science Earth Sciences Economics Education Engineering Sciences English Environmental Studies Film and Media Studies French and Italian Geography German Studies Government History Humanities 1 & 2 Institute for Writing and Rhetoric Jewish Studies Latin American, Latino and Caribbean Studies Linguistics Mathematics Medieval and Renaissance Studies Music Native American Studies Philosophy Physics and Astronomy Psychological and Brain Sciences Religion Russian Sociology Spanish and Portuguese Studio Art Theater Women’s and Gender Studies Inclusivity “Dartmouth’s capacity to advance its dual mission of education and research depends upon the full diversity and inclusivity of this community…Diversity and inclusivity are necessary partners. Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Spanish and Portuguese Undergraduate Overview Frequently Asked Questions Advisors Student Awards and Prizes Programs Hispanic Studies Romance Studies Lusophone Studies Hispanic and Lusophone Studies Honors Thesis Program Thesis Timeline Application Process Thesis Research Funding Past Theses Courses Spanish Portuguese First-Year Seminars (FYS) Placement Information Spanish Portuguese Transfer Credits Alumni Update Foreign Study Overview Programs in Spanish Spanish LSA in Barcelona and Buenos Aires (NEW) Spanish LSA in Santander (NEW) Spanish LSA+ in Barcelona [NEW] Spanish LSA+ in Buenos Aires Spanish FSP in Madrid and Buenos Aires Programs in Portuguese Portuguese LSA+ in São Paulo, Brazil Student Opportunities Overview Apprentice Teacher Information Digital Resources Student Funding AT/Drill Instructor Tryout Dates La Casa Overview Apply Living Guidelines Who We Are Frequently Asked Questions Day of the Dead El Cafecito News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
