The libraries support the instructional and research information needs of the University. Butler Library is the largest of the 17 libraries at Columbia and its affiliated institutions, and the one most heavily used by first-year students, especially those in Columbia College and SEAS. Undergraduates may use any library on campus and also the libraries of Columbia's affiliated institutions, Barnard College and Teachers College. Butler Reserves Collection Located at the Circulation Desk on the third level, Butler Reserves is a collection of books and articles selected by faculty to support their current course teaching. Butler Reserves covers most undergraduate classes, as well as graduate classes in history and humanities. For example, reserve readings for courses in the Core Curriculum (e.g., Contemporary Civilization, Literature Humanities) are available in Butler Reserves. Reserve materials usually circulate for two hours (or overnight after 6 p.m.) Use the Course Reserves link in the CLIO Catalog sidebar or the Library Reserves tab in CourseWorks to find reserves readings for your classes.
