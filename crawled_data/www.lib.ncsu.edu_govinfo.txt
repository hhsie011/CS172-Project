We are a selective federal depository library, as well as a Patent and Trademark Resource Center. As a congressionally designated depository for U.S. Government documents, public access to the Government documents collection is guaranteed by public law. (Title 44 United States Code) Finding Federal Government Documents at the NC State University Libraries Most of the Libraries' Federal Government Documents print collection is located in the Hunt Library bookBot and items must be retrieved by staff. The following guidelines will help you find the resource you need. If online or other electronic format is acceptable: Search Google There have been a number of large-scale digitization projects designed to make government documents available online, many of which may be found the most quickly with a Google Search. To find documents hosted on government websites, use the phrase site:.gov in the Google search box. ProQuest Congressional This database provides full-text of Congressional Hearing, as well as other documents from the U.S. Congress. United States Documents Masterfile: 1774-present This database includes the Monthly Catalog, an index to historical government publications (which may or may not be available online). Full-text databases and websites There are many databases and free online resources that focus on particular categories of government documents. This page is designed to help you find particular types of documents based on time period. For items in our print collection, search our Catalog If you find the item in the catalog, most likely it will be located in the Hunt Library bookBot. This is true for books, serials, CD/DVDs, and microfiche, but not flat maps. You can use the "Request" link within the item record to have it retrieved for you from the bookBot, or request a scan if you need only part of the item. If you do not find the item in our catalog, or our catalog only links to a digital copy and you need a print copy, then use Tripsaver. Only NC State affiliates may request items through Tripsaver. If you are a guest searching for an uncataloged government document, please contact a librarian listed below. More details about our collection of un-folded flat maps may be found here. We are actively adding links in our Catalog to online government publications, which will appear with keyword searches. Reference Help At any point, you may get online or in-person assistance through AskUs. Librarian(s) Jeff Essic Hillary Fox Cindy Levine Top of page Contact D. H.
