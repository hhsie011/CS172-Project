Where the alleged conduct meets the narrow definitional and jurisdictional requirements of Title IX, it will be considered and addressed under the Interim Title IX Grievance Process. These infographics are provided to help individuals understand Columbia’s EOAA and Interim Title IX Grievance Processes. They offer only overviews of these processes. In all instances, individuals should follow the procedures in EOAA Policies and Procedures. EOAA Investigative Process: The EOAA Investigative Process is the set of procedures that will be used for complaints, investigations, adjudication, and appeals of matters where employees or third parties are accused of misconduct that may violate EOAA Policies prohibiting discrimination, harassment, and retaliation (except Title IX); Columbia’s Duty to Report & Duty to Act Policies; Columbia’s Romantic & Sexual Relationship Policies; and Columbia’s Accommodations Policies. Interim Title IX Grievance Process: The Interim Title IX Grievance Process is the set of procedures that will be used solely for complaints, investigations, adjudication, and appeals of matters where employees or third parties are accused of misconduct covered by Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 (“Title IX”) regulations released in 2020. Conduct that may violate Title IX includes sexual harassment, sexual assault, stalking, sexual exploitation, dating violence, and domestic violence as defined by Title IX. This conduct must occur in the United States and in an education program or activity of the University. All prohibited conduct not covered by Title IX will be addressed through the EOAA Investigative Process.
