Social and Health Sciences Academics School of Nursing Degrees Current: Healthcare Genetics and Genomics, Ph.D. Ph.D. Healthcare Genetics and Genomics Healthcare Genetics and Genomics Handbook Request More Information Apply Now Welcome to the home of the interdisciplinary and online Ph.D. in Healthcare Genetics and Genomics. The curriculum offers the opportunity to learn from experts the vital elements of their discipline which can impact the evolving knowledge of genetics and/or genomics. The impact of genetics on healthcare has the potential to be greater than any earlier scientific advancement. With all it promises in prevention, early detection diagnostics and treatment of disease, genetics will require a much different way of providing health care and conducting research. To help meet this challenge, Clemson University offers the first interdisciplinary Doctor of Philosophy in Healthcare Genetics. Program Information Our program offers graduate students the opportunity to be mentored by interdisciplinary faculty from more than six disciplines. Core courses are in genetics, health care genetics, statistics, and research methods with cognates available in psychology, political science, policy and other areas to provide students with the tools necessary to develop a program of research. Core courses are offered in a live synchronous online format and students may choose to locate in the Clemson area or remain distance. Students will be matched with faculty to conduct dissertation research. With its highly collaborative research and practical-application structure, this program will prepare interdisciplinary scientists to: collaborate with multiple disciplines to generate knowledge and develop theories that focus on the genomic aspects of actual and potential health problems. formulate health promotion, disease prevention and treatment strategies that translate and integrate genomic knowledge from a variety of disciplines. demonstrate leadership that facilitates interdisciplinary development and application of ethical guidelines and health policy in genetics. A new lab offers students research projects that are being translated for use in the clinical setting while giving them experience to gain skills for their future research in the lab. Students can participate in a variety of specialty genetic clinics and learn to research questions that are real to patients and their health care providers. Implementation of a new annual seminar gives back timely information on significant genetic topics that can personally affect the local community and health care providers. Are You A Candidate? Those who have degrees in non-nursing disciplines but who have an interest in genetics Those who are nurses who have an interest in genetics, particularly those with experience in obstetrics, pediatrics or oncology. Applying For a Fall (August) start, applications are accepted through the Graduate School at Clemson University through January 1st. Applications open in August (for the following year) and can be found here. For more information about the Graduate School at Clemson University simply visit their site here. Accepted students will attend a 2-day orientation during the Spring semester with one day being on campus at Clemson University and the next day at the Clemson Nursing Building in Greenville, SC. Application Criteria Application for admission to the Graduate School by January 15th for Fall admission (the application becomes available in August each year). At least a bachelor’s degree in a related health science discipline from an accredited institution. A cumulative GPA of 3.25 or higher (all college credits) Official transcripts from all previous college credits Three letters of recommendation for graduate study or Professional resume or curriculum vita (CV) Personal statement and career goals Writing sample (or master’s theses or publications) Interview with faculty TOEFL score (may be required by applicants for whom English is not their first language). As of January 1, 2017, applicants who graduated from program(s) that award Pass/Fail grades for all courses will not be considered competitive applicants.

The institute offers more than 150 genetic libraries of plants, animals and insects for use by scientists all over the world. The S.C. DNA Learning Center provides outreach education in biotechnology and modern genetics to K-12 teachers, non-formal educators, students and the general public. The Clemson University Biosystems Research Complex is one of the university’s newest laboratory facilities and serves as a focal point for biotechnology research, which uses life sciences to create new products and processes in medicine, agriculture and industry. The Electron Microscope Facility holds state-of-the-art equipment. With a wide range of capabilities, this multi-user facility attracts clients from automotive, pharmaceutical, textile, electronics, environmental and medical industries. The Joseph F. Sullivan Nursing Center is an academic nursing center that offers clinical practice opportunities for students while providing services to the community. The center has won numerous awards including the Best Chance Network Provider Facility of the Year. The Center for Research on Health Disparities provides leadership to develop and advance comprehensive, culturally sensitive, community-based research that improves health outcomes and enhances quality of life. The center links faculty, students and community members to advance research on the complex causes of health disparities and strategies to eliminate these disparities. The Robert J. Rutland Institute for Ethics provides the campus and community with a forum for exploration and discussion of ethical issues. The flagship project of the center is to cultivate the Ethics-Across-the-Curriculum movement. The School of Nursing Healthcare Genetics Wet Lab offers tissue-culture capabilities for students interested in translating research from bench to bedside. Cell flow cytometry and cell sorting are also available through University partners. Reciprocity South Carolina is a member of the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (SARA) and Clemson University (CU) is an approved SARA institution, which means we adhere to established standards for offering post-secondary e-learning programs. State authorization allows CU the ability to offer online programs to students who live outside of SC OR enroll students in learning placements that will take place outside of SC (such as internships, clinicals, practicums, and student teaching). CU must meet all of the regulatory requirements, including those from licensure/certification boards, of the state where the student physically resides or where an activity will take place. IT IS IMPERATIVE YOU UNDERSTAND THE REGULATIONS FOR YOUR STATE PRIOR TO ENROLLING IN ANY ACADEMIC PROGRAM OR COURSE. Please review our state authorizations to determine if specific program offerings or learning placements are available in the state which you will be physically located while enrolled. If you experience difficulty finding the requirements for a specific state, please email stateauth@clemson.edu for help. If you are expecting a change in your physical location, contact the State Authorization office as soon as you know the anticipated location(s). Physical presence in a location where we do not meet state regulatory requirements can negatively impact our ability to offer you federal financial aid, military tuition assistance, or your continuation within the program. These restrictions extend to courses taken online over the summer, internships, clinicals or other forms of learning placements if they are conducted outside of an approved state. Students are responsible for providing accurate and updated information about their physical presence to the institution. Early notification allows the institution to minimize, but may not prevent, the possibility of program delays/offerings.
