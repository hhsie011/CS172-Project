Plant pathology and plant-microbe biology are the study of plant diseases and the biology of plant-microbe interactions at the molecular to ecosystem levels of organization. The field of plant pathology and plant-microbe biology at Cornell offers graduate degree programs in plant pathology and the biology, genetics, and evolution of fungi and oomycetes. In addition to plant pathology and plant-microbe biology, Cornell University offers graduate programs that cover the full spectrum of plant sciences.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
