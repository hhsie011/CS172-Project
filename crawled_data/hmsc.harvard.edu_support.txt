With the museums temporarily closed, we are relying more than ever on the generosity of donors. Recent months have presented unforeseen challenges as well as unexpected opportunities. Thanks in part to the support of our members and friends, HMSC has been able to pivot, apply creative solutions, and serve the public in new ways. With online classes, podcasts, virtual tours, and more we continue to encourage exploration across the four public museums. Your gift to HMSC will support these efforts and help us plan for the day we can open our galleries.
