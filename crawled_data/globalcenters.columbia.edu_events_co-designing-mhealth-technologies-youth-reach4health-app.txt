Supported by the International Cooperation and Development Fund of Taiwan (TaiwanICDF) and Columbia University, the REACH Project in Turkey is implemented with the collaboration of Center for Sustainable Development of Columbia University, Columbia Global Centers | Istanbul, Istanbul University, Bir İZ Association, Community Volunteers Foundation (TOG), and Youth Approaches to Health Association (SGYD). With a strong adult-youth partnership, the project includes stakeholder meetings, mixed methods studies with urban youth, qualitative interviews with health service providers and health policymakers, in addition to communication and dissemination activities such as organization of exhibitions, panels, and production of policy briefs and scientific publications. REACH has been working with refugee and local youth, software developers, academia, health professionals, and NGOs to develop a trilingual mHealth application to promote young people’s and vulnerable populations’ health via digital technologies. REACH ultimately aims to increase health literacy and improve health care access among young people, through working with stakeholders to disseminate the app more broadly in Turkey and the region, assess its effectiveness, and contribute to the limited evidence base on using health technologies for youth health promotion in forced migration settings.
