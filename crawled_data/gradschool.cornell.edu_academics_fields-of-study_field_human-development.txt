It does not prepare students to be clinical psychologists, school psychologists, or family life counselors. Students develop an individual program of study and research in consultation with their Special Committee, which is chaired by a member of the Field of Human Development but may include faculty members from other fields. All Ph.D. students are required to complete at least two semesters of graduate-level training in statistics and one semester of teaching. The field also requires that students complete a predoctoral research project or master's degree before taking the Admission to Candidacy examination. All students are expected to acquire a basic background in the behavioral sciences and to master a broad base of knowledge of human development in the context of family and society. Both the M.A. and the Ph.D. degree programs require a research thesis or dissertation. For the Ph.D. degree, two semesters of graduate-level training in statistics and some teaching experience are required. The field also requires that candidates complete a predoctoral research project before taking the Admission to Candidacy examination. The Ph.D. program ordinarily takes four years to complete. Research facilities: There are a number of fully equipped laboratories directed by individual faculty members who are conducting observational and experimental studies of basic processes in development. In the Bronfenbrenner Center for Translational Research, students may become involved in research or demonstration projects involving child maltreatment, families under stress, and adulthood and aging.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
