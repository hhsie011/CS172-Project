Stay Informed Tips Vital Info Latest News Supporting your student’s entire wellbeing: A message from Vice Provost for Student Affairs Susie Brubaker-Cole November 18, 2021 11:19 am Categories: Uncategorized Dear parents and families of Stanford students, As we quickly approach the end of a fall quarter that has been both challenging and exhilarating, I wanted to send my gratitude. Thank you for supporting your students through the pandemic, remote learning and our full return to campus this September. While energy and excitement on campus are high and our COVID-19 infection rates remain low, we know that emotions at this time of the year can compound with other stressors students are managing. We believe parents and families can be key to supporting their students well-being during stressful academic times and over the upcoming winter break. Approaching conversations about mental health and well-being with your student can sometimes be challenging. Student Affairs has updated the Red Folder tool to reflect this moment in time. We urge you to visit this resource for tips on how to: identify signs of student distress more safely and comfortably have conversations with students about what you are observing connect students to appropriate mental health and well-being resources on campus (this tool has a comprehensive listing of resources at Stanford to support student well-being) Additionally, in partnership with CAPS, the university is providing a new 24/7 telehealth mental health counseling service for students. This new service, called WPO, is free of charge and is accessible to students wherever they are – even during university breaks and holidays. More information about this support can be located on the CAPS homepage. To access this new therapy service students should call: 1.866.212.6113 (enrolled Stanford students currently located in the U.S.) 1.984.239.2309 (enrolled Stanford students currently located outside the U.S.) Finally, we have new additional web and downloadable resources for you to use or share with students as needed: Resources for our Communities provides a directory of various services offered to support student well-being. This easy-to-use site should help you and students navigate the network of resources available to our community. Given the extraordinary levels of disability, loss, and grief some students have experienced in the wake of COVID, we created Grieving at Stanford to help students connect with resources to appropriately support their needs. This resource card is a portable way for students to keep this information handy. We take seriously our opportunities and responsibilities to support student mental health and well-being, and we are thankful for the opportunity to partner with and provide support for parents and families. We encourage you to take a moment to familiarize yourself with the resources mentioned above, and we hope they will help you feel more confident in how you support your students. Please be in touch with questions or ideas and know that we deeply value you as members of our broader Stanford community. Sincerely, Susie Brubaker-Cole Vice Provost for Student Affairs Post navigation Previous post Our New Academic Year: A message from Stanford President Marc Tessier-Lavigne Next post The exceptional resiliency of Stanford students, instructors: A message from Freeman-Thornton Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education Sarah Church Categories Academics at Stanford (83) Alcohol at Stanford (16) Career Education (3) Finances at Stanford (12) Health at Stanford (40) Living at Stanford (60) Parents Program (5) Parents' Club (4) Safety at Stanford (41) Stanford Events (56) Uncategorized (11) Archives Archives Select Month April 2022 (1) February 2022 (1) November 2021 (1) September 2021 (3) August 2021 (1) June 2021 (4) May 2021 (4) April 2021 (3) March 2021 (4) February 2021 (5) January 2021 (2) December 2020 (1) September 2020 (3) August 2020 (2) July 2020 (1) June 2020 (4) May 2020 (3) March 2020 (3) February 2020 (2) January 2020 (2) December 2019 (1) November 2019 (2) October 2019 (5) September 2019 (4) August 2019 (2) July 2019 (3) June 2019 (3) May 2019 (3) April 2019 (2) March 2019 (2) February 2019 (6) January 2019 (3) December 2018 (1) November 2018 (2) October 2018 (2) September 2018 (4) August 2018 (2) May 2018 (4) April 2018 (2) March 2018 (6) February 2018 (4) January 2018 (1) November 2017 (4) October 2017 (3) September 2017 (5) August 2017 (5) July 2017 (2) June 2017 (2) May 2017 (5) April 2017 (3) March 2017 (4) February 2017 (2) January 2017 (3) December 2016 (3) October 2016 (3) September 2016 (4) August 2016 (2) July 2016 (3) June 2016 (3) May 2016 (2) April 2016 (4) March 2016 (2) February 2016 (8) January 2016 (3) December 2015 (2) November 2015 (7) October 2015 (2) September 2015 (7) August 2015 (1) July 2015 (3) June 2015 (5) May 2015 (1) April 2015 (3) March 2015 (3) February 2015 (1) January 2015 (1) December 2014 (1) November 2014 (1) October 2014 (4) September 2014 (3) June 2014 (3) May 2014 (1) April 2014 (2) March 2014 (1) February 2014 (5) January 2014 (2) November 2013 (1) October 2013 (1) September 2013 (3) August 2013 (1) June 2013 (1) April 2013 (2) March 2013 (5) February 2013 (1) December 2012 (3) September 2012 (3) June 2012 (1) May 2012 (2) February 2012 (1) January 2012 (2) December 2011 (4) November 2011 (1) August 2011 (2) May 2011 (1) April 2011 (1) February 2011 (1) January 2011 (2) October 2010 (1) August 2010 (1) July 2010 (1) March 2010 (1) Newsletter Email newsletter archive Stanford + Parents/Guardians The student is at the center — and is the focus — of this important partnership.
