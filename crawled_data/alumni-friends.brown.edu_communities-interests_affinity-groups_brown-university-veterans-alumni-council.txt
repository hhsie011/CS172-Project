Email alumniveterans@brown.edu Learn more about BUVAC About BUVAC Brown University Veterans Alumni Council (BUVAC) provides a way to convene Brown’s growing military-affiliated community by raising awareness of the University’s military-related news and activities and engaging veteran and ROTC through a formal mentoring program. BUVAC’s Mission Established in 2018, the Brown University Veterans Alumni Council (BUVAC) engages Brown alumni, parents, and community members by providing support and facilitating connections to Brown University students who are veterans or are participating in Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) programs. The Council also supports military-related activities and programming on campus, and plays a critical role in engaging alumni interested in military affairs at Brown University. Supported by the University’s Division of Advancement and the Office of Alumni Relations in its day-to-day efforts, the Council collaborates closely with Brown’s Office of Military-Affiliated Students (OMAS).

Join our email list: email alumniveterans@brown.edu Support the veterans initiative Learn more about BUVAC About the Mentorship Program Making the connection In BUVAC’s mentoring program, student veterans are paired with Brown veteran alumni mentors. Over the course of the school year, the pairings explore topics such as broadening their networks, learning about post-graduation military experience, and how to navigate their chosen careers. The goal? To help mentees graduate with a solid transitional road map to navigate their journey from military to student and civilian. Passing down practical tips By providing an opportunity to learn from their professional and personal experiences, alumni mentors aim to offer practical advice to mentees as they navigate their time at Brown and prepare for graduation. In addition to access to their mentors, mentees in the program receive guidance from two veteran mentor alumni champions, Scott Quigley ’05 and Jeremy McKenzie MMP’16.
