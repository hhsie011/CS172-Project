Columbia | Center for Spatial Research Projects News Courses Tutorials Publications People Contact x Close Menu Columbia | CSRCenter for Spatial Research Menu About Projects News Courses Tutorials Publications People In connection with our courses and research the Center for Spatial Research develops tutorials on tools in critical mapping and data visualization. Tutorials are crafted to provide the technical expertise necessary for critically-minded spatial research across a broad range of disciplines. This growing library is designed to be a resource for students, faculty, and practitioners engaging in spatial research at Columbia University and beyond.
