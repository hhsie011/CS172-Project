8:30 PM Istanbul On March 21, Columbia Global Centers | Istanbul will host Marianne Hirsch, William Peterfield Trent Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University and Professor in the Institute for Research on Women, Gender, and Sexuality, in conversation with Ayşe Gül Altınay, Associate Professor of Anthropology at Sabancı University and Aylin Vartanyan, Lecturer at Bogazici University. This event is organized in collaboration with SU Gender, Hrant Dink Foundation, and Friedrich-Ebert-Foundation. About the Talk Responding to the renewed monumentality of memory museums, memorials and commemorative rituals that perpetuate nationalism and ethnocentrism, this talk looks at two recent memorial projects by feminist diasporic artists from different parts of the world [Mirta Kupferminc and Wangechi Muthu] projects that explore the vicissitudes and vulnerabilities of exile and statelessness. It suggests that stateless memory can open up the possibility of imagining alternative relationships between contemporary subjects and citizenship, national belonging, and home, as well as alternate temporalities of becoming. Professor Marianne Hirsch writes about the transmission of memories of violence across generations, combining feminist theory with memory studies in global perspective. Her recent books include The Generation of Postmemory: Writing and Visual Culture After the Holocaust (2012), Ghosts of Home: The Afterlife of Czernowitz in Jewish Memory (2010), co-authored with Leo Spitzer, and two volumes forthcoming this year: the co-edited Women Mobilizing Memory and the co-authored School Photos in Liquid Time. The director of Columbia University’s Center for the Study of Social Difference, Hirsch teaches Comparative Literature and Gender Studies at Columbia. Columbia Üniversitesi Toplumsal Farklılık Çalışmaları Merkezi direktörü Profesör Marianne Hirsch'ü "Hafızayı Taşıyan Kadınlar: Vatansız Figürler" başlıklı konuşmasıyla 21 Mart Perşembe akşamı Studio-X Istanbul'da ağırlıyoruz. Hrant Dink Vakfı, Sabancı Üniversitesi Toplumsal Cinsiyet ve Mükemmeliyet Merkezi ve Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung Derneği ile ortak olarak düzenlediğimiz bu etkinlikte, Sabancı Üniversitesi'nden Doç. Dr. Ayşe Gül Altınay ve Boğaziçi Üniversitesi'nden Öğretim Görevlisi Aylin Vartanyan da tartışmacı olarak bizlerle birlikte olacaklar. Etkinlik boyunca simultane çeviri sağlanacaktır. Hafızayı Taşıyan Kadınlar: Vatansız Figürler Milliyetçilik ve etnik merkezciliği kalıcı hale getiren hafıza müzelerinin, abidelerin ve anma törenlerinin yenilenen anıtsallığına bir cevap olarak, bu konuşma dünyanın farklı bölgelerinden feminist diaspora sanatçıları (Mirta Kupferminc ve Wangechi Muthu) tarafından yürütülen iki yakın dönem hafıza projesine değinecektir. Bu projeler sürgünün ve vatansızlığın değişimlerini ve de kırılganlıklarını araştırmaktadır. Konuşma, vatansız hafızanın günümüz özneleriyle vatandaşlık, ulusal aidiyet, vatan ve hatta oluşun farklı zamansallığı arasında alternatif ilişkileri hayal etmeyi mümkün kılabileceğini öne sürmektedir. Marianne Hirsch, feminist teoriyi hafıza çalışmalarıyla küresel bir perspektiften birleştirerek, şiddet hafızasının kuşaktan kuşağa aktarımı üzerine yazmaktadır. Son kitapları arasında The Generation of Postmemory: Writing and Visual Culture After the Holocaust, (Hafıza-sonrası Kuşağı: Nazi Soykırımı Sonrası Yazım ve Görsel Kültür), Leo Spitzer ile birlikte yazdığı Ghosts of Home: The Afterlife of Czernowitz in Jewish Memory (Memleketin Hayaletleri: Czernowitz’in Yahudi Hafızasındaki İzleri) yer almaktadır. Bu yıl çıkacak olan kitapları ise Spitzer ile birlikte derlediği Women Mobilizing Memory (Hafızayı Harekete Geçiren Kadınlar) ve Spitzer ile birlikte yazdığı School Photos in Liquid Time (Akışkan Zamanda Okul Fotoğrafları)’dır. Columbia Üniversitesi Toplumsal Farklılık Çalışmaları Merkezi’nin direktörü olan Hirsch Columbia Üniversitesi’nde Karşılaştırmalı Edebiyat ve Toplumsal Cinsiyet Çalışmaları dersleri vermektedir.
