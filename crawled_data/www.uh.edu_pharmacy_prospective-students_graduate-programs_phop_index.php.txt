Curriculum The graduate program offers structured learning and experiences in health care systems, health care quality, health behavior, biostatistics, multivariate analyses, research methods and design, pharmacoepidemiology, and pharmacoeconomics. Elective courses such as secondary data analyses, multilevel modeling, patient-reported outcomes, and risk adjustments provide advanced learning experiences, along with the opportunities to participate in grant proposal writing and teaching and research practicums. Graduate courses in healthcare administration and healthcare evaluation and policy also are available from TMC academic institutions, such as The University of Texas School of Public Health and the University of Houston Clear Lake, to provide well-rounded graduate training in pharmaceutical health outcomes and policy.
