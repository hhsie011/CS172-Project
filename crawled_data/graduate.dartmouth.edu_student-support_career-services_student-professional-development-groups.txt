Contact: Aileen Eagleton Visit their Facebook page Dartmouth Writers Society Writing societies have functioned as a creative source for centuries. With this in mind, we have created the Dartmouth Writers Society. Our goal is to build a community of exceptional writers who nourish and replenish the creative energies of our members. Each term we will host workshops, roundtable peer reviews, monthly meetings, and tours to historic writer haunts. From these events our members will learn from professionals in the business, discuss their own writing, and network with each other.
