Prerequisites: VIAR R1000. (Formerly R4005) Students will connect with the very heart of the Western Art tradition, engaging in this critical activity that was the pillar of draftsmanship training from the Renaissance on through the early Modern Era. This pursuit is the common thread that links artists from Michelangelo and Rubens to Van Gogh and Picasso. Rigorous studies will be executed from plaster casts of antique sculptures, and pedagogical engravings. Students will confront foundational issues of academic training; assessing proportion and tonal value, structure and form. Hours will be spent on a single drawing pushing to the highest degree of accuracy in order develop a means for looking at nature. There is a focus on precision and gaining a thorough understanding of the interaction between light and a surface. This approach emphasizes drawing by understanding the subject and the physical world that defines it. While this training has allowed great representational artists of the past to unlock the poetry from the world around them and continues to inspire a surging new realist movement, it can also serve as a new way of seeing and a launching point for achieving creative goals.

This advanced painting class will consider contemporary painting in the context of traditional genres, exploring both continuity and discontinuity between contemporary painting and the tradition out of which it arose. Questions considered will include: Do traditional genres such as the history painting, the still-life, the nude, the portrait, the landscape painting have any relevance to contemporary painting? If not, where have these genres migrated to in our contemporary culture? Does contemporary painting exist solely as a clichÃ© of art production, a hand-made status symbol and luxury commodity or can an argument be made for painting as an individual revolt against mass culture? Is paintingâs appeal simply due to nostalgia for a now-obsolete technology of representation or does its enduring popularity result from a desire for the physical/personal in a screen-based world? How are contemporary artists using painting today and what critical strategies are available to painters today? Students will be expected to present artwork weekly for individual and group critiques. The course will use an expanded definition of painting so students should feel free to experiment with other media as desired. Students will be required to research historical and contemporary (both art and mass culture) examples of the various genres and to create visual presentations of their research. Supplemental readings will be assigned weekly. Students will spend the last month working on a project of their choice Photography VIAR UN1700 PHOTOGRAPHY: PHOTO I. 3.00 points.

Prerequisites: VIAR R2300. (Formerly R3332) Sculpture III is an invitation for immersive sculpting. The class will explore the idea of experiences and construction of contexts as central research topics. The class becomes a laboratory space to explore various techniques to heighten body awareness and spatial sensibility. Through assignments and workshops, the students will practice how to digest these sensory experiences through their studio practice. Historical precedents for art outside the usual mediums and venues will be our reference points to investigate how our own work may take part in a generative process that evolves the definition of sculpture. The assignments in the first half of the semester point the students to performance, site specificity, and sound, that utilize New York Citys odd spots and professionals. While building such common experiential platforms, the class will also build language for a dialogic space, through weekly in-class discussions lead by the instructor, guests, and rotating panels of the students. As the semester progresses, the emphasis will gradually be shifted from experiential learning to intensive studio work on a final project, where the students are asked to pay close attention to how various methods and fields of subjects combine. The resulting project has to be the best work you have ever done.

What happens to a body stilled in space, when it takes a shape and holds it? How does its relationship to public space change? How is its transformation attenuated when the body is in formation with other bodies, a breathing still life of people and props? This performance art course will use the question of a bodyâs stillness as a platform to create interdisciplinary projects that exist between dance, sculpture, collaborative movement, and performance art. Through core readings and case study presentations, we will discuss unique possibilities of representation and challenges this form enables, and the prominent role it has been taking within the visual arts in recent years. Students will engage with a variety of aesthetic strategies and formal techniques such as movement workshops, sensory exercises, video, wearable sculptures, collaboration, scores, and group meditation. Studio work will focus on concrete intersections between the body and the object, and case studies chosen to encourage students to think of movement as a form of resistance, and to consider the political implication of collaborative work that unfolds over time. Performativity in the context of this class is widely defined, and no prior experience is required Spring 2022: VIAR GU4600 Course Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment VIAR 4600 001/15609 F 10:00am - 4:00pm 101 Prentis Hall Tamar Ettun 3.00 13/16 Moving Image VIAR UN3500 Beginning Video. 3 points. Beginning Video is an introductory class on the production and editing of digital video. Designed as an intensive hands-on production/post-production workshop, the apprehension of technical and aesthetic skills in shooting, sound and editing will be emphasized. Assignments are developed to allow students to deepen their familiarity with the language of the moving image medium. Over the course of the term, the class will explore the language and syntax of the moving image, including fiction, documentary and experimental approaches. Importance will be placed on the decision making behind the production of a work; why it was conceived of, shot, and edited in a certain way. Class time will be divided between technical workshops, viewing and discussing films and videos by independent producers/artists and discussing and critiquing students projects. Readings will be assigned on technical, aesthetic and theoretical issues. Only one section offered per semester.

Advanced Video is a full day class 10:00am- 4:00pm. Prerequisites: (VIAR UN3500) VIAR UN3500 Beginning Video or prior experience in video or film production. Advanced Video is an advanced, intensive project-based class on the production of digital video. The class is designed for advanced students to develop an ambitious project or series of projects during the course of the semester. Through this production, students will fine-tune shooting and editing skills as well as become more sophisticated in terms of their aesthetic and theoretical approach to the moving image. The class will follow each student through proposal, dailies, rough-cut and fine cut stage. The course is organized for knowledge to be shared and accumulated, so that each student will learn both from her/his own process, as well as the processes of all the other students. Additional screenings and readings will be organized around the history of video art and the problematics of the moving image in general, as well as particular issues that are raised by individual student projects.
