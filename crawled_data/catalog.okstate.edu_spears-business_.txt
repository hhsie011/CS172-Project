Address and Phone Address: 370 Business Building, Stillwater, OK 74078 Phone: 405-744-5064 Website: business.okstate.edu The Spears School of Business focuses on preparing students to make a difference in the world by teaching essential interpersonal skills alongside a high-quality business education backed by impactful research and outreach. We live in a deeply interconnected world where business is personal while simultaneously more distant. In this world, companies rise and fall based on the strength and success of the relationships they forge. Spears Business prepares our students for this world by having them live and learn in an environment where personal connections are paramount and academic excellence is strengthened by interpersonal prowess. We take soft skills seriously. We study business collaboratively. We use technology to include and never to exclude. Community isn’t just a byproduct of what we do. At Spears, we empower students to follow their own dreams, not the dream we have for them--because the purpose of business isn’t just individual gain, but a gain for every individual. With an emphasis on people and community, we ensure our students are just as real as they are ready. In a rapidly changing world, the only constant is people. This is why students choose Spears, why employers choose our graduates and why we make business personal. Accreditation The Spears School of Business (business.okstate.edu) at Oklahoma State University is accredited by The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB International). High School Preparation Although a sound high school program is adequate preparation, prospective business students will benefit from a strong background in English and mathematics. Also, coursework in history and government, science, geography, computer science, foreign language and public speaking will be quite valuable. Scholarships Oklahoma State University has an extensive scholarship program which includes entering freshmen. For full consideration as a prospective student, applications should be sent to the OSU Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid by November 1 during one's senior year in high school. Spears School of Business scholarships are primarily designated for sophomores, juniors and seniors.

General Education Requirements The minimum general education requirements are summarized as follows: not less than 40 semester hours, including six hours of English composition and 31 hours in the breadth areas. These include: six hours in American history and government, three hours in social and behavioral sciences, six hours in humanities, three hours in analytical and quantitative thought and seven hours in the area of natural sciences, with one of the hours in scientific investigation. Students are required to take a "diversity" (D) designated course. This may be met in any part of the student’s program, and thus does not necessarily add to the number of hours required. Diversity courses provide an understanding of the cultural context of relationships, issues and trends in a multicultural and diverse society related to such factors as culture, ethnicity, nationality, age, gender, sexual orientation, mental and physical characteristics, education, family values, religious and spiritual values, socioeconomic status and unique characteristics of individuals, couples, families, ethnic groups and communities. An additional requirement is an "international dimension" (I). This also may be met in any part of the student's program, and thus does not necessarily add to the number of hours required. The international dimension simply requires each student to learn about cultures and societies outside the United States. The scientific investigation requirement involves some kind of laboratory experience with student involvement. More details concerning these and other requirements can be found in the next section, "Lower-division Requirements." Lower-Division Requirement Work in the freshman and sophomore years is planned in such a way as to give the student basic information in the general areas of the following: behavioral and social sciences, communications, humanities and fine arts, natural science and mathematics, and business foundation courses. The student may also select additional hours from courses in these areas, with the opportunity of achieving either further breadth or a certain degree of depth by concentrating these hours in a particular area of interest. As part of the student's general education, one course must be selected that is identified as satisfying the international dimension (I) requirement and one must be selected to satisfy the diversity (D) requirement. During the freshman and sophomore years, the student will complete courses in each of the following areas: Behavioral and social sciences: American history, three semester credit hours; American government, three hours; and three hours elected from courses identified by the University as satisfying social science (S) credit. MGMT 3013 and MKTG 3213, which are required courses for all business majors also carry a social science (S) designation. Humanities and fine arts: Six semester credit hours elected from courses identified by the University as satisfying humanities (H) credit. Natural science and mathematics: A minimum of 10-13 semester credit hours with the specific number of required hours in mathematics and natural science varying with the major chosen. Specific requirements for each major are published by the University in the book Undergraduate Programs and Requirements. Communications: English composition, six semester credit hours. For non-business students, the University prerequisite for upper-division courses applies. (See "Academic Regulations" in the Catalog.) General electives: In addition, the student may elect courses from any area except lower-division aerospace studies and military science and LEIS and HHP activity courses to complete degree requirements. Credits earned during the freshman and sophomore years at a two-year college may not be substituted for junior and senior course requirements in majors in the Spears School of Business.
