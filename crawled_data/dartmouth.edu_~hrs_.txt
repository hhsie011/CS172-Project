College Announces COVID-19 Vaccine Booster Requirement All Dartmouth College employees, whether working on-site or remotely, are required to be up to date with vaccination against COVID-19 (or to have received an approved exemption from vaccination through the Office of Institutional Diversity and Equity). Please visit the COVID-19 Employee Vaccination Policy for details. Compliance with this requirement is a condition of employment. Vaccine booster eligibility by vaccine is detailed on the CDC website. Employees who are not eligible for a booster vaccine by January 31, 2022 must receive a vaccine booster within 30 days of becoming eligible. New employees who fail to meet this condition of employment may result in Dartmouth in its sole discretion delaying or rescinding its offer of employment. Current employees who fail to meet this requirement within 30 days of their eligibility for a booster will be subject to corrective action up to and including termination of employment. If you need a booster vaccine, consider one of the clinics in the area: Same-day COVID-19 vaccine and booster appointments are typically available at Alice Peck Day Memorial Hospital in Lebanon. You can schedule an appointment for yourself through a myD-H account or call 603-442-5612. Search vaccines.gov, or call 1-800-232-0233 to find locations near you.
