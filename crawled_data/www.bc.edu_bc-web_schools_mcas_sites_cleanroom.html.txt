Buddy System BUDDY SYSTEM For safety reasons, we ask that users utilize the buddy system when working in the lab. When performing potentially hazardous/dangerous operations always make sure someone is in the laboratory with you. When a user is only in the lab observing—as part of the buddy system—that user will not be charged clean room usage fee. Cancellation Policy CANCELLATION POLICY The Integrated Sciences Cleanroom and Nanofabrication Facility has a 24-hour cancellation policy. Please notify the Manager at least 24 hours in advance if you can not honor your reservation. We realized that all projects require a certain process flow between tools, so one problem may throw off your entire schedule. Under these circumstances, the 24 hour cancellation policy would not apply.
