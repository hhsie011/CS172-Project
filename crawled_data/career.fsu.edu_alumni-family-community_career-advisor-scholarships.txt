These scholarships support career advisors working in The Career Center and recognizes students who have made a commitment to career counseling, have outstanding academic records and work histories, and have the potential to provide leadership in career development and human resources. The Career Center has awarded $233,396 in 147 scholarships to 95 different students since 1995. A gift to the endowed scholarship funds lives on. Only four percent of the interest earned from a gift is made available each year for scholarships; the remainder, along with the original gift, will contribute to another scholarship in the future. For an overview of career advisor funds, a list of scholarship recipients, and an update on past fellows, view Career Advisor Scholarship News below.
