Penn Clubs EventsFAQLogin Reach-A-Peer Helpline ProgrammingHealthCommunity ServicePeer EducationUndergraduateGraduateSAC Description RAP-Line is a peer helpline established by Penn students to provide peer support, information, and referrals. It is open to all students who wish to share a problem, are in need of information, or just want to talk to someone anonymously and confidentially. The service is run by trained student volunteers who have an awareness of campus resources and skills in active listening techniques. Volunteers acknowledge that they are not professional counselors, but rather peers who provide a warm, safe, unbiased, and supportive environment conducive to self-help. RAP-Line is a stepping-stone in serving the Penn community. The phone call is free, anonymous, and confidential. RAP-Line is not a crisis-intervention line. RAP-Line offers two services: 1. 24/7 Text Line Send a message to 215-515-7332 to connect anonymously with a RAP-Line peer supporter. 2. Phone Line The Line is available every night from 9 pm to 1 am. Reach us at 215-573-2727. Don't be shy! FAQ Most Recent Question: Hi!
