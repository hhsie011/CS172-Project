The document below provides a list of all of the ARA locations on all of the University of Cincinnati's campuses. An Area of Rescue Assistance (ARA) is an area in which a person may go to if assistance with evacuation from an area above or below ground level where the use of an elevator would be used under normal situations for evacuation. Assistance with evacuation may be needed on a permanent or temporary basis. These areas have two way communications with UC's Communication Center. The 911 operator will provide additional information to the occupants. Please familiarize yourself with your primary building's ARA and any additional buildings you may frequent.
