Dr. Pratt’s recent research projects center on meaningful work, ambivalence at work, organizational mourning (coping with losing one's organization), employee-customer identification, and how trust is created when there is very little "direct evidence" of performance. He is also interested in leadership, identity-based conflict, nonconscious processes in organizations, and intuition. Dr. Pratt’s work has appeared in various outlets, including the Academy of Management Annual Review, Academy of Management Journal, Academy of Management Review, Administrative Science Quarterly, Journal of Management Inquiry, Journal of Management Studies, Journal of Organizational Change Management, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, Journal of Organizational Behavior, Journal of Vocational Behavior, Management Learning, Organizational Research Methods, Organization Science, Qualitative Inquiry, Science, Small Group Research, Studies in Cultures, Organizations and Societies, and in numerous edited books. He also has co-edited the book, Artifacts and Organizations: Beyond Mere Symbolism (Lawrence Erlbaum Associates) and is the lead editor on forthcoming the Oxford Handbook of Organizational Identity (Oxford University Press). His expertise and research has appeared in the New York Times, Time Magazine, U.S. News & World Report, the Boston Globe and NPR. in the media Money Magazine Back To Top Back To Top 140 Commonwealth Avenue Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 Accessibility Emergency Contact Notice of Nondiscrimination Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Boston College
