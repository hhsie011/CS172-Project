Her research interest is the information seeking behavior of geologists when looking for physical sample materials. Physical samples cannot be completely digitized but often have digital materials associated with them. These hybrid collections have unique curation needs which may be better understood by investigating metadata creation and user access. Dr. Ramdeen holds a BS in Geology and a BA in Humanities from Florida State University (FSU). She also holds an MS in Library and Information Studies with a Certificate in Museum Studies from FSU. Before entering the PhD program at UNC-CH, she worked for the Florida Geological Survey in their core and cuttings repository processing samples for archival storage and later assisting with the development of a repository database. Dr. Ramdeen is a Data Curator for SESAR, the System for Earth Sample Registration. She is also part of the iSamples and Sampling Nature projects.
