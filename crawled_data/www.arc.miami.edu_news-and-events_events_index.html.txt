As millions of renters face down evictions and foreclosures in the midst of the COVID-19 recession, Andrew Ross reveals how ineffective government planning, property market speculation, and poverty wages have combined to create this catastrophe. Urgent and incisive, Sunbelt Blues offers original insight into what is quickly becoming a full-blown national emergency. Presentation will be held via Zoom; Meeting ID: 980 3862 9203 / Passcode 160511. *Book signing will take place immediately following event at the Thomas P. Murphy Design Studio Terrace.

January 26, 2022 | 6:00 pm Time | Space | Existence - Agency in Design Panel Discussion Presented by The European Cultural Centre (ECC), AIA Miami, MCAD and U-SoA The panel discussion, Agency in Design, fuses notions of vigilance, control, sociopolitical and environmental concerns through a conversation on spatial vernaculars and architectural typology’s role in their past and future manifestations. [spatial vernacular is a local expression of built forms that collectively define the physical conditions of an environment] Recent collaborations on MAS Context: Vigilantism and persistent dialogues on domesticity within each speaker’s work set the table for this group’s conversation. Moderated by Christopher Meyer, the panel will engage in an open and critical dialogue reaching across time, terrain, and race to interrogate the potentials of architectural education and practice. Confirmed panelists include Margi Nothard, Shawna Meyer, Germane Barnes, Shawhin Roudbari and moderated by Christopher Meyer. Via Zoom.

The series has featured guests from both the U-SoA faculty as well as presenters from the Univeristy of Miami’s other 11 schools and colleges, providing an opportunity to present works-in-progress in an informal setting that promotes discussion and the interchange of ideas. In light of the changes taking place in higher education as a result of the COVID 19 pandemic, this semester’s series will be devoted to the future of architectural education and the changing modes of practice in a post-pandemic world. To that end, the series engages leading academics, practitioners and thinkers from outside the School to share their recent experiences and ignite new ways of thinking for the future. 2020-21 lectures: February 12, 2021 Nader Tehrani - NADAAA February 19, 2021 Daniel Susskind 2019-20 lectures: October 2, 2019 Germane Barnes - Barnes Studio November 4, 2019 Joel Lamere - GLD Architecture November 20, 2019 Joanna Lombard 2018-19 lectures: October 1, 2018 Scott Merrill - Merrill Pastor & Colgan Architecture 2017-18 lectures: February 14, 2018 Tiago Torres-Campos - Landscape February 22, 2018 Antonio Martinez-Molina - Welsh School of Architecture March 5, 2018 Charlotte von Moos - Charlotte Von Moos + Florian Sauter March 9, 2018 Giancarlo Mangone - Symbiosis March 19, 2018 Justin Fowler - Princeton March 21, 2018 Amina Blacksher - Columbia March 23, 2018 Christopher Meyer - Pamphlet Architecture 36 March 26, 2018 Nicole McIntosh - Syracuse March 28, 2018 Joel Lamere - MIT March 30, 2018 Stefan Al - University of Pennsylvania 2016-17 lectures: October 2016 Benjamin Kirtman - UM Center for Computational Studies November 2016 Aziza Chaouni - University of Toronto - Aziza Chaouni Projects March 2017 Sanjeev Chatterjee - UM School of Communication Bradley Cantrell - Harvard GSD 2015-16 lectures: September 2015 Jeff Huber - Florida Atlantic University - Brooks + Scarpa October 2015 Eric Goldemberg - Florida International University - Monad Studio November 2015 Petra Liebl-Osborne - Artist February 2016 Landolf Rhode-Barbarigos - UM College of Engineering Alexander Josephson - Partisans March 2016 Nick Gelpi - Florida International University 2014-15 lectures: September 2014 Jose Gelabert-Navia - Perkins & Will October 2014 Jean François Lejeune - U-SoA November 2014 Jaime Correa - Jaime Correa & Associates - U-SoA December 2014 Katherine Wheeler - U-SoA Stefanie Block Reed - Art Basel MRED+U LECTURE SERIES (TUESDAY & FRIDAY SPEAKER SERIES U-SoA faculty and students are welcome to attend virtually.

[spatial vernacular is a local expression of built forms that collectively define the physical conditions of an environment] Recent collaborations on MAS Context: Vigilantism and persistent dialogues on domesticity within each speaker’s work set the table for this group’s conversation. Moderated by Christopher Meyer, the panel will engage in an open and critical dialogue reaching across time, terrain, and race to interrogate the potentials of architectural education and practice. Confirmed panelists include Margi Nothard, Shawna Meyer, Germane Barnes, Shawhin Roudbari and moderated by Christopher Meyer. Via Zoom.

January 21, 2022 | 4:00 pm Book Presentation by Andrew Ross Sunbelt Blues: The Failure of American Housing (Macmillan, 2021)* Through visceral, frontline reporting from the motels and encampments dotting central Florida, renowned social analyst Andrew Ross exposes the overlooked housing crisis sweeping America’s suburbs and rural areas, where residents suffer ongoing trauma, poverty, and nihilism. As millions of renters face down evictions and foreclosures in the midst of the COVID-19 recession, Andrew Ross reveals how ineffective government planning, property market speculation, and poverty wages have combined to create this catastrophe. Urgent and incisive, Sunbelt Blues offers original insight into what is quickly becoming a full-blown national emergency.
