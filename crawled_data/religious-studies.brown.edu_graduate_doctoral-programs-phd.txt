RAM now incorporates our prior Ph.D. programs in Early Christianity, and in Ancient Judaism, as well as various other ancient Mediterranean religions. All applications to study one or more religions of the Ancient Mediterranean should be made to RAM. Prospective applicants should also note that it is no longer possible to apply for the track in Religion, Comparison and Culture. Students interested in comparative work across two or more areas (ART, ISC, RCT, and RAM) should consult with the Director of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Advisor for these areas before submitting an application. Asian Religious Traditions (ART) ART offers training in Asian religions in their historical, intellectual, and cultural contexts. Islam, Society and Culture (ISC) This field is devoted, but not limited, to the study of Islamic beliefs and practices within the cultural and historical context of the Middle East and South and Central Asia. Religion and Critical Thought (RCT) RCT students in this program focus on issues, problems, and texts concerning: philosophy and religion, religious ethics (that is, the interrelation among religion, ethics, and politics), and the theory of religion. Religions of the Ancient Mediterranean (RAM) RAM students focus on the interdisciplinary study of religion throughout the ancient Mediterranean and Near-East. Contact Prospective applicants are welcome to direct inquiries to Prof. Stephen Bush (Stephen_Bush@brown.edu) and/or any faculty member in the listed areas.
