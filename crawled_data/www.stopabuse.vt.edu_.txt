Learn more Community Highlight: "I Ask" for Consent To commemorate sexual assault awareness month in April 2020, Diversity Scholar and Student Title IX Advisory Board Member, Venice Adams '21, planned and organized the "I Ask" proclamation signing event. The "I Ask" campaign raises public awareness and champions the message that asking for consent is a healthy, normal, and necessary part of everyday interactions. After postponing her plans due to COVID-19 Venice worked this year to complete her campaign virtually, gathering signatures on line, and then displaying a banner of the procolmation signde by Hokies in Squires Student Center. We're grateful to Venice for her work to help make Virginia Tech a safer place!
