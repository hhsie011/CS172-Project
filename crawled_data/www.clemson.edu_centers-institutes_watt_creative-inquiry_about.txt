Team-based investigations are led by faculty mentors and typically span a year or more. Students take on problems that spring from their own curiosity, from a professor’s challenge or from the pressing needs of the world around them. These invaluable experiences produce exceptional graduates. Since its start in 2005, Creative Inquiry has supported more than 33,400 student experiences in more than 1,000 research projects. Each semester, more than 2,800 undergraduate students investigate topics ranging from children’s literacy to medical devices for developing countries to designing the next generation of solar cells. Creative Inquiry projects, many of which are multidisciplinary, can be found in all disciplines. Students in each project collaborate with their peers to utilize each team member’s expertise to accomplish project goals. See the current projects page for more info.
