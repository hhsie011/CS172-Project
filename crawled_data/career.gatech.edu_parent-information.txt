While our focus is on the Georgia Tech students that we serve, we value our relationship with parents (or grandparents, guardians, and other family). We know that you are often the ones funding this expensive endeavor of higher education, and you are the ones who raised your daughters and sons to be the fine young adults we are privileged to work with! So, we are always happy to help you understand what we do, how we do it, and what our outcomes data shows of our successes – or the inevitable areas where we strive to improve. (Do keep in mind that we usually cannot share much information specifically about your student due to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act [FERPA] regulations.) Georgia Tech has one of the highest rankings in the U.S. for return on investment from a college education. At the career center, we contribute to that positive ROI by not only helping your students get work after graduation (or acceptance to professional or graduate school, or awarding of a prestigious fellowship) but also by helping them learn how work works. Careers these days are complicated, and it’s not enough to learn how to interview to get a great job or to do all the right things to get into grad school. Students need to develop career readiness competencies so that they can hit the ground running in the workplace and can effectively manage the twists and turns of their careers over the lifespan. We encourage you to explore this site to learn more about how we help students make career choices that fit them well, get valuable – and often lucrative – experience through internships and co-ops, explore professional options through information sessions and shadowing, land jobs at graduation, and become equipped to navigate the workplace and a career. Please read our mission and vision statements to understand what drives us, and see us through your student's eyes by browsing the Undergraduate or Graduate Student pages. We want only the best for your student – career success and happiness – and that’s what drives our career center team in every single day. Thank you for your interest in our department.
