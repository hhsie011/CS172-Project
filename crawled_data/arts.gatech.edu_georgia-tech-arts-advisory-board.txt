Board members engage in strategic conversations regarding arts culture and policies on campus; they champion programs that increase exposure to and practice of the arts within the Georgia Tech community; and they advocate on behalf of the arts as points of engagement and collaboration among students, faculty, administration, community members, and professional artists to enhance the educational experience. The Board promotes arts-relevant research developed at Georgia Tech to the local, national, and international communities.
