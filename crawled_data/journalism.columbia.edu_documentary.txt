Jump to: Overview Classes Student Work Faculty Overview The Journalism School is deeply engaged with the burgeoning world of journalistic documentaries. The faculty of working filmmakers trains students to report and produce short and long-form documentaries. The entire school community has the opportunity to encounter some of the most acclaimed documentarians of the day with the Film Fridays series, which brings first‐run films and their directors to the Journalism School to screen and discuss their latest work. Recent visitors include Alex Gibney, Kirsten Johnson, Matthew Heinemann, Betsy West & Julie Cohen, and Josh Oppenheimer. You can listen to some of these conversations on the On Assignment podcast. During the spring semester, students in the regular M.S. Program have several choices to explore longer-form video including Video for the Web, Multimedia, and our new Data and Animation course. Cinematographer, Duy Linh Tu regularly partners with professors in a subject area like science and education. For students who want further immersion and a chance to produce a longer documentary, the school offers a Documentary Program concentration. Students stay a third semester, and work over the summer in teams of two to report, shoot and edit a 20-30 minute film. Projects from recent Documentary classes have screened at festivals across the country, including Tribeca and DOC NYC, and have been licensed by distributors like Netflix, The New York Times video, PBS and Fusion. Student documentaries are featured a DocFest, an all‐school screening event in December. Explore degree programs.

Documentary Specialization Seminar Professor: June Cross Thor Neureiter Nina Berman Judith Helfand Documentary Specialization Seminar June Cross Thor Neureiter Nina Berman Judith Helfand This seminar has two primary objectives: to acquaint you with the aesthetics, ethics and traditions of documentaries, and to prepare you to make your own short, nonfiction film. To accomplish this, we will be studying, watching and dissecting lots of docs. And you will undertake a series of exercises and workshops on shooting, organizing, editing, budgeting, archive use and outreach. Open only to students in the M.S. Documentary Program. Video 1/Web & Documentary Video 1/Web & Documentary This class is for students interested in producing short-form videos, of the type that appear on web sites such as Vice.com or NYTimes.com. In this course, you’ll learn the basics of video journalism: gathering sound and picture simultaneously; the fundamentals of exposure and composition; the grammar of video, writing to picture, selecting sound bites, the basic concepts of non-linear editing. By the end of the course, you should have a foundational understanding of the basic skills involved in video storytelling and the ability to produce short-form video pieces. Video 2 Professor: Betsy West Video 2 Betsy West If you already have a solid foundation in video, you may request admission to this module, which will give you the chance to develop a more sophisticated understanding of, and approach to, the medium. We’ll delve into the elements necessary for producing compelling stories; teach you how to light and shoot sequences and well-framed interviews; discuss the practical ethical and legal considerations of working in video; and help you develop rapport with subjects. You may request this module during balloting, but when you get to campus, you’ll be required to demonstrate the ability to shoot video interviews and action scenes; identify and use sound bites; and edit a short story using pictures and sound. Those not qualified will be placed in Video 1. For more information, contact Prof. Betsy West.
