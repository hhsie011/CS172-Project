How I've Changed I caught my breath here. I have learned how to ebb and flow with great seers, makers, mages, and sages. I clarified my intentions here. I cleared up some ignorance and gained the capacity to be with uncertainty and more of the mystery. I became more responsible and more willing to be responsible for my contribution to the noise. I took important steps to address my perpetuation of inherited trauma and I broke through some critical generational ceilings here. The program itself was a gift and the monastic way of life I embraced due to the quarantine also yielded gifts. Message of Thanks These are the kind spirits that held space for me in this part of my journey; thank you for helping me with my process: Malta, Ludo, Piale, Rosalyn D. and Frankey H., Danielle H., Andrea K., Katie Mae H., Siobhan F., Michael H., Ayauna M., Phira B., and Chanelle G. These are the rockstars I came to Harvard to witness and be witnessed by: Cody H., Jess Y., Natalia S., Mary P., Lindsay S., Malini S., Amy M., Katie D., Rebecca M. N., Keerthi R., Maisie L., Amy G., Aliyah C., and my entire senior seminar cohort. Your clarity helped me become more clear, John O. and Thomas M. These instructors participated with my questions; I walked away feeling deeply heard and ready to shift to the next curiosity: Ntuli Akyampeong, Phiwokuhle Mnyandu, Leslie McPherson, Georgette Ledgister, David Holland, Teren Sevea, Jean Comaroff, Janet Gyatso, Naya Jones, Leida Tolentino, and Joh Camara. What I Hope to Be Remembered By Not remembered by, but remember to: I want my classmates to remember to contact me if I pop up meaningfully in their processing or in their dreams. I want to be remembered in a way that leads those whom I've interacted with to be prepared for and excited to receive a DM or email from me, out of the blue, passionately seeking to make meaning from an excerpt of a class text or a shared moment. Future Plans I will continue investigating how to be a good guest on lands that have been taken without consent and how to be a better neighbor to the different categories of animals I encounter and whose lives better mine.
