Each year, a GEI cohort of up to 12 faculty and/or staff members is selected to participate in a variety of activities focusing on a world region or topical orientation. (Call for Proposals) 2021/22 Call for Proposals For the 2021-2022 academic year, the emphasis will be on developing academic and research collaboration through the Global Learning for All initiative. This initiative expands upon existing high impact opportunities such as study abroad, international student mobility, and traditional student/faculty mobility to include a wider variety of program models, primarily by providing many more online or virtual global learning options, as well as campus-based curricular and co-curricular global activities. Participants can choose between two tracks: The development of an expertise in Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL) connections that create virtual, interactive educational opportunities for faculty and students through shared experiences across international borders. The Institute will utilize NC State’s membership in the SUNY COIL network to provide expert workshops with the expectation that participants in this track will develop their own COIL experience for the 2022-23 academic year. Building on our global partnerships and curricular and co-curricular initiatives already underway at NC State on the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), this track will identify ways these initiatives, such as the two year SDG campus programming initiative, SDG course inventory and Academics Working Group in the Sustainability office can more effectively engage students, faculty, staff, and the wider community in these activities. Institute activities will include both in-person and virtual workshops, seminars, and expert consultation with local and global partners. It will culminate with a trip to a peer institution in the US to study best practices and share the NC State experience. We envision this to be a sustainable endeavor that will enable the participants to build active collaborations and develop leadership to support global engagement at NC State. Eligibility Full-time permanent NC State faculty (all tracks) or EHRA professional staff are eligible for nomination to the Global Engagement Institute.
