Students will have their own private bedroom and bathroom within the suite. Private bedrooms include: UK small double bed with pillow and duvet Desk/workspace with bulletin board Clothing storage space/wardrobe AMENITIES: All students will have access to common rooms that include a pool table, games, PlayStation area, and room for tv watching and events. They'll also have a gym with high-quality equipment like treadmills, cross-trainers, rowing machines, and free weights. Laundry facilities are also available within the building. STUDY AREAS: Most importantly, there is a large, quiet study area for students to catch up on homework in a productive working environment with fast WiFi throughout the building. SUPPORT: Baylor's partner in Dublin, FIE: Foundation for International Education is officed on the ground floor of the student residence and open business hours Monday - Friday for support and questions. FIE Student Life Assistants also live within the residence halls and provide 24/7 support for any of your needs, including medical emergencies. ROOMMATES: Because all apartments have private bedrooms and bathrooms, you will not have a "roommate". You will have 2-4 suitemates who share a common living and dining room. If interested in having a specific suitemate, you can request this via a form after acceptance. Otherwise, Baylor will "match" you with your suitemates. All apartments are single-gender. HOUSING PROCESS FOR DUBLIN & WACO: If you are committed to starting abroad in Dublin, you do not need to submit a Waco housing application prior to enrolling. Instead, you will have the opportunity to request Dublin suitemates via an online form (if interested). During your Dublin Fall semester, a Baylor housing coordinator will meet with you to select your new Waco Spring housing. We highly recommend Baylor & Beyond LLC. We guarantee you will get a room in a freshman community of your preference. We will do our best to accommodate roommate requests as well. If you are still trying to decide between Dublin or Waco, you should submit a Waco housing application for the academic year to ensure you have housing. If you committed to starting abroad and you already submitted a housing application, your original Waco housing application will be canceled and you will have the opportunity to request Dublin suitemates via an online form (if interested). During your Dublin Fall semester, a Baylor housing coordinator will meet with you to select your new Waco Spring housing. We guarantee you will get a room in a freshman community of your preference. We will do our best to accommodate roommate requests as well. Still, have questions?
