Wang; Assistants in Medicine: Bradley, Connolly, Wu; Associates in Research: Foster, Vied, Y. Yang; Senior Research Associate: Didier, Mercer Degrees Offered The Department of Biomedical Sciences offers programs leading to the Bachelor of Science (BS) in Interdisciplinary Medical Sciences and the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Biomedical Sciences. The Interdisciplinary Medical Sciences (IMS) Bachelor of Science degree program is designed to prepare students for work in healthcare. Departments in seven Colleges at FSU have partnered to provide the curriculum for the program: College of Arts and Sciences, College of Communication and Information, College of Health and Human Sciences, College of Medicine, College of Nursing, College of Social Sciences and Public Policy, and the College of Social Work. The IMS degree is based on competencies thought to be fundamental for careers in the health professions. These competencies include communication skills, use and knowledge of technology, awareness and respect for the roles of members of the health care team, ability to navigate in the health care system, scientific knowledge, life-long learning skills, and critical thinking skills. The Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Biomedical Sciences at the Florida State University College of Medicine is designed to train modern biomedical scientists who use genomics, proteomics, bioinformatics, and other contemporary approaches to address questions of developmental, cell, and molecular biology related to human health. The program is appropriate for students with majors in biochemistry, biology, or other health-related fields. Three broad areas of research are emphasized: development, neuroscience, and the molecular basis of human disease. Research rotations during the first year allow students to make an informed choice regarding the research area and major professor with whom they will conduct their PhD work. A core curriculum of the fundamentals, the choice of electives from other departments, and intellectual interaction with faculty and postdoctoral fellows encourage graduate students to mature into independent scientists. Computer Skills Competency All undergraduates at Florida State University must demonstrate basic computer skills competency prior to graduation. As necessary computer competency skills vary from discipline to discipline, each major determines the courses needed to satisfy this requirement. This requirement is satisfied through BSC 2010L Biological Sciences I Lab course. Oral Communication Competency Students must demonstrate the ability to orally transmit ideas and information clearly. This requirement may be met with an approved college-level course. State of Florida Common Program Prerequisites The state of Florida has identified common program prerequisites for this University degree program. Specific prerequisites are required for admission into the upper-division program and must be completed by the student at either a community college or a state university prior to being admitted to this program. Students may be admitted into the University without completing the prerequisites, but may not be admitted into the program. At the time this document was published, some common program prerequisites were being reviewed by the state of Florida and may have been revised. Please visit https://dlss.flvc.org/admin-tools/common-prerequisites-manuals for a current list of state-approved prerequisites. The following lists the common program perquisites or their substitutions, necessary for admission into this upper-division degree program: BSC X010C or BSC X007/X007L or BSC X005/X005L CHM X045, X045L General Chemistry I and Lab or equivalence CHM X046, X046L General Chemistry II and Lab or equivalence PSY X012 MAC X114 ENC X101 Interdisciplinary Medical Sciences (BS) The Interdisciplinary Medical Sciences (IMS) Bachelor of Science degree program is designed to provide a broad background to develop scientific and psychosocial knowledge, and an understanding of the healthcare team and the healthcare system. So that students may pursue their specialized and professional interests, three (3) interdisciplinary majors are offered: Clinical Professions; Community Patient Care; and Health Management, Policy and Information. The IMS degree program’s rigorous science core curriculum, individualized advising, experiential service learning, and developmental seminar and capstone course sequence enable students to reach their potential academically and personally, determine a career path best suited for them, and develop the skills, attitudes, and acumen to attain their career goals. The program includes three to four 1-credit hour experiential seminar courses that engage students with the challenges of healthcare in community, clinical, political, and research venues. The medical sciences seminar sequence leads to a senior capstone course which requires the submission of a scholarly report and oral presentation describing the student’s academic inquiry into a current health issues of interest. The capstone course meets the Scholarship in Practice and Upper Division Writing liberal studies requirements. Resources are available to help students locate opportunities in clinics, community service organizations, hospitals, pharmacies, and physician offices for students to engage in the various ways healthcare is accessed. Students are required to obtain a minimum of 64 hours of experiential learning hours each academic year for a total of 256 experiential learning hours before graduation. These hours must be approved by the Community Coordinator in advance. Although housed in the College of Medicine, the curriculum is delivered by seven (7) colleges at FSU. In addition to the College of Medicine, the College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Communication and Information, the College of Health and Human Sciences, the College of Nursing, the College of Social Sciences and Public Policy, and the College of Social Work are IMS degree program partners. Curriculum guides stating specific degree requirements for the undergraduate majors are available through the Office of Undergraduate Programs and through our Website: https://med.fsu.edu/imsDegree/home. Minor Requirements Students majoring in any of the IMS majors are not required to complete a minor for their IMS degree. The FSU Registrar does not recognize, certify, or document minors in any way on a transcript. Therefore, the IMS degree program will not certify, document, or clear minors for students. The IMS program does not offer any minors. Honors in the Major Because healthcare is a broad field of study and practice and the IMS degree spans seven colleges and numerous departments, an Honors in the Major thesis can be completed in a variety of disciplines. The Honors in the Majors topics must be health related and approved by the IMS Honors Director for the College of Medicine. The Thesis Director for Honors in the Major must be full-time tenured or tenure-track FSU faculty member appointed in one of the FSU colleges approved for the IMS majors and meet the Thesis Director requirements of the University Honors Program. Honors in the Major requires junior standing, a 3.2 GPA on at least 15 semester hours at FSU and all transfer work, and completion and defense of an honors thesis for 6 hours credit under the direction of a faculty committee. To graduate with honors is a worthwhile distinction. For more information, contact the IMS Honors Liaison, Dr. Elizabeth Foster, or the Honors Program office at (850) 644-1841.
