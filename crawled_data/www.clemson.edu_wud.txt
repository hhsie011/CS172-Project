WU+D forges new markets and grows South Carolina’s $21 billion forest products industry by: Drawing new business and industry to South Carolina; Providing education and training, research and development, and direct marketing of wood-based technical solutions; Developing forest management protocols to grow trees with higher quality fiber; Engineering groundbreaking manufacturing and construction processes for wood-based products, resins, adhesives, and fasteners. WU+D also enhances the educational and career opportunities of Clemson students by: Preparing the next generation of architects, engineers, foresters, and material and wood scientists; Creating an experiential learning environment where students test products they have developed through installation in prototype buildings; Attracting undergraduate Creative Inquiry teams to engineer innovative wood products that meet the needs of the building construction industry; Fostering collaborative research connecting Clemson’s main campus with its statewide research and public service centers.
