5:00 PM Room 603, Hamilton Hall, Columbia University, 116th Street, New York, NY 10018 On April 20, David Zhu CC '12, Founder & CEO of WonderCV, will be sharing his career experiences over the past six years, including his exploration of popular career choices such as banking, consulting, venture capital and private equity, as well as the much-debated geographic choice of living between New York, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Beijing. David spent thousands of hours to prep for a career development in finance, only to give it all up and dive into the world of technologies. He went on to learn coding and has dedicated to solving the most inefficient system he has yet to witness: career development. The event is co-hosted by Columbia Global Centers | Beijing and Global China Connection–Columbia University, and is supported by Columbia University Chinese Students and Scholars Association. We welcome all Columbians and friends to this event to ask questions and build connections.

David is also a founding partner at Younker Capital, where he led the investment in Kuanter.com, an auto service O2O company backed by Tencent and Yiche.com. David is a founding trustee of Global China Connection, a non-profit organization founded at Columbia in 2008, connecting 60+ universities worldwide to opportunities in China.
