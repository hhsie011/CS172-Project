SI is a voluntary program that offers free, regularly scheduled study sessions for traditionally difficult courses. SI sessions are led by current ISU undergraduate students who have successfully completed the course. We support more than 30 courses in these subject areas: Accounting Animal Science Biology Chemistry Engineering Math Physics Statistics, and more Meet our Team Information for faculty and departments Remote video URL Proven to Work Our methods of collaborative study sessions have shown an average of over one-half letter grade improvement amongst students who regularly attend SI sessions. Students who participate in SI: Learn how to learn while learning what to learn. Work collaboratively with peer students in a facilitated environment. Receive support from a trained, educated SI Leader. Our data suggests that the more often students attend, the higher their final grades will be in the course. We recommend attending SI at least once per week. Become an SI Leader Becoming an SI Leader is an excellent opportunity to gain valuable leadership skills and help support your peers.
