The IRB 101 tutorial covers the basics of human subjects research and provides important practical information about navigating the IRB process at UW. The tutorial takes approximately 60 minutes to complete. HSD staff may begin application review before the training is completed, but the student or resident PI must provide verification that the training has been completed before an IRB application can be approved or given an exempt determination. How to Provide Training Documentation After completing the IRB 101 tutorial, you have the option to print a course certificate. You must save a copy of the completion certificate. The tutorial does not automatically provide HSD with records of course completion. The course certificate must be uploaded as a supporting document in your Zipline IRB application. HSD staff will verify that the certificate has been provided before the IRB application receives an exempt determination or IRB approval.

Student and resident researchers are typically the most inexperienced with conducting human subjects research and the least likely to be required to take human subjects training because of an external funding requirement. Adding an institutional requirement to complete the IRB 101 tutorial covers an important gap by providing IRB training to novice researchers who are not otherwise required to receive training on conducting human subjects research. What do I need to complete the tutorial? To complete the tutorial, you need a UW NetID and password, an Internet connection and internet enabled device (a computer works best), and the ability to save a document and upload it to Zipline (the electronic IRB system). Do I need to complete the tutorial in one session? We recommend that you complete the tutorial in one session. However, if you need to pause and come back to the tutorial, you have the option to restart or resume. If you select resume, the tutorial will load the last slide that you viewed. Does IRB 101 meet the human subjects training requirement for NIH and other funding organizations? No. The UW IRB 101 requirement for students and residents is separate from the human subjects training requirement for NIH and other funding organizations. If the student or resident researcher is required to meet the human subjects requirement for NIH or another funding agency, they must also complete take the human subjects training available through the CITI Program.
