It is capable of an ultimate point-to-point resolution of 0.19 nm, with the ability to image lattice fringes at 0.14 nm resolution. It is a multipurpose ultrahigh resolution analytical electron microscope with a wide range of capabilities such as high-resolution image observation, nanoarea X-ray analysis, versatile analysis by convergent-beam electron diffraction, and analysis of the atomic structure and/or bonding state of atoms. With the addition of Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) and Parallel electron energy loss spectrometer (PEELS), the field-emission TEM can also be used as an elemental analysis tool, capable of identifying the elements in areas less than 2 nm in diameter. 200 kV, Schottky Field Emission Gun Ultra High Resolution Pole Piece (Cs=0.5 mm) 0.19 nm Point-to-Point Resolution Minimum Beam Size: 0.5 nm JEOL Single Tilt Low Background Holder JEOL Double Tilt Low Background Holder Double Tilt Heating Holder (Maximum Temperature: 1000ºC) Specimen Tilt Angle (X axis): ±20º High Resolution Imaging Convergent Beam Electron Diffraction (CBED) Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis (EDS) Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) Standard Operating Procedure for the JEOL 2010F TEM TEM Facility User Rates (Per Hour) External Commercial (profit) External Academic (non-profit) Internal Facility Operator Self Operator Facility Operator Self Operator Facility Operator Self Operator TEM $250 $150 $160 $60 $140 $40 The microscope is located in Higgins 030.
