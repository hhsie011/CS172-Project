The Neiman Center provides students, as well as established artists, a rich environment in which to investigate and produce images through a myriad of printmaking techniques including intaglio, lithography, screenprint, relief, photography, and digital imaging. In our academic programming, we encourage undergraduate and graduate students to explore various printmaking media through a wide array of classes, fellowships, and studio work. In addition to strong technical instruction, we also support the students in creating work that challenges the established conventions of printmaking, moving print into new and innovative territory. Through our fellowship program, students have the opportunity to gain first-hand experience in a professional printshop by assisting the master printer and visiting artist with the production of an editioned print. The LeRoy Neiman Gallery hosts a variety of exhibitions throughout the year, showcasing the work of invited artists, Visual Arts faculty, undergraduate and graduate students and work produced in the professional printshop. The exhibits give students’ work public exposure in a professional setting and bring outside voices to the Neiman Center, creating a rich environment of display and dialogue. As part of its goal to bring a professional element to Columbia's printmaking community, the Neiman Center invites artists to produce editioned prints in the professional printshop. We assist emerging artists who have not yet had a chance to investigate the print medium. We also collaborate with mid-career artists who have specific projects that match our capabilities and are invited to make prints which they would otherwise not be able to produce in a commercial shop. Finally, we invite established artists who are interested in exploring new and exciting directions for their work in a less commercial environment. The projects produced by artists in collaboration with the Neiman Center provide financial support for the Center's mission. These funds specifically sustain future artist and student collaborations, exhibitions, equipment upgrades, and fellowships.
