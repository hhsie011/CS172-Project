His clinical and academic focus is on substance use disorders, harm reduction, and populations experiencing homelessness, and he is faculty at both the University of Alberta and the University of Calgary. In Canada, he co-chaired several provincial and National committees around social inequity and has developed both national guidelines and national programs to serve those who are most vulnerable. He came to Harvard Chan for a Master’s in Public Health so he can develop research, policy, and other skills to better serve his populations. He was particularly involved in the creation of isolation sites for those experiencing homelessness during the COVID-19 pandemic in Alberta and was able to directly apply much of the knowledge he obtained during his degree in real-time to the shifting situations he encountered.
