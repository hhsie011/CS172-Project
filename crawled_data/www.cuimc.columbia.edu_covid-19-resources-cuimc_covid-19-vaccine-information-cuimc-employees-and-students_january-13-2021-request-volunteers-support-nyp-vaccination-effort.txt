NYP is now facing the daunting task of vaccinating hundreds of thousands of patients while also dealing with the continued increase in COVID patients. NYP has asked Columbia to provide additional clinical and non-clinical staff to help with vaccine administration. Potential assignments include vaccine administration (clinical personnel), and directing and registering patients. Time commitment required will be a minimum of four eight hour shifts (6 AM-2 PM or 2 PM- 10 PM) over the next several months. At this time the volunteer location will be the Armory at the Medical Center (168th Street) however additional locations may be added in the future. Since volunteers will be in direct contact with patients, they will be considered in category 1A for vaccination purposes. If you are interested in supporting this effort, please go to: https://events.columbia.edu/go/VolunteerNYP and provide the information requested. Please note that we will do our best to match to volunteers to assignments, and you will be contacted directly with more information including specific shifts and training details. Thank you for your support in this critical effort to protect our community.
