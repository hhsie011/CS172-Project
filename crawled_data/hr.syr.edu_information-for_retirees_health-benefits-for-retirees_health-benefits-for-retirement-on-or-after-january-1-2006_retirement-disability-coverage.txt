The University has made the following post-65 retiree health plan provisions available to pre-65, Medicare-eligible retirees and dependents to allow them the flexibility to move into a plan with no prescription coverage, but lower premiums, according to the following guidelines: A member (either retiree or dependent), if eligible for and participating in Medicare before age 65 due to Social Security Disability, may elect the post-65 retiree health plan provisions. If elected, the lower post-65 monthly rates would apply for continuing medical-only coverage through a University plan (SUBlue, SUOrange or SUPro). For eligible members who elect this provision, prescription drugs are not covered. Members are encouraged to purchase prescription drug coverage through a Medicare Part D plan. If a member takes advantage of this provision, other covered members of the family who are not eligible for Medicare would remain covered under the pre-65 retiree health plan and keep prescription drug coverage. Reminder: retired members or their dependents who become Medicare-eligible are required to immediately enroll in Medicare Part A and Part B coverage. Medicare will be the primary payer, and the University plan will pay secondary. Claims are submitted to Medicare by the provider and are automatically forwarded to Excellus BlueCross BlueShield (BCBS) for processing of the University benefit after Medicare payment has been applied. Contact Lifetime Benefit Solutions directly at 800.493.0318 (TTY: 800.662.1220) if you would like to explore this option. The benefits listed above apply as indicated to retired and emeritus faculty and retired staff members of Syracuse University. All benefits programs are subject to change. If any discrepancies exist between program-related communications and the Plan Document, the terms and conditions detailed in the Plan Document will control.
