To ensure students are prepared for medical situations that could create barriers to their learning, Syracuse University requires full-time, matriculated students to carry qualifying health insurance coverage. Through the Syracuse University Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP), eligible students have access to comprehensive health care coverage. Graduate Assistants (GAs), including Research Assistants, Teaching Assistants, and Administrative Assistants, may enroll in the Student Health Insurance Plan administered by Aetna. For information about the Student Health Insurance Plan, the University’s requirement for all full-time matriculated students to demonstrate that they have qualifying coverage, and the waiver process, review healthinsurance.syr.edu or contact the Student Health Insurance Office at 315.443.9019 or healthinsurance@syr.edu.
