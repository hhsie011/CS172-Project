How I've Changed HDS made me a more capacious thinker, a more effective communicator, and a more compassionate presence to those I serve. Memorable Moment My most memorable moment at HDS was delivering my research as part of the annual Stendahl Symposium. It was an honor to share my work and ideas with so many wonderful scholars, colleagues, and friends. Favorite Class or Professor Cornel West taught me to allow suffering to speak and to find joy in the struggle. Stephanie Paulsell taught me that the study of religion is fundamentally a study of our own humanity. Diane Moore taught me that complexity is the beginning of justice and peace. Francis Clooney taught me the challenges and fruits of dialogical encounter. Each class I took at HDS left an indelible mark on my own intellectual and spiritual journey. Thank you to all who taught me with patience and attention. Message of Thanks Above all, I'd like to thank my family for supporting me through challenges and adversity. I also owe a deep debt of gratitude to all those mentors and friends who supported, challenged, and counseled me throughout my time at HDS, especially Zachary Davis, Rev. Robin Lutjohann, Fr. Francis Clooney, Fr. Laurence Freeman, Will Guild, Tom Maridada, Anna Mudd, Christy Waybright, Noahito Miura, and many others. Thank you also to my classmates and colleagues with whom I built a rich intellectual environment in which all could flourish. Future Plans I will be moving to France to live and work at the Abbaye de Bonnevaux, the international home of the World Community for Christian Meditation. The community of Bonnevaux is dedicated to the practice of meditation and lives in the spirit of the Rule of St. Benedict. I am thrilled to be able to continue to work towards fostering our human capacities for contemplation, transformation, and transcendence.
