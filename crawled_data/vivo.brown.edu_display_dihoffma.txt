She received her B.S. in Optics Engineering from the University of Rochester, her Ph.D. in Medical Science from Brown University, and her postdoctoral training from M.I.T., Harvard, and the Bunting Institute. Professor Hoffman-Kim teaches courses in tissue engineering and biomedical engineering. The goal of Professor Hoffman-Kim's research is to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie axon guidance, both during the formation of the precise connections of the nervous system and during the regrowth of axons after injury. Her long-term objective is to apply this knowledge to the development of biomaterials and tissue engineered nerve substitutes for nerve regeneration.

Background Education and Training Year Degree Institution 1993 PhD Brown University 1988 BS University of Rochester Affiliations Visualize it Collaborators Name Title Franck, Christian Associate Professor of Engineering Mathiowitz, Edith Professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Professor of Engineering Teaching Teaching Overview Professor Hoffman-Kim teaches courses in the general field of biomedical engineering, including an upper-level undergraduate course, Tissue Engineering. Tissue engineering is an interdisciplinary field that incorporates progress in biology, materials science, and engineering, to work toward the goal of replacing or regenerating compromised tissue function. Using an integrative approach, BI0L 1140 examines tissue design and development, manipulation of the tissue microenvironment, and current strategies to reconstitute injured tissues. Ethical, legal, and regulatory issues that accompany current and emerging technologies are also discussed. In her courses, Professor Hoffman-Kim also focuses on helping students develop the ability to explain scientific concepts to audiences with diverse backgrounds, a skill that is increasingly crucial in today's expanding and changing society. Facility at explanation is of particular importance in the fields of biotechnology and biomedical engineering, whose most exciting work is of great interest to the public, and often requires the participation of multiple diverse research groups to accomplish successful results. The goal is to improve oral communication skills of students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, with a particular focus on translating information across disciplines -- between biologists and engineers, and from scientists to non-scientists.
