Previous familiarity with the literature in the field is helpful, but a comprehensive and targeted review of the most relevant publications and information is usually necessary. All information from reliable sources should be considered, whether it is found in peer-reviewed scientific journal articles, presented at scientific conferences, or otherwise made available through such mechanisms as websites, databases or personal communications. Roles The Principal Investigator (PI), is responsible for determining the definitive research question or hypothesis, based on a comprehensive literature search. Co-Investigators may participate in the literature search, according to their proposed roles in the research project. Plan/Act Conduct a comprehensive review of the literature in the relevant and associated fields of study in preparation for formulating a preliminary research question or hypothesis. Conduct an in-depth review of the literature most relevant to the preliminary research question or hypothesis to refine the research question or hypothesis. Repeat this process, resulting in the statement of a definitive research question or hypothesis. Consult the literature periodically to ensure that all relevant new information is available to the research project.
