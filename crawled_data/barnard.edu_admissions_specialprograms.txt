Academic support programs such as the Arthur O. Eve Higher Education Opportunity Programs (HEOP), Collegiate Science and Technology Entry Program (CSTEP), and Science Pathways Scholars Program (SP²) offer students from underrepresented backgrounds academic, financial, and peer support throughout their four years. The Scholars of Distinction program provides a unique four-year scholarly experience for high-achieving students in a cohort with other outstanding students. Finally, the Music Lesson Exchange Program with The Juilliard School or the Manhattan School of Music offers the highly talented music student the opportunity to receive lessons from a Juilliard or MSM master teacher while studying at Barnard. Higher Education Opportunity Programs (HEOP) The New York State-funded Arthur O. Eve Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP) provides access to a Barnard education for high-achieving students from economically under-resourced backgrounds. Students admitted to the HEOP exhibit the spirit, drive, curiosity, and motivation that is characteristic of Barnard students. Our scholars also achieve academically, despite a lack of financial and academic resources. The HEOP Scholars Program was established at Barnard in 1970 and is funded in partnership with New York State. Students must be residents of New York State in order to apply for the program. Our scholars are part of a small community with extra mentorship and support to persist through the challenging and exciting transition to college, four years of growth at Barnard, and post-graduation years. For more information about eligibility and program details, please visit the HEOP website. If you have questions regarding HEOP's application requirements or process, please contact Virginia Hart, Senior Admissions Officer, at vhart@barnard.edu. Collegiate Science and Technology Entry Program (CSTEP) The Collegiate Science and Technology Entry Program (CSTEP) at Barnard College provides services that increase recruitment, retention, and placement of eligible students in CSTEP-targeted fields and the licensed professions. The program provides opportunities for historically underrepresented (Black/African-American, Latinx, Native American, or Alaskan Native) or financially under-resourced Barnard students who are New York State residents and intend to pursue or show ability in the STEM fields, health-related fields, and/or the licensed professions. CSTEP is a New York State-funded program first introduced in 1986. Barnard College began its program in 2006 and is sponsored by both the New York State Education department and Barnard College. In addition to academic counseling and tutoring, CSTEP provides paid opportunities for internships and research opportunities, including conference sponsorship, and assistance with graduate school exam preparatory courses. For more information, please visit the CSTEP website. If you have questions regarding CSTEP's application requirements or process, please contact Virginia Hart, Senior Admissions Officer, at vhart@barnard.edu. Science Pathways Scholars Program - (SP)² The Science Pathways Scholars Program, or (SP)², is a highly selective four year program that supports talented young women from Black/African-American, Latina, or Native American/Alaskan Native backgrounds or first generation college students who convey strong interest in biology, chemistry, environmental science, physics/astronomy, or neuroscience. Students who are selected as (SP)² Scholars will benefit from an exceptional set of opportunities and resources, including science faculty mentorship all four years, paid summer research opportunities, and a week-long expenses paid trip to campus for entering students to meet science faculty and tour research facilities and departments. For more information, please visit the (SP)² website. If you have questions regarding the program's application requirements or process, please contact Christina Lopez, Dean of Admissions, at clopez@barnard.edu. Barbara Silver Horowitz '55 Scholars of Distinction Program The Barbara Silver Horowitz '55 Scholars of Distinction Program, formerly known as The Barnard Centennial Scholars Program, was established in 1985 to help the College educate extraordinary young women bound for achievement. The Program provides a unique four-year scholarly experience in a cohort with other outstanding students. It offers participants an intellectual community, interaction with special invited guests, occasional special events outside the university setting, funds to pursue research, and a chance under the mentorship of a faculty member or outside expert to create an ambitious final project that will be presented to faculty and peers. The nature of the work produced varies according to the student, as is discussed below, and may or may not be related to their Barnard capstone thesis. For more information, please visit the Scholars of Distinction website. If you have questions regarding the program's application process, please contact Christina Lopez, Dean of Admissions, at clopez@barnard.edu. Music Lesson Exchange Program with The Juilliard School or Manhattan School of Music In addition to the music courses, major, private lessons, and many performance opportunities available to Barnard students through our music department and relationship with Columbia, Barnard also offers highly talented music students the opportunity to apply for the Lesson Exchange Program with Juilliard or the Manhattan School of Music (MSM). Both programs require a separate application in addition to your Barnard application on the Common Application or Coalition Application, as well as an audition. The Lesson Exchange Program at MSM and Juilliard provides students with private weekly lessons with faculty. It is important to note that the Lesson Exchange Program does not include participation in large ensembles. Students in the Juilliard program can take classes in instrumental or vocal performance (Classical or Jazz) and piano composition. MSM students can take lessons for instrumental or composition only. For more information regarding the audition requirements and program details, please view the Juilliard website or the Manhattan School of Music website. If you have questions regarding the application requirements or process, please contact Grace Bradley, Senior Admissions Officer, at gbradley@barnard.edu.
