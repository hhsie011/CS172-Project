ABET accreditation is assurance that a college or university program meets the quality standards established by the profession for which it prepares its students. Accreditation helps students and their parents choose quality college programs, enables employers to recruit graduates they know are well-prepared, and is used by registration, licensure, and certification boards to screen applicants. Accreditation also gives colleges and universities a structured mechanism to assess, evaluate, and improve the quality of their programs. The process for evaluating and improving Brown’s BME program is shown below. Brown’s BME program received its accreditation at the earliest possible date and the program went through the renewal process in the fall of 2008.
