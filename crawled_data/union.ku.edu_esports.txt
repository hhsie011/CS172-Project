The Kansas Esports Team is competing in League of Legends. The KU Memorial Union provides program support and coaching as part of their ongoing efforts with student programs and events. The program was made possible through a partnership with KU Information Technology and Dell Technologies. NACE KU joined the National Association of Collegiate Esports (NACE). The National Association of Collegiate Esports (NACE) was formed in July of 2016 and is committed to helping their members grow strong esports programs to benefit colleges and students alike. As a member-driven organization, they formed to help legitimize collegiate esports by guiding members on starting varsity esports programs, providing a network of communication between administrators, a recruiting network and a collective voice representing almost all the institutions in the collegiate varsity esports space. Currently NACE counts more than 175 institutions as members, representing 94% of all varsity programs in across North America.
