Our program consists of 33 student-led organizations with participants who are passionate about a certain sport and compete with other colleges throughout the state, region, and nation. The Club Sports Program emphasizes developing students’ leadership, financial, and organizational management skills through the opportunity to manage and run their own club. The Department of Campus Recreation provides advisement and administrative assistance to clubs, but emphasis is placed on student leadership, involvement, and service, with the success of each club dependent on the dedication and commitment of its student leaders and members.
