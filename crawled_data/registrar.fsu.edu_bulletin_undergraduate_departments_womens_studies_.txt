The programs establish gender and sexuality as fundamental categories of social and cultural analysis. Drawing on disciplines across the university, the programs offer interdisciplinary perspectives from which to study the diversity of human experience. The courses foster critical analysis of the social meaning of gender and gender expression and examine sexual identities, discourses, and institutions as they intersect with class, race, ethnicity, nationality, and transnational movements, drawing on the full range of approaches adopted within feminist and Queer scholarship.
