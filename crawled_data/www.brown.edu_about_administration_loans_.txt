As you may be aware, the U.S. Department of Education Office of Federal Student Aid released information about the CARES Act (the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act), which was signed into law in March 2020. The CARES Act provides relief to borrowers with federally held loans. It also allows Brown and other schools that hold Federal Perkins Loans to implement similar relief opportunities for federal student loan borrowers. The University is committed to assisting our borrowers by implementing relief measures that are available to Brown borrowers. For borrowers who request repayment relief due to COVID-19, a 3-month forbearance on loans to temporarily postpone repayment will be provided. For Federal Perkins Loans borrowers, we encourage you to consolidate your federal loans in order to take full advantage of other repayment relief options available to borrowers under the CARES Act. These measures are offered in addition to existing deferment options available through each loan program. _________________________________________________________________________________ Leaving Brown?
