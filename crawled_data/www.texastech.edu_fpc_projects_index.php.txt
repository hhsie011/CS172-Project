With the help of strategic partners, the Facilities Planning & Construction team manages new construction and renovation projects valued over $4 million for the Texas Tech University System and its five universities—Texas Tech University, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Angelo State University, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso and Midwestern State University. The Texas Tech University System continues to experience tremendous growth and has future developments scheduled on the horizon. Through 2024, there is planned growth of more than 1.5 million gross square feet with an investment portfolio of more than $1.1 billion on the multiple campuses and academic sites across the state of Texas. Impacting all five universities and touching almost every corner of each campus, these construction and renovation projects are transforming teaching classrooms, research laboratories and athletic facilities, among many other areas, all while furthering the mission of higher education and solidifying each university's place as an epicenter in its community. Take a look at the numerous projects managed by Facilities Planning & Construction that are in design, under construction and completed.
