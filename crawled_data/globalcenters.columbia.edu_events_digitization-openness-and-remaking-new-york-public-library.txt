Hall of Harmony, Nehru Centre, Dr. Annie Besant Road, Worli, Mumbai – 400018 How can libraries develop new strategies to stay relevant in a technologically changing landscape? How can they reach out to the diverse publics within the city and beyond to build a sense of community and openness? These challenges are reflected in the experience of the iconic New York Public Library, which was founded in the nineteenth century and has grown to become the fourth largest public library system in the world. Paul LeClerc served as the President and Chief Executive Officer of the New York Public Library from 1993 to 2011, where he was instrumental in expanding access to the library through digitization and digital technology, building additional new libraries, acquiring new collections, and connecting with various cultural institutions in New York city. Dr. LeClerc is currently the director of the Columbia Global Centers | Europe in Paris. He received his Ph.D. in French literature from Columbia University and is a noted scholar of Voltaire and the French Enlightenment. He has received several awards such as the French Legion of Honor (Officier), the French Order of Palmes Academiques (Officier), and the Spanish Order of Isabel the Catholic (Commander), as well as honorary doctorates from Oxford University and La Nouvelle Sorbonne.
