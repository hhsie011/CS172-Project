PreviousNext Coursework and Curriculum The major components of the program are the core curriculum, a number of elective courses, and research. During the first year students take Proseminar, which is taught by the entire faculty. This seminar explores the diverse areas of psychological and brain sciences represented in the department. First-year students also begin to take a series of Core Courses and conduct supervised research in their chosen advisor's lab. The program does not have first-year rotations, although co-supervision and collaboration is encouraged. The IND graduate program, in which a number of PBS faculty participate, does offer rotations. Second-year students receive training in statistics, enroll in focused seminars, carry out independent research and complete a Specialist Examination in their area before proceeding to their dissertation research in subsequent years of the program. Students serve as teaching assistants for four terms during their time in the program. The Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences maintains close ties and affiliations with a number of other departments and programs, including the Dartmouth Medical School and the Neuroscience Center at Dartmouth. Coursework and research is often conducted in conjunction with these other programs.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences Undergraduate Overview Psychology Major Minor Major & Minor FAQs Honors Honors FAQs Neuroscience Major Minor Major & Minor FAQs Honors Honors FAQs Curriculum Transfer and AP Credit Courses and Syllabi Introductory Intermediate Topics Labs Independent Research Course Syllabi (ID login required) Permission Courses Request Form Fall 2022 Winter 2023 Spring 2023 Resources Graduate Graduate Program in Psychological and Brain Sciences Research Areas Coursework and Curriculum Mentoring Toolkit Resources Current Graduate Students Graduate Admissions Admissions FAQs Our Graduates Recent Dissertations Research Overview Recent Research Findings Facilities Undergraduate Research Post-Doctoral Fellows Post-Doctoral Opportunities Participate in Experiments 2021 Honors Student Thesis Presentations (ID Login Required) 2022 Honors Student Thesis Presentations (ID Login Required) Community Diversity Suggestions For Current PBS Community (ID Login Required) News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
