All parking zones are subject to special event use Accessible Parking ADA permit parking on Georgia Tech's campus requires a state-issued disability tag or license plate and a Georgia Tech parking permit. Parking is authorized in any ADA space on campus with these credentials. ADA visitor space parking requires that a state issued disability tag or license plate and an hourly fee apply to customers parked in an ADA space within visitors parking areas. In some cases, ADA permit parking and ADA visitor parking are located in the same location. Vehicles parked in an ADA parking space without displaying a state-issued disability tag or license plate will be immediately result in a fine up to $200 and possible impoundment/towing with associated costs. Anyone with a disability that requires accommodation should contact the appropriate campus resource for ADA accommodations: Students should contact Disability Services. Faculty, staff, and visitors should contact the Office of Human Resources. All accommodation decisions are dependent on coordination and input from the appropriate Disability Consultant, and are based on the requirements of the ADA. Approved parking accommodations shall be periodically reviewed by Disability Services and EHS to determine future needs. Notes: ADA stalls are not reserved stalls for individuals but for all those requiring special accommodations. To reserve a personal stall, a permit applicant is required to follow the same procedure as all faculty and staff for Reserved Spaces. Decisions are based on a case by case basis. Decisions are dependent on coordination/input from appropriate Disability Consultant. Decisions are based on what the ADA law requires. Approved parking accommodations will be reviewed periodically with Disability Services and EHS to determine current needs. When the person who receives the parking accommodation leaves campus, the accommodation is canceled. If the accommodation involves a specific stall (in a specific location) PTS will determine the appropriate designation and usage of the stall.
