Books Articles Requesting Items Course Reserves Troubleshooting How can I make my search more specific? 1Search includes many types of resources so you will very likely need to limit your search results. Note all the facets on the right side, as well as some quick limiters at the top. Useful limiters and facets on the right-hand side to refine your search: Availability - limit to what is in the OSU Libraries' collection Resource Type -- to limit to books, audiovisual (for DVDs, CDs, etc.) Publication Date-- to limit your results published within a specific time Can I use "boolean logic"? To search for a phrase, enter quotation marks around your search terms, e.g., “climate change”. To search for any specified words or phrases, enter OR (all in upper case) between the words or phrases, e.g. genealogy OR lineage. To exclude words or phrases, enter NOT (all in upper case) followed by the word or phrase to exclude, e.g. silver NOT gold. To group terms within a search, use parentheses around the terms, e.g. Shakespeare (tragedy OR sonnet). Can I use truncation or wildcards? To perform a single-character wildcard search, enter a ? in place of the character position that has more than one possibility, e.g. wom?n to search for woman, women, etc. To perform a multiple character wildcard search, enter a * in place of the characters that have multiple possibilities, e.g. cultur* to search for culture, cultural, culturally, etc. How do I search by ISSN or ISBN? This option is found on the Advanced Search page in the drop-down text menu next to Search Terms. Click on Advanced Search to the right of the search box Choose ISBN or ISSN from the Any Field drop-down menu You must enter ISBNs like this: 9780375847387. You must enter ISSNs like this: 1523-388X.
