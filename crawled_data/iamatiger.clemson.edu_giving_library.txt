It’s the place students come to research, create, and collaborate. They share ideas, work on group projects, and practice presentations. Turning 50 years old in 2016, Cooper needs to be able to evolve to meet the needs of students and faculty. Your donations will help increase access to research materials, add more flexible furnishings, and create additional spaces for studying. With your help, the Cooper Library will continue to be the one place that supports students and faculty from all majors and disciplines. After all, no one graduates from the library, but no one graduates without it. To make a secure online gift today, please use the form below.
