If you have a hold on your registration, you must see the appropriate office (Outstanding Balance—Student Services, Immunization—Health Services, etc.) to resolve the situation before you can register. For information regarding immunization requirements, visit the Policies and Procedures on the University Catalog website. Closed and Restricted Courses Students may go to the department that offers a course that requires permission, is closed, or is restricted. The department will do one of the following: decline permission, add the course to your schedule at that time, or provide you with a stamped override form that you should bring to Student Services, where the staff will add the course to your schedule.
