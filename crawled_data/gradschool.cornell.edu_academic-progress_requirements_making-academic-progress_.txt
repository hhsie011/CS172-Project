With few exceptions (generally limited to certain professional degree programs), there are minimal requirements imposed by the Graduate School for either total credit hours or required courses. Graduate programs may impose additional requirements. Time-to-Degree Limits The maximum elapsed time from first registration to completion of all requirements is: Full-time Master’s: four years Part-time Master’s: six years Ph.D. Candidates: seven years Extensions may be granted by submitting a General Petition form, which can be found on our Forms page. Please include a detailed plan for completing all remaining degree requirements. *Students enrolled in the Employee Degree Program are exempt from these time requirements. Research Degree Requirements The Graduate School’s degree requirements are kept to a minimum in order to give the Special Committee and the student freedom to determine appropriate degree requirements and to define a program of study best suited to the student’s particular goals. For the Ph.D., M.A., and M.S. degree programs there are several requirements imposed by the Graduate School, including: Maintaining registration status Formation of a special committee Completion of Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) training Completion of the Student Progress Review (SPR) Timely completion of A, M, and/or B Exams Submission of the dissertation or thesis Land Acknowledgement Cornell University is located on the traditional homelands of the Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' (the Cayuga Nation). The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
