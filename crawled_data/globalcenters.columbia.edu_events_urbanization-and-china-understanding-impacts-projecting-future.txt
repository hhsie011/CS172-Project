6:00 PM Wood Auditorium, Avery Hall, 1172 Amsterdam Avenue, New York, NY 10027 As part of the celebration of WEAI’s 70th Anniversary, the 2019 Urban China Forum explores the impact of China’s sweeping urbanization on the country’s economic growth, environment and land resources, urban form and lifestyle, social fabric and welfare, and population and health. The magnitude and scope of change occurring through China’s urbanization are unprecedented, with impacts on nearly all facets of the society. As a field of inquiry, urbanization also provides a conceptual container for the study of populations and the natural and built environment within spatial concentrations of human habitation and exchange. Recognizing the breadth of urbanization research, we acknowledge the multidisciplinary nature of discourse and bring together scholars in an integrated forum of dialogue.
