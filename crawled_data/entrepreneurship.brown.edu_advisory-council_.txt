With varied backgrounds, they are all committed to building a world-class center that combines the best of Brown’s liberal arts tradition with the entrepreneurial tools needed to help students “discharge the offices of life with usefulness and reputation.” Building and growing the Nelson Center is a team effort, and we would not be able to do so without our generous and talented council members.
