The University of Memphis is proud to collaborate with Church Health of Memphis, along with other institutions and community partners. Our missions neatly intersect to provide a variety of programs and services to a wide range of populations in the Memphis area. While the various departments and schools within the University of Memphis have had relationships with Church Health for a long time, the partnership was formalized to strengthen and consolidate existing partnerships, as well as expanding to include other organizations, departments, and schools in the partnership in innovative ways. This new partnership is called the Healthy Memphis Initiative (HMI). Please click on the About tab above to learn more about this initiative. If you are interested in becoming involved please contact Dr. Fedoria Rugless at frugless@memphis.edu.
