Through the program, public artworks are funded using one percent of the estimated total cost of each new major capital project. Since then, more than 100 items created by some of today’s leading artists have been added to the TTU System’s multiple campuses. Contact Emily Wilkinson, public art director, to inquire about touring the public art, presentations about the collection, brochures and additional information.
