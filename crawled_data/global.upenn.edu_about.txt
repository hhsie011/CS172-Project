Our Strategic Framework The Strategic Framework for Penn’s Global Initiatives aligns institutional priorities with constituent needs to pursue a coordinated, sustainable approach to global engagement, ensuring the University continues as a preeminent university in the U.S. and world in global engagement and academic diplomacy. The University's first global strategic framework was adopted in 2012 and subsequently updated in 2018. At the core of the five-year strategic framework are three pillars: 1) educate global citizens, 2) catalyze transformative ideas, and 3) bring the world to Penn and Penn to the world.
