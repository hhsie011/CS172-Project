Synaptic connections between neurons are not hardwired but constantly change in strength in response to neural activity and other influences, on a time scale of milliseconds to months or years. We are interested in the mechanisms that underlie these different forms of synaptic plasticity, as well as in the functional consequences for information processing in local neuronal networks. Most of our experiments are carried out in brain slices of neocortex or thalamus, using a combination of electrophysiological and optical techniques.
