About the Talk Emergency remote education during COVID-19 has exacerbated structural inequities and revealed gaps in pedagogical knowledge and infrastructure to support the use of technology for instruction. We will hear about the impact COVID-19 has had on education and instructional strategies in primary and secondary education that can support online teaching and learning - in the US, Kenya, Turkey, and globally. Speakers Dr. Detra Price-Dennis is an Associate Professor of Education in the Department of Mathematics, Science, and Technology at Columbia University’s Teachers College. Detra serves as Co-Director of the Reimagining Education Online Advanced Certificate Program, and is the founding director of #JustLit - a media based project that provides multimodal resources about literature, media, and social change in education. She uses ethnographic and sociocultural lenses to examine the intersections of literacy education, technology, and curriculum development as a means to identify and amplify equity-oriented pedagogies in K-8 classrooms; and has had experience in the classroom as an elementary school teacher. Saliha Aslan holds a BA in English Language and Literature, and an executive MBA degree from Bosphorus University in Turkey. After working at various independent schools in Turkey as a teacher, department head, and division head, she received an MA degree in Private School Leadership from the Klingenstein Center at Columbia University’s Teachers College. She had the chance to observe and work at top NYC independent K12 schools during her study. Saliha is currently the Head of Uskudar SEV School, one of the top private co-ed schools in Istanbul, Turkey. Mary Muriuki is a pioneer home educator in Kenya with 22 years of experience.
