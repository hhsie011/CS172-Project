Over 50 years later, Clemson Libraries remain committed to servicing a full range of needs for student projects, faculty research, and community resources. When you give to the Libraries at Clemson, you are supporting the entire university in its mission to offer an excellent undergraduate experience and advance research across each of the seven Colleges. Donor support for the Libraries increases access to vital research materials, provides funding for physical improvements to Cooper Library, and funds programs aimed at keeping Clemson affordable for our students. To meet the needs of our growing university, the Libraries prioritizes the following giving options: Friends of the Library: Unrestricted support through the Friends of the Library Fund ensures that we can meet immediate needs as they arise. Student Assistant Fund: Clemson Libraries employs student assistants on an annual basis, which helps fund their education as well as offer vital support to our professional staff of service and research librarians. Special Collection and Archives: This area of the Libraries houses unique collections that differentiate Clemson’s research corpus from other regional and academic libraries. Please see the Opportunities section for a complete list of Clemson Libraries giving priorities. Questions?
