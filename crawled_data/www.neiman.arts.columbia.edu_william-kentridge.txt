In 2002, Kentridge was invited to Columbia University as an artist-in-residence, and has since completed several print projects with the Neiman Center including a graceful, larger-than-life sized portrait of a middle-aged couple dancing using offset lithography. As a master of intaglio techniques, he also created a number of smaller images in drypoint, aquatint and sugar-lift including a hybrid megaphone-man figure and a series of vintage typewriters all with an unfaltering hand and delicate touch. William Kentridge lives and works in Johannesburg, South Africa as an artist, designer, writer, actor and director. In 1976 he received a BA in politics and African studies from the University of the Witwatersrand and then studied art from 1976 to 1978 at the Johannesburg Art Foundation. Alongside his academic pursuits, Kentridge has been active in the theater since the mid-1970s. Following his first solo exhibition, at the Market Gallery in Johannesburg in 1979, his work has been shown extensively throughout Europe and the United States, including solo exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C., New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York, Centre Georges Pompidu in Paris, and Castello di Rivoli in Rivoli, Italy. He is the recipient of various awards including the Blue Ribbon Award at the American Film Festival, the Carnegie Prize, the Sarjah Biennial Prize, and the Kaisserring prize from the Monchehaus-Museum fur Moderne Kunst in Golstar, Germany.
