Multidisciplinary and Multi-Sector Approaches to Urbanism Design and Development Events Past Event Healthy Cities Series - Multidisciplinary and Multi-Sector Approaches to Urbanism Design and Development Share Add to Calendar: Google Yahoo May 19, 2021 4:00 PM - 5:30 PM Online event The development of scalable and sustainable housing in the rapidly urbanizing context in East Africa presents multiple challenges, including construction material supply, skilled labor, financing and affordability, environmental impact, policy and legal considerations, and planning and design. The Urban Development webinar session for the Healthy Cities series will focus on two multidisciplinary practitioners' work developing design innovations to address critical issues of sustainable urban development. Both presenters have backgrounds in architecture and urban planning and policy and have worked across the public, private, non-profit, and institutional sectors. Fatou Dieye will share her work and experiences across the multiple systems and stakeholders required to produce quality affordable housing and promote sustainable models for local construction and development. Justin Moore will share examples of affordable housing design and policies from the United States and his social enterprise Urban Patch's recent adaptation of existing policies and design practices to building mixed-income housing in Rwanda. The conversation will also explore the potential for the replicability and scalability of new development approaches to varied urban contexts.
