How to Fill Your Prescription at a Retail Pharmacy Present your Express Scripts identification card at a participating pharmacy in the Express Scripts national network. Prescription ID Card Employees enrolled in a health plan will receive one combination ID card for health and Express Scripts benefits for each covered member. You must present your medical ID card for pharmacy benefits. Enrollment in the prescription plan is automatic when you elect a health plan. Formulary The Express Scripts formulary for UofL is available online at www.express-scripts.com. The formulary may change during the year when: A generic drug becomes available to replace the brand name drug, or A drug becomes available over the counter (no longer covered under the pharmacy benefit, or New drugs approved. Frequently Asked Questions for Pharmacy What is the difference between a formulary brand product and a non-formulary brand product? Why do I pay more for a non-formulary brand product? Our pharmacy benefits provider has contracts with the drugs listed on our formulary brand (similar to in-network with insurance). It does not have contracts with non-formulary brands, so we cannot get a discount (similar to out-of-network with insurance). Since non-formulary brands cost more, employees must share this increased cost. How can I save money if I am taking a non-formulary branded drug? Always speak with your medical provider who is writing the prescription to see if there is a generic or a formulary branded drug that is available. This will save you time and trouble when you get to the pharmacy and realize that the medication is not covered. Where can I find out whether my prescription is a specialty drug or not and what the co-pay is going to be? You have two choices in finding this information. You can either contact KnowYourRx Coalition or ExpressScripts. Why do specialty prescriptions have to be filled through ExpressScripts? Specialty drugs are injectable, infused, oral or inhaled therapies that often require special delivery, handling, administration and monitoring. Therefore, our Specialty Pharmacy must be used because they meet these criteria. Are there any limitations on covered drugs? Yes, covered drugs are subject to plan limitation and exclusions. Some drugs may require prior authorization or step therapy. The Plan formulary lists whether a drug requires prior authorization or has a specific quantity limit. What are other ways that I can save money on prescriptions? Fill your maintenance medications for a 90-day supply and get them through home delivery. Consider over-the-counter drugs and always ask for a generic drug if it is available from your doctor or pharmacist.
