Fellows Mentoring Award Award Winners Support for Editors Previous Recipients Credits Required to Earn a Graduate Degree Graduate degrees at UC each have a stated number of credit hours that must be completed satisfactorily to earn the degree. As described below, there are multiple opportunities where coursework taken prior to matriculation into a degree program may count towards that credit hour total. In all cases, to earn a degree at UC, at least 67% of the relevant coursework credit must be earned while a matriculated student at the University. Students entering in Fall 2019 or later should make application to their program for such (advanced standing or transfer) credit during their first semester at UC to assure their course of study is optimized. For all students matriculating in Fall 2019 and later, such credit will only be granted if a complete and program-approved application for such credit is submitted to the Graduate School by the end of their first year in the program, or prior to their final semester of study, whichever comes first. For students who matriculated before Fall 2019, such credit will be considered if the application reaches the Graduate School as outlined above prior to Fall 2020. This new policy (introduced in AY19-20) is in effect for all students matriculated in Fall 2019 and later. In prior policies, master’s degrees were granted when 50% of graduate credits were completed while matriculated in the graduate program granting the degree, therefore allowing up to 50% of credits to be via advanced standing. As a transition to the new policy, for students admitted prior to Fall 2019 who are NOT in approved shared degree programs, the Graduate School will temporarily accept petitions for up to 50% of credits for advanced standing. Using the same eligibility criteria listed in this policy, such petitions can be made to the Graduate School until the start of Fall semester 2020. Students who are in approved shared degree programs will not have any transition to different levels of eligible advanced standing credit.
