He earned a Licenciado en Ciencias Matemáticas degree from the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina, and a Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from Brown University. In 1990 he joined IBM Research, where he held various positions at the T.J. Watson Research Center, including Research Staff Member and Research Manager, and in 2003 he joined Brown University as a Faculty member. Taubin was named IEEE Fellow for his contributions to the development of three-dimensional geometry compression technology and multimedia standards; he was named Fulbright Specialist by the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Education and Cultural Affairs (ECA), and Council for International Exchange of Scholars; and during his tenure at IBM he was named IBM Master Inventor, and received various internal awards, such as the IBM Research 1998 Best Computer Science Paper Award. Prof. Taubin has held various visiting appointments: during the 2000-2001 academic year he was Visiting Professor of Electrical Engineering at the California Institute of Technology; during the Spring semester of 2010, he was Visiting Associate Professor of Media Arts and Sciences at the MIT Media Lab; during the month of April 2013 he was Visiting Professor of Computer Science at the School of Exact and Natural Sciences, University of Buenos Aires, Argentina; and during the month of October 2014, he was Visiting Professor of Engineering, at the Universidad Nacional del Sur, Buenos Aires, Argentina. Prof. Taubin served as Editor-in-Chief of the IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications Magazine for a total of four years starting in January 2010, he has served as a member of the Editorial Board of the Geometric Models journal, and as associate editor of the IEEE Transactions of Visualization and Computer Graphics. Prof. Taubin's main research interests fall within the following disciplines: Applied Computational Geometry, Computer Graphics, Geometric Modeling, 3D Photography, and Computer Vision. Since his graduate student days his research has been related to the development of efficient, simple, and mathematically sound algorithms to capture and operate on 3D objects represented as polygonal meshes. During his tenure at IBM he emphasised technologies to enable the use of 3D models for Web-based applications. At Brown his research also spanned smart cameras, embedded systems, visual sensor networks, and digital archaeology. His current research projects emphasize low cost and precise 3D scanning systems, 3D scanning for 3D printing, and more generally digital fabrication.

Full Text Research Research Overview Professor of Engineering Gabriel Taubin main research interests fall at the intersection of the following disciplines: Applied Computational Geometry, Computer Graphics, Geometric Modeling, 3D Photography, and Computer Vision. His main line of research has been for many years related to the development of efficient, simple, and mathematically sound algorithms to operate on 3D objects represented as polygonal meshes, with an emphasis on technologies to enable the use of 3D models for Web-based applications. More recent research initiatives are related to visual sensor networks, real-time distributed audio/visual signal processing algorithms, and applications, low cost 3D scanning for 3D printing and industrial metrology, and digital fabrication. Research Statement Gabriel Taubin, a professor of engineering, is primarily interested in the development of efficient, simple, and mathematically sound algorithms to represent, store, transmit, operate on, and reason about 3D objects and scenes. He is actively pursuing research activities in 3D Photography, Geometry Processing, Multi-View camera Systems, and Visual Sensor Networks. 3D Photography refers to processes that use cameras and lights to capture the shape and appearance of 3D objects. These processes provide simple ways of creating graphical models for a number of applications, including computer animation, game development, electronic commerce, heritage preservation, reverse engineering, and virtual reality. Geometry Processing is concerned with 3D object representations and data structures, as well as methods to capture, smooth, denoise, edit, compress, transmit, simplify, and optimize these representations. Multi-view camera systems, composed of multiple synchronized video cameras or hybrid sysystems with multiple curved mirrors and lenses, are used to capture, or to make inferences about, the structure of 3D dynamic scenes. Visual Sensor Networks (VSNs) are wireless and wired networks of smart cameras, able to capture and process image data in a distributed collaborative fashion. VSNs have been very important in surveillance and security applications.
