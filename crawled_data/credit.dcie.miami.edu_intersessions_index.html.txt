These courses provide an opportunity for students to enhance their educational goals in a concentrated time period and allow our continuing students to participate in innovative classes taught by outstanding faculty and renowned guest lecturers. The Division of Continuing and International Education traditionally offers Intersession periods during fall/winter, spring, and summer break and these intensive courses allow students to accelerate the college journey or delve into special interest topics. Intersession includes offerings from the School of Architecture, College of Arts and Sciences, Miami Herbert Business School, School of Communication, School of Education and Human Development, College of Engineering, Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, and the Frost School of Music. Intersession section letters begin with a "U" for Undergraduates and "B" for Bachelor of General Studies students and this is to prevent students from registering for courses that are not short term Intersession courses. Intersession tuition charges are separate from and in addition to regular semester tuition charges (ARE NOT included in the full time 12-20 credit hours "flat rate"). Each student must complete the Intersession Enrollment Acknowledgement and Declaration of Understanding Form. Completion of this form will be the only way to gain pin controlled enrollment access into these courses.
