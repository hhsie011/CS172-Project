We offer students a way to modify a major with Medieval and Renaissance studies, allowing them to add interdisciplinary breadth within their course of study. We sponsor the Medieval Seminar, which gathers interested faculty twice a term to share work in progress. And we sponsor further colloquia and conferences aimed at our intellectual community. We warmly welcome faculty and other scholars from the area who wish to participate. To be added to our distribution list, please email us.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Medieval and Renaissance Studies Undergraduate Major Modification Major Modification Planning Form Steering Committee Overview Courses Events Events Medieval Seminar Medieval Colloquium People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
