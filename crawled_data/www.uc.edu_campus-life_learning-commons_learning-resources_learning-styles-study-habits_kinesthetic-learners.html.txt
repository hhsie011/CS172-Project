You will learn more through “doing” or experiencing the concepts you learn about in classes. Real-world examples and experiments will create stronger memory connections as you study. Classroom Strategies When reading or in class, pay attention to: Practical applications or real world examples provided by your instructor. The possibility of field trips, labs, or exhibits on the topic. Reviews of previous assignments. These reviews will connect to your experience writing papers or taking past quizzes and tests. Opportunities for “hands-on” learning. The texture of your notes. Try reading any handouts or textbooks through multiple colored transparencies; this will add another layer of experience to your reading and allow you to remember the experience of reading about each different topic. Your body. Fidget if you need to do so; just be sure not to frustrate your neighbors. Your state of attention. Ask questions about the material to engage yourself and put it in a new perspective. Study Strategies When studying, try the following: Study while walking, lying on your stomach or back, or in any other position that will not require you to remain at a desk. Try to write out concepts, ideas, key words, etc with your finger in the air. This sensation will help you lock into the concept more easily. Incorporate real world examples or look up case-studies to help you remember abstract concepts. Ask a friend to quiz you out loud, or perform the material for yourself in front of a mirror (Don’t worry if you look silly, it’ll be worth it when you get that A on your test). Take frequent breaks and move around during your breaks.
