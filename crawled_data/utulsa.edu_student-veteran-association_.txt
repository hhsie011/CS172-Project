While it use to be housed in Fisher Hall, in 2016 the SVA was given a 2 bedroom apartment to make into their own student lounge. At that time, the space became known as ‘The Vet House’, and to this day is still lovingly referred to as such. However, its formal name is now the Calvin C. McKee Student Veteran Center. Before the Calvin C. McKee Endowment, the SVA chapter was a recipient of grant funds, awarded by The Home Depot Foundation, in conjunction with Student Veterans of America. The award allowed for the student organization to remodel the apartment, giving the space a more open flow, new floors, paint, furniture, etc. The space had a campus-wide ‘grand opening’ during Veterans Day celebrations 2017 and quickly became a place to do homework, each lunch and blow off steam. The lounge is now named in honor of Calvin C. McKee, a distinguished TU alumnus with a rich oil and natural gas background. Mr. McKee’s brother-in-law, Thomas Russell, made the donation in Mr. McKee’s name due to his valiant military service from WWII to the Korean War. The SVA hosts events throughout the year, such as tailgating, crawfish boils, welcome back luncheons, and more. All students are welcome to join in on the festivities! The Student Veteran Association is open, welcoming student organization that helps student veterans to transition and assimilate to campus. With lunch and learns, community gatherings and tailgates, the SVA chapter is an active part of campus culture.
