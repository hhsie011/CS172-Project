The Wiley Read and Publish deal provides subscription access to nearly 1,500 journals as well as a shared pool of vouchers for open access publishing. Clemson is one of 40 consortium members participating in this deal this year. Open access articles and publications are freely available for the public to read, download and share. Normally authors must pay an article publication charge, but the deal covers that cost for up to 700 researchers from Carolina Consortium member schools. “One of the objectives of faculty sharing their research is to have a wide-reaching impact on the scholarly community,” said electronic resources librarian Chris Vidas. “By providing their content as open access, they can touch more researchers and expand the influence they have on their field.” Click here for more information or contact Vidas at cvidas@nullclemson.edu.
