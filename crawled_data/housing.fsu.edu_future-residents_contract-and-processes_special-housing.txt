Living–Learning Communities Living–Learning Communities While each learning community is unique, they all share a basic emphasis on academics. The residents of each learning community, most of whom are first–year students, live in the same residence hall and participate in an academic component that brings them together as a community. Several programs have a weekly colloquium course, for example, and several offer additional courses that apply toward the bachelor’s degree. Learning communities introduce participants to all the "value added" opportunities and experiences this major research university has to offer, including immediate interaction with some of FSU's most distinguished faculty members. Participating in a learning community helps residents build on the high level of motivation that they bring to college, and the outcome is that a higher proportion of learning community participants stay at Florida State University and graduate on time.
