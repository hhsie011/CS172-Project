About Story County Courts Story County is unique in that courts are located in both Ames and the county seat city of Nevada, located 11 miles east of Ames. Some cases are conducted entirely in Ames or Nevada. Because proceedings in an ongoing case may be held in different court locations, it is important that you ascertain the time and place where you must appear. Note: Public transportation to/from Nevada is extremely limited. See HIRTA's website for more information.
