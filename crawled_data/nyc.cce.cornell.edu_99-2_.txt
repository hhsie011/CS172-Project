Our community educators help participants embrace nutrition and health messages from USDA dietary guidelines and ChooseMyPlate.gov. Adults, seniors and children participate in hands-on learning tailored to meet their needs. Families make healthier food choices, become more physically active, and learn to stretch their food dollars. We reach families in all five boroughs of New York City by working in partnership with community organizations, schools, job training programs, faith based organizations and emergency food assistance providers. We reach into communities at many levels to support changes for healthier neighborhoods, and professional development opportunities that compliment those efforts.
