Those programs are listed below. The Graduate School also offers a printable PDF of this program list. Animal and Veterinary Science Applied Health Research and Evaluation Automotive Engineering Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Bioengineering Biological Sciences Biosystems Engineering Chemical Engineering Chemistry Computer Engineering Computer Science Economics Electrical Engineering Engineering and Science Education Entomology Environmental Engineering and Environmental Health Physics Environmental Toxicology Food, Nutrition and Packaging Science Genetics Healthcare Genetics Human Centered Computing Human Factors Psychology Industrial Engineering Industrial/Organizational Psychology International Family & Comm. Studies: PROGRAM IS INACTIVE Learning Sciences Materials Science and Engineering Mathematical Sciences Mechanical Engineering Microbiology Photonic Science and Technology Physics Plant and Environmental Sciences Wildlife and Fisheries Biology Bachelor’s to Graduate Programs Current seniors at Clemson University may be eligible for a Combined Bachelor’s-to-Graduate Plan. Depending upon individual program offerings, a combined plan may be either of these options: Bachelor’s to master’s, reducing the time required to complete both degrees, or Bachelor’s to doctoral, reducing the time required to complete both degrees. The Graduate School also offers a printable PDF flyer of graduate programs that participate in bachelor-to-graduate plans. Students use Form GS6-Bachelor-to-Graduate (the form previously called GS6BS/MS) to request participation in either type of plan. Under this plan, students may reduce the time necessary to earn both a bachelor’s and master’s/doctoral degree by applying graduate credits to both undergraduate and graduate program requirements. Students who hold a bachelor’s degree from another institution and who wish to enroll directly in a Clemson doctoral program should not use this form. Participating Programs Accounting Applied Economics & Statistics Applied Health Research and Evaluation (MS) Architecture (MArch) Architecture (MS) Automotive Engineering Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Bioengineering Biological Sciences Biomedical Data Science and Informatics Biomedical Engineering Biosystems Engineering Chemical Engineering Chemistry City and Regional Planning Civil Engineering Communication Computer Engineering Computer Science Economics Electrical Engineering Engineering and Science Education Entomology Environmental Engineering and Environmental Health Physics Environmental Engineering and Science Food, Nutrition, and Culinary Sciences Genetics Human Resource Development Hydrogeology Industrial Engineering Marketing Materials Science and Engineering Mathematical Sciences Mechanical Engineering Packaging Science Parks, Recreation & Tourism Mgt - MS (nonthesis-online) Parks, Recreation & Tourism Mgt-MS (thesis) Plant and Environmental Sciences Public Administration | Online Social Science Teacher Residency Wildlife and Fisheries Biology To be eligible for this plan, students must have completed their bachelor’s curriculum through their junior year (minimum 90 credits) and have a minimum overall grade point ratio of 3.4. All of the following conditions apply: 1 A maximum of 12 credit hours of graduate courses may be applied to the bachelor’s program. 2 The total credit hours taken for the bachelor’s and master’s must be at least 150 credit hours; that is, the credit hours counted towards the bachelor’s degree plus the credit hours taken after the bachelor’s is awarded must total at least 150. For the bachelor’s and PhD, the total must be 180 credit hours. 3 This total may contain a maximum of 6 credit hours of thesis/dissertation research, and all credit hours to be included in the total that are completed after receiving the bachelor’s degree must be in 6000-level or higher courses. 4 The total course workload for an undergraduate student in any semester that includes a graduate-level course must not exceed 18 hours. 5 As determined by the participating bachelor’s program, 7000 or 8000-level courses may be substituted for required undergraduate courses and 6000, 7000 or 8000-level courses may be applied to the bachelor’s degree as electives or technical electives. 6 Under no circumstances may 6000-level counterparts of 4000-level courses required for the bachelor’s degree be counted toward graduate degree requirements. Combined Bachelor’s-to-Graduate Plan students are not eligible for graduate appointments for financial aid until their bachelor’s degrees have been awarded. Seniors should consult both their undergraduate academic advisor and the graduate program coordinator of the program they wish to pursue. Students who receive financial aid should check with the Office of Student Financial Aid (finaid@clemson.edu) regarding their eligibility for continued assistance while pursuing Combined Bachelor’s-to-Graduate Plan credit hours. Approval is required by the student’s advisor, department chair, coordinator of the graduate program, and the Graduate School. Students should consult their individual academic units for specific requirements. Fill out the application form to request for combined bachelor’s/master’s education plan. Note: As the GRE exam is a tool used to facilitate admission decisions, the GRE requirement for admissions is eliminated for all students who are approved via Form GS6-Bachelor-to-Graduate to pursue graduate degree programs. Full admittance to the graduate program will occur the academic term following receipt of the bachelor’s degree.
