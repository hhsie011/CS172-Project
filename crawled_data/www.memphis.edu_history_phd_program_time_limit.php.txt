You must complete the degree within twelve years from the entry date. Other than credits transferred from your M.A. program, no credits that you earned more than twelve calendar years prior to the year of your graduation can count for the degree. There are no exceptions to this policy. You may, however, be able to "validate" some old courses, as described in the Graduate Catalog. Such validation, which generally involves additional readings, and must include a written exam, is limited to 1/3 of the total credits required for the degree and is limited to courses with a fixed content. In particular, you cannot validate directed readings, research seminars, or thesis credit. Only those courses still being taught are eligible for validation. The course validation system can be accessed through the following URL: Credit By Examination. Grades earned in courses older than twelve years will appear on your transcript but will not be included in your GPA. The twelve-year time limitation does not apply to course work from your master's degree.
