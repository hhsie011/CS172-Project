Program Educational Objectives Alumni of the Chemical Engineering program will be work-ready engineers, problem solvers, responsible professionals, and interdisciplinary collaborators. Specifically, based on the needs of the program’s constituencies, within a few years of graduation chemical engineering alumni will have: Obtained professional employment in a company, institute or agency within the chemical or related industries, entered a graduate program in chemical engineering or a related field or gained admission to a professional program such as medicine, law or business. Created value by applying appropriate modern chemical engineering tools to the analysis, design, and control of chemical, physical, and/or biological processes, including the hazards associated with these processes. Continued to develop their skills and knowledge through professional activities including FE/PE certifications, memberships in professional organizations and continuing education courses in order to fulfill their professional and ethical responsibilities though lifelong learning. Demonstrated good communication skills and worked effectively in cross-functional team environments comprised of a diverse set of members with varying organizational backgrounds, positions, and geographic locations. Student Outcomes The graduates of the chemical engineering undergraduate program must demonstrate that they have: An ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics. An ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors. An ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences. An ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts. An ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives. An ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions. An ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies. Additional Opportunities Among the many unique opportunities open to Oregon State chemical engineering students is the Multiple Engineering Cooperative Program (MECOP). The program offers students a high quality, paid industrial experience and related academic activities while pursuing a degree at Oregon State. We also encourage students to seek registration as a professional engineer. This process begins by successfully passing the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam (FE exam), which is normally held in April and late October. More Information More information about the program can be found on the School of Chemical, Biological and Environmental Engineering Advising Page. You may also review the Schedule of Classes and the Academic Regulations found in the Oregon State University Catalog. It is intended to aid students in planning and completing programs leading to a degree. The guide provides information regarding the undergraduate curriculum, professional practice, advising, admissions policies.
