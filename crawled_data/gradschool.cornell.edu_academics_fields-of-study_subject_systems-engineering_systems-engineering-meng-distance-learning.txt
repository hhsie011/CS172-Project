(Distance Learning) Field of Study Systems Engineering Program Description Do you have a hunger to learn? Don't have time to go back to school full-time to earn your master's degree? We can help. Cornell University is offering a Master of Engineering in Systems Engineering via distance learning. This program is ideal for you if you've entered the workforce and want to earn your master's degree without taking a break in your employment. As more and more engineers pursue master's level education, the demand for master's programs is increasing and will rise dramatically in the coming years. Many of those prospective master's degree students are engineers who already have professional jobs, and who want to pursue a professional master's program without leaving their employment. For these mature students, part-time study - often based on distance learning - is a necessity and that's where we come in.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
