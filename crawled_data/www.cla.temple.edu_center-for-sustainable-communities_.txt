The center, housed in the College of Liberal Arts, draws on resources at both Temple Ambler and Main Campus to conduct interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research for sustainable development. The center draws on expertise from across the social and environmental sciences and diverse methodological approaches that include geospatial analysis and techniques, community-based research and citizen science.
