Due to Covid-19 we won't be able to host a campus-wide in person orientation this fall. However, we're moving our orientation activities to an online format so we can make sure new graduate students still get acquainted with essential campus resources and offices, have the chance to (virtually) meet other students, and get to learn a little bit about what Lawrence has to offer you and your families. We recognize the unique needs of graduate students, and this event is designed to give you the tools and connections you'll need to be successful in your professional and personal lives. The orientation consists of a Blackboard online course full of important information, which you'll have access to as long as you're a KU student, and a number of virtual activities and meetings the week before school starts. Look out for an email with more information about the live virtual sessions in August soon! Schedule We'll be hosting the following virtual orientation events the week before school starts in August. You'll receive links to the zoom sessions and more information through the Blackboard orientation course.
