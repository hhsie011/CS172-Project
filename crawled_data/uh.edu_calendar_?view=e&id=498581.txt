Submit an Event You Have Not Yet Been Defeated Book Launch Wednesday, May 4, 2022 6:00 pm - 8:30 pm The Arab-American Educational Foundation Center for Arab Studies at the University of Houston and the Arab American Cultural & Community Center Warmly Invite You To The Book Launch of “You Have Not Yet Been Defeated: Selected Writings” by Alaa Abd El-Fattah. Alaa Abd el-Fattah is arguably the most high-profile political prisoner in Egypt, if not the Arab world, rising to international prominence during the revolution of 2011. A fiercely independent thinker who fuses politics and technology in powerful prose, an activist whose ideas represent a global generation which has only known struggle against a failing system, a public intellectual with the rare courage to offer personal, painful honesty, Alaa’s written voice came to symbolize much of what was fresh, inspiring and revolutionary about the uprisings that have defined the last decade.
