Divide funds by student type to better serve the needs of Georgia Tech students who pay technology fees but are enrolled in programs not on the Atlanta campus. Recommendation #2 Strengthen representation, transparency, and checks in the process through: Faculty representation from each college and GTPE and an equal number of students (7) on the allocation committee. Periodic reviews through the appointment of a representative ad-hoc committee by the Provost about every three years to review the process for consistency with policy, student needs, and effectiveness of allocation formulas (proposed below). Clarifying the allowable uses of technology fee funds, consistent with the policy and Institute priorities and practice. An annual report of technology fee expenditures available to the campus community. Further details of the recommendations are included in the full report.
