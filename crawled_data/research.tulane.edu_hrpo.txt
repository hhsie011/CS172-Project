About HRPO Tulane University is mandated to provide the US Department of Heath and Human Services (DHHS) with a formal assurance that it will follow procedures designed to assure the protection of all human subjects involved in research projects conducted at Tulane and elsewhere by faculty, staff, or other representatives of Tulane in connection with their institutional policies. To this end, Tulane University has established two Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), one Biomedical and one Social Behavioral, to examine and approve research projects involving human subjects. The IRB members are chosen from within the research University and the outside community to represent a variety of scientific and non-scientific disciplines. While it is the role of the IRB to determine that the rights and welfare of human research subjects are protected, the investigator bears the primary responsibility for following the approved research protocol and meeting standards established by federal regulations and the IRB. Before a research project involving human subjects is initiated, it must first be reviewed and approved by the IRB, then conducted according to the guidelines set forth by the FDA. This compliance is a crucial element of the IRB process, because it is the collective effort of individual investigators in this area that ensures the integrity of the University as a research institution.
