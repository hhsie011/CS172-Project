Advanced placement credit cannot be used to satisfy minor requirements, but students who have fulfilled the History Core through advanced placement may substitute 2 electives (worth at least 6 credits) in order to complete the required 6 courses (and 18 credits). Undergraduate Forms To declare a minor, please fill out this form (you must be logged into your BC email first) History Minor Declaration Form Beginning with the Class of 2024, the History minor will consist of 5 courses worth a total of 15 credits: 4 electives, of which at least TWO should be upper-division (4000-level) ONE LAMA (Latin American, Asian, Middle Eastern, African) elective, 2000- or 4000-level* Core courses will no longer satisfy minor requirements. * Students who have taken a majority of LAMA courses should take an elective in US or European history to fulfill this requirement. Note on Foreign Study Credit One or two foreign studies courses can be accepted toward minor requirements (although at least 3 of the 6 courses, worth at least 9 credits, must be taken at Boston College during the regular academic year). Normally foreign-study courses are accepted for elective (not upper-division) credit. If you believe that a course you are taking abroad is as challenging as one of our upper-division electives (i.e., it has substantial reading and writing requirements), you should compile evidence to support this. Save everything, especially the course syllabus and the paper(s) you write! Only one course taken abroad can count toward the minor for upper-division credit; at least one upper-division course must be taken at BC. For approval of your courses before you go abroad, please contact Prof. Charles Gallagher.
