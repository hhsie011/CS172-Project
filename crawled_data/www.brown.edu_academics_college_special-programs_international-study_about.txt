Well over 500 Brown students study outside of the United States each year and are transformed by their experiences in the most positive and profound ways. The Office of International Programs is responsible for the management of study abroad opportunities for Brown undergraduates. We also work with students from other institutions who are interested in studying abroad on a Brown-sponsored program.
