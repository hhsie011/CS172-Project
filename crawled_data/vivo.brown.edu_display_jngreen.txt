Full Text Research Research Overview James N. Green works on the political, social and, and cultural history of nineteenth and twentieth-century Brazil. His books include: We Cannot Remain Silent: Opposition to the Brazilian Military Dictatorship in the United States (Duke, 2010) and Beyond Carnival: Male Homosexuality in Twentieth-century Brazil (Chicago, 1999); Exile within Exiles: Herbert Daniel, Gay Brazilian Revolutionary (Duke, 2018). Research Statement RECENTLY COMPLETED RESEARCH PROJECT: Exile within Exiles: Herbert Daniel, Gay Brazilian Revolutionary Historical accounts of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985 gen-erally focus on political history and the militant armed opposition. Most narratives offer heroic visions of those who resisted authoritarian rule without examining tensions, complexities, and contradictions embedded in the leftwing political culture that dominated opposition to the gener-als. Similarly, many Brazilian politicians who participated in the armed struggle, including President Dilma Rousseff, have glossed over their past militancy, creating simplified stories about idealist youth who had fought for democracy rather than for revolutionary change. Exiles within Exiles seeks to problematize these glorified and revisionist historical representations through a critical biography of Herbert Daniel, a forgotten leader in the Brazilian left. Based on oral histories, archival sources, and other documentation, this project explores the complex life story of a protagonist who personifies many of the contradictory political, social, and cultural crosscurrents that were characteristic of oppositional forces in late twentieth-century Brazil. While in medical school, Herbert Daniel (1946-1992) recognized his homoerotic desires. He also discovered leftwing politics. Eager to be involved in student activism, he repressed his sexuality to join a clandestine organization whose Marxist members considered homosexuality immoral and inappropriate for a revolutionary. It was his first self-described internal exile. In 1970, he participated in the kidnapping of the German and Swiss ambassadors to obtain the re-lease of 110 political prisoners. Soon thereafter, police dismantled his underground organization. Cut off from others, he embarked on a second internal exile. Living clandestinely, he read vora-ciously and rethought his politics. Four years later, Daniel slipped out of Brazil, embarking on a European exile, his third exile. He drafted his memoirs and challenged the homophobic assump-tions of the Brazilian left by organizing a heated public debate about homosexuality that polarized Brazilian exile organizations. Returning to Brazil in 1981, he unsuccessfully ran for the state assembly of Rio de Janeiro on a platform emphasizing new but controversial ideas such as gay rights, feminism, and environmental justice. He then took up the fight to end discrimination against those with HIV/AIDS. Daniel died of AIDS in 1992. This biography provides a vehicle for investigating cultural and social aspects of radical opposition to the military regime, its aftermath, and its legacy by exploring how constructions of gender and sexuality intersected with revolutionary politics. It also offers a theoretical frame-work for understanding political and social manifestations of homophobia within the left through examining what I term "revolutionary masculinity" as an integral component of Latin American Marxist ideology. From Che Guevara's formulations about the "New Man" to self-images and symbolic popular iterations after his death, this gendered representation also draws upon tradi-tional Catholic notions of masculinity and sacrifice, forms of patriarchy, and uncritical appropri-ations of pervasive medical discourses. Daniel's lonely trajectory within the left, his internal ex-ile of repressing his desires, and the bitter debates that ensued when he revealed his homosexu-ality, unveil ways that revolutionary masculinity, with its patriarchal and sexist notions of nor-mativity, was an integral part of radical oppositional identity in the 1960s and 1970s. The transition to democracy created novel challenges for the Brazilian left. Many revolu-tionaries turned to electoral politics and gained significant influence. New issues arose, among them feminism, black consciousness, and environmental concerns. Daniel became a bridge link-ing former revolutionaries to new social movements. Through his writing and activism, he re-mained situated between class and identity politics, engendering a dialogue between seemingly divergent perspectives. When he discovered he was HIV+, he articulated a political discourse that emphasized radical participatory activism and interventionist government AIDS policies. Though he died before his proposals were fully implemented, his political legacy continues, as the ideas he formulated became integrated into international models for AIDS prevention and treatment. FUTURE RESEARCH PROJECTS: Generation 77: Youth Culture and the Demise of the Brazilian Dictatorship While completing the final archival research for Exiles within Exiles: Herbert Daniel, Gay Brazilian Revolutionary, I began conducting interviews to write a history of the Brazilian student movement of the 1970s. Much has been written about the previous generation that mo-bilized against the Brazilian military dictatorship in 1968. In mid-December, the regime decreed Institutional Act No. 5 that closed Congress, increased censorship, and authorized the repression of opposition political forces. Over the next two years, the military and the political police an-nihilated the underground student organizations that had operated clandestinely since the 1964 coup d'etat. Some student leaders turned to the armed struggle as a strategic option for over-throwing the dictatorship, although these efforts were crushed by 1973. A new generation of high school and university students emerged in the mid-1970s and began reorganizing student asso-ciations and conducting semi-clandestine actions to revitalize mobilizations against the regime. In 1977, when five students activists from this new generation were arrested and tortured be-cause they were distributing leaflets in a working-class neighborhood of the industrial belt around the city of São Paulo, students responded by organizing the first massive public street demonstrations against the military regime in a decade. This new generation, which I call Generation 77, was motivated by a variety of political, social, economic, and cultural influences that were significantly different from those that inspired youth to protest against the dictatorship in 1968. While an end to the authoritarian regime was encoded in that period's ubiquitous slogan "Down with the Dictatorship," students also em-braced another new chant calling for democratic rights. Unlike many student activists and leaders of the previous generation that had seen the end of the military regime as the prelude to a socialist revolution, a significant sector of radicalized youth of Generation 77 brought new ideas to the student movement that were linked to the demand for cultural and social changes, as well as political ones. As students protested in the streets against the regime, some of these activists sought new forms of political organization and a political agenda that addressed issues related to gender, race, sexuality, and the environment. These new ideas articulated by emergent move-ments among Brazilian youth upset what had been previously a pervasive paradigm among po-liticized students that considered these questions to be "secondary" and "divisive" in the fight against the dictatorship. Whereas Exiles within Exiles examines the personal trajectory of an active participant in 1968 youth radicalization, "Generation 77: Brazil and the Forging of an Anti-Dictatorship Movement" will offer a social and cultural history of a new generation of rebellious youth that adopted new political agendas and introduced new content to public protest. The book will focus on student opposition to the military regime that was largely centered in São Paulo, the most dy-namic economic, political, and cultural region in the country. I will argue that the student mo-bilizations of 1976 to 1978 served as the incubator for budding social movements that focused on issues of personal identity and their relationship to politics and social change. Universities cam-puses and to a lesser extent theatres, served as a public space where this generation could meet to discuss question related to gender, race, sexuality, the environment, indigenous rights, land re-form, and other issues. At the same time, the outburst of student protests played a crucial role in energizing the labor movement to carry out a strike wave from 1978 to 1980 that challenged the dictatorships economic and labor policies and set the stage for the formation of a new political leadership em-bodied in the trade union leader and future Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Schol-ars working on this period have seen the student movement of the late 1970s as merely a prelude to the emergence of new social movements in Brazil in the 1980s without analyzing the direct influences of the former and the latter. Nor have historians adequately analyzed the complex interactions between the student movement and other social movements that developed in the period to offer a more comprehensive analysis of the slow-motion transition to democracy be-tween 1974 and 1985. As in my previous works, I will combine oral histories with written sour-ces that will allow me to craft an inclusive analysis that integrates economic, social, political, and cultural factors in explaining the emergence and impact of Generation 77 on this crucial period in recent Brazilian history. The Crossroads of Sin and the Collision of Cultures: Pleasure, Commerce, and Entertainment in Rio de Janeiro, 1860-1930. This research project examines the multiple layers of public interactions and sociability that took place in the downtown area of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil’s largest city in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. I argue that this specific public space shaped popular and elite cultures, influenced forms of entertainment, commerce, and leisure activities, and, above all, was an area where social classes, races, genders, and occupational groups intermingled to create a unique and vibrant environment. Focusing on the district in and around Tiradentes Square—a region of bars, brothels, vaudeville reviews, highbrow theatres (and later movie houses), and commercial establishments—I will trace the transformations that reconfigured Brazilian society and urban life at a time of transition from slavery to freedom, mass immigration from abroad, migration from the hinterland, and a revolution in gender norms. Originally an elite venue, this downtown area became a shared space, visited by all social classes and racial groups. This was the location where newcomers first visited and experienced life in a big city; this was the neighborhood where the desperate went as a last resort to become thieves or prostitutes. I will examine tensions in the social fabric that occurred there because of overlapping usages of this locality by members of bourgeois society, working-class men and women, Bohemians, slaves and free people of color, rogue figures, and prostitutes. This work will also investigate the ways in which this downtown public space afforded working and middle-class women different kinds of access to the public sphere, while at the same time it was a site of social conflict among people of color, immigrants, and other residents of the area. By studying these intersecting worlds, I want to reconsider Brazilian notions of urban social boundaries and their permeability in a time of dramatic transformations. I have chosen to deal with the years 1860-1930 because it enables me to plot the significant economic, political, social, and cultural changes that took place in Brazil's capital during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Rio de Janeiro experienced significant economic, social, and infrastructural renovations in the three decades before the abolition of slavery (1888) and the overthrow of the monarchy (1889). The new Republican government enacted an even more ambitious urban renewal project that transformed the city into a modern (self-described) “Europeanized” capital. The local elite of belle époque Rio de Janeiro proudly considered it to be the “Paris of the Tropics.” At the same time that public health authorities and civil engineers were redesigning the city’s physical layout as a bourgeois city, large numbers of former slaves converged on the capital, modifying patterns of housing and public sociability. A parallel sharp increase in European immigration added to the doubling of Rio de Janeiro's population between 1890 and 1910. Recent arrivals from sugar and coffee plantations, along with Portuguese, Italian, and Spanish workers who entered the urban economy and joined the city’s labor force, created a new, diverse Brazilian urban population. Members of these divergent social groups intersected in downtown Rio de Janeiro, seeking social interactions, sexual pleasures, and entertainment options at venues located next to elite theaters, clubs, opera houses, and commercial establishments. Many of the historical studies on the transition period in urban Brazil between the Empire and the Republic and between slavery and the free labor market concentrate on political, economic, and social transformations that took place after the establishment of the Republic in 1889. Scholars have looked at popular responses to the elite’s approaches to urban renewal, public health programs, and the forced removal of the poor and working class from tenements in the Rio de Janeiro’s downtown area. Other historians have investigated issues of race, ethnicity, gender, or class in this formative period in Rio de Janeiro’s republican history. Cultural historians have examined the emergence of middle- and upper-class public life during Rio de Janeiro’s belle époque, while researcher have also analyzed the role of the police in controlling an unruly lower-class citizenry. Although these studies offer an understanding of the social history of diverse slices of the population, we lack an integrative work that focuses on the relationships among these different social groups and classes. By examining a broader time period (1860-1930), I will also be able to analyze changes in public sociability, entertainment, commerce, and leisure both before and after the end of slavery and the Empire in 1888-89. These are not merely matters of chronology and social interactions, but rather a new and different perspective of the meaning of "Becoming Urban." Among other questions, I will be asking the following: How did social interactions in this public zone differ before and after the abolition of slavery? How did gender roles shift during the late Empire and through the Republic as modernization, urbanization, immigration, and industrialization accelerated? In what ways did women of different races and social classes occupy urban public spaces, and how did that change over time? How did divergent groups and social classes coexist and negotiate tensions and conflicts arising from multiple uses of downtown public space, especially as working-class leisure, entertainment, and commercial consumption became more widespread in spaces that had previously mostly been occupied by the city’s elites? The focus on entertainment, commerce, and public sociability in this urban history of downtown Rio de Janeiro offers the possibility of obtaining a deeper understanding of everyday interactions that occurred in one of the city's most vibrant public spaces during that time period. I hope to broaden the framework that historians use to analyze urban sociability in the nation’s capital. This project will also provide the opportunity to consider ways in which gender, race, class, and sexuality manifested themselves in a public forum in a country that started, already in the period under discussion, to consider that it was “becoming modern.” In turn, this work should shed new light on our overall understanding of urban life not only in Brazil but also in other urban centers in Latin America in the crucial period of modernity and nation building.
