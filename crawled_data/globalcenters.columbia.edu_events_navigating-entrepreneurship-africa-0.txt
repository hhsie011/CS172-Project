The motivation behind our theme was an observation that in recent years during the rise of the startup industry and culture, entrepreneurship across the world has been defined primarily through the Western gaze, and particularly the Silicon Valley startup culture. And while this culture has inspired a startup movement across the world and in this case, within the African continent, we believe that it is crucial that we present a holistic perspective of entrepreneurs from the continent. Entrepreneurship in Africa, as we have observed growing up in different African countries, is more than the recent rise of startups. It includes small and medium businesses, from the women on the streets selling groceries to the farmers primarily based in rural towns who set up their agricultural ventures in a bid to earn a living and make a profit.
