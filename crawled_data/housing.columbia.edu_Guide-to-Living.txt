Updated for the 2021-2022 Academic Year. The Guide to Living is a collection of policies and procedures created by Columbia Undergraduate Housing and Residential Life in collaboration with other campus partners, including Columbia Health, Student Financial Services, Public Safety, and more. Residential students should familiarize themselves with the content of the Guide to Living prior to moving into a Housing-owned or operated residence hall or brownstone. Additionally, residential students are required to comply with these policies and with all legitimate requests from University officials acting in the performance of their duties. Failure to comply may result in the Residential Life Conduct Process or Dean’s Discipline. Additional important Columbia University policy information is available on the University Policies website.
