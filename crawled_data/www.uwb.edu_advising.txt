We are so glad you are here. What is Academic Advising? The Advising Partnership As educators, advisors emphasize the core skills of critical thinking and decision-making, and the value of broad exposure to a diversity of perspectives. In addition to assistance with tasks such as choosing a major and planning course schedules, advisors engage in a broader dialogue with individual students to clarify their academic and personal goals. This includes discussing careers and graduate school plans or pre-professional advising in a number of areas such as pre-health. We are committed to your academic success! Our mission as Academic Advisors is to facilitate the exploration of transformative educational experience so that students may become engaged university members and active global citizens. We are set up to do this in a variety of places throughout your campus experience, with pre-major advisors in the Student Success Center and advisors within the Schools for both undergraduate and graduate majors and programs.
