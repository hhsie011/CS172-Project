How I've Changed I think after having met so many interesting people at HDS coming from diverse backgrounds, I have become more empathetic. Memorable Moment HDS Muslims gatherings, weekly halaqas, chai nights, and hence spending time with some amazing people who came from diverse backgrounds and were remarkably passionate about doing interesting things. Favorite Class or Professor 1. "Islam and Religious Diversity" with Professor Boylston. 2. "Major Works of Islamic Civilizations" with Professor Khaled El-Rouayheb. 3. "What is Lived Islam" with Professor Teren Sevea. Message of Thanks I would like to thank all the professors, mentors (PhD students), colleagues, and each and everyone I met because I have definitely learned a lot from all of them. I think Harvard PhD students were a great inspiration for me such as Mafaz, Shaharyar, Abtsam, Iesa, and many others. What I Hope to Be Remembered By I know my friends will not forget about my silly jokes. :) Future Plans I will be starting my PhD in Islamic Studies from UCLA in the fall, InshaAllah.
