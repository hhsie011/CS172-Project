Much like a doctor may use ultrasound or radiography to assess the health of the body, engineers use these and other techniques to decide if material properties are within an acceptable range, if a component was well manufactured, or if damage has occurred in service that would warrant retirement. NDE professionals are active in all phases of engineering, from design to manufacturing to in-service use, and in all industry sectors including aviation, power generation, transportation, manufacturing, and many others. How can undergraduates get involved in NDE? The NDE Minor at Iowa State University is a unique opportunity to get a multi-disciplinary qualification in the rapidly evolving engineering discipline of Nondestructive Evaluation. There are also several summer internship opportunities accessible by students taking the NDE minor. Below is the current list of required and approved courses for the minor, for which 16 credits are required. Courses other than the two required courses can be selected from those listed below according to your interests; you can take courses in various NDE disciplines and at the same time qualify for this important minor. Required Courses MatE/EM 362 Principles of Nondestructive Testing (Cr. 3. S.) MatE/EM 362L Nondestructive Testing Laboratory (Cr. 1. S.) NDE Specific courses (at least one needed for 3 or 4 credits) MSE/EM 550 Fundamentals of Nondestructive Evaluation (Cr. 4. S.) EM / AerE / MatE 490 + other departments Independent Study (Cr. 3.
