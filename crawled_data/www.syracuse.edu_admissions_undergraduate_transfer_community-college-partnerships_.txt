The length of collegiate study and type of degree will be the same as if you joined Syracuse University in the fall, but the path to Syracuse University will be more like that of a transfer student. If you are selected and choose to participate in the pathway program, you will: Attend nearby Wells College, in the town of Aurora, NY, for your first year. After that, you can transfer credits to Syracuse (requirements apply). Complete your second, third, and fourth years at Syracuse University, then graduate on time with a Syracuse bachelor's degree. If you are chosen to participate in the Pathway Program, you will be notified via email in response to your application to Syracuse University. **Reverse Transfer Credit Agreement The Reverse Transfer Credit Agreement assists you if you earned credits that applied toward an associate's degree while enrolled at OCC, did not complete sufficient credits to earn the degree and then pursued your education at Syracuse University. This agreement is designed to allow you to transfer your credits earned at Syracuse to OCC to have the opportunity to complete your associate's degree while pursuing a baccalaureate degree at Syracuse. Please contact the Office of Admissions for a copy of the agreement.
