The university will undergo its next comprehensive evaluation during the 2026-2027 academic year. Additionally, several WSU programs hold specialty accreditation. The accreditation status of those programs can be found online (http://wichita.edu/assessment) or in information published by the accredited programs. In some cases regional and specialty accreditation status is required by some programs for its graduates to sit for certification examinations and/or to obtain a license and/or a registration. Regional accreditation by The Higher Learning Commission does not constitute specialty accreditation for individual programs.
