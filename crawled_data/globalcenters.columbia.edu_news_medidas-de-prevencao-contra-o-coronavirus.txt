Novas datas serão definidas e informadas a todos. March 13, 2020 Em meio ao avanço dos casos do novo coronavírus, classificado pela Organização Mundial de Saúde (OMS) como uma pandemia, diversos países adotaram medidas extremas para lidar com a situação, entre elas o cancelamento de grandes eventos, aulas em escolas e universidades e a orientação para que as pessoas evitem aglomerações ou até mesmo proximidade entre si. A Universidade de Columbia instruiu a todos os docentes, alunos e staff a evitarem viagens e a idas ao campus. Por essa razão, todas as aulas estão sendo ministradas online e todos os eventos foram cancelados. Vale ressaltar, que nós do Columbia Global Centers | Rio de Janeiro, apoiamos todos os esforços realizados pela universidade para combater essa situação. No Brasil, os casos de COVID-19, têm crescido exponencialmente nos últimos dias. Hoje, o país registrou ao menos 151 casos confirmados. O número foi atualizado nesta sexta-feira (13) a partir de balanços divulgados pelas secretarias estaduais de Saúde e pelo Hospital Albert Einstein. A saúde de todos é a nossa prioridade, e por essa razão, decidimos adiar todos os nossos eventos como medida de prevenção. Novas datas serão definidas e informadas a todos. Sem tratamento específico, por enquanto, a principal forma de se proteger é adotando alguns hábitos. Image Carousel with 3 slides A carousel is a rotating set of images.
