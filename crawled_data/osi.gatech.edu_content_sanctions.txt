As such, the philosophy of our sanctioning models is meant to not only be punitive in nature, but rather to have a strong educational component. These models are guidelines. The vast majority of cases should fall within these guidelines, but there may be mitigating or aggravating circumstances which may warrant deviation from the guidelines.
