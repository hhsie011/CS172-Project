HRECOS monitoring stations are geographically distributed along the Hudson and Mohawk Rivers, and are equipped with sensors that continuously record a suite of water quality and weather parameters every 15 minutes, with most stations operating year-round. Remote telemetry at each station transmits real-time data for the public to freely view and download using an easily-accessible interface at hrecos.org. HRECOS works to improve the capacity of regional river and estuary stakeholders to: understand the ecosystem and manage water resources, provide baseline monitoring data necessary for applied research and modeling, support the use of real-time data in educational settings, provide policy makers and emergency managers with data products to guide decision making, and provide information for safe and efficient commercial use and recreational activities. Explore the Piermont Pier Dashboard and other monitoring stations as well as the HRECOS Current Conditions Platform.
