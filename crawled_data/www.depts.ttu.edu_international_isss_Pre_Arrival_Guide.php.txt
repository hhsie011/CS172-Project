Information about on- campus housing and how to register can be found at the University Student Housing Web Page Graduate students, transfer students, and any other students that are not required to live in on-campus housing, can find a variety of web sites that will help you in your search for off-campus housing options. Many of these off-campus facilities have bus services to the campus for students without cars.

These rates are only available to international students traveling to the USA alone or with their families who need a temporary place to stay until move in.

The university also reserves the right to make changes in tuition and fees at anytime. Students on F-1 and J-1 visas should have at least $4,000 in their possession upon arrival in Lubbock. We recommend that you bring as much of the amount as you are allowed to transfer. Please plan accordingly. Tuition and fee payments are due before classes begin. If you plan to bring your spouse and child(ren) with you, add approximately $6,500 for your spouse and $4,600 per child for 12-month living expenses. Students are urged to have adequate financial means for their entire period of study, since there are few financial resources at the University.

DO NOT PUT MONEY/IMMIGRATION DOCUMENTS IN YOUR LUGGAGE!!!! Consider setting up a Flywire Account to pay your tuition, fees and housing bill. This service will allow you to more easily pay your bill after you register for classes. Sometimes there are delays in transferring money from your home bank account and setting up a US bank account. Delays in payments for your tuition and housing and can result in your classes being dropped.
