In this vein, we give attention to the ways in which institutional structures and systems of oppression (sexism, racism, ableism, classism, ageism, etc.) impact gendered identities and lived experiences. We create programs and events that cultivate community across difference and inspire critical dialogue and collective movement-making. Many of our programs are student-driven and coordinated, under the supervision of the Director and Assistant Director. Sarah Doyle programs include but are not limited to lectures, film screenings, panel presentations, workshops, lunch conversations, open houses, creative arts, and social events. We work to coordinate programs that address contemporary issues and are relevant to what is going on at Brown and beyond. Our programs can be organized along the following areas of focus: Community Engagement, Sarah Doyle Gallery, Graduate Student Programs, Sarah Doyle Library, Masha Dexter Lecture, Women Peer Counselors, and Women’s History Series.
