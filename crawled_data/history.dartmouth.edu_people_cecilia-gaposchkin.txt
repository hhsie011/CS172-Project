She works on late medieval cultural history, and has published on the crusades, on the Capetians (the kings of France between 987 and 1328), on kingship, and on liturgy. Her most recent book is on how liturgy and church ritual underwrote holy war and crusading. It is Invisible Weapons: Liturgy and the Making of Crusade Ideology (Cornell UP, 2017). She is also the author of The Making of Saint Louis (IX) of France: Kingship, Sanctity and Crusade in the Later Middle Ages (Cornell UP, 2008), Blessed Louis, The Most Glorious of Kings: Texts relating to the Cult of Saint Louis of France (Notre Dame: 2012; translations done with Phyllis Katz), and, with Sean Field and Larry Field, The Sanctity of Louis IX: Early Lives of Saint Louis by Geoffrey of Beaulieu and William of Chartres (Cornell UP: 2014).

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of History Undergraduate Overview History FAQs for First Year and Transfer Students How to Declare a Major or Minor in History Major Modified Major Minor Transfer Credit Policy Course Descriptions First-Year Seminars Introductory Africa, Asia, Latin America & The Caribbean (AALAC) Europe (EUR) Interregional & Comparative (INTER) United States (US) Seminars & Colloquia Independent Study & Honors Course Schedule 2021-2022 Schedule 2022-2023 Schedule 2023-2024 Schedule Course Syllabi Honors Thesis Program General Timeline Guidelines for the Class of 2022 Guidelines for the Class of 2023 Honors Theses By Year Phi Alpha Theta Honors Society Prizes After Graduation Alumni Update Research Overview Faculty Research Initiatives Dartmouth History Institute Student Research Initiatives and Resources The Dartmouth Vietnam Project History Librarian Research Funding Resources Undergraduate Research Database Student Class Projects Foreign Study News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
