HUT Deadlines Calendar - Updated 05/26/2022 Click here to access the HUT Student Handbook, which outlines the policies and procedures expected of HUT Scholars. Become a Thesis Chair There is a growing demand for faculty members to serve as thesis chairs for incoming Honors Thesis students. We are asking qualifying faculty who are interested in being thesis chairs to fill out this short survey: www.tinyurl.com/HUT-thesis-chair. The information collected in this survey will be housed in the Office of Honors Research — not posted online. If a student has difficulty finding a thesis chair, the hope is that we will have at least one or two faculty members with similar interests to recommend to the student. We would appreciate if you can take the survey and distribute it to your colleagues, so everyone has the chance to get involved in this program.
