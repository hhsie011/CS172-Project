Naturally produced molecules often regulate complex interactions with their animal hosts. They hold a rich history of being utilized as human drugs and serve as molecular probes for identifying new drug targets for a wide variety of diseases. Building on major technical and conceptual advances of the last decade, faculty and students at the Institute integrate diverse areas including synthetic chemistry, biochemistry, cell biology, microbiology, bioinformatics, and molecular biology to address fundamental questions in biology. Two Open Faculty Positions The Institute invites applications for two tenure-track position at the ASSISTANT PROFESSOR rank in partnership with the Department of Immunobiology and the Department of Molecular, Cellular & Developmental Biology at Yale University.
