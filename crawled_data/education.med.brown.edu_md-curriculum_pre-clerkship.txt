The pre-clerkship curriculum is a 17-month introduction to the profession of medicine, composed of the Integrated Medical Sciences course sequence and Doctoring, as well as a two-week Clinical Skills Clerkship that prepares students for transition into the clerkship phase. In addition to these required courses, the elective Scholarly Concentrations Program is introduced in Year 1 and runs throughout the four years of medical school. The program allows students to pursue a course of study beyond the traditional medical school curriculum and translate personal interests into scholarship.
