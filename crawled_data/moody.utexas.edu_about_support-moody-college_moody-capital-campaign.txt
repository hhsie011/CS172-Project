We want to ensure that Moody College attracts the very best students and that our academic programs remain at the forefront of quality and relevance.

In a competitive marketplace, we must work hard to retain our existing talent and to recruit the very best faculty to join our college. Transforming Healthcare and Improving Society Moody College’s health programs — the Department of Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences, the Center for Health Communication, and the Arthur M. Blank Center for Stuttering Education and Research — are among the very best in their fields but require additional support to expand their cutting-edge medical and clinical research, low- and no-cost clinics and camps, and other offerings. Increasing Interdisciplinary Innovation Moody College has been at the forefront of communication for decades, and every one of our programs is ranked within the top 15 in the country. In today’s hyper-linked media world, collaboration across our academic units is more important than ever, and instituting cross-cutting centers and shared spaces is crucial. UT is a top-tier university — but what makes it unique is how it levels the playing field. As the flagship public university in Texas, it gives countless young people access to opportunities and networks they couldn’t get anywhere else.
