Meyer Schapiro earned Columbia's first Ph.D. in the field in 1929 with a dissertation that was to revolutionize the study of Romanesque art. In the years since, scholars here have shaped nearly every area of study in the field: art and architecture of the Americas until 1550 to postmodern, style analysis to critical theory.
