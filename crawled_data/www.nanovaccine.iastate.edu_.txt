Interdisciplinary research Our research is a transdisciplinary merger of expertise in immunology, nanotechnology, materials science, microbiology, neuroscience, cancer biology, gerontology, clinical science, and social science. We are developing nanovaccines and nanotherapeutics for respiratory infections, neural disorders, antimicrobial resistance, cancer, aging, and animal health. Our vision is that nanovaccines and nanotherapeutics will revolutionize how we prevent and treat disease.
