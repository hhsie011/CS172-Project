Both are a vital resource for MBA students and graduates. Social enterprise faculty members expose students to new ideas, theory, and research, offer educational and career advice, and provide a starting point for networking with organizations relevant to social enterprise areas in the nonprofit, public, and business sectors. Faculty members are involved in research projects, external working groups, conference and student club activities, and student organized study trips. Read about other faculty activities in the news section. Staff members of the Tamer Center for Social Enterprise work closely with individual students and student clubs to provide experiential and educational learning opportunities, career advice, and connections between organizations and the social enterprise community at Columbia Business School, across Columbia University and beyond.
