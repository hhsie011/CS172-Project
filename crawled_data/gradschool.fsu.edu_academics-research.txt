Combined Bachelor's/ Master's Pathways Combined bachelor’s/master’s pathways provide academically talented undergraduate students an opportunity to complete both a bachelor’s and a master’s degree. Upon approval, a combined bachelor’s/master’s pathway allows for up to 12 graduate hours to be shared with, or double-counted toward, an undergraduate degree program. A student enrolled in a combined pathway will earn the baccalaureate degree upon completion of the undergraduate program and master’s degree upon completion of the graduate program. Joint Graduate Pathway Programs Joint graduate pathways provide qualified master’s students with an opportunity to earn two master’s degrees or master’s/professional degrees from two academic degree programs. Joint graduate pathways share academic content that allows a student to expand their breadth of knowledge and content expertise to include additional domains not covered in a single degree. All post-baccalaureate degree programs must have at least 30 unique hours of coursework. Upon approval, joint graduate pathways allow graduate/professional courses in excess of the 30-hour minimum to be shared with, or double-counted, toward both degree programs.
