About Requirements Academic Plan Learn more about the Bachelor of Science in Pharmaceutical Sciences. The Bachelor of Science in Pharmaceutical Sciences is designed for students who are planning to obtain both a Bachelor of Science in Pharmaceutical Sciences and a Doctor of Pharmacy degree in seven years. It provides a solid science foundation and broad liberal arts education while preparing students for careers in the areas of research/laboratory work, quality control, and administration in pharmaceutics, biotechnology, and healthcare industries. This major is open to incoming freshmen who are direct admits to the Temple University School of Pharmacy. Current students who have been admitted to the Pharmacy School and can complete this major within their first year of Temple University School of Pharmacy are welcome to declare this major. The B.S. in Pharmaceutical Sciences is a 4-year, non-licensure, undergraduate bachelor's degree program, and does not qualify the student for state board examination to become a registered pharmacist. Students must meet the admissions requirements for early admission to the Temple University School of Pharmacy.
