The mission of every Chaplain is to make available pastoral care and advice for students, staff, faculty, and alumni, and to to increase religious literacy within the Brown community. This can happen through: individual or group counsel interventions in emergencies (both academic and personal) programming on critical spiritual themes or concerns presiding at key life rituals The latter includes everything from weekly services to weddings/unions, baptism/blessing of children, and memorial or funeral rites. The composite of the chaplains' work in this area includes care for many hundreds of community members. We seek to ensure that a diversity of beliefs have voice and vitality throughout the University community. Please feel free to explore our site. Brown community members may send questions and requests for counsel, support, information or prayer by email to [email protected] or by calling 401-863-2344.
