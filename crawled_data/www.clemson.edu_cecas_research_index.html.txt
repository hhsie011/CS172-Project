all levels of their academic journey. As undergraduates, students can participate in Creative Inquiry, a program unique to Clemson where a faculty mentor leads team-based investigations. Graduate and postdoctoral students collaborate with faculty, industry partners, government officials and state-of-the-art facilities to solve the world's pressing problems and move the industry forward. Interdisciplinary collaboration among college faculty also helps the University gain formal recognition as a research institute. Translational Research The engineers and scientists at our campuses are conducting translational research - research that seeks to produce applicable results and discoveries that can be quickly and efficiently "translated" into human practice. The four thrusts of the college's translational research are: Next-Gen Computing Future Materials Health Innovation and Human Performance Sustainable Environment Read more about these emphasis areas and our research goals in the college's Strategic Plan. Research Links Research Facilities The College utilizes many world-class facilities in its day-to-day research. These facilities include institute facilities located on the main campus and across South Carolina. Research Facilities Centers & Institutes Research is fundamentally important in the College. As a Carnegie R1 research institution, faculty are able to stay at the cutting edge of science and technology. Centers & Institutes Endowed Faculty Endowed faculty positions enhance our college to potential candidates and provide stipends to members for research, travel, and professional development.
