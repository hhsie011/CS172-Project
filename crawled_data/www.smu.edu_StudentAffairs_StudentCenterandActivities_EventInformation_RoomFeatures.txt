To reserve a room and resources, log in to STABLE at smu.edu/stable. Clients external to SMU can fill out an Event Request Form here. If you need to reserve a space “as-is” in the Hughes-Trigg Student Center, utilize the Indoor Reservations form. If your event requires resources (Audio/Visual support, tables & chairs, catering, etc.), you must ALSO fill out the Indoor Event Request form at least 5 business days before your event. There is no charge to utilize HTSC spaces and resources for SMU departments or student organizations. Exceptions to this are as follows: Damage incurred to property or resources No-notice cancellations An SMU member uses their reservation privilege to book a space for which a non-SMU entity is the primary host/audience/participant (such as seminars for the general public or recruiting/advertising) and/or does not directly serve current SMU students, faculty, or staff (hosting a meeting or conference for your professional network) Attendees are charged for admission, refreshments, or any part of their participation During the transition to the STABLE software, it is anticipated that there will be a period of adjustment for both clients and space managers. Before reaching out to Hughes-Trigg personnel, familiarize yourself with the easy-to-follow instructional video here, FAQs here and tutorial resources here. If you still have questions or concerns after examining these resources, please e-mail htsc@smu.edu and our staff will respond as soon as they are able. We look forward to hosting you soon!
