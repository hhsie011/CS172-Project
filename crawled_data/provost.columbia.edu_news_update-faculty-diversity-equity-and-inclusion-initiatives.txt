As President Bollinger noted in October, this year we welcomed the most racially and ethnically diverse cohort of new tenure and tenure-track faculty hires in Columbia’s history (26% of new faculty are Black, Latinx, or Native). And with 47% of tenure and tenure-track hires identifying as women, the gender diversity of this cohort was the second highest in our history. Our ongoing efforts to build a more representative and inclusive faculty continue to gain momentum, spearheaded by the Office of the Vice Provost for Faculty Advancement. As part of the larger Faculty Diversity Initiative, I am pleased to announce awardees of a number of competitive programs: Faculty Recruitments in Race and Racism Scholarship Provost’s Grants Program for Junior Faculty who Contribute to the Diversity Goals of the University Addressing Racism: A Call to Action for Columbia Seed Grants, and Inclusive Faculty Pathways Initiative’s Provost's Postdoctoral Research Scientist and Scholar Program. Faculty Recruitments in Race and Racism Scholarship The Faculty Cluster Hire Initiative, launched in 2020, invited schools to submit proposals for recruiting outstanding tenured and tenure-track faculty engaged in race and racism scholarship. This cohort can be instrumental in the strengthening of cross-disciplinary and cross-school collaborations regarding race and racism. Six pending recruitments were authorized in fall 2021: the School of Social Work (2); and, in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the Department of Anthropology (1); the Department of Psychology (1); the Department of Religion (1); and the Department of Sociology (1) Provost’s Grants Program for Junior Faculty who Contribute to the Diversity Goals of the University This program offers grant support to further the scholarship of outstanding junior faculty who contribute to the diversity goals of the University by their research, teaching, and mentoring activities.

The awards have been granted to the following units: the Division of Natural Sciences in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences; the Department of Biomedical Engineering; the Departments of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering; Columbia Climate School; Columbia Law School; and the Columbia School of Social Work. I am delighted to recognize our awardees and the progress they help us make toward building a more diverse and inclusive community of scholars. Please join Dennis A.
