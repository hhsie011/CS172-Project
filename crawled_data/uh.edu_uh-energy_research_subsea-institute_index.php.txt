The RESTORE Act established the Restoration Trust Fund, which allocated 2.5% of the money received in civil penalties to create Centers of Excellence in the five Gulf Coast states to further Gulf coast science, monitoring and technology. Then-Governor Rick Perry and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) awarded the funds (roughly $4.1 million) for the Texas Center of Excellence to the consortium partners of the University of Houston, Rice University, and NASA Johnson Space Center.
