Jeremy Horrell and Nicola Neretti training in the lab. Through these efforts we foster not only increased awareness of this fascinating topic, but promote and stimulate basic research in this critically important area. The cornerstone of our efforts is a Pre-doctoral Training Grant from the National Institute on Aging. With this award we have established a curriculum track in the Molecular Biology of Aging (MBoA) in the MCB and Pathobiology Graduate Programs. The training grant funds fellowships leading to a Ph.D. degree in the laboratories of participating faculty. The Center supports several other activities, including the Aging Seminar Series, the Providence Area Aging Research Forum, and the annual Colloquium on the Biology of Human Aging.
