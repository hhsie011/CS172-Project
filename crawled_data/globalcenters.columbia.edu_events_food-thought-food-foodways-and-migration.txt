Through his audio installations and gastronomic works, he explores how personal, public, and collective memories and histories are translated and transformed into or through sound and food. Through these media, his practice probes human relationships and existential conditions. It seeks an understanding of our postcolonial world by subjecting issues around immigration, migration and globalization to a critical rigor. Having spent the last four years living in Europe, he has gained a profound grasp of concepts such as exile, migration, expatriation, and diaspora as they relate to the African experience. For his public presentation, he will be discussing food and foodways, in relation to the migrant experience, with special focus on the Sufferhead Original beer project. Sufferhead Original is a craft beer inspired by the food tastes and experiences of Africans living in Europe, and communicates some of the received stereotypes, politics of difference and integration associated with their expatriate fate through the brewing and branding of the beer. Emeka Ogboh Nigeria / Germany Emeka Ogboh connects to places with his senses of hearing and taste.
