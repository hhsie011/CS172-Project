The systematic acquisition of data made possible by genomics and proteomics technologies has created a tremendous gap between available data and their biological interpretation. Given the rate of data generation, it is well recognized that this gap will not be closed with direct individual experimentation. Computational and theoretical approaches to understanding biological systems provide an essential vehicle to help close this gap. These activities include computational modeling of biological processes, computational management of large-scale projects, database development and data mining, algorithm development and high-performance computing, as well as statistical and mathematical analyses. Yale has an interdepartmental CBB PhD program. The advantage of an interdepartmental program is that CBB students complete the CBB curriculum while being able to do their dissertation research in the laboratory of a faculty member in any relevant department at Yale (which might be a biological science department, computer science, statistics, applied math, etc.). They do not have to satisfy the PhD requirements of their research adviser’s department. We welcome your interest in Yale’s CBB program.
