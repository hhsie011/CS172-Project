More Information The Dartmouth Financial Aid Office can answer your questions about federal loans. Individual academic program offices handle scholarships, grants, stipends, and all institutional financial aid. Other Sources of Financial Aid All students are encouraged to seek grants and scholarships available from outside sources. Some good resources: Fastweb Collegenet Sallie Mae The Fulbright Program UNIGO Scholarships Many lenders offer privately funded educational loans. In most cases, the Financial Aid Office will need to certify your enrollment and educational costs. These commercial loans have varied interest rates, origination fees, and repayment terms, and may require a co-signer. Short-Term Loans Limited funds are available in the Graduate Studies Office for making short-term, no-interest loans to help students through temporary emergencies. Loans are limited to a few hundred dollars and payment must be made within three months. Employment at Dartmouth Graduate students who are fully supported (a full tuition scholarship and a full stipend) cannot receive additional payment from Dartmouth College for services rendered and cannot accept employment outside the College while enrolled. Exceptions may be granted in cases of academic or professional benefit or documented financial hardship. Unless a program-specific exception has been approved by the Graduate Council, any exception will normally not exceed eight hours per week and must have the written approval of the graduate student's advisor, department chair or Graduate Program Committee, and the Dean of Graduate Studies.
