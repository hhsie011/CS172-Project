SAS determines reasonable accommodations for all students with disabilities, and works collaboratively with Yale faculty, staff, and students to ensure accessible and equitable educational access. VALUES We believe disability is a natural facet of diversity, and we value the lived experiences of students with disabilities and use this experience to help guide our work. Universal Design concepts are a central tenet in our advocacy for institutional policies that further the goal of a fully inclusive campus community. We are committed to normalizing the accommodation process and removing barriers that prevent students from requesting accommodations.
