Last Updated: March 31, 7:02pm Close Alert Open Alert: Financial Aid Program Expanded Breadcrumb Financial Aid How Aid Works On this page Overview Our Principles Determining Need Cost of Attendance Types of Aid Bills & Payments Overview By The Numbers Statistics $ 12 12 K Average Parent Contribution 20 20 % Of Harvard Families Pay Nothing 100 100 % Of Demonstrated Financial Need is Met Our Principles You Can Afford Harvard Getting into Harvard can be challenging. Figuring out how to pay for it shouldn't be. Harvard is more affordable than public universities for 90 percent of Americans—and international students receive exactly the same financial aid as American students. Because we want to bring the best people to Harvard regardless of their financial circumstances, we follow two important principles: Need-blind admissions. Your financial need and your aid application will never affect your chance of being admitted to Harvard. 100% need-based aid. We base aid awards on need, not on merit. This means that financial aid supports the students who will benefit from it the most. Furthermore, we meet 100 percent of our students' demonstrated financial need. We will work with you and your family one-on-one to help you navigate the options and make sure Harvard is an affordable option for your education. Revolutionary Financial Aid This preview video does not contain audio. Video description: Lucerito and her parents in their California home Watch "Revolutionary Financial Aid" Video End of embedded content Determining Need Our financial aid officers will work closely with you and your family to determine your demonstrated need and your family’s expected contribution. For many families, this is between zero and 10 percent of family income. Because everyone's circumstances are unique, it's difficult to summarize the many financial aid options and policies that exist. The simplest way to put it is this: We want to make Harvard accessible and affordable for everyone who gets in—no matter what. Use our Net Price Calculator to quickly estimate your aid package and expected family contribution. You can also visit the MyInTuition Quick College Cost Estimator to see just how affordable an education can be at Harvard and other schools. FAQs about determining need Parent Contribution We determine parent contribution through a careful review of your family's income, assets, and overall financial circumstances. For families with annual incomes below $75,000 (increased from $65,000 beginning in the 2022-23 academic year), the expected contribution is zero. Families with annual incomes between $75,000 and $150,000 will contribute between 0 and 10 percent of their income. Those with incomes above $150,000 will be asked to pay proportionately more than 10 percent based on their circumstances. Families who have significant assets will be asked to pay more, but home equity and retirement assets are not considered in our assessment of financial need. Parents may provide their contribution from savings, current income, future income (through borrowing), or a combination of these methods. You can use our net price calculator to estimate your expected family contribution. Student Contribution As the primary beneficiary of a Harvard education, all students are expected to contribute to their college expenses. Your financial aid award will include a standard expected contribution from your own earnings. In the past, students were expected to contribute from both term-time and summer earnings; however, we have recently expanded our financial aid program by eliminating the summer work expectation for all students beginning in the 2020-21 academic year. Students are still expected to contribute a standard amount through term-time work to meet their estimated personal expenses. If you have savings or other assets, you will also be expected to contribute a small portion toward college expenses. This determination will be included with your financial aid award. Most students work to meet their student contribution, and jobs on campus are plentiful and varied. Visit our Guide to Student Employment for more information. Some students use outside awards or loans to replace their expected contribution. If you can't save up enough for your student contribution, the Harvard Loan program may be able to help. Unusual Family Circumstances We know that every family is different. Your financial circumstances are also unique. We are happy to work with you on an individual basis if you have complex, uncommon, or challenging financial circumstances that are not easily described in the standard aid application. We hope families discuss the cost of going to college and agree that paying for education is a priority, but we can't provide extra aid for students whose parents withdraw financial support. Similarly, we can't provide additional aid for families that have incurred large consumer debts. Please know that we will work with you and your family to make Harvard as affordable as possible.

Net Price Calculator Cost of Attendance We know that paying for a private college education is a significant undertaking. Our goal is to make sure it remains manageable for you and your family. These values represent the full cost of a Harvard education before taking into account financial aid or scholarships, so the amount that your family will pay will likely be significantly lower. If you are eligible for aid, you may also receive an additional allowance for travel and personal expenses. You can use our Net Price Calculator to gain a better estimate of your personal cost of attendance.

History of Financial Aid Harvard’s long tradition of opportunity and access continues to be strengthened by the partnership and generosity of our amazing alumni and donor community. History of Financial Aid Types of Aid Financial aid is completely need-based and considers many factors, such as your family’s income, assets, size, and unusual expenses. There are no merit-based awards, and we have no preferential policies that give some students more attractive awards than others. When you qualify for financial aid from Harvard, we create an individualized aid package to meet all of your demonstrated need. This may include scholarship funds and student employment, as well as any scholarships you’ve earned from outside sources. Parent and student loans are also available for interested families, although we will never require you to take out loans.
