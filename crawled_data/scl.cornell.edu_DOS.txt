He often serves a reminder of why I find this work so special. So I welcome you to the office of the Dean of students with the desire to pay that investment forward This office has a long and rich history of supporting students in their individual endeavors throughout their time at Cornell. My role as the Robert W. and Elizabeth C. Staley Dean of Students is to be an advocate for the student experience and seek to be highly engaged in conversations about the issues that impact undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. Along with my team, I am deeply invested in a transformational student experience and the opportunities to develop the tools that will shape your life during and after Cornell. The Office of the Dean of Students is focused on the co-curricular experience, the classroom outside of the classroom. We desire to enhance the academic life of all students and believe that learning continues and is made more meaningful through life in community. I am committed to building a sense of community and belonging among all students through identity conscious approaches that cultivate meaning-making. To facilitate this environment, I am committed to equity, inclusion, and justice in my approach to leading the units within the Office of the Dean of Students. Along with your triumphs, you will face challenges at Cornell, and we are here to support you in those moments too. Resilience comes from supporting each other in the best times as well as the difficult times. From our Diversity and Inclusion teams and Care and Crisis Services, to the Community Response Team and Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards, each member of the Office of the Dean of Students staff is committed to connecting you to resources, being a thought partner in ethical decision making, and celebrating what makes you a unique member of the Cornell community. We shape this community together by investing in each other. I encourage you to engage deeply in Cornellâ€™s curricular and co-curricular opportunities. My team and I are ready and able to help you find the answers you need, so please visit our office, schedule an appointment, or give us a call. Marla Love Robert W. and Elizabeth C.
