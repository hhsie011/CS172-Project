This state-of-the-art facility, spearheaded by a transformational gift from Dan ’68 and Gayle D’Aniello, will serve as the center of veteran life on the campus of Syracuse University, in the local community, and across Central New York. Specifically, the NVRC will function as a bridge to forging public-private partnerships, a collaborative space to nurture academic research and actionable programming, and a forum to facilitate collaborative thought leadership – all for the purpose of advancing the social, economic, and wellness concerns of the nation’s veterans and their families. The building was dedicated November 3, 2021, in recognition of the 10-year anniversary of the Institute for Veterans and Military Families, which has served more than 160,000 veterans and their families and is now located in the NVRC.
