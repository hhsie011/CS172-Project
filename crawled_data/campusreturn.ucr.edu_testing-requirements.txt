Anyone who receives a positive PCR test result, and recovers, should pause this testing protocol for 90 days unless they develop new symptoms. When do I need to confirm a positive test result with a second test? A positive antigen test must be confirmed with a PCR test. A positive PCR test does not require a second test to confirm. If you are coming to a campus testing site to confirm a positive antigen test, please wear your mask, keep six feet of distance, and go to the front of the line to notify the testing staff.
