General suggestions are available on the Cornell Graduate Student Admissions website. We request that you use headings for the following four sections for the Statement of Purpose: (1) Personal background, experience, and motivation (400-word limit): Introduce yourself, what are your personal motivations to come to graduate school, your short and long-term professional goals, and how did you get here? Please describe how your background and experiences influenced your decision to pursue a graduate degree.

You may also provide the context around any perceived gaps or weaknesses in your academic record. (3) Future research (400 words): What research questions would you like to explore as a graduate student? This is in no way binding - it is only intended to give us an indication of where your research interests and approaches are headed. If you have written a proposal for future research (e.g., NSF predoctoral fellowship), those ideas should be included here. 4) Importance of community, diversity, and inclusion (400 words): We strive to build a diverse and inclusive community that strengthens our intellectual and collaborative department. Please provide insight into your potential to contribute to a community of inclusion, belonging, and respect where scholars representing diverse backgrounds, perspectives, abilities, and experiences can learn and work productively and positively together. Within sections 1 and 4 of the Statement of Purpose, you may also include relevant information on any of the following: How your personal, academic, and/or professional experiences demonstrate your ability to be both persistent and resilient especially when navigating challenging circumstances. How you engage with others and have facilitated and/or participated in productive teams. How you have experienced or come to understand the barriers faced by others whose experiences and backgrounds may differ from your own. Your service and/or leadership in efforts to advance diversity, inclusion, access, and equity especially by those from backgrounds historically underrepresented and/or marginalized. If relevant, how your research interests focus on issues related to diversity, inclusion, access, inequality, and/or equity.
