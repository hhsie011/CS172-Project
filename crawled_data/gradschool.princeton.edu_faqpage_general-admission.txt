No. If you have questions about which department would be the best fit for you, please visit our fields of study page. Once you have narrowed it down to a few choices, contact those departments directly. Can I visit the campus? The campus is open to explore on your own or you can take a student-led Orange Key Tour. I have specific questions about the program and/or faculty, who should I contact? The Graduate Program Administrator for that department. You will find an email link to the GPA for each department on the fields of study page. May I take graduate classes at Princeton without being admitted into a program? No. Does the Graduate School admit for spring and/or summer? No, new students are admitted once a year beginning in the fall. May I pursue my degree part-time? No. May I transfer credits from another college or university to Princeton’s graduate program? Princeton does not operate on a credit system. Therefore, no provision exists for transferring credit received for work at other institutions. Ph.D. students who have completed work elsewhere should be able to present themselves for the general examination in a correspondingly shorter time and should discuss this with the director of graduate studies in their program. How long are Ph.D. programs? The defined Ph.D. program length is generally five years, with few exceptions of four year programs.
