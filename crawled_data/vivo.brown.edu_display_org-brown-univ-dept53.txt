We offer a wide range of undergraduate and graduate courses that form the core of modern experimental biology. Our faculty offer training in genetics, biochemistry, developmental biology, cellular biology, molecular biology, genomics, and proteomics. Departmental research employs state of the art optical tools such as electron and confocal scanning microscopy, physical techniques such as X-ray diffraction, and innovative techniques in molecular biology. The Department is devoted to cutting-edge research that addresses basic questions in biology, including the control of gene expression, cell fate determination, protein synthesis, the genetics of behavior, control of the cell cycle, signaling pathways within the cell, and the role of prions in cellular activity. A distinguished faculty, well-represented on editorial and professional boards and societies, directs undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral work in the Department.
