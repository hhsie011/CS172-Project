About Admission Program Requirements Contacts TYLER SCHOOL OF ART AND ARCHITECTURE About the Program The Photography program at the Tyler School of Art and Architecture is a two-year, 60-credit program leading to the Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) degree. The program offers students close mentorship, top facilities, and interdisciplinary approaches, drawing on the resources available in Tyler’s broad range of studio art programs as well as its architecture and environmental design programs. Whether students want to make bold moves into other disciplines through the lens of photography or be trained as classic still photographers, the breadth of faculty expertise and programs at Tyler offers a pathway, guided by one-on-one attention from faculty. Students have access to both the resources of a large public research university and the warmth, support, and spirit of collaboration that has come to define the Tyler Photography community. Tyler M.F.A. students take advantage of faculty and alumni relationships in the photography and art world and the school’s location in Philadelphia, a vibrant art center with a pioneering photographic tradition, and its proximity to New York and Washington, D.C., to grow their creative practices and careers. Time Limit for Degree Completion: 4 years Campus Location: Main Full-Time/Part-Time Status: Full-time status is required. Interdisciplinary Study: Tyler students expand their technical and conceptual approaches to their work through studio and seminar classes, and become actively involved in the broader art community by curating an ongoing series of exhibitions by established and emerging artists. Through Art History classes, electives, and seminars, students are engaged in emerging topics in the field and the broader art world. Study Abroad: Students may elect to spend one of the two years of the program at Temple University Rome, a home base for immersive artistic, academic, and cultural exploration for Tyler students since 1966. Accreditation: This degree program is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD). Areas of Specialization: The Photography area houses studios that facilitate the use of various creative approaches to the medium, including black-and-white printmaking, critical theory, experimental and digital imaging, handmade cameras, historical processes, large-format photography, offset production, professional digital color, and career options for artists.
