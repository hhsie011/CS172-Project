The Office of the Provost is home to the ombuds serving faculty and graduate students; the Office of Human Resources manages the program for classified staff. This program's practices and procedures are guided by the Standards of Practice and Code of Ethics (pdf) established by the International Ombudsman Association (IOA). Prohibition of Retaliation Attempts to intimidate or retaliate against a person for utilizing the Georgia Tech Ombudsman Program is contrary to the program's purpose and is unacceptable.
