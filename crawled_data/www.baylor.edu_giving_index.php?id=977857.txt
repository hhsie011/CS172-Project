Scholarships open doors to intellectual and spiritual discovery, to deeper knowledge, to greater dreams and to the courage to follow those dreams. A gift to student scholarships is a gift that can change a life. For anyone who has experienced Baylor's diverse community, caring faculty, and distinctive offering of an education infused by academic excellence in a Christian environment, Baylor is an extraordinary place. Each year, Baylor attracts an increasing number of qualified students and welcomes over 3,000 first-time college students to campus from across the U.S. and around the world. The escalating costs of higher education, however, are making it more and more difficult for families to afford a quality educational experience. At Baylor, we aren't simply studying the statistics, we are responding with a renewed focus on increasing student scholarships. Whether giving to current scholarships or to establish or grow a scholarship fund, your gift will make a difference in the lives of Baylor students. General Scholarship Fund Supporting the General Scholarship Fund allows students the opportunity to pursue their best selves at Baylor University.
