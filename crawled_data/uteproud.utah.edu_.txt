The University, as the flagship of higher education in Utah, takes pride in carrying the name with understanding and respect toward our state’s namesake people. This website was created to encourage the entire U community—students, faculty, staff, fans, alumni, supporters—to learn more about the Ute culture, heritage and the history of our region. Ute history is Utah history so that we can all be “Ute Proud.” History of the Ute Tribe Little is written about the Utes before the 1600s, when European explorers encountered them in lands now known as Utah, Colorado and northern New Mexico. How long they had been there is not known. Ute oral tradition indicates they were always there. Learn More Relationship A Memorandum of Understanding outlines the official relationship between the Ute Indian Tribe and the University, but the ties go much deeper than the document signed in 2005 and renewed in 2014. The futures of the Ute people and the University connect through education. Learn More Respect Just as our athletes do their very best on the field, so do the fans in our stands. As Ute fans, we bear special responsibility to the Ute Indian Tribe, the school’s and state’s namesake, and we use the Ute name with honor and respect.
