These relationships provide opportunities for undergraduate students to study abroad, graduate students to engage with peers and mentors, faculty to conduct individual or collaborative research with colleagues, and to implement innovative curricula for students. These international collaborations also allow students, visiting scholars, and faculty from partner universities to come to Brown and participate in teaching, research, and community activities. Today, Brown is focused on strengthening existing partnerships and on exploring innovative approaches to the development of new partnerships. As such, we are expanding partnerships through multi-lateral collaborations to ensure a truly international and transnational approach to sustained dialogues on specific fields of inquiry and topics. Our partnerships seek to foster an innovative approach to collaboration and include activities spanning from video-conferencing classrooms across continents to bringing students together for blended and experiential study. We welcome representatives of international institutions who seek to initiate collaborations with Brown to contact the Office of Global Engagement.
