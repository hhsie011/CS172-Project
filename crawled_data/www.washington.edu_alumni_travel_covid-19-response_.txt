Yet the rate of vaccinated individuals continues to grow in our community and around the world. That is exciting and bright news for the travel industry! As we move forward, please know that your safety remains our number one priority as you travel with your fellow Huskies and friends. Our tour operators have diligently worked to put health and safety protocols in place. These protocols may change based on up-to-date conditions at a tour’s destination. Thank you for your ongoing support of UW Alumni Tours. We look forward to helping you plan safe and fulfilling experiences as you explore this incredible world. 2022 Tour Reservations Travelers with reservations on fall trips will be notified by the tour operator via email on any status updates. In the event of a postponed or canceled trip, operators will provide you with options for next steps. Your best resource for questions about your current reservation is with the tour operator. Their contact information can be found in the next section, “Tour Operator Health & Safety Protocols.” Tour Operator Health & Safety Protocols When travel resumes, it will be incredibly important that travelers and tour operators work together to keep each other safe. Traveler safety is top priority for our tour operators. They have developed health and safety protocols which they will update as new information is available or conditions at a destination change.
