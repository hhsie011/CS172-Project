Such high-dimensional realities from either simulation or experimental data makes direct computational analysis, compression, and/or probing tasks such as outer-loop optimization, design, and/or uncertainty quantification computationally infeasible. One paradigm for addressing such a challenge is mathematics-based model reduction, which aims to find and exploit low-dimensional structure in high-dimensional models to generate a computationally efficient emulator, often with provable accuracy guarantees. A complementary class of approaches is found in low-rank approximation and statistics where data reduction techniques can efficiently explore and mine parsimonious summarizations of high-dimensional datasets. One major goal of the Spring 2020 program, and the foundational theme for this proposed...

Since the program, some students have begun successful technical careers in mathematics and computation, and some have matriculated in graduate school programs. This in-person reunion event, to be held from June 9-10, 2022 at ICERM, aims to rekindle professional relationships and possibly spark new directions for research. The tentative schedule during the reunion event is: Thursday, June 9 9:00am-10:00am: Introduction 10:00am-11:00am: Coffee/social 11:00am-12:00pm: Panel #1: Academic panel 12:00am-2:00pm: Lunch 2:00pm-4:00pm: â€œLife after my Summer@ICERMâ€ talks Friday, June 10 8:30am-10:00am: Coffee/social 10:00am-11:00pm: Panel #2: Industry...

We invite members of the community to join us on Friday, June 10th as Drs. Kavita Ramanan, Richard Schwartz, and Joseph Silverman give their ICM talks here at ICERM. Close View Event Page Summer@ICERM 2022: Computational Combinatorics Jun 13 - Aug 5, 2022 Undergraduate Research Summer@ICERM 2022: Computational Combinatorics Jun 13 - Aug 5, 2022 × The Summer@ICERM faculty advisers will present a variety of research projects on the combinatorics of parking functions. This overarching theme will allow participants to study and analyze parking functions by leveraging computational techniques and theory. Faculty will also guide the development of open-source computational tools for analyzing parking functions and their statistics, with time devoted to creating a database of parking functions and their generalizations. Throughout the eight-week program, 18-22 students will work on their projects in groups of two to four, supervised by faculty advisors and aided by teaching assistants. Students will meet daily, give regular talks about their findings, attend mini-courses, guest talks, and professional development seminars, and will acquire skills in free software development. Students will learn how to collaborate mathematically, working closely in their teams to write up their research into a paper. Organizing Committee Susanna Fishel Pamela E. Harris Gordon Rojas Kirby Close View Event Page Prediction and Variability of Air-Sea Interactions: the South Asian Monsoon Jun 13 - 15, 2022 Topical Workshop Prediction and Variability of Air-Sea Interactions: the South Asian Monsoon Jun 13 - 15, 2022 × A challenge for mathematical modeling, from toy dynamical system models to full weather and climate models, is applying data assimilation and dynamical systems techniques to models that exhibit chaos and stochastic variability in the presence of coupled slow and fast modes of variability. Recent collaborations between universities and government agencies in India and the United States have resulted in detailed observations of oceanic and atmospheric processes in the Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea, and the Indian Ocean, collectively observing manyÂ coupled modes of variability. One key target identified by these groups was the improvement of forecasts of variability of the summer monsoon, which significantly affects agriculture and water management practices throughout South Asia.Â The Monsoon Intraseasonal Oscillation is a northward propagating mode of precipitation variability and is one of the most conspicuous examples of coupled atmosphere-ocean processes during the summer...

In order to advance the mathematics community's understanding of the complexity of computational social justice work, the program will have four emphasis areas (1) networks, (2) policy, (3) education and (4) community-driven research. While the program itself is broadly computational and applied mathematics, researchers with expertise and interests in network science and analysis, open science and data, and computer science are particularly encouraged to apply. As a new field emerges at the face of computational and applied mathematics and social justice, this requires new methods for working across community lines. The organizers are committed...

This workshop will bring together social scientists, digital humanists, computational scientists, and mathematicians with experience in network theory and network analysis in social systems. This workshop will also showcase how mixed methods research (which combines qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis) with multidisciplinary perspectives leads to deeper insights and more ethical and responsible approaches. Workshop organizers will lead tutorials in the mathematics of network theory, finding and working with network data, and qualitative methods for networks in the social sciences. We will emphasize and showcase the use of a critical lens throughout the process, from model building to data collection and analysis, connecting us to a broader dialogue about algorithmic...

Over the last few years, these systems have become highly sophisticated and have learnt a large amount of mathematics. One has to be open to the idea these systems will change the way mathematics is done, and how it is taught in universities. At the ICERM workshop "Lean for the Curious Mathematician 2022", experts in the Lean theorem prover will explain how to do number theory, topology, geometry, analysis, and algebra in the Lean theorem prover. This will be accessible to mathematicians without a specific background in computer-proof systems. The material covered will range from undergraduate mathematics to modern research. Participants will be invited to begin formalizing mathematical objects from their own research. Application Deadline: March 7, 2022.

The program will bring together leading mathematicians in both areas, along with researchers working in related applied fields, for the first-ever long-term joint program. The main directions of the program will include: the Fourier approach to Geometric Tomography, the study of geometric properties of solids based on information about their sections and projections, Volume and Duality, Bellman technique for extremal problems of harmonic analysis, and various types of convexity of solutions of corresponding Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation, as well as numerical computations and computer-assisted proofs applied to the aforementioned problems. The computational part will cover theoretical aspects (optimal algorithms, and why they work) as well as more applied ones (implementation).
