Definitions For all purposes of this Agreement the following terms, as used herein, will have the meanings specified below: 1.1 “Aggregate Consideration” means an amount equal to: In the case of an Asset Sale, the sum of (a) all cash, and the fair market value of all securities or other property transferred to the Optionee at the time of the transaction, less all current and long‐term liabilities (but not contingent liabilities) of the Optionee that are not discharged or assumed by the buyer (or its affiliates) in connection with the Asset Sale, and (b) all cash, and the fair market value of all securities and other property for Trailing Consideration payable to the Optionee, when and if, actually paid; or In the case of a Merger or Stock Sale, the sum of (a) all cash, and the fair market value of all securities and other property transferred to the stockholders of the Optionee (and any option holders or warrant holders) in return for their stock (or options or warrants) in the Optionee at the time of the transaction, and (b) all cash, and the fair market value of all securities and other property transferred to the stockholders of the Optionee (and any option holders or warrant holders) for Trailing Consideration payable to the holders of Optionee’s securities, when and if actually paid. The valuation of any securities or other property shall be determined by reference to the operative transaction agreement for a Liquidation Event, provided that, if no such valuation is readily determinable 2 from such operative transaction agreement, then for securities for which there is an active public market; – If traded on a securities exchange or the NASDAQ Stock Market, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing prices of the securities on such exchange or market over the 30‐ day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing of such transaction; or – If actively traded over‐the‐counter, the value shall be deemed to be the average of the closing bid prices over the 30‐day period ending three (3) days prior to the closing of such transaction. The method of valuation of securities subject to investment letters or other similar restrictions on free marketability shall take into account an appropriate discount from the market value as determined pursuant to either clause above so as to reflect the approximate fair market value thereof. For securities for which there is no active public market, the value shall be the fair market value thereof as either (i) determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of Optionee, (ii) approved by the University, such approval not to be unreasonable withheld, or (iii) determined by a third party appraiser appointed and paid for by Optionee. 1.3 “Asset Sale” means a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Optionee (or that portion of its assets related to the Improvements). 1.4 “Improvements” means any new technology, discovery, invention, or copyrightable work conceived, developed, derived, improved, and/or invented solely by UC or jointly by UC with Company as a result of funding from UC. Improvements shall not include any new technology, discovery, invention or copyrightable work conceived, developed, derived, improved, and/or invented solely by Company, provided that there was no funding from UC and/or no employee of UC was working within the scope of their employment. Improvements shall further include intellectual property listed in Exhibit C and identified as Improvements. 1.5 “Initial Public Offering” means the effectiveness of a registration statement for the first sale of Optionee’s common stock in a firm commitment underwritten public offering registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 1.6 “License Agreement” means a license agreement according to the terms and conditions in Exhibit B. 1.7 “Liquidation Event” means a (i) a merger, share exchange or other reorganization (“Merger”), (ii) Stock Sale or (iii) Asset Sale in which for (i), (ii) and (iii) above, the stockholders of the Optionee prior to such transaction do not own a majority of the voting power of the acquiring, surviving or successor entity, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Liquidation Event shall not include a bona fide financing transaction in which voting control of the Optionee transfers to one or more persons or entities who acquire shares of Optionee capital stock from Optionee in exchange for either an investment in Optionee or the cancellation of indebtedness owed by Optionee, or a combination thereof. 1.8 “Option Period” means the period beginning on the Effective Date and extending to twelve (12) months after the Effective Date. The Option Period is renewable by Optionee for up to two (2) additional periods of twelve (12) months as long as all Accelerator Program milestones have been met.
