The Shared Services Center (SSC) is a part of the University's Process Improvement project which provides a range of finance, human resources, and payroll services to campus administrative divisions. This business model creates a single service-oriented unit by bringing together similar business activities historically managed within individual departments. The goal is to assist departmental staff with the completion of transactional processes and optimize the amount of time spent on University, College, Division, and departmental initiatives. This is accomplished by transferring some of the more routine work to the SSC.
