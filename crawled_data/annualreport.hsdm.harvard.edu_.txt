As we navigated an everchanging landscape in FY21, we adapted and became adept at leading through change. This report highlights the extraordinary efforts of our faculty, students, and staff, and how they rose to the challenge. It demonstrates exciting progress made across our organization in education, clinical care, research, and diversity and inclusion. The year also provided opportunities for reflection and evaluation of our priorities and programs. We launched an in-depth research review and then a strategic planning process that will inform our goals and mission in the months and years ahead. What remained constant throughout this year is our dedication to the core values and educational mission of HSDM—this binds us together and makes our School an exceptional community dedicated to advancing dental medicine. Our alumni and supporters are important to sustaining this mission and propelling us forward. We are deeply grateful for their support, and we’re pleased to highlight them in this report. Many exciting opportunities lie ahead. We look forward to expanding our strategic vision, making new research discoveries, and investing in talented students and faculty to lead the profession. Thank you to our dedicated alumni, friends, and colleagues for your steadfast support of HSDM. -William V. Giannobile, DDS, DMSc96, PD96 Dean, Harvard School of Dental Medicine Table of Contents Education Finding Silver Linings Clinical Care Caring for the Community Research Reshaping Research Student Life and Learning Inspiring Outreach Alumni and Giving Making Strides Leadership Building Momentum Education “My four years at HSDM have been an incredible time of growth. Every day has presented new challenges and experiences that have strengthened my passion for dentistry.” -Nicholas DeMeo, DMD21 Finding Silver Linings Throughout an extraordinary year, Harvard School of Dental Medicine educators and students found ways to turn challenges into opportunities. When faced with adapting to virtual learning formats during the pandemic, they saw the opportunity to study how to best deliver dental education in new and uncharted territory. The outcome of their published research could shape the future of dental education for years to come. Faculty members like Hiroe Ohyama, assistant professor of Restorative Dentistry and Biomaterials Sciences and director of Predoctoral Operative Dentistry, recognized that students felt distant during remote learning and realized the best way to engage them would be to include them in the process of examining new learning models. “We conducted several survey studies remotely, but together. We learned the importance of minimizing student fatigue and improving student engagement during remote lectures, and the advantage of faculty giving lectures with more case-based interactive activities, among other findings,” Ohyama said. Faculty and student research resulted in a series of papers published in the Journal of Dental Education. Ohyama was recognized with a national award from the American Dental Education Association (ADEA) for her innovative work. Faculty also found creative ways to deliver course content, even sending kits and instruments to students at home. Despite pauses in clinical time, all students in the Class of 2021 graduated on time—an accomplishment Dean William Giannobile credits to faculty members going above and beyond to help students complete their requirements. Dr. Hiroe Ohyama DMD Class of 2025 18 different states 11 countries 69% women 31% men Clinical Care “This is a unique opportunity for us to fill a critical gap in care at a time when continuity of oral healthcare and maintaining overall health is so vital. It is also very much at the heart of HSDM’s clinical and educational mission.” -William V. Giannobile, Dean Caring for the Community Maintaining a high level of patient care, and delivering care safely throughout the pandemic, have been essential to HSDM’s clinical operations. While closely following local and state COVID protocols, the Harvard Dental Center’s practices were able to gradually reopen to full capacity in FY21 and patient visits began to return to pre-pandemic levels. A milestone was reached in February 2021, when HSDM opened its first practice in Harvard Square, bridging the Longwood and Cambridge campuses. HSDM stepped in to fill a need for dental care that was left when Harvard University Health Services (HUHS) announced its Dental Service would close. With the opening of the Harvard Dental Center Cambridge location, patients of the former HUHS practice were able to continue their care with minimal interruption. Now with a presence in Harvard Square, the School is poised to offer a high level of care to the greater Harvard and Cambridge communities. Additionally, HSDM students were able to complete all their clinical requirements and competency standards despite reduced clinical availability. Faculty gave their clinical practice time to students and worked nights and evenings to ensure the Class of 2021 met their requirements for graduation. Patient Population 47,041 Active patients 32,845 Dental appointments Research “We have exciting new opportunities ahead to increase research diversity, establish new collaborations, and scale our funding, which will better bridge basic and clinical research with enhanced vigor and excellence.” -Yingzi Yang, Associate Dean for Research Reshaping Research Research activities ramped up in FY21 with labs fully reopened, resulting in a productive year supported by $6.8 million in grant funding. A robust external review of HSDM’s research infrastructure in spring of FY21 provided key insights for additional growth and collaboration that build upon HSDM’s existing core strengths. The review found opportunities to leverage HSDM’s research excellence in the basic sciences, expanding on strengths in developmental and skeletal biology, to align with clinical-translational interests and research in the areas of regenerative medicine, genomics, stem cell and craniofacial biology. Under the leadership of Dr. Yingzi Yang, who took on the role of Associate Dean for Research in FY21, HSDM will focus on ways to build on existing areas of strength and momentum; expand collaboration with between basic science researchers and clinical faculty; and capitalize on partnerships with other Harvard schools, institutes, and hospitals. Faculty recruitment, mentorship, and career development were also identified in the review as key areas for improvement. The committee recommended that expanded resources be made available for junior faculty, from initial recruitment through promotion, to bolster support mechanisms for early-career scientists. grant program. Investigators can apply for pilot grants of up to $100,000 over a period of two years, and equipment grants of up to $100,000 over a period of two years. “I am grateful to the committee for dedicating themselves in reviewing HSDM’s research programs. Their insights and recommendations will advance our mission as we look at ways to strengthen our research community to attract and cultivate talented clinician-scientists to advance dental, oral, and craniofacial research at HSDM,” said Dean William Giannobile. By the numbers $6,352,430 Federal Funding $406,674 Non-Federal Funding 320 Papers published Student life and learning “In addition to being a cherished tradition, GKAS is a special opportunity for HSDM as an institution to give back to the communities that we vowed to serve.” -Ziwei Chen, DMD23 Inspiring Outreach In FY21, HSDM students spearheaded outreach efforts to reach vulnerable patients and pave the way for greater access to oral health care and dental education. Even during a pandemic, student organizers were committed to hosting outreach events such as the annual Give Kids a Smile (GKAS) event due to the critical need for dental care. “The pandemic has created financial strain and has further contributed to a lack of access to dental care for many individuals,” Ziwei Chen, DMD23 said. “Preventative dental care is always important for all patients; however, children are a vulnerable population whose normal day-to-day routines have been turned upside down.” ODI student ambassadors GKAS was re-envisioned to comply with all new COVID-19 safety protocols and incorporate new virtual tele-dentistry appointments which allowed providers to expand care beyond the clinic and accommodate more than three times the number of patients virtually. Later the same year, HSDM students organized the School’s first Give Veterans a Smile event to provide veterans with free dental care and consultations, and address gaps in veterans’ access to oral healthcare. Over 30 predoctoral students volunteered for the event along with residents from AGE specialty programs, faculty, and Harvard Dental Center staff members. Veterans from several branches of the military attended. HSDM students were also recognized for their work in diversity and inclusion efforts. The Bridge to Dental School Program, organized by Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) student ambassadors, was named a recipient of INSIGHT Into Diversity magazine’s 2021 Inspiring Programs in STEM Award. Students serve as instructors in the program and assist pre-dental students from backgrounds underrepresented in dentistry in navigating the dental school application process. Additionally, HSDM’s Wampanoag Outreach Group was recognized with a Harvard Medical School (HMS) Dean’s Community Service Award for their work to provide better access to oral and systemic health care to the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (WTGH), as well as other underserved communities on the island of Martha’s Vineyard. Alumni and giving “The Freeman, Grant, Franklin Scholarship means more than just a monetary aid. For me, the significance behind the scholarship and the generosity of the donors demonstrates HSDM’s efforts to facilitate greater representation of minorities in the healthcare field.” -Hoda Mahmoud, DMD25 Making Strides Meaningful gifts to HSDM have made it possible for students underrepresented in dentistry to pursue their dream of a Harvard dental education. The Freeman, Grant, Franklin Scholarship, activated in FY21 with the support of numerous alumni and friends, and a capstone gift from Colgate-Palmolive, is already making an impact for one student. Hoda Mahmoud, DMD25, the School’s first recipient of the scholarship arrived on campus this past summer as a first-year dental student from Chicago, eager start her studies and learn more about integration of oral health and systemic health. Mahmoud hopes her dental education will lead to opportunities in public health research, and the chance to minimize the negative effects that socioeconomic status can have on patient care. “Growing up, I rarely came across dentists that looked like me. Only later did I make the connection that it was not the lack of interest in the field; rather, it was the lack of opportunities and representation in dentistry,” Mahmoud said. “The scholarship is a decisive step forward in the struggle to achieve our longstanding goal of equity for predoctoral students from underrepresented racial minorities in dentistry, said Dolores “Mercedes” Franklin, DMD74, PD76, one of the trailblazers for which the scholarship is named. “It holds the promise of attracting highly-qualified students with financial need and preparing them to be global leaders—leaders in their fields dedicated to improving human health, and in doing so, addressing health disparities.” Mahmoud’s incoming DMD class is one of the most diverse in recent years with one-third of the new students coming from populations underrepresented in dental medicine. Additional funding from annual gifts helped bolster tuition support for several new students, enabling HSDM to attract a broader and more diverse pool of DMD candidates. The FGF scholarship now ensures HSDM can attract students like Hoda and can continue to make strides in diversifying the field of dentistry. Dr. Brian Swann with first-year dental student Kaila Daniels Funding Success $1,904,976 Funds raised in FY21 468 Number of gifts in FY21 1/3 Of incoming students received financial support 1/3 of new students are from backgrounds underrepresented in dental medicine Leadership “We have a unique opportunity to build on HSDM’s strengths and set a new course for the School’s future.” -William V. GIannobile, Dean Building Momentum Key leadership roles were initiated in FY21 to support areas of emerging focus under Dean William Giannobile’s vision. In Development and Alumni Relations (DAR), Jody Johnson who began her career at Harvard, returned to join HSDM as associate dean for DAR. She brings over 20 years of experience in securing major and principal gifts; leading development teams, programs, and events; and recruiting volunteer leaders to bolster philanthropy. In Research, Dr. Yingzi Yang, an accomplished developmental geneticist with HSDM since 2015, took on the role of Associate Dean of Research at HSDM, expanding on her previous role as Associate Dean for Translational Research. HSDM Leadership Retreat In Faculty Affairs, Dr. John Da Silva, also took on a new role as associate dean for Faculty Affairs and Development to bring his many years of expertise to the critical work of promoting faculty through mentoring and development programs. In the Dean’s Office, Kate Rezendes, joined HSDM from Brown University’s School of Public Health. She serves in a newly formed role as Dean Giannobile’s Chief of Staff. Also within the Dean’s Office, Heather Denny became Senior Director of Communications, taking on an expanded role to elevate HSDM’s Communications efforts. Serving in key interim roles, Dr. Howard Howell, a long-serving HSDM leader and A. Lee Loomis Professor of Periodontology, took on the role of interim chair for the Department of Oral Medicine, Infection, and Immunity while a search is underway. And in the Office of Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging (DIB), Dr. Brian Swann, well-known for his involvement in oral health outreach, stepped into role of interim assistant dean for DIB while a full-time faculty member is being recruited for the position. In the fall, HSDM leaders participated in a two-day retreat to embark on an in-depth strategic planning process. They identified broad categories in education, research and discovery, clinical care delivery and innovation, and community to explore, and formed working groups to encourage broad participation in the process with stakeholders across the School. The strategic plan, expected to launch this spring, will set HSDM’s priorities and guide the School over the next three to five years.
