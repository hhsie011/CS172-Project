PreviousNext About Us Dartmouth graduates who have completed the ROTC program are commissioned as second lieutenants in the U.S. Army. We also support students who wish to enter the Navy or Marine Corps. The program is flexible enough to allow students to seek leave-term opportunities and enroll in Language Study Abroad and the Foreign Study Program. Courses ROTC is an elective taken with other college courses and normally covers four years, divided between basic and advanced courses. The classes require about five hours weekly. Once each term, cadets train at our partner institution, Norwich University. Scholarships Two- to four-year ROTC scholarships at Dartmouth are based on merit, not financial need. We provide full tuition or room and board, and an allowance for living expenses.
