The student should also have some familiarity with applications of advanced calculus and should have had courses in linear algebra and modern abstract algebra at an advanced level. Applicants are required to submit GRE general and mathematics subject test scores; scores need to be reported by January 15. Non-native English speaking applicants must also submit minimum TOEFL scores of Writing: 20, Listening: 15, Reading: 20, and Speaking: 22 (Internet-based test). all Graduate School Requirements, including the TOEFL Exam or IELTS Academic Exam for non-native English applicants TOEFL scores of Writing: 20, Listening: 15, Reading: 20, and Speaking: 22 three recommendations GRE general test* GRE subject test in mathematics* *Due to COVID-19, GRE General and Subject Test scores will not be required or considered for fall 2022 admissions. Learning Outcomes The PhD program in mathematics teaches you to create and communicate mathematics. The chief requirement for the doctoral degree is to complete under the guidance of an advisor a dissertation which makes an original and substantial contribution to its subject matter. You will be expected to disseminate the main results of your dissertation in the form of journal articles and conference presentations. We do not require you to choose a specific research area or a dissertation advisor at the outset of your graduate education. The best way to make an informed choice of a research area and to make headway in it is to gain knowledge in a number of areas of mathematics. As a beginning student you will be taking various required core courses in basic subjects. Furthermore, aside from providing research training we prepare our students for careers as professional mathematicians in a variety of settings including academia, business and government. Our aim therefore is to educate flexible and broadly knowledgeable mathematicians, and to this end we offer besides the core courses a wide selection of advanced courses and seminars. We will help you develop the oral and written communication skills expected of a professional mathematician. You will acquire these skills in part through courses and dissertation work. Active participation in our many seminars, several of which are targeted to students, is another way to improve your presentation skills and will also ease your transition from a learner to a researcher of mathematics. In addition, many practising mathematicians are involved in teaching at some level, and that is why we require every student to undergo our teaching assistant training program and to participate in the teaching mission of the mathematics department.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
