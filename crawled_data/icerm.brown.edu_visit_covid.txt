Starting in fall 2021, we anticipate that all ICERM scientific programming will be held in person at the institute. Those who cannot attend in-person can live-stream our lectures. Through the end of 2021, ICERM will support virtual participation for people unable to travel to our workshops and semester programs. Participants must apply in advance via Cube for their program of interest, be accepted, and submit the required vaccination attestation in order to attend ICERM programs in person. Speakers and organizers are pre-registered for their associated workshop(s) and do not need to apply. Exemptions from the vaccination requirement from short-term/workshop visitors will not be given. However, if a visitor is an individual with a disability, the individual may seek reasonable accommodations. No unregistered program participants will be allowed at ICERM, even with proof of vaccination. Individuals visiting semester program participants or staff must be accompanied by a Brown ID holder at all times. Anyone visiting more than once for scientific purposes will need to apply via the program page and be processed as noted above.
