The DAR is used by both students and staff of these schools to aid in advisement and analyze students' progress toward the degree. The report is updated once a week on Sunday night. The DAR is an unofficial document and not a substitute for a transcript, certification, or any other official University document. Deans and advisors are the final authorities on whether program and University requirements have been met. The Degree Audit Report includes: An assessment of overall degree requirements, including total points earned and GPA. A display of internal and external transfer credit with a listing of all courses taken by the student. Course exclusions such as those based on incomplete or failing grades, and duplicate courses. Exceptions approved and submitted by advisors.
