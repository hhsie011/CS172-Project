A student for each ceremony will be selected by a panel of faculty, administrators, and students to share an inspirational message at the respective ceremonies. Eligibility Applicants must be graduates at their ceremony. Selected finalists must be in both academic and judicial good standing. Those who have a history of participation in campus and/or community activities are preferred, but not required. Speech Requirements The reflection speech is two to three minutes in length (approximately 250 words). The reflection message should be secular in tone, providing inspiration to the graduates, recounting times with other Tech students, and calling the audience to action around a certain message. Applicants must feel comfortable speaking at a podium in front of a very large audience. We encourage students to view previous speeches and visit with the Communication Center to help them prepare their speech. Selection Process All submissions will be reviewed by a committee consisting of faculty and staff, who will select multiple finalists. Those finalists will then be asked to present a full version of their speech to the committee during the spring semester. Once selected, the speaker is required to work with the Communication Center during the semester and meet in-person with event organizers for final review prior to Commencement. Students do not need to be living on campus to qualify, but must return to campus by Thursday, May 5. Application Deadline Click here for the application page and FAQs.
