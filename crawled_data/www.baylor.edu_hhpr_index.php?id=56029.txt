Over the last 20 years, there has been an increased research focus on the role of exercise and nutrition on health, performance, and disease. There has also been an increased interest in identifying strategies to reduce risk to chronic diseases through behavioral modification and wellness intervention programs. The goal of this research has been to identify ways to optimize performance, health, and quality of life. Clinically-related research on preventive and rehabilitative health represents one of the strongest areas for private and public funding. There are also significant resources available to implement community-based fitness and wellness education programs particularly to under-served communities. Historically, research in this area has been conducted in a multidisciplinary manner through the collaborative efforts of scientists trained in exercise physiology, nutrition, rehabilitation, health, psychology, chemistry, molecular biology, nursing, and/or medicine. While this collaborative approach has been successful, there has been a well-recognized need to develop doctoral programs that integrate exercise science and nutrition so that researchers are better prepared to conduct multidisciplinary health science research. Our program is one of few designed to train specialists in the areas of exercise science and nutrition. Some highlights of our doctoral program: Uniqueness of the program - The STEM program is uniquely designed to train researchers to conduct multidisciplinary clinical research evaluating the role of exercise and nutrition on health, disease, rehabilitation, and performance. Academic flexibility - Students work closely with their faculty advisor to develop a course schedule that best meets the student’s professional goals. Excellent faculty - Our outstanding Department faculty have been ranked one of the ‘most productive’ in scholarship at Baylor University. Mentoring – Student faculty collaboration on research and community service projects Competitive assistantships with opportunities for teaching and research - Doctoral students are typically funded to work in Baylor Laboratories for Exercise Science and Technology and Exercise Biochemical Nutrition Lab, and to teach lab sections of undergraduate courses such as Anatomy, Exercise Physiology, and Human Physiology for full tuition remission and stipend ($24,000). Career readiness - Our graduates find immediate employment in their chosen field, with most going on to tenure track faculty positions, and some to post-doctoral research fellowships and industry jobs.
