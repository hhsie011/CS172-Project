College courses taken ten (10) or more years prior to the term of application are removed from consideration for admission purposes. Once ignored, this coursework cannot be used to satisfy prerequisite or degree requirements at the University of Houston. Process First, submit an application through ApplyTexas or Common App. Submit just one application. Then, complete the Academic Fresh Start Acknowledgement. You must meet all admission or re-admission requirements, and you must submit official transcripts from all colleges or universities. Coursework completed within the last ten (10) years will be used in the evaluation for admission. If you don't have coursework within the last ten (10) years, you'll be considered for admission based on the freshman admission requirements. Financial Aid The AFS Program does not apply to the Standards of Academic Progress for financial aid applicants. Therefore, you may not qualify for financial aid based on prior academic performance.
