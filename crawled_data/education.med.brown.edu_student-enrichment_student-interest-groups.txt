AMS Student Groups provide over 80 opportunities to learn, serve, network, lead, create, relax, and support each other. Groups can vary from year to year, based on student interest. All AMS Student Groups must register with the Office of Student Affairs, which provides overall coordination and support. All student groups must abide by the Guidelines for Student Organizations. Click here for the Student Group Catalog, which includes descriptions and student contact information for all groups. Groups fall into four main categories: Advocacy/Service Groups serve others. Some groups partner with local schools, free clinics, or other nonprofits to provide ongoing outreach and service. Many groups target particular communities or health conditions. Several do broader or national advocacy work in health policy or other issues. Medical Association Representative Groups represent AMS as part of national medical associations (currently the American Medical Association, Association of Women Surgeons, Latino Medical School Association, Physicians for Human Rights, and Student National Medical Association). Specialty Interest Groups connect students to professional insight, research, networking, and mentoring opportunities in over twenty medical specialties, from Anesthesiology to Urology. Student Life Groups enhance AMS student life beyond medicine. Share your creativity in AMS journals and other student publications, your thoughts in discussions of books or films, or your voice in musical groups. Exercise through athletic groups or dance teams. Make a difference in the AMS community as part of groups working to improve sustainability, peer support, student health/wellness, or other issues at AMS. Please contact the Student Senate (ams-senate@brown.edu) or the Office of Student Affairs (medstudentaffairs@brown.edu) with any questions about student groups, including how to form or apply for funding for a new group.
