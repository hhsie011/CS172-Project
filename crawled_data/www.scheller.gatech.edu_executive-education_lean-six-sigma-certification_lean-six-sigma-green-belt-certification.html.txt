Georgia Tech Scheller's Lean Six Sigma (LSS) Green Belt program is designed for professionals from any industry or background interested in learning how to identify problems, analyze possibilities, and implement solutions for increasing productivity and efficiency in their organizations. Our LSS Green Belt training program requires no prior experience in process improvement methodologies. The program provides a full introduction into DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control) principles, a data-driven improvement cycle used for optimizing and stabilizing business processes. Lean Six Sigma Green Belt Certification Students who complete the LSS Green Belt program coursework and final process improvement project will receive their certification from the Georgia Tech Scheller College of Business. Students who choose to continue their studies and progress to the LSS Black Belt program do not need to complete their Green Belt process improvement project to advance and can complete a Black Belt level project to earn an LSS Black Belt certification.
