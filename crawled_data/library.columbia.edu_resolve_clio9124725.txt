Core Curriculum : Contemporary Civilization Home Aristotle Bibles The Quran Augustine Machiavelli Galileo Reformation Hobbes Revolutions Rights Freud Darwin Columbia University’s commitment to the Core Curriculum extends to the University Libraries' special collections. Columbia University Libraries preserve and provide access to important editions of, and in some cases autograph manuscripts by, many of the authors taught in the Core Curriculum. Additionally, the collections include subsequent editions, translations, and adaptations, which demonstrate the transmission and reception of these works across centuries and attest to their continuing importance. These online exhibitions were created as part of an Association of Research Libraries CEP Fellowship Summer 2011 based in Columbia University's Rare Book and Manuscript Library. The RBML staff welcomes Columbia undergraduates who would like to follow up on a potential research question related to any of these items to consult them in person. Instructions for using the library's collections can be found here. See also the exhibit on the Core Curriculum's course on Literature Humanities.
