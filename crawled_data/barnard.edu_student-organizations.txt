Barnard-based clubs include pre-professional organizations, such as the Athena Pre-Law Society; culture clubs, like BOSS and Q; and climate action organizations, such as Sprout Up NYC. On top of that, there are some 500 clubs at Columbia to choose from. Check out the clubs and chat with members at the annual Activities Fair. If you can’t find a club that fits, you can apply to start your own. The Breakfast Club, Barnard’s student leadership series, will guide you from launch to passing the torch and provide the skills you’ll use to make your mark long after graduation. “It’s good to just try things. That’s one of the great things about the school — there are so many clubs, and you can always try something and say, ‘This isn’t for me,’ and try again some other time.” — Alana Koenig ’18 Cultural & International Clubs Nearly 20 clubs and organizations help you explore your identity within Barnard’s diverse and international student body. Popular options include Q for the College’s queer community, and the Mujeres club for Barnard Latinas. Black students founded the Barnard Organization of Soul Sisters in 1968 and a year later gave College administrators a list of 10 demands. BOSS is still active on campus and, through mentorship and community, empowers its members to become leaders. Watch the video to learn more about the 50-year history.
