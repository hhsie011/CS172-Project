The law prohibits all forms of sex or gender-based discrimination in any education program or activity that receives federal funding. Some key issue areas in which institutions have Title IX obligations are: recruitment, admissions, and counseling; financial assistance; athletics; sex-based harassment; treatment of pregnant and parenting students; discipline; single-sex education; and employment. Also, an institution may not retaliate against any person for opposing an unlawful educational practice or policy, or made charges, testified or participated in any complaint action under Title IX. For an institution to retaliate in any way is considered a violation of Title IX. Title IX applies to all Dartmouth educational programs or activities, including sponsored off-campus programs. Title IX states: No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. The Department of Education Office for Civil Rights ensures compliance with Title IX. Dartmouth College designates the Title IX Coordinator, Kristi Clemens, to coordinate the College's efforts to comply with and carry out its responsibilities under Title IX. Inquiries Inquiries or complaints concerning the application of Title IX may be referred to the College's Title IX Coordinator and/or to the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights: Title IX Coordinator and Acting Senior Director, Institutional Diversity and Equity Kristi Clemens Parkhurst Hall, Room 005 Hanover, NH 03755-3541 603.646.9850 TitleIX@Dartmouth.edu Office for Civil Rights U.S. Department of Education Boston Office 5 Post Office Square, 8th Floor Boston, MA 02109-3921 Phone: 617.289.0111 | Fax: 617.289.0150 | TDD: 800-537-7697 Email: ocr.boston@ed.gov Web: www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/ In addition to the Title IX Coordinator, inquiries involving employees may also be referred to: United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Boston Office John F.
