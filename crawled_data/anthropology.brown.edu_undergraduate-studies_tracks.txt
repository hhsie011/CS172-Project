Students choose from the core course offerings that best fit their interests. The remaining five tracks offer more specialized pathways through those same requirements. Course options in the specialized tracks are more restricted and ensure a student is more deeply trained in one of the core areas of anthropology, while still broadly trained in the discipline. Students who wish to specialize in an area of anthropology outside of these tracks also have the option of designing their own track, with the approval of the DUS. Self-designed anthropology tracks must include the core requirements outlined in the General Anthropology track. General Anthropology Track The General Anthropology track is the most flexible and open of all of the anthropology tracks.
