It provides a foundation of crucial ideas for other scientific fields, and many of the underpinnings of modern technology. Our physics faculty actively engage in both teaching and research, including mentoring undergraduate and graduate students. Our research focuses on new phenomena occurring on scales ranging from the subatomic to the cosmic. Many of us collaborate across disciplines working with biologists, chemists, engineers, geologists, and mathematicians. Gaining knowledge and understanding about nature can be very rewarding, and the opportunity to make discoveries that illuminate fundamental aspects of nature is truly exciting. A Brown physics degree can lead to a career investigating the key secrets of the universe. This solid and strong training in the fundamental laws of nature and in the tools used in their application can lead to productive careers in all the other sciences. For example, our graduates conduct basic research into the most fundamental properties of matter, ranging from investigations of novel collective phenomena of condensed matter to studies of particles and strings and the closely related realm of cosmology. They also have central roles in developing new industrial applications such as advanced electronic devices. Some use their expertise in statistical mechanics to achieve a better understanding of the brain and neural processes or to study protein self-assembly and other areas of biological physics. Underlying all of these careers is a common interest in understanding the natural world. At Brown we cherish, support and promote this curiosity. Brown is a small but elite university, highly regarded as an institution for encouraging student initiative and involvement with the processes of learning and discovery. You will find in our labs and seminars a lively mix of faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates all working together with a common love of physics. Research opportunities at Brown are outstanding, and are at the forefront of the most important areas of physics. Please explore our web pages to learn more about physics at Brown.
