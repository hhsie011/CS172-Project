The Mechanical Engineering program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org/. Mechanical engineers apply the principles of motion, energy, and force to create mechanical solutions to technological problems, thereby realizing devices and systems that make life better. About one-fifth of all engineers practicing today are mechanical engineers. Their skills are used in research, development, design, testing, production, technical sales, technical management, as well as medicine, law, and business. Mechanical engineers are characterized by personal creativity, breadth of knowledge, and versatility. For these reasons they are found to function and thrive as valuable members and leaders of multidisciplinary teams. Mechanical engineers are employed in a wide range of industries; examples include agricultural/heavy equipment, biomedical, consulting, energy and power, manufacturing, product design and transportation. Student Learning Outcomes: Graduates of the Mechanical Engineering curriculum should have, at the time of graduation: an ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics an ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences an ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions an ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies. Program Educational Objectives: The mechanical engineering curriculum is organized to provide students with a broad foundation in mathematics, science, engineering, social science and humanities. Areas emphasized in the curriculum are design and optimization, dynamic systems and control, materials processing and mechanics, and thermo-fluid sciences. Elective courses provide additional emphasis in terms of the student’s unique educational goals, whether they include immediate entry into industry or further professional or graduate study. The mechanical engineering curriculum at Iowa State University is dedicated to preparing students for productive careers in the state, nation, and the world and has the following objectives: Graduates will have utilized a foundation in engineering and science to improve lives and livelihoods through a successful career in mechanical engineering or other fields. Graduates will have become effective collaborators and innovators, leading or participating in efforts to address social, technical and business challenges. Graduates will have engaged in life-long learning and professional development through self-study, continuing education or graduate and professional studies in engineering, business, law or medicine. A major focus throughout the mechanical engineering curriculum is a series of experiences that emphasize engineering design, culminating in a capstone design experience in the senior year. Students will develop engineering judgment through open-ended problems that require establishment of reasonable engineering assumptions and realistic constraints. Development of skills needed to be independent, creative thinkers, effective communicators, and contributing team members is integrated throughout the curriculum. Students also develop an understanding of the societal context in which they will practice engineering, including environmental, legal, aesthetic, and human aspects. Students are encouraged to participate in the cooperative education program or to obtain engineering internships, both domestically and abroad. Study abroad is encouraged, and the department has exchange programs with several universities around the world. These experiences help students to round out their education and to better prepare for careers in the increasingly global practice of engineering.

Concurrent degrees allow well-qualified students to begin their graduate studies before completing their undergraduate degree to complete their graduate degree on an accelerated timeline. Students in concurrent status must be making good progress toward a bachelor’s degree. The minimum requirements for admission to concurrent-student status are the same as those required for admission to the Graduate College. Other aspects of concurrent status include: · Official enrollment and fee payment will be as a graduate student. · The graduate credential will be awarded at the same time or after the undergraduate degree is conferred. · Students may be appointed to graduate research assistantships. · With the approval of a student’s Program of Study (POS) Committee, up to 6 ISU credits taken while in concurrent status may be applied to a bachelor’s degree and a graduate degree. Details on the Masters degree requirements and graduate admission in mechanical engineering may be found at: https://www.me.iastate.edu/graduate-admissions/ Details on the graduate college policies on concurrent degrees may be found at: https://www.grad-college.iastate.edu/handbook/chapter.php?id=4#4.3 Graduate Study The department offers programs for the degrees Master of Engineering (M. Eng.), Master of Science (M.S.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) with a major in mechanical engineering. The M.Eng. degree is a coursework-only degree designed to improve professional expertise in mechanical engineering. The M.S. and Ph.D. degrees are designed to improve the student’s capability to conduct research as well as their professional expertise. Although co-major and formal minor programs are not offered in mechanical engineering, courses may be used for minor work by students taking major work in other departments. Well-qualified juniors and seniors in mechanical engineering who are interested in graduate study may apply for concurrent enrollment in the Graduate College to simultaneously pursue both the Bachelor of Science and Master of Science, the Bachelor of Science and Master of Business Administration. Under concurrent enrollment, students are eligible for assistantships and simultaneously take undergraduate and graduate courses. Details are available in the Graduate Programs Office and on the department’s website (http://www.me.iastate.edu/). The graduate program offers advanced study in a variety of thrust areas, including biological and nanoscale sciences, clean energy technologies, complex fluid systems, design and manufacturing innovation, and simulation and visualization. The department offers students the opportunity to broaden their education by participating in minor programs in established departments, interdepartmental programs, or other experiences as approved by their program of study committees. The requirements for advanced degrees are established by the student’s program of study committee within established guidelines of the Graduate College. Graduate students who have not completed an undergraduate program of study substantially equivalent to that required of undergraduate students in the department can expect that additional supporting coursework will be required. Program requirements can be found on the department webpage (http://www.me.iastate.edu/) and in the Mechanical Engineering Graduate Student Handbook.
