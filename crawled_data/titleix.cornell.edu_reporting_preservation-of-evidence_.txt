Nevertheless, pending the decision to report, individuals are strongly encouraged to take immediate steps to preserve all evidence that might support a future report or an investigation by the Police, by Cornell, or both. Such evidence may include: A forensic sexual assault examination Any clothing, sheets or other materials (items containing bodily fluids should be stored in cardboard boxes or paper bags) Electronic exchanges (e.g., text messages, emails, and Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat or other social media posts, to the extent that they can be captured or preserved) Photographs (including photographs stored on smartphones and other devices) Voice-mail messages and other physical, documentary and/or electronic data that might be helpful or relevant in an investigation Electronic and photographic evidence that may be lost through the upgrade or replacement of equipment (including smartphones), software and/or accounts or may simply be lost to the passage of time Contact Us Cornell University Office of Institutional Equity and Title IX Day Hall, Suite 500 (Fifth Floor) 607-255-2242 titleix@cornell.edu Report an Incident Â© 2014 Cornell University Facebook Twitter YouTube Hosted by CampusPress Skip to toolbar Log In Search
