Dr. Cromer is passionate about social justice and works to build human resilience to adversity in at-risk and disadvantaged populations. Much of Dr. Cromer’s prevention work is focused within systems. She has worked with college athletes, first generation college students, trauma-informed schools, students and student athletes transitioning to college, and military families preparing for deployment. Her expertise extends to the prevention of the intergenerational transmission of trauma and fostering healing from historical trauma. Dr. Cromer’s work is applied in the sense that she actively works to improve outcomes for the people with whom she works. Dr. Cromer’s prevention work is based in attachment, self-regulation, and empowerment.
