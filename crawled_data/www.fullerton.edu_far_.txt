FAR coordinates the following academic employee processes: Retention, Tenure, and Promotion (RTP); Temporary Faculty (Lecturer) Evaluation; Post-Tenure Review; Range Elevation; Student Opinion Questionnaires (SOQs); Sabbatical and DIP Leaves; and Records Retention and Disposition. FAR is the official repository of the Personnel Action Files for the full-time faculty and safeguards documentation pertaining to employment, reappointment, tenure, promotion, and the evaluation of faculty performance. FAR is housed in the division of Faculty Support Services along with the Faculty Development Center , the Academic Technology Center , and Online Education and Training . We also work in collaboration with Human Resources, Diversity and Inclusion to provide faculty with support for successful academic careers. Our dedicated staff looks forward to working with you!
