Nevertheless, it should be used as a training tool that can reduce the number of injuries or death if put into action as soon as a situation develops. Time is a critical factor in the management of this type of situation. A Hostile Intruder situation may require a combination of action depending on the circumstances. The Department of Homeland Security along with many other law enforcement agencies recommend the RUN… HIDE… FIGHT… tactic in response to a situation where an ‘active shooter’ is present and intending to cause harm. RUN – When an active shooter is in your vicinity HIDE – If evacuation is not possible, find a place to hide FIGHT – As a last resort, and only if your life is in danger In an emergency contact the Department of Public Safety at 401-863-4111.
