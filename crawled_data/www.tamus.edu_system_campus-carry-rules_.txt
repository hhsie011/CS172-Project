Each university president and agency CEO consulted with their respective students, staff members, and faculty and proposed rules that take into account specific safety considerations and the uniqueness of their campus environment. The proposals were reviewed by the Texas A&M System Office of General Counsel, approved by the Chancellor for submission to the Board, and were considered and accepted by the Texas A&M System Board of Regents on April 27, 2016. No rule at any Texas A&M System member prohibits a licensed holder from carrying a concealed handgun in classrooms or residential facilities owned and operated, or leased and operated, by the institution. However, in keeping with the law, there will be certain locations throughout the System where concealed carry will, or may at times, be prohibited. Three institutions — Prairie View A&M University, Texas A&M International University, and Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi — have residential facilities that are leased by a third party management company. While the universities do not oppose licensed concealed carry in campus residential facilities, their proposed rules acknowledge the property right of the management company to determine restrictions on the possession and storage of weapons in those facilities. Generally, Texas A&M System members will defer to the property rights of lessees, allowing them make determinations about the allowance of concealed handguns on their premises. State law prohibits carrying a concealed handgun on the premises in which an interscholastic event is taking place. Additionally, Texas A&M System rules grant the presidents and CEOs of member institutions the authority to prohibit concealed carry on a temporary basis as necessary for institutional safety.
