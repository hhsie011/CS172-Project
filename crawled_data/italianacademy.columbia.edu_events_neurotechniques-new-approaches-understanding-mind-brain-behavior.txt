Scientists in the field of systems neuroscience presented and discussed modern techniques such as single- and multi-electrode recording, optical-, magnetic- and molecular-imaging, and optogenetically targeted neural control. They explained the importance of these techniques and the data they generate for the neuroscientific enterprise. The aim of the workshop was dual: firstly, to foster the interaction among scientists using a variety of techniques and secondly, to sensitize a more general public to the potential and significance of the recent developments in approaching neuroscience and the study of the brain and behavior. Organized by the Italian Academy for Advanced Studies in America at Columbia University and former Academy Fellow Franco Pestilli, in cooperation with the Mahoney-Keck Center for Brain and Behavior Research, the event featured talks by Aniruddha Das, Karl Deisseroth, Winrich Freiwald, Michael Goldberg, Uri Hasson, David Heeger, Elizabeth Hillmann, Adam Kohn, John Maunsell, and Frank Tong.
