The Group reports to the Associate University Librarian for Collections. We are functionally divided into five areas, with the common mission of providing timely and effective bibliographic control for materials acquired by the Libraries. Original and copy cataloging occurs in the following areas: The Collection Acquisition and Description Division (CAD) handles most copy cataloging and monographic ordering and receiving. Main contact: Mark Wilson (mw18@columbia.edu ; 212.854.7357) The Original and Special Materials Cataloging Division (OSMC) provides original cataloging for all formats and copy cataloging for some special materials and has responsibility for bibliographic projects and metadata coordination for digital collections. Main contact: Kate Harcourt (harcourt@columbia.edu ; 212.854.2714) The following three divisions are concerned with other aspects of bibliographic control: The Collection Development and E-Resources Management Division (CDERM) orders, receives, and adds traditional print and non-print continuing resources and manages Columbia's electronic collections.
