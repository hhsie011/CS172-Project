Upon admission to Columbia University, all entering students with disabilities are encouraged to contact DS. Reasonable Accommodations are adjustments to policy, practice, and programs that “level the playing field” for students with disabilities and provide equal access to Columbia’s programs and activities. Examples include the administration of exams, services such as note-taking, sign language interpreters, assistive technology, and coordination of accessible housing needs. Accommodation plans and services are custom designed to match the disability-related needs of each student and are determined according to documentation and the student’s program requirements. Accommodations are determined on a case-by-case basis after DS considers the student’s needs as described in their disability documentation. Faculty also have the opportunity to consult with DS on the final determination of accommodations for each of their courses and for each student. Some accommodations may be appropriate in one course or program, but not in another.
