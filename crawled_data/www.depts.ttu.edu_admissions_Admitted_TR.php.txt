The FAFSA opens annually on October 1st. You are encouraged to submit the FAFSA to Texas Tech as soon as possible by entering the TTU school code (003644). The priority deadline for financial aid is January 15th. The Texas Application for State Financial Aid (TASFA) is available for all non-US citizens who are Texas residents. The TASFA opens October 1st at collegeforalltexans.com. The priority deadline is January 15th. 4. Register for Red Raider Orientation Red Raider Orientation (RRO) is required for all incoming students attending classes on the main campus. Spots are filled on a first come, first serve basis. To see available dates for your major, visit the RRO website and log in using your eRaider credentials. During registration, make sure to verify that your major is correct. 5. Select on-campus housing and meal plan All incoming students with less than 30 credit hours, post-high school graduation, are required to live on campus. Housing registration opens in December. You can choose from traditional, suite, apartment or pod style within our 19 residence halls across campus. Spaces are filled on a first come, first serve basis. Visit housing.ttu.edu to make your housing arrangement. 6. View and accept your scholarships and financial aid Sign into raiderlink.ttu.edu. Click on the MyTech tab and choose View/Accept Aid Package under the Student Financial Aid & Scholarships menu.

Thank you letters must also be submitted to fully accept the award(s). 7. Submit your immunization records Visit the Immunization Record Upload Center to submit your meningitis and MMR records. If you are requesting records from a physician, have your physician fax it to (806) 743-2122. There is a registration hold on your account until this requirement is fulfilled. 8. Submit all official transcripts Final college transcripts for all institutions that you have attended will be required. College transcripts must be official and include grades from your most recent semester. While high school transcripts are not required, we recommend that you submit yours for advising purposes as some high school credits may impact course selection at Texas Tech University. Transcripts should be sent to Box 45005, Lubbock, TX 79409 or through an electronic transcript service to admissions.transcripts@ttu.edu. 9. Check your registration holds An important part of Red Raider Orientation is meeting your academic advisor and registering for classes. However, before you can register for classes during orientation, you must clear any registration holds. Learn about where to see your holds and actions to take.
