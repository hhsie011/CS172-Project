All application content is subject to verification and adherence to the above requirements. OFFERS OF ADMISSION WILL BE RESCINDED SHOULD ANY MISREPRESENTATION AND/OR OMISSION OCCUR. Employer Sponsorship Regardless of the level of financial support from your employer, applicants to EMBA-Friday/Saturday are required to submit a signed sponsorship letter from an authorized representative of your organization, briefly stating the terms of support. Financial sponsorship is not required of your employer, but your organization must agree to: 1) Keep your travel time to a minimum; 2) Completely release you from all job responsibilities on class days. Learn more about the sponsorship requirement. Sponsorship letters must be uploaded into the online application system. EMBA-Saturday applicants are not required to obtain employer sponsorship of any kind, though it is welcome.
