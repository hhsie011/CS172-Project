Section 25A Under Section 25A of the IRS Code, a taxpayer may claim an education tax credit only for qualified tuition and related expenses actually paid during the calendar year. The taxpayer may not be able to claim an education tax credit with respect to the entire amount of qualified tuition and related expenses reported for the calendar year; the amount of any scholarship or grant aid reported for the calendar year and other similar amounts not reported (because they are not administered and processed by the institution) may reduce the amount of any allowable education tax credit for the taxable year. Also, the amount of any reduction in charges for qualified tuition and fees or any reductions in scholarships or grant aid reported for a prior calendar year may affect the amount of any education tax credit allowable for the prior calendar year.
