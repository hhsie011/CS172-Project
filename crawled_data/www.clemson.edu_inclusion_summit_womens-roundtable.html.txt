The Women’s Roundtable brings approximately 500 participants together to emphasize the importance of education, self-care and preservation. It also focuses on the tools and skill sets necessary to cope with and navigate exclusionary educational and professional environments that many girls and women encounter. These sessions and keynote speeches, held a day prior to Clemson University’s Men of Color National Summit, will bring heightened awareness to these issues for all participants and provide networks of support and mentoring to girls and women in attendance. The Pre-Summit will feature well-known keynote speakers, a panel of women professionals, and various roundtable conversations regarding academic, career and personal achievement.
