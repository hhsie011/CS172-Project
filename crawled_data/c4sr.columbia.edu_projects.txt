In many places the concentration is so dense that states are spending in excess of a million dollars a year to incarcerate the residents of single city blocks.\u00a0\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHalf way through the exhibition, SIDL hosted a Justice Reinvestment Scenario Planning Workshop which was facilitated by the Global Business Network that brought together local government agency leaders, technical assistance specialists, community developers, architects, and urban planners to explore the possibilities of policy and design, highlighted by our maps, in a single neighborhood. It was our hope that the experts we had gathered around the tables in the space of the exhibit would contribute to taking the project from analysis into suggestions and proposals of possible futures for these places.\u00a0\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe form of intervention most commonly accepted by a range of people working on reentry, is \u0022Justice Reinvestment.\u0022 This is understood as an effort to reorient criminal justice and related government agency operations and resources around specific places in the city. More simply put, how might we save state money spent on prisons, and redirect that money where it is most needed, in the poorest urban areas of our cities?\u00a0\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe Workshop itself took place over the course of one day. It was structured around the presentation of a variety of data\u2014criminal justice, homelessness, health and human services, socio-economic, land-use, and architectural\u2014which workshop participants used to explore possible scenarios for a particular series of \u201cmillion dollar blocks\u201d. The results of the workshop are documented in a publication.\u00a0\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBrownsville in Brooklyn was the focus of the workshop, both because it is one of the highest prison and jail migration areas in the City and because it is the focus of current efforts by local housing developers (Common Ground) and technical assistance specialists (Family Justice) to establish more successful ways of resettling homeless and reentering populations. We took into consideration as well, that Brownsville, is part of a larger urban initiative \u2013 the Jail Discharge Planning Initiative that the Department Of Corrections(DOC) has been undertaking in partnership with the Department of Homeless Services(DHS) over the last three years.\u003C\/p\u003E\n"}]},"field_project_category":{"und":[{"tid":"26"}]},"field_project_tags":{"und":[{"tid":"25"},{"tid":"30"},{"tid":"5"}]},"field_project_images2":{"und":[{"fid":"178","uid":"3","filename":"00032.jpg","uri":"public:\/\/00032.jpg","filemime":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"103806","status":"1","timestamp":"1401915462","type":"image","field_image_caption":[],"field_file_image_alt_text":[],"field_file_image_title_text":[],"metadata":[],"alt":"Scenario planning workshop","title":"","width":"500","height":"375"},{"fid":"179","uid":"3","filename":"00026.jpg","uri":"public:\/\/00026.jpg","filemime":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"78077","status":"1","timestamp":"1401915462","type":"image","field_image_caption":[],"field_file_image_alt_text":[],"field_file_image_title_text":[],"metadata":[],"alt":"Million Dollar Blocks on view at The Urban Center","title":"","width":"500","height":"375"},{"fid":"180","uid":"3","filename":"00028.jpg","uri":"public:\/\/00028.jpg","filemime":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"84509","status":"1","timestamp":"1401915462","type":"image","field_image_caption":[],"field_file_image_alt_text":[],"field_file_image_title_text":[],"metadata":[],"alt":"Architecture and Justice publication","title":"","width":"500","height":"375"},{"fid":"181","uid":"3","filename":"00031.jpg","uri":"public:\/\/00031.jpg","filemime":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"107782","status":"1","timestamp":"1401915462","type":"image","field_image_caption":[],"field_file_image_alt_text":[],"field_file_image_title_text":[],"metadata":[],"alt":"Scenario planning workshop","title":"","width":"500","height":"375"},{"fid":"182","uid":"3","filename":"00030.jpg","uri":"public:\/\/00030.jpg","filemime":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"84565","status":"1","timestamp":"1401915462","type":"image","field_image_caption":[],"field_file_image_alt_text":[],"field_file_image_title_text":[],"metadata":[],"alt":"Scenario planning workshop","title":"","width":"500","height":"375"}]},"field_software_tags":{"und":[{"tid":"12"}]},"field_additional_people":{"und":[{"value":"Laura Kurgan \u0026 Eric Cadora, Project Directors\r\nSarah Williams \u0026 David Reinfurt, Research Associates\r\nLeah Meisterlin, Research Assistant","format":null,"safe_value":"Laura Kurgan \u0026amp; Eric Cadora, Project Directors\r\nSarah Williams \u0026amp; David Reinfurt, Research Associates\r\nLeah Meisterlin, Research Assistant"}]},"field_project_files":{"und":[{"fid":"492","uid":"39","filename":"ScenarioPlanning.pdf","uri":"public:\/\/ScenarioPlanning_0.pdf","filemime":"application\/pdf","filesize":"15623275","status":"1","timestamp":"1458323492","type":"default","metadata":[],"display":"1","description":""},{"fid":"642","uid":"39","filename":"ArchitectureAndJustice.pdf","uri":"public:\/\/ArchitectureAndJustice_0.pdf","filemime":"application\/pdf","filesize":"3198871","status":"1","timestamp":"1461076123","type":"undefined","metadata":[],"display":"1","description":""}]},"field_project_contact":{"und":[{"email":"ljk33@columbia.edu"}]},"field_project_videos":[],"field_more_images":[],"field_make_slideshow_2":{"und":[{"value":"0"}]},"field_more_videos":[],"field_additional_project_text":{"und":[{"value":"\u003Cp\u003EExhibition and Scenario Planning workshop held at the Architectural League of New York.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n","format":"filtered_html","safe_value":"\u003Cp\u003EExhibition and Scenario Planning workshop held at the Architectural League of New York.\u003C\/p\u003E\n"}]},"field_project_date":{"und":[{"value":"2006-01-01 00:00:00","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datetime"}]},"field_lead_image":{"und":[{"fid":"641","uid":"39","filename":"SIDL_MDB_expenditures.jpg","uri":"public:\/\/SIDL_MDB_expenditures_0.jpg","filemime":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"697945","status":"1","timestamp":"1461076123","type":"undefined","metadata":[],"alt":"","title":"","width":"2195","height":"1672"}]},"field_intro_text":{"und":[{"value":"\u003Cp\u003ESIDL won a competition in the Spring of 2005 run by the Architectural League of New York to mount and exhibition and run a scenario planning workshop within its gallery space.

Of interest, though, is the sudden shift that occurs around 5am, with the activity hotspots switching from the East Village\/Lower East Side area, to Grand Central and Penn Station. This is probably due to the fact that during most of the night, compared to other areas, the stations in the East Village\/Lower East Side continue to have high activity, but during most of the day, and specially during peak hours, they are not as active as the stations around Union Square or Grand Central and Penn Station.\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022image-project-page-image img-responsive project-image-inline\u0022 src=\u0022http:\/\/c4sr.spatialinformationdesignlab.org\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/project-page-image\/public\/Hour_by_Hour_03.gif?itok=bgcjZrNr\u0022 \/\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ECiti Bike Hourly Balance\u003C\/p\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cp\u003ENext, we visualized overall patterns of origins and destinations.

Again, using the same data as the animations above, this first matrix (Citi Bike Hourly Balance) clearly shows how the big imbalances happen (as expected) mainly between 6am and 10am (morning peak hour) and between 4pm and 8pm (evening peak hour). However, there are some stations whose imbalance starts and ends earlier, like 8th Ave. \u0026amp; 31st Street, W 33rd Street \u0026amp; 7th Ave. and W 41st Street \u0026amp; 8th Ave. (more origins than destinations starting around 2pm). In addition, this matrix also shows that not all of the stations suffer from big imbalances during peak hours. Indeed, stations like E 31st Street \u0026amp; 3rd Ave or E 32nd Street \u0026amp; Park Ave. barely have any imbalances during peak hours.

The first one (Imabalance matrix normalized by hourly activity) shows the imbalance as a percentage of the activity for that hour. Hence, the great imbalances appearing late at night, when there are fewer trips and there\u0027s a higher chance of having all of them as origins or destinations.

In addition, we can see how late at night (imbalanced as it may be) there\u0027s still very little activity. Finally, we can also see some outlier stations with a lot of activity and still pretty imbalanced: for example, in the morning 8th avenue and 31st street, 17th street and Broadway, Lafayette and 8th street, and Pershing Square (north); and in the evening 8th avenue and 31st street, 41st street and 8th avenue and again Pershing Square (north).

As you can see from the maps below, Citi Bike activity closely matches what we would expect to see in New York: the AM peak hour map shows people leaving residential neighborhoods (Lower East Side, East Village, Chelsea and Hells Kitchen) and arriving at Midtown East and the Financial District, and the PM peak hour map shows the reverse. To note, however, is the fact that these two maps are not completely symmetrical, meaning that there are certain trips that happen in the morning which do not have their counterpart in the evening, and vice versa. Also, there are some stations that while being inside imbalance hotspots do not show that large of an imbalance. These stations have been outlined on the maps and should be further studied.

Peak Hour\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally, we have created hotspot maps for both the AM and the PM peak hours. As you can see from the maps below, Citi Bike activity closely matches what we would expect to see in New York: the AM peak hour map shows people leaving residential neighborhoods (Lower East Side, East Village, Chelsea and Hells Kitchen) and arriving at Midtown East and the Financial District, and the PM peak hour map shows the reverse. To note, however, is the fact that these two maps are not completely symmetrical, meaning that there are certain trips that happen in the morning which do not have their counterpart in the evening, and vice versa. Also, there are some stations that while being inside imbalance hotspots do not show that large of an imbalance. These stations have been outlined on the maps and should be further studied.

We have combined several experimental methods in order to look at the conflict and the urban context of Aleppo in new ways: by cross referencing YouTube videos we have geocoded with bi-weekly change maps we created using low resolution and free Landsat satellite imagery we have been able to identify intense areas of damage on high resolution satellite images that have gone undocumented by the international human rights community, which uses other methods to look at these same high resolution satellite images.\u00a0\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe project has been exhibited at the \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/arewehuman.iksv.org\u0022\u003E2016 Istanbul Design Biennale\u003C\/a\u003E (October 22- November 20, 2016) and has been the subject of several invited lectures and articles including in the \u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/www.harvarddesignmagazine.org\/issues\/42\u0022\u003EHarvard Graduate School of Design Magazine\u003C\/a\u003E, Architecture Design, and at the Unknown Unknowables conference in Copenhagen, and a Curating Data conference at Harvard.\u00a0\u003C\/p\u003E\n"}]},"field_project_category":{"und":[{"tid":"2"}]},"field_project_tags":[],"field_project_images2":{"und":[{"fid":"722","uid":"39","filename":"07_Aleppo_June2016.png","uri":"public:\/\/07_Aleppo_June2016.png","filemime":"image\/png","filesize":"2778536","status":"1","timestamp":"1477936717","type":"image","field_image_caption":[],"field_file_image_alt_text":[],"field_file_image_title_text":[],"metadata":[],"alt":"Mapping pixel value change using data from the Landsat Satellite","title":"","width":"5162","height":"3542"},{"fid":"460","uid":"39","filename":"CSR_AleppoInterface.png","uri":"public:\/\/CSR_AleppoInterface_0.png","filemime":"image\/png","filesize":"1074128","status":"1","timestamp":"1457640197","type":"image","field_image_caption":[],"field_file_image_alt_text":[],"field_file_image_title_text":[],"metadata":[],"alt":"The Conflict Urbanism: Aleppo interface","title":"","width":"1590","height":"941"},{"fid":"453","uid":"39","filename":"CSR_Aleppo_04.jpg","uri":"public:\/\/CSR_Aleppo_04_0.jpg","filemime":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"2783822","status":"1","timestamp":"1457638351","type":"image","field_image_caption":[],"field_file_image_alt_text":[],"field_file_image_title_text":[],"metadata":[],"alt":"Experimental rubble detection method using machine learning","title":"","width":"1600","height":"1200"},{"fid":"465","uid":"39","filename":"CSR_AleppoAerial.png","uri":"public:\/\/CSR_AleppoAerial.png","filemime":"image\/png","filesize":"7700029","status":"1","timestamp":"1457640197","type":"image","field_image_caption":[],"field_file_image_alt_text":[],"field_file_image_title_text":[],"metadata":[],"alt":"Aleppo 2014","title":"","width":"2820","height":"1836"},{"fid":"467","uid":"39","filename":"CSR_BeforeAfter.png","uri":"public:\/\/CSR_BeforeAfter_0.png","filemime":"image\/png","filesize":"2472540","status":"1","timestamp":"1457640300","type":"image","field_image_caption":[],"field_file_image_alt_text":[],"field_file_image_title_text":[],"metadata":[],"alt":"Damage in the Karm aj-Jabal neighborhood identified by Human Rights Watch","title":"","width":"2330","height":"1150"}]},"field_software_tags":[],"field_additional_people":{"und":[{"value":"Laura Kurgan, Madeeha Merchant, Jamon Van Der Hoek, Dare Brawley, Grga Basic, Mike Howard","format":null,"safe_value":"Laura Kurgan, Madeeha Merchant, Jamon Van Der Hoek, Dare Brawley, Grga Basic, Mike Howard"}]},"field_project_files":[],"field_project_contact":{"und":[{"email":"info@c4sr.columbia.edu"}]},"field_project_videos":[],"field_more_images":[],"field_make_slideshow_2":{"und":[{"value":"1"}]},"field_more_videos":[],"field_additional_project_text":{"und":[{"value":"\u003Cp\u003EConflict Urbanism: Aleppo is a call for inquiry and a call to action.

As a first step, we will capture baseline health data and quality of life indicators which we will track as the project progresses.\u003C\/p\u003E\n"}]},"field_publication_links":{"und":[{"url":"http:\/\/spatialinformationdesignlab.org\/project_sites\/the-haven-project\/","title":"The Haven Project - Metrics Website","attributes":[]}]},"field_black_dots_in_slideshow_na":{"und":[{"value":"0"}]},"field_initiative":{"und":[{"tid":"79"}]},"field_themes":{"und":[{"tid":"81"},{"tid":"84"},{"tid":"93"},{"tid":"88"},{"tid":"82"}]},"field_methods":{"und":[{"tid":"103"},{"tid":"101"},{"tid":"108"}]},"field_one_sentence_description":{"und":[{"value":"Analysis of New York City neighborhoods according to specific health, demographic and environmental metrics.","format":null,"safe_value":"Analysis of New York City neighborhoods according to specific health, demographic and environmental metrics."}]},"field_project_team_v2":{"und":[{"value":"90","revision_id":"90"},{"value":"91","revision_id":"91"},{"value":"92","revision_id":"92"}]},"field_inline_images":{"und":[{"fid":"567","uid":"39","filename":"150429_Pollution_Large.jpg","uri":"public:\/\/150429_Pollution_Large_0.jpg","filemime":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"478609","status":"1","timestamp":"1459976619","type":"undefined","metadata":[],"alt":"","title":"","width":"800","height":"800"},{"fid":"569","uid":"39","filename":"150429_GreenSpace_Large.jpg","uri":"public:\/\/150429_GreenSpace_Large_1.jpg","filemime":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"531406","status":"1","timestamp":"1459976619","type":"undefined","metadata":[],"alt":"","title":"","width":"800","height":"800"},{"fid":"571","uid":"39","filename":"150429_Distance_Large.jpg","uri":"public:\/\/150429_Distance_Large_0.jpg","filemime":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"539055","status":"1","timestamp":"1459976619","type":"undefined","metadata":[],"alt":"","title":"","width":"800","height":"800"},{"fid":"573","uid":"39","filename":"150429_Asthma_Large.jpg","uri":"public:\/\/150429_Asthma_Large_0.jpg","filemime":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"392303","status":"1","timestamp":"1459976619","type":"undefined","metadata":[],"alt":"","title":"","width":"800","height":"800"},{"fid":"575","uid":"39","filename":"150429_Education_Large.jpg","uri":"public:\/\/150429_Education_Large_0.jpg","filemime":"image\/jpeg","filesize":"489501","status":"1","timestamp":"1459976619","type":"undefined","metadata":[],"alt":"","title":"","width":"800","height":"800"}]},"field_make_slideshow_":{"und":[{"value":"1"}]},"field_related_projects":[],"field_related_publications":[],"field_project_website_link":{"und":[{"url":"http:\/\/spatialinformationdesignlab.org\/project_sites\/the-haven-project\/","title":null,"attributes":[]}]},"field_dashboard_sort_date":{"und":[{"value":"2015-03-01 00:00:00","timezone":"America\/New_York","timezone_db":"America\/New_York","date_type":"datetime"}]},"field_project_gifs":[],"path":"projects\/nyrp-haven-project","name":"juanfranciscosaldarriaga","picture":"0","data":"a:5:{s:16:\u0022ckeditor_default\u0022;s:1:\u0022t\u0022;s:20:\u0022ckeditor_show_toggle\u0022;s:1:\u0022t\u0022;s:14:\u0022ckeditor_width\u0022;s:4:\u0022100%\u0022;s:13:\u0022ckeditor_lang\u0022;s:2:\u0022en\u0022;s:18:\u0022ckeditor_auto_lang\u0022;s:1:\u0022t\u0022;}","initiative":"Advanced Data Visualization","sort_date":"2015","pub_link":"","pub_pdf":"","email":"","image_large":"https:\/\/c4sr.columbia.edu\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/c4sr_large_inline_slideshow_980x500\/public\/bluedots.png?itok=oZSUPccJ","image_small":"https:\/\/c4sr.columbia.edu\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/homepage-400x300\/public\/bluedots.png?itok=zdI8X00m","image_square":"https:\/\/c4sr.columbia.edu\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/square-crop-for-button\/public\/bluedots.png?itok=lQmwNuPS"},"node_path_alias":"projects\/nyrp-haven-project"},{"nid":"260","access":true,"node":{"vid":"260","uid":"39","title":"Exit","log":"","status":"1","comment":"1","promote":"0","sticky":"0","nid":"260","type":"project","language":"und","created":"1461791202","changed":"1552403549","tnid":"0","translate":"0","revision_timestamp":"1552403549","revision_uid":"39","field_description":{"und":[{"value":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022image-project-page-image img-responsive project-image-inline\u0022 src=\u0022http:\/\/c4sr.spatialinformationdesignlab.org\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/project-page-image\/public\/EXIT-006.jpg?itok=VIenIXlZ\u0022 \/\u003EPopulation and urban migration.

Another takeaway is that much of the city still does not produce a lot of taxi trips and there is not enough data to present primary payment types at all.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg alt=\u0022\u0022 class=\u0022image-project-page-image img-responsive project-image-inline\u0022 src=\u0022http:\/\/c4sr.columbia.edu\/sites\/default\/files\/styles\/project-page-image\/public\/Yellow_Destinations-01.png?itok=1Pb0CpAV\u0022 \/\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\n"}]},"field_project_category":{"und":[{"tid":"2"}]},"field_project_tags":[],"field_project_images2":{"und":[{"fid":"516","uid":"39","filename":"Payment_Type_Oct_2014_Green_Rdm_Dest-01.png","uri":"public:\/\/Payment_Type_Oct_2014_Green_Rdm_Dest-01_0.png","filemime":"image\/png","filesize":"640883","status":"1","timestamp":"1459193847","type":"image","field_image_caption":[],"field_file_image_alt_text":[],"field_file_image_title_text":[],"metadata":[],"alt":"Green Cab Origins","title":"","width":"1951","height":"1020"}]},"field_software_tags":[],"field_additional_people":[],"field_project_files":{"und":[{"fid":"519","uid":"39","filename":"CSR_BankingDivide.pdf","uri":"public:\/\/CSR_BankingDivide.pdf","filemime":"application\/pdf","filesize":"1725760","status":"1","timestamp":"1459193847","type":"default","metadata":[],"display":"1","description":""}]},"field_project_contact":{"und":[{"email":"jfs2118@columbia.edu"}]},"field_project_videos":[],"field_more_images":[],"field_make_slideshow_2":{"und":[{"value":"1"}]},"field_more_videos":[],"field_additional_project_text":{"und":[{"value":"\u003Cp\u003ESince 2008 yellow taxis have been able to process fare payments with credit cards, and credits cards are a growing share of total fare payments.
