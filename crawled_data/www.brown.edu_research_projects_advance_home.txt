We also strive to transform the institution by utilizing the social science literature on gender equity in resources provided to department chairs and administrators in order to ensure the retention and advancement of women and minority scientists. ADVANCE at Brown awards grants for research and professional development, sponsors seminars and public lectures, provides grant librarian support, as well as networking opportunities that seek to foster faculty success.
