It stands at the forefront of biomedical research on eukaryotic pathogens, which are the causative agents of some of the most devastating and intractable diseases of humans including malaria, amoebic dysentery, sleeping sickness, Chagas disease, and fungal meningitis. Globalization has resulted in an increase in such infections in the US and many eukaryotic pathogens are also classified as bioterrorism agents and/or neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). The global importance of these pathogens is what motivates our faculty members, who have established a lengthy track record of major contributions in this area of research. That's EPIC!
