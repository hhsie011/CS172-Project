As we accompany students, we endeavor to create an environment that will encourage them to deepen their faith, develop the virtues that constitute a good moral character, grow intellectually, discover the joy of selfless service, and cultivate their psychological and physical well-being. This formation prepares them to discern their calling, live just and generous lives, and achieve the human completeness that is the goal of true education. The division consists of 18 departments, including 32 undergraduate residential communities, that offer a wide range of services designed to support student development and formation. The Office of Student Affairs is located in 316 Main Building and can be reached at 574-631-5550. Rev. Gerry Olinger, C.S.C., Vice President for Student Affairs, and Office of Student Affairs staff coordinate the efforts of the Division of Student Affairs and welcome the opportunity to assist and support students.
