Additional information about this program is available here. Zambia Juvenile Justice Field Placement Zambia Juvenile Justice Field Placement (2 credit hours) – students chosen for this unique field placement will spend 30 days in Zambia doing legal work under the direction of lawyers working for UP Zambia (see www.upzambia.org), a non-profit legal services organization dedicated to representing juveniles charged with crimes under Zambian law. Students will assist Zambian lawyers in meeting directly with minors detained in adult prisons, accompanying them to court, and, if necessary, writing their appeals. Students will also have the opportunity to participate in recreational visits (chess, soccer, music/karaoke) with UP Zambia clients in prisons and reform schools. The field placement also includes a field trip to Victoria Falls, one of the 7 modern natural wonders of the world, and a visit to a game park in neighboring Botswana. Study Abroad at Other Law Schools Baylor Law recognizes study-abroad credit hours obtained through other ABA-accredited law school programs, and many Baylor students take advantage of these opportunities around the globe to fulfill degree requirements at Baylor. Students interested in obtaining credit through a study abroad program hosted by a school other than Baylor Law must receive pre-approval to do so. Contact Jerri Cunningham or Associate Dean Wilson for details on gaining approval for study abroad credit.
