She discussed how to have long-term vision in a short-term world given day-to-day pressures and the impact Covid will have on the startup landscape in the future. CBS Startup Alley at TechDay NY is a unique environment for entrepreneurs to exhibit their concepts and highlight products currently in development. TechDay NY has been the largest event in the United States for startups with over 15k attendees and 300+ exhibitors. TechDay also takes place in London and Los Angeles. Both CBS student- and alumni-founded companies can apply to exhibit at the event in CBS Startup Alley, part of the larger Columbia Business School exhibit. Exhibiting companies will house their photos, videos, and other images and presentations in their virtual room/table where they will chat with visitors. Lead generation tools will help track them and provide data for follow-up. Results include opportunities to market on prominent marketplace sites, introductions to investors, and receiving feedback on pitches and presentations. TechDay markets participating companies before, during, and after the TechDay conference.
