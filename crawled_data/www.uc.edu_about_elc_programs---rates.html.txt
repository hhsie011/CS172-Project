Children are fed when hungry, sleep when tired and are changed as needed. Teachers encourage the toddler's move toward independence by supporting their attempts to self-feed, use the toilet and dress themselves. The daily program invites the young child to play and actively explore the environment during waking hours. Opportunities for outdoor play are included in the daily routine. Play activities include music and movement, reading stories, sensory play (with water, play dough, sand, etc.), play with toys that stimulate intellectual and motor development, experiences with appropriate, non-toxic art media, and pretend play. Space is limited for Infants and Toddlers. Our waiting list for children under age three years is approximately one year Please note -- This is an estimate that may change based on the age of your child Part Time and Full Time Preschool Our preschool program serves children ages 3-5 years.
