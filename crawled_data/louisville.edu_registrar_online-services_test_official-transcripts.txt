The mailing address is: Registrar's Office Transcript Department University of Louisville Louisville, KY 40292 (502) 852-6522 FAX (502) 852-7088 The hours of operation are from 9:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. Transcripts cost $7.00 per copy. Processing time for transcripts is 1 to 3 working days from the time we receive your request, so order early. There are several methods for requesting a transcript: · WEB - If you have attended U of L since Fall 1982, you may request your transcript over the WEB, using your student ID, social security number and PIN or UserID and password for identification. Your PIN may have been initially set to your birthday (MMDDYY), but would have been changed to a different number that you selected if you have ever used the touch-tone phone registration system. If you would like to request your transcript over the WEB, click ORDER NOW. If you do not know your PIN or student ID number, or if you attended prior to 1982, you can order a transcript using your Social Security Number with the National Student Clearinghouse. You can also use the Mail-In/Fax option listed below. · NATIONAL STUDENT CLEARINGHOUSE - Transcripts can also be ordered via the Internet 24/7 through the National Student Clearinghouse. You may place as many orders as you like using any major credit card. The Clearinghouse will charge a processing fee of an additional $2.50 per transcript. Your signed consent may be required to fulfill your transcript order. For your convenience, a consent form will be generated for your order that you can return via fax, mail or as a scanned email attachment. Any attachments that need to be included to your transcript can be uploaded. · IN-PERSON - You may request a transcript in the Registrar's Office. Please bring a picture ID and payment. You have an option to request an immediate copy of your transcript for a $10.00 fee. This copy will be official, but marked "issued to student". You should be sure that your intended recipient will accept a copy directly from you. · MAIL-IN/FAX - For mail-in or fax requests, please complete the Transcript Request Form For Mail-In/Fax(PDF)(you must have Adobe Acrobat Reader 5.0 or higher to use/print this form). If you do not have Adobe Acrobat Reader 5.0 or higher, please send us your full name (also list any other name you may have used while enrolled here), social security number, date of birth, home address and phone number, and the full address of where you want your transcript to be sent. Remember to sign your request and include the appropriate fees if mailing or mail check if faxing order. Make your check or money order payable to the University of Louisville. If you have not attended U of L since Summer 1982, or if you have attachments to accompany your request, you can use this method to request your transcript or use the National Student Clearinghouse. Fax orders will be processed before receipt of payment. You will need to fill in complete address information, including zip codes for USA addresses, when you submit your request. If you need to look up a zip code, click on ZIP CODE DIRECTORY for assistance.
