Parking During Finals On weekdays on individual study day and during finals, all commuter lots are open to any vehicle with a valid TTU commuter ePermit. (Those with a Commuter North, Commuter ICC, Commuter West, Commuter Satellite, Evening, or Raider Park ePemit may use Commuter North or Commuter West.) Other parking areas on campus will operate as posted on their signs, including on weekends. Please remember that faculty and staff are still on duty during finals and must use their Area Reserved lots. This includes R03, the Library Lot, which is faculty/staff parking only weekdays from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. TOWING WILL BE ENFORCED IN R03. Parking During the Intersession If you need to park on campus the day after finals end through the day before residence halls reopen, you may park in any residence hall space or commuter space. Please avoid reserved and service spaces within those lots because employees will be on duty.
