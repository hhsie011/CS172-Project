Whatever Professor Gaski’s intentions, we deeply regret that his words were used to support a doctrine of racial hatred. We urge all, at Notre Dame or elsewhere, to speak and act in ways that never give harbor to hatred and violence.” Joel Curran Vice President of Public Affairs and Communications University of Notre Dame Posted In: University News Home Latest News Experts ND in the News Subscribe About Us Related May 27, 2022 Berthiaume family’s $20 million gift endows Institute for Precision Health May 26, 2022 Abigail Abikoye receives Wood Award from Community-Engaged Alliance May 26, 2022 Heather Christophersen, Anne Griffith appointed to VP positions May 20, 2022 Twenty-seven Notre Dame students named 2022-23 Fulbright US Student Program finalists May 19, 2022 Thomas Fuja to serve as interim vice president and associate provost for graduate studies and interim dean of the Graduate School For the Media Contact Office of Public Affairs and Communications Notre Dame News 500 Grace Hall Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA Facebook Twitter Instagram YouTube Pinterest © 2022 University of Notre Dame Search Mobile App News Events Visit Accessibility Facebook Twitter Instagram YouTube LinkedIn
