Number of recordkeepers. At this time, both TIAA and Vanguard will continue to provide administrative recordkeeping services and be open for ongoing contributions Assets in legacy Retirement Annuity (RA) and/or Group Supplemental Retirement Annuity (GRSA) contracts [TIAA ONLY]. Any balance you may have in legacy RA and/or GRSA contracts will not be affected by this transition. However, you may affirmatively elect to transfer all or any portion of your balances in a legacy RA and/or GRSA contract, including those in the CREF Stock and/or TIAA Real Estate Accounts, to the new tiered investment lineup at any time. See the TIAA Transition Guide for more information. Expand all Collapse all What is Changing The following changes will be made to the investment options offered under the Plans, effective June 1, 2022. Updates to the investment lineup. The Committee is streamlining the investment options available through the Plans. As a result, some funds are being closed and will not be available in the new investment lineup. The new lineup will be arranged into three tiers, offering you flexibility and a variety of investment choices to create a diversified retirement portfolio. See next section on "New Tiered Investment Options" Transfer of existing balances (and future contributions). You are not required to take any action. Existing balances and future contributions may be impacted in one of four way Share class change Existing balances in Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund, Vanguard Extended Market Index Fund, Vanguard Total International Index Fund, and Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund will automatically transfer to a lower-cost share class of the same fund. No other changes will occur to these funds. "Similar fund" mapping If you have a balance in, or direct contributions to, an investment option that is being closed and the Committee has determined there is a "reasonably similar" fund in the new tiered investment lineup, your balance, and any future contributions, will be automatically transferred to that new fund. "Target date" fund mapping If you have a balance in, or direct contributions to, an investment option that is being closed and the Committee has determined there is not a "reasonably similar" fund in the new tiered investment lineup, your balance, and any future contributions, will be automatically transferred to a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund with a target date closest to the year in which you will reach age 65. "In-kind" mapping Some funds are being closed and will not be available in the new investment lineup. In addition, some of the investment options that are being closed may no longer open to new investors (e.g., Vanguard PRIMECAP Fund). If you would like to continue to invest in the mutual fund investment options that will no longer be available in the Plans, consider opening a self-directed brokerage account during the "early choice" brokerage election window. Through the special one-time "in-kind" transfer process, your balances from all closing investment options in the Plans will be automatically transferred "in kind" to your self-directed brokerage account and will continue to be invested in the same share class options. New self-directed brokerage account. For investors with specialized needs, a self-directed brokerage account will allow participants to make investments outside of the Plans' investment option lineup. Additional costs and fees may apply. See the Vanguard and TIAA guides for more information {insert link} Increased access to investment education and retirement planning advice. The Committee wants you to have access to information and resources to help you understand the upcoming changes and how they may affect you. The Committee, in collaboration with Vanguard and TIAA, have designed a program of webinars and one-on-one advice sessions to provide information and updates. Expand all Collapse all New Tiered Investment Options The Plans’ investment options continue to offer you the flexibility to create a retirement portfolio that meets your investment preferences and goals. Your investment options are grouped into three tiers: Tier 1: Target-date funds. Target-date investment funds are designed to create a diversified portfolio within one fund. The asset allocation changes over time and becomes more conservative as you near the target date, or retirement date. Tier 2: Core funds. Provides a set of investment options, selected by the Committee, designed to help you build your own diversified investment portfolio. Tier 3: Self-directed brokerage account. Available for those who are more engaged investors who want to invest in a wide range of mutual funds outside of the Plans’ investment lineup. Neither Columbia University nor the Committee monitors the investments offered through a self-directed brokerage account. Expand all Collapse all Key Dates and Action Steps Here are some "next steps" you may want to consider: Review the Vanguard and/or TIAA Transition Guide carefully to learn how your account(s) and future contributions may be affected Review the options in the new tiered investment lineup and the charts showing how your existing investment options and future contributions will transfer If you would like to continue to invest in certain investment options that will no longer be available in the Plans, you must open a self-directed brokerage account during the "early choice" brokerage election window. A brokerage account will give you the opportunity to invest in a wider range of mutual funds across several asset classes outside of the Plans' investment lineup Review your assets held in TIAA legacy Retirement Annuity (RA) and/or Group Supplemental Retirement Annuity (GSRA) contracts, including those in the CREF Stock and/or TIAA Real Estate Accounts, and consider whether you want to transfer all or any portion to the new tiered investment lineup Attend a webinar to get answers to your questions Schedule a one-on-one retirement counseling session with either Vanguard or TIAA at no additional cost to you Access your account online to review and update your beneficiary information Key dates for upcoming investment changes Dates Beginning March 10, 2022 Events Financial Planning and Education webinars will be held (see section on Webinars above). Dates April 1 - May 25, 2022 Events The “early choice” brokerage election window is open. You can open a self-directed brokerage account to elect an “in-kind” transition of any balances in an investment option that is being closed. Please note: Opening a self-directed brokerage account during the “early choice” brokerage election window will automatically authorize the in-kind transfer of your balances from all closing mutual fund investment options in the Plans to a self-directed brokerage account. If you do not want this to happen, but still want to open a brokerage account, you must wait until after June 1, 2022, to open a self-directed brokerage account. Dates Through May 31, 2022 Events You can change how your current fund balances and future contributions are invested. For example, if you are not comfortable with how your current fund balances and future contributions will be invested in the new tiered investment lineup after the transition, you can change how your current fund balances and future contributions are invested, which may change how those amounts will be invested in the new tiered investment lineup. Dates May 1 - June 20, 2022 Events Individual counseling sessions will be available. Please check with TIAA and Vanguard for specific dates and to register for a session. Dates May 26, 2022 (after 4 p.m. ET) Vanguard Only Events All the existing “Institutional” class shares of funds that are being closed and will not be available in the new tiered investment lineup will be automatically moved to the retail “Admiral” or “Investor” class shares, which may have a higher expense ratio.. This is being done to accommodate the addition of the self-directed brokerage option. The “Admiral” or “Investor” class shares will be available from that point forward if you open a self-directed brokerage account during the “early choice” brokerage election window. Please note: This change will affect all participants, regardless of whether they have established a self-directed brokerage account during the “early choice” brokerage election window. Dates May 31, 2022 Brokerage account investors only Events “In-kind” transfer to brokerage account and brokerage account Freeze Period begins. If you opened a self-directed brokerage account during the “early choice” brokerage election window and hold any of the funds closing in the Plans, your balances in the closing funds will be automatically transferred “in-kind” to your self-directed brokerage account. There will be a short “freeze period” for these funds while they are transferred. During the freeze, you will not be able to make exchanges or withdrawals from the transferring funds until after the brokerage account freeze ends. If you want new contributions to go into the brokerage account, you can make a contribution allocation change to select the percentage you want allocated to brokerage—up to 95%. After your first contribution to brokerage takes place, you can make purchases in the brokerage account with this money. If you do not open a self-directed brokerage account during the “early choice” brokerage election window, the mapping of investments will occur according to the mapping strategies outlined in the Transition Guides. Assets in legacy Retirement Annuity (RA) and/or Group Supplemental Retirement Annuity (GRSA) contracts will not be affected by this transition. Dates June 1, 2022 Events The new tiered investment lineup goes live. After this date, you can change how your account(s) and/or future contributions are invested in the new tiered investment lineup. You can also begin allocating future contributions to a brokerage account and/or more your existing balance into a brokerage account.

The Committee decided to make changes to the Plans’ investment lineup to further reduce fees and expenses and modernize the Plans’ investment menu considering current best practices. The streamlined lineup eliminates investment options with overlapping investment styles. This change may help reduce any participant confusion in the fund selection process. In addition, decreasing the number of investment options may allow more effective communication of the individual investment options and may provide participants with the ability to reduce overall investment expenses. Moreover, the new menu will continue to provide participants with the ability to diversify their portfolios across a broad spectrum of investment options. How will the tiered investment structure help participants? The tiered investment structure packages or categorizes investment options in a manner that helps guide participants through the investment decision-making process. Participants first select a path that is appropriate for them based on their: Investment knowledge Time for managing their own investment portfolios Risk tolerance Interest in making investment decisions, including deciding asset allocation and selecting investment options Education materials are then tailored to meet participants’ needs. For example, an investor who lacks the time for managing their own investment portfolio or a novice investor who is uncomfortable making their own asset allocation decisions may select a pre-mixed asset allocation fund in Tier 1. The communication materials will then assist the participant in selecting the Vanguard Target Retirement Fund based upon their time horizon. Keep in mind that even though Target Retirement Funds simplify the investment process, they still require some monitoring to ensure that the portfolio is in line with your current situation. If I invest in one of the closing investment options through the self-directed window, will it have the same investment expenses? If you open a self-directed brokerage account during the “early choice” brokerage election window, the expense ratio of a closing investment option available through a self-directed brokerage account will be higher than it is now as the existing “Institutional” class shares of closing funds are being automatically changed to the retail “Admiral” or “Investor” class shares. This is being done to accommodate the addition of the brokerage option. If you do not open a self-directed brokerage account during the “early choice” brokerage election window, you will no longer be able to invest in any mutual funds that are closed to new investors (i.e., a term that means a fund has decided to stop allowing new investments from any investors who are not already invested in the fund) through the Plans’ self-directed brokerage account. What if I want to change how my current funds (and contributions) transfer to the new tiered investment lineup? If you want to choose how your existing fund balances and future contributions will transition to the new tiered investment lineup, you must change how your existing account(s) and future contributions are invested before May 31, 2022, generally by 4 p.m. (ET), except for the brokerage window. See the three investment mapping tables in “Investment mapping” on pages 11-12 for additional information. For example, if your account is currently invested in the CREF Social Choice Account Class R3 but you do not want your account to transition to the Vanguard Retirement Fund with a target date closest to the year you will reach age 65 (or your account is currently invested in Vanguard PRIMECAP Fund but you do not want your account to transition to Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Institutional Plus Shares), you can exchange that investment. If you exchange the CREF Social Choice Account Class R3 to the CREF Equity Index Account Class R3 before May 31, 2022, generally by 4 p.m. (ET), your existing balances and future contributions in the CREF Equity Index Account Class R3 will be automatically invested in the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Institutional Plus Shares. What should I expect from a one-on-one consultation session? If you sign up for a one-on-one consultation session, you can expect a thorough review of your retirement plan account and an action plan for moving forward. These consultation sessions last approximately 45 minutes. You will need all your investment account statements, including any retirement investments outside of the retirement plans and your most recent Social Security statement, if available. A consultant will use this information to understand your current financial situation and develop an action plan. To schedule a session, go to: Vanguard: meetvanguard.com TIAA: TIAA.org/schedulenow What does ESG stand for? ESG stands for environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG). This is a type of fund available in the Plans. Will I still have access to an investment option that incorporates ESG criteria in the new tiered investment lineup? Yes. The Calvert U.S. Large Cap Core Responsible Index Fund (CISIX) will provide investors with an offering that seeks to provide superior long-term performance and positive impact. Calvert Research and Management is a recognized leader in responsible investing. The fund offers broad exposure to companies that meet The Calvert Principles for Responsible Investment (Calvert Principles), which provide a framework for considering ESG factors. Calvert Research and Management conducts deep, proprietary research across approximately 200 peer groups using over 200 key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure material ESG factors and actively engage with company management. I want to move my closing fund(s) to the self-directed brokerage option and continue to buy shares with my future contributions. What do I do? (Vanguard-specific) Please review the Vanguard Brokerage Enrollment Process guide for step-by-step instructions. You will need to complete several steps to continue holding a closing fund and to purchase additional shares in that closing fund. Between April 1 and May 25, you must open a self-directed brokerage account by completing the online enrollment for the self-directed brokerage account. Beginning June 1, you will need to change your contribution allocations through the Vanguard website and elect to invest new contributions in the self-directed brokerage option. After your next plan contribution, you must access your self-directed brokerage account through TD Ameritrade (accessed through a link from your account on the Vanguard website) and purchase shares of the fund(s). After the initial purchase settles in your self-directed brokerage account you can set up recurring automatic purchases in the self-directed brokerage account through TD Ameritrade (accessed through a link from your account on the Vanguard website) I want to move my closing fund(s) to the self-directed brokerage option and continue to buy shares with my future contributions.
