They devote substantial attention to the causes (such as past and present abuses of peoples, lands, and water) and solutions (such as public policy development, social movements, individual action, and social innovation). In class, they focused their attention on the connections between our global past and what it can tell us about how we can responsibly act in the future. They accomplished this through engaging lectures andreflection sessions as well as classroom discussion and debate. In turn, students shared their thoughts about how the class had made them feel by the end of the semester. History & Natural Science Making the Modern World: Design, Ethics, and Engineering Reflection Sessions Reflection Sessions integrate course content into peer-led discussions about student personal moral development. Reflections grounded in the Jesuit tradition spur personal reflection and inquiry about the moral and ethical dimensions inherent to modern engineering and design. Reflection sessions are a place where ethical inquiry and an understanding of modern engineering and its history overlap in creative and meaninful ways. Hybrid Labs Hybrid Labs give students hands-on engineering experience. Students are currently tackling a seven-week human centered design project anchored in questions focusing on technology and accessibility on BC's Chestnut Hill campus. The project brings students' nascent engineering knowledge together with the insights they've gained from the history of science and critical theory in weekly class lectures. The result will be group designs that bear the marks of students' new understanding of how different disciplines like engineering, history, and ethics intersect.
