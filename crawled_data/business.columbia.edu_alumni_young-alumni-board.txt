Who We Are Established in 2018, the CBS Young Alumni Board includes MBA and EMBA alumni from the most recent graduation classes. YAB works closely with leaders in specific CBS offices to provide constructive feedback, serve as a sounding board for new ideas, and lead strategic projects throughout each school year. YAB additionally acts as a peer-to-peer network by which student and alumni populations can voice concerns and be assured feedback is brought to the attention of the School, thereby increasing partnership for ongoing priorities. Membership Members of each graduating MBA and EMBA class are selected to join the Young Alumni Board. YAB members meet quarterly and meet bimonthly in subcommittees that partner with CBS offices like the Dean’s Office, the Career Management Center, and External Relations.
