However, the programming each provides is different. Healthy Campus provides educational programming about specific topics addressing common challenges college students face. CAPS provides programming that supports students, staff or faculty who may be struggling or need support around a specific issue. For example, if a student group wants information about health and wellness, they could contact Healthy Campus to do a presentation that provides education and skill-building about the topic. But if a group of students within a student organization are struggling with anxiety and need some additional support, then contacting CAPS to talk about the issue and how these students can support one another during this time would be appropriate. If you are unsure of what presentation would be most appropriate, please reach out to CAPS or Healthy Campus â€“ we are happy to help you!
