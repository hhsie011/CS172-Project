We are committed to providing all students with the tools and resources necessary for success. We recognize that students from diverse backgrounds may possess or confront unique needs when searching and identifying potential employers or opportunities, or when navigating professional work environments. It is our hope that this resource serves as a tool for furthering your internship and job searches. This page is by no means exhaustive of all the options and opportunities available to diverse students, but it is a step forward in promoting awareness for the need for more diverse, equitable, and inclusive programming and practices. We encourage students and colleagues to engage with us in conducting and envisioning this work.
