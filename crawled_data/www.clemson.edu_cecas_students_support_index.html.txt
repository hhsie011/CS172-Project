decisions that influence your future. You choose classes that prepare you for the technical knowledge needed for your career. You perform research, design programs, and participate in group projects. As you define and redefine your success each semester, it's important to assess what is working and determine any adjustments that need to be made. If at any point you find you need a little extra assistance, we have a team of faculty, staff, and peers ready to help you.

Academic Advising Program Spotlights PEER/WISE Mentorship Incoming first-year students who are majoring in engineering and science are paired with upper-level mentors in the same area of study. Mentors are known for giving support and advice about adjusting to life as a Clemson student. PEER/WISE Mentorship Lead Forward Leadership LEAD Forward has constructed a unique development model based on the concept of having a leadership mindset. This model emphasizing that students must first develop self-awareness and learn to think as a leader before they are able to effectively lead others.

Events Calendar Preparing Tomorrow's Leaders From providing access to clean water to securing the realm of cyberspace, the challenges facing our modern societies are immediate and complex. Grand Challenge Scholars The Grand Challenge Scholars (GCS) program helps students to engage in real-world applications of their education through experiences such as research, international travel, seminar talks, and community outreach. The program’s goal is to prepare tomorrow’s engineering leaders to solve the grand challenges facing society during the next century. CU-GCS Program Samantha Kodikara completed the 5 competencies through research, adopting a political science minor, becoming involved in Dixon GPS, studying abroad, and completing service projects. “ “GCS helped me attend BMES 2019 where I was able to present research from my REU at Georgia Tech. The biggest challenge I have faced in college was deciding between a career in research and medicine. I helped come to this decision after completing an REU at Georgia Tech and realizing that I wanted a more patient-centered career.” Samantha Kodikara Bioengineering '21 THRIVE Events Study Resources Accessibility Career Services College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences Copyright © Clemson University College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences | Riggs Hall 864-656-3000 | Directory intro-arrow Engage With Us Through Facebook Twitter Instagram YouTube Clemson University Facebook Instagram Twitter Linkedin Youtube Tiktok Policy/Terms of Use Web Accessibility Ethics/Safety Hotline Privacy Policy Copyright © 2022 Clemson University • Clemson, South Carolina 29634 Clemson University Facebook Instagram Twitter Linkedin Youtube Tiktok Resources A-Z Index Campus Map CU Safety Directory Webcams Apply to Clemson
