Our graduates will be equipped with the fundamental technical, communication, and teamwork skills to succeed in their chosen careers. They will be empowered by innovative problem-solving creativity and an entrepreneurial mindset. They will be motivated by Christian ideals and a vocational calling to improve the quality of life worldwide. Learn more about how our students live out this mission. Our ABET Accredited program contains two course stems, thermal/fluids and materials/mechanical systems. In our thermal/fluids stem, students study fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and thermodynamics. In the materials/mechanical systems stem, students study engineering materials, manufacturing processes, control systems, and machine design. In addition to the required stems, students can further specialize by choosing electives in several areas, including: data acquisition systems and instrumentation, analysis and design of propulsion systems, advanced structural analysis, computational methods for fluids-thermo, biomaterials, biomechanics, robotics, and manufacturing processes. Students gain a foundation for the major areas of mechanical engineering and are prepared to enter a variety of industries. The Mechanical Engineering program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org.
