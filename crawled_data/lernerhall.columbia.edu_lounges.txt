Jump to Navigation Lerner Hall Lounges Where to Find a Quiet Space Lerner Hall offers a wide variety of relaxing lounge space for students to study, use their laptops, read, socialize and have quiet conversations, or just relax with a cup of coffee (or tea). The Main Lounge, perhaps the coziest place in Lerner Hall, provides a comfortable atmosphere to relax or engage in a quiet chat with friends. It is a great place to hang out between classes. The lounge features a Steinway Grand Piano that students are welcome to play, which is why it’s also commonly known as the Piano Lounge. Additional lounge spaces are located on the 2nd Floor West, 3rd Floor East, 3rd Floor West, 4th Floor East, 5th Floor East, and the 5th Floor West of Lerner Hall.
