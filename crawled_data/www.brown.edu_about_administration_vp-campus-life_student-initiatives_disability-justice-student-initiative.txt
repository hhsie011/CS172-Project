We explore disability as a social identity campus-wide and cultivate a community of support as Disabled students identify and navigate resources. We work, with partners, to reduce or eliminate barriers to academic and personal success experienced by Disabled students. The initiative also creates opportunities for all members of the Brown community to learn more about and engage on issues of disability justice. Programs will support undergraduate, graduate, and medical students at Brown. Upcoming events this semester include a number of opportunities to engage including workshops, speakers, lectures, open hours, zine making, resource curation, and more! We thank our allies - those students, student organizations, staff, and faculty who tirelessly continue to support Disabled students and educate the entire community around disability justice at Brown. We look forward to our continuing partnership as we learn from and build on the legacies of Disabled people at Brown.

Program Descriptions “Disability Justice at the Intersections” Speaker Series Speakers will examine disability justice and its connections with other anti-oppression movements ( e.g., racial and economic justice) in informing our understanding of a holistic, integrated approach to how we navigate barriers to equity and inclusion based on the complexity of our individual and collective identities and experiences. The series will collaborate with academic and administrative departments and centers to bring leading scholars, community organizers, and artists to campus to engage with the community. Co-Curricular Educational and Community Building Programs The Initiative prioritizes empowering students themselves to create knowledge and make an impact on community and societal challenges grounded in their own lived and learned experiences. Centering Disabled students and their experiences, DJSI's workshops, gatherings, and community building programs will provide a web of opportunities for co-curricular education focused on disability justice.
