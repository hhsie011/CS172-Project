The Knoll has been home to Iowa State’s first family since it was opened in 1901. Members of the Order of the Knoll, Iowa State University’s most prestigious donor recognition society, believe in creating opportunities to transform lives at Iowa State. Their gifts – whether through lifetime giving, annual giving or both – are essential to the future of our university. The Order of the Knoll acknowledges four giving levels: Society of the True and Valiant Cumulative giving of $10 million+ W.M. Beardshear Society Cumulative giving of $1 million to $9,999,999 President’s Circle Cumulative giving of $100,000 to $999,999 Campanile Society Annual giving of $2,500+ Annual giving of $1,500+ (under age 40) All Order of the Knoll members enjoy many opportunities for ongoing engagement with Iowa State.
