It also helps students understand the various risks related to consumption and the strategies to reduce their risk if they do choose to drink. In the CHOICES program, students are led by the facilitator through an Interactive Journaling session that provides them with critical normative, psychological and biological education about alcohol consumption as well as strategies for harm reduction. Through the journaling process, students reflect upon the content, considering how alcohol has or could touch their lives and how they might implement effective coping strategies to avoid abuse and harm in the future.
