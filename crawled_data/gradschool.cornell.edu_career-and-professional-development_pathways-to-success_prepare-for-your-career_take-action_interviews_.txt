If employers invite you to interview, it means they liked what they saw in your resume, CV, letters, research statement, etc. An interview allows you and the employer to meet and assess each other. In an interview, the employer will evaluate your: abilities and skills that match the job requirements. accomplishments. personal attributes. enthusiasm to work for this employer in this position. short- and long-term goals. Interview for Non-Academic Positions To learn more about interviewing for non-academic positions, visit the Career Services website. Interview Types for Academic Positions For some fields, the conference interview is a prerequisite for being invited to campus for an academic position. A conference interview is conducted by someone at a conference. This person may or may not be the person ultimately hiring you. Conference interviews are typically brief (about 30 minutes) but may be longer, so do not schedule interviews back to back. Focus on conveying the important information you want this person to take back to the campus search committee. Also realize that this person may see you throughout the conference and may be observing you. Search Committee Interviews These often are used to select academic candidates and sometimes to make hiring decisions. When interviewing with a search committee, direct your responses to all members of the group. You may begin by making eye contact with the person who asked you the question, but then make eye contact with others as you elaborate. Even if some members of the committee are quiet, they are still evaluating you. To involve everyone in the group, ask questions relevant to each member. One suggestion is to ask members how their position interacts with your position. Academic Mock Interview Questions Why do you especially want to teach at Nameless College or University? How do you see yourself contributing to our department? What have you contributed to your field? What is your research about and how can it be applied? What are its implications? How is it relevant?

Details Do alumni come back and tell you about life after graduation? Questions to Prepare to Answer One applicant was given these four topics in advance: Future research plans: what directions do you see your research taking in the next five–10 years? What will be the topic of your first major research proposal as a new faculty member, and where will you submit it? What balance do you anticipate between field research and lab/office-based research? If field work will be important, what field sites would you want to consider in the first few years? Education: Given our curriculum needs within the X group, how will you contribute to the undergraduate and graduate curricula? In particular, what graduate course(s) would you like to teach, and what will be your basic teaching model (e.g. lecture, lecture + lab, discussion, etc.)? Graduate and undergraduate research: How will you engage graduate and undergraduate students in your research program? That is, what style of advising/mentoring will you use? Resources: What critical resources do you need in order to establish a successful research program? What critical resources may already be here? What kind of help would you want from the X group, the department, and the university for you to achieve your goals? From Everham & Smallridge, ESA Bulletin Dec 1994: What is the main point of your dissertation? What are your professional goals? What is your concept of teaching in a four-year college as opposed to a research university? What specific research will you pursue if you are selected? How do you anticipate funding it? How has your experience and training prepared you to teach the courses required? What other courses might you teach? Why do you want this job? Why should we hire YOU? What strengths would you bring to the department? What would you expect from this department and administration? What kind of start-up funds, facilities, and equipment would you need? What experiences or interests do you have in college-wide activities and service? From an underground primer by Peter Kareiva (UW–Seattle) and Dan Doak (UC–Santa Cruz): What research will you be doing when you show up here? What projects will you start next? Why would you want to come here? What teaching would you like to do? What is your philosophy of grad student training? How will you support students? What types of projects do you expect them to work on? What will you contribute to the department that is not already well covered by the faculty? What makes you think you could ever get any outside funding? What is the best idea you ever had? What do you do? (the three to five minute summary of your entire research agenda) Where do you see your work going in the next 10–20 years? From an underground list of questions used by graduate students at the University of Arizona: What kinds of tools would be available in your lab for grad student use? In what areas do you think your work would uniquely contribute to this department? With whom in the department do you envision interacting the most? Outside the department? What meetings do you attend? What societies do you belong to? What do you envision as your ideal lab: # grads, undergrads, postdocs, techs, participation of grads who are not your own students? To what degree do you see integrating grad students into your research program? Is their work usually closely related to your research focus or is it fairly independent? How do you help grad students get started on a project? What’s your perspective on grad student funding? How would you respond to a student who is floundering (early vs. late)? What types of mentoring have you experienced—and what would you do similarly or differently? What courses have you taught before? What do you see as the major challenges of teaching at a large (small) university? What do you want to teach? (grad, undergrad, seminars) Statistics? Questions that Might Catch You Off Guard The illegal questions: spouses, children, etc. For example: Will anything need to be done for your spouse/partner (like find them a job)? Would you take this job if it were offered to you? How would you handle an interpersonal conflict in your lab? What happened in a break-up between two members of the lab who were involved? How to Respond If faced with a potentially discriminatory question during an employment interview, you are under no obligation to provide an answer. Be aware that such questions might be examples of stress questions, and you should be prepared to respond to them. Based on your personal preference and experience, you may choose to answer such questions briefly, but you should understand that volunteering such information may have negative consequences. Understanding the employer’s concern, however, might help you to structure a response. Indirect Response Address the employer’s underlying concern without directly answering the question. If an employer asks a question about your plans for marriage or family, the underlying concern is likely to be your ability to travel or to be at work during business hours, or your commitment to remain with the organization. Although you need not answer the question directly, you might acknowledge the employer’s concern and give assurance that your personal life will not interfere with your career responsibilities. Example: “I understand that you are concerned about my abilities to carry out the responsibilities of this position, and I assure you I will be able to.” Direct Response A more direct but less comfortable response is to mention your concern that the issue has no apparent bearing on your qualifications or ability to do the job. You may ask for clarification of the reason such information is requested or how it relates to the job discussed. Example: “It’s not clear to me why you are asking about this. Can you please explain?” Land Acknowledgement Cornell University is located on the traditional homelands of the Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' (the Cayuga Nation).
