We are thrilled that you are interested in learning more about our program. This website is designed to be highly informative, however the true USchool educational experience is best captured in person. We hope that you will schedule a tour where you can meet our dedicated teachers and motivated students and witness our curriculum in action. You would also likely run into a friendly parent volunteer or two and see how well our community works together to benefit the lives of our students. We hope to welcome you to campus and share more about our school. Thank you for your interest. Debra Price, M.Ed. Director 800 S.
