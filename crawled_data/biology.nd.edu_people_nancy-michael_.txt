John A. Zahm, C.S.C. Associate Teaching Professor Neuroscience and Behavior Contact Information: E370 Corbett Hall University of Notre Dame Notre Dame, IN 46556 574-631-2283 office nmichael@nd.edu Primary Research Areas: Neuroscience & Behavior Research Specialties: Behavioral neuroscience Experiential plasticity Neuroendocrinology Research Interests: Since December of 2014, Dr. Nancy Michael has served as the Director of Undergraduate Studies for the Neuroscience and Behavior major at the University of Notre Dame. In her few years as faculty, Dr. Michael’s dedication to excellence, innovation in education and commitment to community wellness have earned her numerous teaching, advising and community awards. In partnership with multiple community organizations, Dr. Michael works to develop and implement NEAR (neuroscience, epigenetics, adverse childhood experiences, resilience) science approaches that aim to mitigate the impact of toxic stress on individuals and communities. Her research uses a community-based change theory model to work with community organizations in developing population specific NEAR-based strategies to support organizational and community efforts in becoming trauma-informed.
