Take bold steps toward a better future for everyone by confronting some of society’s greatest issues and advocating for a number of causes. A Master of Nonprofit Management (MNM) equips students with the skills necessary to understand and manage all components of nonprofit organizations — preparing them for employment or to advance their career in a leadership role. Throughout the program, delve into volunteerism, resource management, grant management, ethics, program evaluation and more. Through service learning, students take skills from the classroom and apply them to the real world, all while building community partnerships and a professional network. Students can also choose to stand out among their peers by earning the National Nonprofit Leadership Alliance Certification, recognizing their achievements and standards in nonprofit management.
