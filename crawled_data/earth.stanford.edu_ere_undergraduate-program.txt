Energy Resources Engineering Overview About Us Admissions Undergraduate Program Coterminal MS Program Graduate Program Current Student Resources Courses Alumni Programs Research Groups Events Professional Education Careers Publications Thesis Database News Undergraduate Program The Bachelor of Science degree provides a foundation for careers in many facets of the energy industry. The program represents an evolution toward a broader forward-looking energy curriculum, while still providing an Earth-sciences based engineering approach to energy resources. One of the goals of the program is to provide experience integrating the skills developed in individual courses to address a significant design problem. In ENERGY 199 Senior Capstone Project and Seminar in Energy Resources, taken in the senior year, student teams identify and propose technical solutions for an energy-resource related problem of current interest. In collaboration with their major advisor, students will develop their individual course of study. The curriculum is structured with flexibility that allows students to explore energy topics of particular individual interest and to study abroad.
