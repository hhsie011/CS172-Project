These sessions are held either prior to the beginning of classes during Global Bears Week, or during the first week of classes, depending on the semester. Students entering in the summer will be required to attend one of the sessions prior to the fall semester. The session is designed to educate international students about their responsibilities as international students studying in the U.S. The primary goals are to help students understand the regulations that they must follow in order to remain “in status” and to make them aware of the many processes, resources, and support services that the ISSS Office has to assist them during their time at Baylor University. Students who do not attend one of the required sessions will have a hold placed on their account which will prevent them from changing their schedule, getting a transcript, registering for the following semester, etc. 7.
