Grade disputes are filed with the department offering the course in question. First step | Course Instructor The student must first contact the course instructor to provide official notice of the grade dispute and discuss the grade dispute. The instructor may ask the student for additional materials, as necessary, in an effort to resolve the dispute. If the grade dispute remains unresolved, the student may initiate the second step of the grade dispute process. Second step | Graduate Adviser Following the first step, the student may bring the grade dispute in writing to the Graduate Adviser of the department offering the course. The Graduate Adviser has the discretion to review the grade dispute in person or consider only written materials. The Graduate Adviser may require additional information as necessary. If the grade dispute remains unresolved, the student has the option to initiate the third step of the grade dispute process. The designated contacts for step two are: Courses offered in Architecture [ARC] – Danelle Briscoe Courses offered in Community and Regional Planning [CRP] – Bjørn Sletto Courses offered in Architectural Interior Design [ARI] – Clay Odom Courses offered in Landscape Architecture [LAR] – Mirka Beneš Third step | Program Director The student may bring the grade dispute in writing to the director of the academic program offering the course. The Program Director has the discretion to review the grade dispute in person or consider only written materials. The Program Director may require additional information as necessary. If the grade dispute remains unresolved, the student may bring the grade dispute to the Dean of the School of Architecture. The designated contacts for step three are: Courses offered in Architecture [ARC] – Kory Bieg Courses offered in Community and Regional Planning [CRP] – Ming Zhang Courses offered in Architectural Interior Design [ARI] – Igor Siddiqui Courses offered in Landscape Architecture [LAR] – Hope Hasbrouck Fourth step | Dean Students wishing to bring a grade dispute to the Dean are required to complete the Graduate Grade Dispute Form and provide supporting documentation as listed on the form. The Dean will review the documents and may contact the student or instructor to obtain additional information. Once the review is complete, the Dean will notify the student of the decision. The decision of the Dean is final. Neither the Graduate Adviser, Program Director, or Dean shall change a grade without first consulting with and fully considering the position of the course instructor. The instructor shall be fully advised as to the resolution of the grade dispute. Students may contact the Office of the Student Ombuds for more information about grade disputes.
