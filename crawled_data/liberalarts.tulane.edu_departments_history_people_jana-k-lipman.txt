Lipman Jana K. Lipman Professor jlipman@tulane.edu 504-862-8618 Hebert 113 Education Ph.D., Yale University, 2006 Biography Research Interests I am a scholar of U.S. foreign relations, U.S. immigration, and labor history. While my research spans numerous geographies, from Cuba to Hong Kong, at its core it investigates the local histories of diplomatic politics. My first monograph, Guantánamo: A Working-Class History between Empire and Revolution (University of California Press, 2009), argued how Cuban base workers were key actors in shaping U.S.-Cuban relations in Guantánamo, before, during, and after the revolution. My new book, In Camps: Vietnamese Refugees, Asylum-Seekers, and Repatriates (University of California Press, 2020), reveals how first asylum sites (places that hosted refugee camps) “pushed” the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to reshape international refugee policy. It also argues how Vietnamese activists in the camps and diasporic activists in resettlement countries influenced U.S. and international refugee policy. This project engages with questions raised by historians of human rights, humanitarianism, refugee studies, and Asian American studies. I have also published essays about the relationship between the U.S. military and refugee camps, and I have co-edited multiple projects on U.S. empire. My future projects include investigating the histories of sexual violence and the U.S. military, collaborative projects on Southeast Asia and U.S. foreign relations, and an ongoing commitment to public history. Teaching Interests I teach a wide range of undergraduate and graduate courses in U.S. foreign relations, immigration, and 20th century political history. Specialized classes include seminars on the U.S. War in Vietnam, U.S. Public History, and Labor and Migration. I have also taught numerous service learning classes and mentored student internships. At the graduate level, I mentor students in 20th century U.S. history, U.S. Empire, U.S.-Latin American relations, and Labor History.
