The Rubenstein Group is a theoretical chemistry group that applies both analytical and computational tools to explore a variety of problems in quantum chemistry, quantum physics, and biophysics. We currently focus upon developing new methodologies for studying problems in quantum and statistical mechanics, molecular and quantum computing, and biophysical simulation. The group welcomes summer students, high school students, undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral associates from diverse backgrounds who have the passion, creativity, and perseverance to solve complex problems. For more information about the Group and its Research, please visit the Research, Publications, People, and Events pages below. If you are a prospective undergraduate, graduate student, or post-doc interested in the group, please contact Professor Rubenstein expressing your interests via email. We are always looking for interesting and passionate students! The group will have openings for 1-2 graduate students during the Fall 2021 admissions cycle as well as 1 postdoc with a specialization in biophysics. The group is always happy to host talented undergraduates from other institutions. If you are interested in such an opportunity, first check to see if you are eligible for Leadership Alliance, S. N. Bose Fellows, or IIT Fellowships. If you are an interested high schooler, please consider the Rhode Island Advocate and American Chemical Society Project Seed programs, which sponsor students to perform independent research in preparation for science fairs such as the Rhode Island Science and Engineering Fair, International Science and Engineering Fair, Junior Science and Humanities Symposium, and Regeneron Science Talent Search.
