The department identifies ways to put all University space resources to their "highest and best use." It also defines and negotiate space exchanges between University departments and groups. To that end, the interests of the Arts and Sciences are represented by Susan Mescher, the deputy vice president of strategic planning who oversees space planning and capital projects. The space planning and programming groups that exist within the Facilities Planning department provide early stage coordination and advice on complex capital projects to make sure key elements work together to fulfill the projects' purposes and needs such as: Project definition Programming Legal approvals Real estate negotiations Major design decisions Major operating decisions The Space Information group keeps track of all University space, except at CUMC, on computerized (CAD) floor plans and linked databases. CAD plans, space assignment, occupancy and square footage information are available to Facilities personnel and other authorized University users. For information requests please complete the web request form at https://www.facil.columbia.edu/spaceinfo/. Detailed campus and neighborhood maps are also available on CAD. For any facilities issue, your first stop should be a service request. From keys to light bulbs to trash, this is the frontline for resolving issues.
