In 2011, we began emailing College of Engineering news to keep you connected with engineering at Georgia Tech. A lot has changed since our newsletter first began, and we are changing with it. Not only the title, but also the way we give you information about CoE. Rest assured, we will not spam you! Expect to get an issue about every six weeks highlighting students, alumni, and researchers in the College. We hope you will find the newsletter helpful and a source of pride. We value our alumni and hope you will find Engaging Engineers to be a sustaining connection with our engineering community.
