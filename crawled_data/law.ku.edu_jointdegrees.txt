The programs allow students to complete two degrees in less time than it would take to work toward the degrees separately. The law school is an integral part of the University of Kansas, the state's flagship research institution and a member of the prestigious Association of American Universities (AAU). That connection makes possible joint degree programs with a dozen other professional schools and departments at KU. Students must apply separately to the law school and the companion graduate program.

Browse joint degree options to learn about graduation and admission requirements for each program. Business East Asian Languages and Cultures Economics Health Services Administration Indigenous Studies Journalism Philosophy Political Science Public Administration Social Work Urban Planning Joint Degree Policies All J.D. candidates must conclude their joint degree program enrolled in courses offered at the law school, and in all cases, students receive their joint degrees concurrently. The academic affairs committee will grant exceptions to the concurrent-graduation requirement only for exigent circumstances. Higher likelihood of bar-exam success is not an exigent circumstance. All ad-hoc joint degree programs are subject to the concurrent-graduation requirement. This includes joint Ph.D. programs. Ad-hoc joint degrees are defined as any dual degree program in which the student is credited toward their J.D. for more than 6 credit hours earned in a companion graduate degree.
