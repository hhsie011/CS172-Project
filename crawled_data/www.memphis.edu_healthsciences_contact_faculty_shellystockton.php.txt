She has provided her students with experiential learning in the development, implementation and evaluation of health promotion programs by involving them at various levels in her research (as focus group facilitators, health educators, program evaluators, data collectors, authors, presenters) and service initiatives (World Food Day, Arthritis Foundation Walk, health behavior change workshops, community health fairs, walks and runs). She prides herself in having a working partnership with students to promote research and other scholarship that mutually benefits the student, the community and the University. Dr. Stockton also mentors students by being actively involved in their research. This is seen by the above average number of dissertation, thesis and special project committees on which she serves. As such, her academic career may be described as a continuous interaction among service, research and teaching with a focus of immersing our students in learning opportunities that prime them to be community leaders. As an active member of the health sciences faculty, Dr. Stockton continues to be engaged in a research agenda centered on the identification, prevention and reduction of health risks. Her research incorporates the design, implementation and treatment fidelity of community-based health behavior interventions/programs specifically targeting obesity prevention, smoking cessation and ETS reduction at specific and multiple socio-ecologic levels. Her research also involves identifying mediating and moderating variables that are intertwined in making successful health behavior changes.
