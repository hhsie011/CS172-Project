Graduate training at the Cornell Population Center (CPC) is similarly multidisciplinary and provides students with opportunities to develop fundamental demographic insights and methodological tools, as well as to engage with arguments from a range of perspectives. Why Minor in Demography? New insights: Population dynamics are fundamental to social, economic, political, and environmental change, and an understanding of demographic processes is critical to answering some of our most pressing questions. Cutting-edge research: Demographers rely on a broad set of tools for analyzing demographic data, and weekly seminars provide exposure to new developments in data and methods from prominent scholars across the U.S. and abroad. Broader community: CPC offers many opportunities to connect students with researchers (students and faculty) in other disciplines using high-quality empirical techniques to answer population-related research questions. Additional funding: CPC regularly provides funding for student travel to professional population conferences (e.g., PAA) and offers seed funding to CPC students in need of research support. CPC research is also supported by major grants, and faculty are often looking for GRAs with demographic skills during the academic year and summer months. Course Requirements The campus-wide graduate minor in Demography is open to Ph.D. students in all social science fields. To qualify for completion of the minor, students must successfully complete the following courses: a) Principles in Demography (PAM 6050/DSOC 6070), (b) Demographic Techniques (PAM 6060/DSOC 6080), (c) Demography Training Seminar (PAM 6810), and (d) one elective course from approved list of CPC courses. For more information visit Cornell Population Center Demography Training. This is a minor field. Application for admission is made only to the major fields. After matriculation, a student may select minor subjects from the major or minor fields.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
