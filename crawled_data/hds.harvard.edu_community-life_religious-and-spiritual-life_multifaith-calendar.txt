If we have not included a religious tradition or major religious holiday of significance to you, please notify the Office of the Chaplain and Religious and Spiritual Life so that it might be included in future editions of this calendar. While we have made extensive efforts to verify the accuracy of the information included here, some inaccuracies may remain. Please bring to our attention any you notice. The dates of some holidays, particularly those that are calculated according to a lunar calendar and rely on sightings of the New Moon (e.g., Islamic holidays), vary according to region; other observances and dates (e.g., Buddhist holidays) vary greatly across cultures and strands of a tradition.
