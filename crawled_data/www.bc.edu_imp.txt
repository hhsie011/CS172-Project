Strategic Plan Website Print Open All Close All Welcome Message From President William Leahy, S.J. I am pleased to introduce you to the Boston College Institutional Master Plan Web site where you will find information on Boston College’s efforts to develop a vision for growth that looks to the 21st century, but is also grounded in the University’s past. These pages offer information on the University’s strategic plan that proposes strong advances in the liberal arts, student formation, academic research, professional training, international scope and Catholic intellectual and theological life, as well as the long-range campus plan that will translate these strategic goals into the physical development of BC’s campus over the next 30 to 50 years. As we continue the work ahead, I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to this process including our task force and neighborhood council members in Allston-Brighton and Newton, the Boston Redevelopment Authority and the Newton Planning Department, elected officials, community groups, and neighbors. Boston College looks forward to continuing communication and dialogue with all parties as we move toward the development and approval of our ten-year Institutional Master Plan. William P. Leahy, S.J. President Mission of Boston College Strengthened by more than a century and a quarter of dedication to academic excellence, Boston College commits itself to the highest standards of teaching and research in undergraduate, graduate and professional programs and to the pursuit of a just society through its own accomplishments, the work of its faculty and staff, and the achievements of its graduates. It seeks both to advance its place among the nation's finest universities and to bring to the company of its distinguished peers and to contemporary society the richness of the Catholic intellectual ideal of a mutually illuminating relationship between religious faith and free intellectual inquiry. Boston College draws inspiration for its academic societal mission from its distinctive religious tradition. As a Catholic and Jesuit university, it is rooted in a world view that encounters God in all creation and through all human activity, especially in the search for truth in every discipline, in the desire to learn, and in the call to live justly together. In this spirit, the University regards the contribution of different religious traditions and value systems as essential to the fullness of its intellectual life and to the continuous development of its distinctive intellectual heritage. Boston College pursues this distinctive mission by serving society in three ways: by fostering the rigorous intellectual development and the religious, ethical and personal formation of its undergraduate, graduate and professional students in order to prepare them for citizenship, service and leadership in a global society by producing nationally and internationally significant research that advances insight and understanding, thereby both enriching culture and addressing important societal needs by committing itself to advance the dialogue between religious belief and other formative elements of culture through the intellectual inquiry, teaching and learning, and the community life that form the University. Boston College fulfills this mission with a deep concern for all members of its community, with a recognition of the important contribution a diverse student body, faculty and staff can offer, with a firm commitment to academic freedom, and with a determination to exercise careful stewardship of its resources in pursuit of its academic goals.
