Before coming to South Carolina, he was a visiting assistant professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville (1994-97). Vazsonyi earned a master’s degree in German in 1988 and a Ph.D. in Germanic Languages in 1993 at the University of California, Los Angeles. He graduated summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from Indiana University Bloomington in 1982 with a B.A. in German.

While at Indiana University, he worked behind the scenes at its internationally known opera theater. He later completed apprenticeships at the Lyric Opera of Chicago and the Deutsche Oper in Berlin. As a scholar, Vazsonyi’s research interests include composer Richard Wagner; literary figure Goethe; German national identity; Enlightenment and Romanticism; and cultural intersections in music, literature and film. He is the author of two books, more than 30 peer-reviewed articles, and conceived and edited several volumes, including “The Cambridge Wagner Encyclopedia” and the “Cambridge Companion to Wagner’s ‘Der Ring des Nibelungen.’” College of Architecture, Arts and Humanities Copyright © Clemson University College of Architecture, Arts and Humanities | 108 Strode Tower, Clemson, SC 29634 864-656-3081 | Email Us | Website Updates intro-arrow Engage With Us Through Facebook Twitter YouTube Clemson University Facebook Instagram Twitter Linkedin Youtube Tiktok Policy/Terms of Use Web Accessibility Ethics/Safety Hotline Privacy Policy Copyright © 2022 Clemson University • Clemson, South Carolina 29634 Clemson University Facebook Instagram Twitter Linkedin Youtube Tiktok Resources A-Z Index Campus Map CU Safety Directory Webcams Apply to Clemson
