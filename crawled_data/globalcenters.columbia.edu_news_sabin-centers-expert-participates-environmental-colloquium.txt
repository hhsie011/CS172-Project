The event, entitled V International Colloquium on Environmental Law "Global Pact of The Environment, Human Rights and Constitution”, aimed at addressing the integration of local and international views regarding the Global Pact, under the context of the Paris Agreement, as well as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (SDGs).

During the opening, Mena highlighted the importance of linking the Global Pact with Human Rights. Then, Moraga discussed the Global Pact initiative, its origin, ratification and the challenges is poses for the signatory parties. Parejo addressed the articulation of the Global Pact in the legal context of the European Union with a focus on the situation in Spain. Cordano opened the second conversation with a description of Chile's position in international negotiations on the Global Pact. Lastly, Galdámez, addressed the contributions and challenges that the Global Pact would imply from the perspective of the Chilean Constitution.
