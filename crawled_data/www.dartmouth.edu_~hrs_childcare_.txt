Teaching teams work in cooperation with families to produce an encouraging and supportive environment. Children are recognized and respected as individuals with unique and diverse family values and backgrounds. Children are given the opportunity to develop at their own pace in a nurturing, play-based environment that provides for their physical and emotional health and safety. Children are encouraged to make choices and develop independence while learning to be responsible members of the community.
