Is Judaism a religion, a nationality, an ethnicity, or a combination of these?

REL 257 / AMS 397 Religion and American Film Professor/InstructorJudith Weisenfeld The controversy over Mel Gibson's [The Passion of the Christ] sits in a long history of complex interactions between religious Americans and popular movies.
