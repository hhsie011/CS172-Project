Newsletters Search Enter a keyword Search About Us Mission and History Today, DDC persists in its commitment to help underserved community youth get into and graduate from college so that they can live fulfilling lives. We leverage the intellectual resources of the University to foster a culture of achievement, confidence, and hope for our first-generation and low income college-bound students. We continually refine our efforts to ensure that our students have a comprehensive network of support to help them pursue and attain their highest aspirations for success to, through, and beyond college. Just as it was in 1965, DDC’s mission is to increase the high school graduation as well as the college enrollment and graduation rates of low income and first-generation college-bound youth from public schools in Harlem and Washington Heights. DDC Statistics Annually, 90% of high school seniors participating in Double Discovery graduate from high school on time and enter college the following fall semester. This surpasses city, state and national outcomes for low-income, first-generation, college-bound and minority students.
