As you may know, there is an outbreak of a new virus in China that is causing infections primarily in the Hubei province and concentrated in the city of Wuhan. The symptoms are similar to the flu and are fever, cough, and shortness of breath due to pneumonia. Cases have now been identified in the U.S. in patients returning from China. We have not had any reported or suspected cases among the Texas Tech University community. The health and safety of all students, faculty, and staff at Texas Tech University are our top priority, and we are taking a proactive approach to this situation. Sukant Misra, Vice Provost for International Affairs, is in regular contact with those who are currently abroad and will provide ongoing updates as the situation continues to develop. We will provide additional information on spring break and summer semester study abroad programs as we receive additional information. If you or someone you know has visited China since December 1, 2019, particularly in the last 14 days, there is a risk for this infection. If you or someone you know with travel exposure develops symptoms, please seek urgent attention in the Emergency Department. Your health is our priority. Please see the link from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for more information on this virus: https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/novel-coronavirus-wuhan-china.
