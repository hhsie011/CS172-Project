While abroad, participants collaborate with community partners, actively contributing to the work of schools, environmental organizations, public health agencies, and other organizations that support community well-being. At the same time, participants deepen their community connections through family homestays, intensive language training, and carefully designed cultural enrichment activities. Application to the Novogratz Bridge Year Program is open to students who have accepted Princeton's offer of admission and have formally indicated their intention of enrolling at Princeton University.
