As the global response to HIV advances, countries are placing more emphasis on quality to improve population health. That’s why ICAP supports the Quality Improvement Capacity for Impact Project (QICIP), a five-year cooperative agreement funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). Through this project, ICAP provides ministries of health and local partners with technical assistance that enables them to analyze and improve health system performance based on appropriate standards of care. Participating countries monitor program performance, identify quality challenges, explore root causes, develop targeted interventions, and conduct rapid, iterative tests of change in programs supported by PEPFAR.
