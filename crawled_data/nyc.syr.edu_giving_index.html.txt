When you make a gift to Syracuse University, you provide the students of today-and tomorrow-with unique educational experiences and the tools they need to succeed in a world that's ever more complex. Here are just a few of the ways you can show your support. Support Another Part of Syracuse University that's Meaningful to You If your passion lies on the Syracuse University campus or in any of Syracuse University's other regional or international centers, you can direct your gift accordingly. Whether you decide to support the dean's fund in your school or college, student scholarships, faculty recruitment and retention, academic programs, facilities, or research, your gift will make a real difference to Syracuse University students. Endow a New York City-Based Program Students from across Syracuse University's schools and colleges participate in NYC immersion programs both large and small. During a New York City trip for the creative writing graduate program, for example, third-year students are able to spend time visiting publishers, literary agents, and literary magazines in New York City, all expenses paid. The program is made possible by a generous endowment established by Alan Mirken. Other endowments have established programs that run through the summer, during spring break, or even for one day. Regardless of the time frame, they provide students with unmatched access to the world beyond the Syracuse campus. Give Now Have Questions? Contact a member of our SU in NYC Development Team!
