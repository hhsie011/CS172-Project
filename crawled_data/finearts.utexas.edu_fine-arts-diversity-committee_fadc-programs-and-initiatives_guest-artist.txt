APPLY GET INVOLVED Search this Website Search FADC Guest Artist Initiatives Proposal The Fine Arts Diversity Council (FADC) supports and collaborates with the COFA units in the design and implementation of strategies that advance diversity. By actively establishing and fostering a culture of inclusivity throughout the College community, the council assists in the development of recruitment and retention strategies for underrepresented students, faculty and staff; provides forums for mutual respect, an appreciation of differences, and cross-cultural understandings; and prepares our community for a changing global society. We also welcome proposals from COFA students for projects that will further the FADC mission. Our student grant initiative can be accessed here. We welcome proposals from staff and faculty for guest artists and speakers whose presence on the UT campus will further the mission above. Up to $1,000 will be available for each proposal originating from a single department or academic unit of the COFA; proposals involving collaboration between multiple departments/units may be funded up to an additional $1,000 for the project ($2,000 total maximum). Proposals will be reviewed three times a year on Oct. 1, Feb. 1, and May 1, and must be submitted at least eight weeks before the proposed residency. To apply, provide the information prompted below.
