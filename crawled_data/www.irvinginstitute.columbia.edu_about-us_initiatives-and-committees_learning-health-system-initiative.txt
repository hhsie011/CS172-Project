Since then, this diverse and talented group has worked together to outline a strategy to engage the broader CU medical community and build a leading program in Learning Health System. Mission The mission of the Learning Health System initiative at Columbia University is to optimize our health systemâ€™s performance by enhancing the patient experience, improving population health, reducing costs, and improving the work life of health care providers in alignment with the Quadruple Aim. It aims to do this by leveraging CU and NYP resources and interdisciplinary partnerships to create sustainable processes, resources and training on rapid, rigorous design, evaluation and implementation of interventions particularly using real-time informatics data and digital health tools. Fall 2021 Learning Health System Symposium In December 2021 we held the inaugural Learning Health System symposium featuring Columbia University faculty that are integrating informatics, research, and clinical practice programs to solve real-world problems in real-time and continuously iterating knowledge to practice and practice to knowledge in a learning health system cycle. The symposium also featured two external speakers describing an overview of a learning health system and federally funded programs in quality improvement, evidence-based interventions, and interesting areas for further research. Watch a recording of the event (Columbia UNI required). A funding opportunity was announced at the meetings conclusion to encourage collaborative teams to submit learning health system research ideas.
