Of the anthropology courses, one must be ANTH 01, 03, 05, 06, 08, or 09 and another must be a culminating experience—ANTH 72, 73, 74, 75, or 76. The seven major courses must include at least one course from TWO of the three subfields (ARCH, BIOL, CULT). Students wishing to modify their Anthropology major must submit a written rationale that makes clear the coherence and purpose of their modified major. Modified A: A modified "type A" major consists of the seven courses from Anthropology (as described above) and four courses from another single department or program. The plan requires approval of the Anthropology chair (or faculty delegate). The plan also requires approval of the chair (or faculty delegate) for the secondary department or program. Both faculty members, in approving the plan, indicate that the resulting major is an intellectually integrated package. When such a major has been completed, the final records will show a major for, say, 'Anthropology Modified with Biology.' Modified B: A modified "type B" major consists of the seven courses from Anthropology (as described above) and four courses that are not from a single department or program. Only approval of the Anthropology chair (or approved faculty delegate) is required. When a student completes the major, it will be entered in the permanent record as 'Anthropology Modified.' How to Modify Your Anthropology Major Students wishing to modify their Anthropology major must submit a written rationale that makes clear the coherence and purpose of their modified major. This rationale must be reviewed by and approved by any faculty in the Anthropology department, and must also be submitted to the Registrar. For more information on modified majors, see the ORC/Catalog. If you are interested in pursuing the Honors Program and the faculty approves your thesis proposal, you must enroll in ANTH 88. This course would be counted as the twelfth course beyond the eleven required to complete the modified major.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Anthropology Undergraduate Overview Major Modified Major Minor Global Health Minor How to Declare an Anthropology Major or Minor Courses Introductory Courses Archaeology Biological Anthropology Cultural Anthropology Independent Study Culminating Seminars Past Teaching Schedules Honors Program Honors Proposal Submission Form Transfer Credits Careers Alumni: Where Are They Now?
