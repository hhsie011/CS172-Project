Any university-level policy that is not in the library will not be considered official policy. We are beginning the process of incorporating school-, college-, and division-level policies into the library. If you are interested in moving your school, college, or division policies to the policy library, please email policylibrarycoordinator@wisc.edu. To help maintain the integrity of the policy library, all campus constituents should use the resources and tools linked under Policy Development when developing new policy or revising existing policy. In addition, any policy links published on campus websites or in Knowledgebases should go directly to those policies in the library.
