This is an office of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and acts as its proxy by coordinating activities which include but are not limited to course registration; enrollment patterns (D-Plans); assignment of classes to classrooms; records maintenance of courses offered and grades awarded; certification of students for graduation; and maintenance, protection and release of academic records. This office certifies student enrollments, degrees awarded and academic eligibility to various governmental, public, private and academic agencies. These agencies include, but are not limited to, the Veterans Administration and the National Student Clearinghouse as required by law and/or requested by students within the guidelines of the law. All release of student information is guided by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 as Amended (FERPA). Many student academic services are available on the web via DartHub and Banner. Students contact or come into our office for other individual services such as to submit a petition, file a course withdrawal, or to seek guidance or information. All are welcome, and we are committed to the principles of diversity and inclusion. We look forward to helping make your Dartmouth experience a good one.
