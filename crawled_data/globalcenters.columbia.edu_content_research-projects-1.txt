The Center provides students and scholars a base from which to conduct research in Tunisia and for the regions of Western and Northern Africa. To encourage and support research at the Global Centers, the President of Columbia University, Lee Bollinger, established the President’s Global Innovation Fund (PGIF), a program providing grants to Columbia Faculty who utilize the 9 Global Centers as a resource for teaching and research activities. The program is designed as a venture fund to enable the development of projects and research collaborations within and across these sites, in order to increase global opportunities for research, teaching, and service. Leveraging the experience and expertise of Columbia University faculty, the Tunis Center promotes reflection and action on Tunisia’s most pressing issues. We seek out and support important research conducted locally to deepen collaborations between Columbia, our Center, and critical research institutes across Tunisia. Pr. Eric Verhoogen presenting Why Export matters President's Global Innovation Fund (PGIF) The President’s Global Innovation Fund (PGIF) awards grants for faculty members to collaborate with Columbia’s network of global centers. The program aims to enable the development of new projects and scholarly collaborations across global centers, in order to increase global opportunities for research, teaching, and service.
