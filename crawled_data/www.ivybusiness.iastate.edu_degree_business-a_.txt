They need the talent to help them drive insights from data, which is key for making solid decisions. Choosing a career in business analytics provides you with a unique opportunity. You’ll be in demand and you will have the opportunity to make a significant impact in a company or organization. Businesses will need you. Companies that are committed to making data-driven decisions use business analytics, a process that combines technology, statistics, and business. In this major, you will learn the skills, technologies, and best practices for analytical problem solving, skills that help organizations gain insight and drive improved performance. Real-World Experience As a business student, you can participate in an internship as early as your first or second summer in college.
