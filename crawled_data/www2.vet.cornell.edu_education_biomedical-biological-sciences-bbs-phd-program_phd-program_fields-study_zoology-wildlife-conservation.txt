Joint Graduate Training Program between Cornell University and the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) Several faculty within the BBS wildlife conservation research specialty participate in the Joint Graduate Training Program (JGTP) with the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI). Any prospective student interested in the JGTP must address this interest in their PhD application personal statement. A student enrolled in the joint graduate training program has two research mentors, a Cornell Faculty member as your major advisor (Chair) and a scientific staff member from the SCBI to serve as your co-mentor. Utilizing expertise from both institutions, you would be working collaboratively and would be expected to study on site at both locations (Cornell in Ithaca, NY and SCBI in Front Royal, VA). During your 1st year you will have three lab rotations, including one at the SCBI. This SCBI rotation could occur in the summer prior to or after your first academic year.
