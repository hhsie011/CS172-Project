Google Scholar results include links to Brown University Library resources. These links will appear automatically if you search from an on-campus computer or use this Brown-specific URL: http://scholar.google.com/scholar_setprefs?num=30&instq=&inst=12301228881857859123&inststart=0&submit=Save+Preferences If you are off-campus and do not use the Brown-specific URL, you must go to “Scholar Preferences” and search for “Brown.” Please note that all off-campus users must log into the VPN client or to EZPROXY. The Brown links appear as: Find It @ Brown Full Text at the end of the article title if the Library subscribes to full text or Find It @ Brown to search the Library’s catalog or to place an interlibrary loan request.
