There will be a brand-new Crenshaw Lanes bowling alley in the new union when it opens (anticipated fall 2021). For more information, visit: new.union.fsu.edu Welcome! Crenshaw Lanes is a premier bowling center to be located in the Florida State University Student Union. This facility is under construction as part of the New FSU Student Union Project and will reopen in Fall 2021. Crenshaw Lanes has been an FSU tradition since 1964, with a twelve lane facility previously housed in the Oglesby Union Complex. Construction began in Spring 2018 and more information on the project can be found at new.union.fsu.edu. Along with bowling, Crenshaw Lanes offered full sized billiards tables and a number of programs including bowling leagues, billiards tournaments, intramurals, parties, cosmic bowling, late night programming and open bowling. Crenshaw Lanes was and will be a popular party spot for student and university groups. Crenshaw Lanes also serves as the home to the FSU Bowling Team. The bowling team represents FSU in intercollegiate bowling competition and has established itself as one of the elite programs in the country. The FSU Bowling Team is active during the renovation project.
