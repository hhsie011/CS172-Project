Admission requirements Inside the Program Study abroad provides invaluable experience for student Sam Belsan, Secondary History major, was among the first students at WSU to participate in the Teach in Paraguay program. The summer study abroad program allows education majors to gain experience student teaching in Paraguay. While there, Sam was also able to try Paraguayan delicacies, meet with government officials and explore the ruins. Sam shared, "The students at Colegio del Sol also made my time in Ciudad del Este remarkable. They embraced me as a person who could help them grow in their understanding of English and I embraced them as people who could help me grow in my understanding of Paraguay."
