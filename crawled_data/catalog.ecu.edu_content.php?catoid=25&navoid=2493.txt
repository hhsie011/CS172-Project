If you are currently attending a North Carolina community college to complete an AA or AS degree with plans to transfer to ECU, we have developed baccalaureate degree plans which can help you select your coursework at the community college. Following these degree plans will ensure you are best positioned to transfer smoothly to ECU. Please note that these plans are published as an example of how a degree from ECU can be completed. Course availability, prior credit, course prerequisites, and student needs must be considered in developing an individual academic pathway. Following the Baccalaureate Degree Plan does not guarantee admission to ECU or guarantee a degree will be conferred. Students should seek academic advising to determine the best course of study to meet their educational goals and degree requirements. Baccalaureate Degree Plans are housed on the Office of the Registrar website: https://registrar.ecu.edu/caa-transfer-degree-plans/.
