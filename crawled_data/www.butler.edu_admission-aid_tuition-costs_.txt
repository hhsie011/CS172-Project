Overwhelming, even. Our goal is to make this process as understandable and digestible as possible. If something doesn’t make sense, please ask us—we want to help! Your tuition dollars make Butler’s high-quality academic experience possible and preserve the value of a Butler degree. Our close-knit community of faculty, staff, and students help Bulldogs do their very best work. When asked, a majority of Butler students say that faculty have taken a personal interest in them academically, and believe in their potential to succeed. And succeed they do. Ninety-seven percent of Bulldogs are employed or attending graduate school within one year of graduation, due in large part to the experience they receive while at Butler. See All Butler Graduate Outcomes Cost of Attendance When we talk about college costs, we split them into two buckets: direct and indirect costs. Butler sets direct costs—the tuition, room, board, and fees paid by students. Indirect costs include things such as books, supplies, costs to get to and from campus, and other items (tickets to watch the Pacers, say, or an afternoon at the Indianapolis Museum of Art). The standard full-time undergraduate student budget used to determine financial aid eligibility is outlined below.
