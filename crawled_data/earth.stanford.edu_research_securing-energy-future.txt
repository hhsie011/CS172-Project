Stanford Earth and other schools at Stanford are investing heavily in research aimed at developing new approaches, technologies, and policies for a reliable, affordable, and low- or no-carbon energy future. As we move toward that future, our research aims to help ensure that fossil fuels are extracted and used as efficiently as possible, with the fewest negative consequences, and in a way that complements the growth of renewable resources. How our scientists work toward the energy futureH The world will use 100 million barrels of oil a day for the next 50 years, despite the march toward renewable energy. Will we do that in an uncontrolled way? Stanford Earth researchers are developing greener ways of extracting oil and mitigating the resulting greenhouse gases. Read more...
