We value the academic, social and broader community benefits that arise from a diverse campus and are committed to equity, inclusion and accountability. Diversity enriches our University community and is a driving force instrumental to our institutional success and fulfillment of the University’s mission. We commit to engaging in an ongoing dialogue to thoughtfully respond to the changing realities of our increasingly interconnected world.

The competencies gained through diverse experiences across campus prepare all of our students, staff and faculty to thrive personally and professionally in a global society.
