CHRIS works under the direction of the California Office of Historic Preservation (OHP) and the State Historic Resources Commission (SHRC). The SCCIC houses information about historical resources (e.g. location, size, age, etc.) within Ventura, Los Angeles, and Orange Counties per CHRIS standards. Information about historical resources is maintained in various forms such as 7.5 USGS Quadrangle Maps, historical resource records and reports, and computerized data. SCCIC clients are generally archaeologists, historians, architectural-historians, developers, and public agencies. Information Centers provide historical resources information to local governments and individuals with responsibilities under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), and California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). A fee is charged for maintaining the information and any assistance provided.
