We're merging scientific disciplines, using state-of-the-art materials synthesis & structures fabrication approaches, and building bespoke instruments to investigate quantum phenomena. Our collaborative efforts across several quantum research themes are beginning to yield new quantum devices with applications in computers, communications, energy, finance, health, and climate.
