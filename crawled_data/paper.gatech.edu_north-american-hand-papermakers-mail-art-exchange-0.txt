Each month NAHP provides a theme pertaining to a concept or technique for participants to create a series or edition of paper works to be shared with others. Through this exchange NAHP hopes to connect paper lovers to each other and create a greater sense of community through snail mail! Using handmade paper is not required and participants are responsible for their own postage. All flat works were required to fit inside a 9 ½” x 12 ½” envelope and any 3D work could not exceed 4” in any direction. Robert C. Williams Museum of Papermaking is the official home of the exchange archive.
