Response by Kenneth Frampton Grafton Architects November 20, 2013 Grafton Architects: 2013 Kenneth Frampton Endowed Lecture Yvonne Farrell and Shelley McNamara, Grafton Architects In the third annual Kenneth Frampton Endowed Lecture, Grafton Architects Principals Yvonne Farrell and Shelley McNamara explore the architect’s role as interpreter of various needs—from from site and space to language and culture—into built form. Drawing on their Universita Luigi Bocconi in Milan, Italy, and a “new cliff” for the Universidad de Ingeniería & Tecnología (UTEC) that overlooks the Pacific Ocean in Lima, Peru, the architects grapple with highlighting difference, nuance, and social and cultural specificity over an “Esperanto” of architecture, and, recalling the language, literature, and visual metaphors of their native Ireland, question what is lost in translation.
