With an ultimate goal to help enhance the resilience and sustainability of society, our mission is to create knowledge that can be used both to reduce the detrimental effects of wind, such as the life and property losses caused by windstorms, and to improve the efficiency and reliability of wind energy harvesting. To realize this mission, we perform analytical, numerical and experimental studies to tackle the critical problems posed by wind. These studies are supported by unique research facilities administered by NWI.
