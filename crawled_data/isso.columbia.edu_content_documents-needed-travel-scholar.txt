Documents Recommended for Travel Within the U.S. Domestic travel includes travel to any of the 50 states or travel to the U.S. territories (Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa). When traveling within the U.S. (even if youâ€™re not crossing any borders or traveling by air), we recommend that you travel with your passport and other immigration status-related documents. Expand all Collapse all Travel FAQs I'm a J-1 scholar and received an I-515 at the airport. What does this mean? If a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Officer determines your documentation is incomplete, you may be issued a Form I-515A and a date-specific I-94 card for admission in J-1 status. This will grant you only 30 days instead of the usual duration of status (D/S). To have your legal status extended: 1. Follow the instructions on what to do if you get an I-515. 2. Submit the required documents before the expiration date of the I-94 card. 3. Visit us as soon as possible with an I-515. We will assist you with the documentation you need. I experienced delays when entering the U.S. at the port of entry. What should I do? Sometimes scholars are sent to secondary inspection so that a port of entry officer can verify your status. If you are sent to secondary inspection on multiple occasions, it may be helpful to file a report through DHS Trip. I donâ€™t have an entry visa for my current status because I changed status inside the U.S. Is this a problem when my dependents want to travel? Yes, if you donâ€™t have an entry visa for you current status, your dependents won't be able to obtain a dependent visa. You must obtain a visa for your current status first.
