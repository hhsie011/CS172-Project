After reading the descriptions, simply click on a program name and it will redirect you to the online reservation calendar and form. How do I know if the program is appropriate for my students? All K-12 programming has been aligned with state standards [TEKS]. The K-12 team has studied the language of the standards and will make adjustments to programming based on the grade level and needs of your students. Each K-12 program has a menu of basic options that are used to adjust the language of instruction and activities to meet the needs of various grade levels. What are the basic features of your programs? Programs might contain some of the following basic features: Introduction to physical and human geography using our 10'x12' floor maps of the continent or region and standards based vocabulary [grade level appropriate] Hands-on examination of artifacts from featured countries Families Video Series for featured countries Hands-on culturally relevant activities and crafts Cultural traditions and celebrations *Special Guests: Interaction with international students, traditional music, and dance performances.

We are located at 601 Indiana Avenue [4th and Indiana] - just behind the TTU Museum and across the street from UMC. We also offer many of our programs through our "On the Road Adventures" for schools that cannot visit the ICC, though we highly recommend bringing your students to our beautiful building for the full cultural experience. *Note: Some of our programming choices are not offered for "On the Road Adventures". Special Guests and performances are not part of the basic programming choices for "On the Road Adventures". Participation and scheduling will be based on their availability. [Map to ICC] When are programs offered? K-12 GEO programs are offered throughout the academic year (September-May). K-12 GEO does not offer after hours or weekend programming at this time. Typical program times range from 1 Â½ to 2 hours long. Choose either a morning or afternoon time for regular programs. Though our online reservation form offers specific program times for scheduling, timing can be adjusted to meet your needs. Seasonal programming for special cultural events and celebrations is offered throughout the year. These programs are scheduled at specific times in the morning and afternoon to accommodate large audiences and/or multiple K-12 campuses at once. Students will be divided into groups to rotate through the program activities. Every effort is made to keep campuses/groups together. We do ask that teachers and parents help to chaperone these groups as they move through the program stations. Do we need chaperones for the program? One chaperone or teacher is required for every fifteen (15) students attending the program. *Note: In addition to being a learning center, the ICC is also a working office building and art gallery.

You can access specific programming information under the PROGRAM OPTIONS OR PROGRAM RESERVATIONS tab on the website. K-12 GEO has only four staff members- two of which are part-time and do not work during the summer.
