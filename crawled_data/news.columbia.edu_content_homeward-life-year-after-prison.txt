Drawing from more than 100 in-depth interviews, Bruce Western, the Bryce Professor of Sociology and Social Justice, demonstrates how poverty, racial inequality, and failures of social support trap many in a cycle of vulnerability despite their efforts to rejoin society. In the first year after prison, most could not afford their own housing. Many struggled with chronic pain, mental illnesses, or addiction, and most were unemployed. Western advocates increased assistance in the first year after prison, including guaranteed housing and health care, drug treatment, and transitional employment. 212-854-5573 [email protected] Genre Nonfiction Topic Social Sciences Contact Us [email protected] Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University Â©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
