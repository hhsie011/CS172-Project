Attend an Information Session Your first step is to attend a study abroad information session. This is required. Sessions are from 4:00-5:00 pm every Monday and Tuesday during the semester (except when the university is closed). Sessions are on the second floor of Hankamer, room 263. You do not need to schedule an appointment for these sessions; walk in! However, you must attend a session before you can make an appointment with an advisor. This will allow you to learn about: Program options Application requirements and deadlines Program Costs & Financial Aid 2. Research Study Abroad Opportunities First, ask yourself. "What am I planning to do?" as opposed to "what location am I looking for?" Follow our advice on choosing a program. Understand your options to study, intern, or conduct research abroad Consider taking our study abroad course GBL 1101 Use our program search pages to search by major or country Are you an incoming freshman?

Make an Academic Plan Study Abroad - Course Plan Tool: Use this to get a list of primary and alternate courses that fit your 4-year plan. Speak with your academic advisor about your potential study abroad aspirations. Bring the course planning tool to help you. 4. Make an Appointment With a Peer Advisor Ready to talk with someone? Schedule a Peer Advising Appointment here! (Make an appointment after you have gone to the study abroad information session). Are you the parent of a Baylor Bear? We would love to meet with you and answer all of your questions! Sign up for a Parent Advising Appointment and see our parent information page. 5. Research Funding Opportunities Funding opportunities are available to study abroad students through scholarships.  Global Programs, individual colleges, and academic departments, and other resources outside the university may have scholarships available.  6. Open an Application Once you have decided on a program, go ahead and apply! You can click the "Apply Now" button at the bottom of your program's brochure page. All brochure pages are located in Bears Abroad. Opening an application does not commit you to the program, but it will allow you to complete some essential steps in the application process. Applications for each program generally open 10-12 months in advance (i.e., Fall 2022 applications will open sometime in Fall 2021). Application Timeline Application Process 7. Make an Appointment With the Study Abroad Programs Advisor Ready to talk with the Study Abroad Program Advisor? You will be given a link to schedule this appointment after meeting with the Study Abroad Peer Advisor. Study Abroad advisers work with a specific portfolio of programs and can help answer questions about your program of interest including how other programs compare, the application process, pre-departure processes, and cultural preparation. 8. Submit your Application Application Timeline Application Process Requesting a Recommendation Will I Be Approved? Tips Your acceptance into the program will be communicated to you via email one week after the application deadline. Your application status will be updated to “Ready for Review” in our database. This designation means that you have been accepted by the study abroad office and nominated to study abroad at your host institution. Your study abroad advisor will also send an overview of your next steps, which may include a second application from your host institution. Final acceptance to study abroad is not guaranteed until you have been accepted by your host institution. You will have two weeks to decide whether or not you will commit to your study abroad program. I'm Accepted..What's Next?
