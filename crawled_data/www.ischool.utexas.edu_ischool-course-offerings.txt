Beginning with a contextualization of the field, and of its precedents in European collecting practice, public records offices, and museums, the course will employ both a theoretical and practical approach to archival media product. Debates over the merits (and drawbacks) of defining media product as "artifact" will be complemented by larger discussions over the practical ramifications of copyright and physical deterioration - increasingly problematic areas for both the filmmaker and academic researcher. Subjects will include: preservation principles, the impact of access programs and strategies, and the role of the archivist or curator. Utilizing the literature available as well as film and video resources of the University of Texas and the Austin community at large, students will combine an analytical approach to the history and theory of collecting with "hands-on" research - from Hollywood features and educational films, to home movies and the ever vanishing footage of the public domain. 2021 Misinformation and Disinformation Examines misinformation, disinformation and other forms of networked manipulation, which can function not only to deceive and create divisions, but also to diminish trust in information intermediaries such as journalism and science.

The second part of the course will be focused on providing students with in-depth knowledge of how to design and implement sound ontologies for semantic systems. Particular attention will be given to smart use of ontology languages such as RDF/OWL (W3C standard) and topic maps (ISO standard). In a summary, this course will be focused on designing and implementing interoperable metadata and ontology schemas using XML and Ontology Editors. However, it will not deal with developing interfaces of those systems, so programming skills are not required for this class. 2021 Participatory Design and Research for Special Populations This seminar will examine methods used in empirical research studies that focus on designing or researching computational technologies with or for people from underserved communities (e.g., empirical studies from IS-related fields such as HCI and CSCW).

Many designers and user researchers view usability and user research as qualitative activities, which do not use formulas and numbers. However, usability practitioners and user researchers are increasingly expected to quantify the benefits of their efforts. The impact of good and bad designs can be quantified in terms of user performance, task completion rates and times, perceived user satisfaction. The course will address questions frequently faced by user researchers, such as, how to compare usability of products for A/B testing and competitive analysis, how to measure the interaction behavior and attitudes of users, how to estimate the number of users needed for usability testing. The course will introduce students to a foundation for statistical theories and the best practices needed to apply them. It will cover descriptive statistics, confidence intervals, standardized usability questionnaires, correlation, regression, and analysis of variance. It will also address how to effectively communicate the quantitative results. 2021 Rapid Prototyping and Lean UX Methodology Introduction to basic design concepts such as composition, color theory, interactions; the Lean UX methodology, history, predecessor, pros/cons, and adaptations on Lean UX and case studies from companies such as Google; application of rapid prototyping using the latest design tools and methods. 2022 Rapid Protoyping and Lean UX Methodology Introduction to basic design concepts such as composition, color theory, interactions; the Lean UX methodology, history, predecessor, pros/cons, and adaptations on Lean UX and case studies from companies such as Google; application of rapid prototyping using the latest design tools and methods 2021 Seminar in Propaganda, Deception and Manipulation in the Technology Era Examination of propaganda and disinformation campaigns, the psychology behind how they work and how they became central to both the Cold War and political elections; as well as the advent of social media and algorithmic optimization to facilitate and accelerate the reach and impact. 2022 Technology Learning Studio In this class we'll learn how to learn new technologies.

We will investigate how notions of control, access and expression have changed during the 20th and the 21st centuries, examining communication policies and regulation against a backdrop of technological innovation. Our point of departure is that definitions of and debates on what constitutes the public interest intersect with policies for broadcasting, cablecasting, computer networks (the Internet) and various other telecommunications systems. The course begins by examining some of the framing documents and events that established expectations about how communications and telecommunications systems should function in American society and with what goals; the course pursues the events and shifts in broadcasting, cable, telephony, and network communication (particularly the Internet) history in order to discover how original conceptualizations have become wedded to marketplace notions. 2022 Cybersecurity Law and Policy See instructor's previous syllabus sample. 2022 Privacy, Surveillance, and National Security Introduction to U.S. federal information policy, with emphasis on privacy and surveillance in the post-9/11 environment and brief consideration of American intelligence work.
