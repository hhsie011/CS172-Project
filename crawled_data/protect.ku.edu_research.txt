As a Research I university, one of KU’s top priorities is a safe and thoughtful reactivation of our research endeavors. The Office of Research has relaxed some of its required procedures for research operations that had been imposed in 2020, such as: Researchers are no longer required to create and maintain individual lab and fieldwork COVID-19 safety plans that are approved by deans, department chairs or center directors and kept on file with the Office of Research. Research facility managers are no longer required to track vendors or other visitors to buildings. Human subjects researchers should contact the Human Research Protection Program if they have questions about how this new phase affects their studies. Protocol modifications will be considered on a case-by-case basis. See the KU Office of Research’s Next Steps for On-Campus Research guidelines for more details about health and safety measures for researchers.
