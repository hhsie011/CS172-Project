Computer Electrical & Computer Engineering Research Electrical and computer engineering (ECE) leverages fundamental principles to advance technologies ranging from semiconductor devices to advanced communication networks, from self-powered sensors to electric cars, from wearable devices to cognitive medical imaging, and from autonomous vehicles to smart cities. Numerous subfields are found within this broad discipline, all of which are built on the foundations of mathematics and computer science, physical and life sciences, electromagnetics, electronics, and systems. Graduate engineering students are expected to propose a plan of study that supports their interests, potentially including distinctive intellectual paths unconstrained by disciplinary boundaries and enriched by interdisciplinary synergies. ECE research addresses key challenges in the following sub-areas supported by leading faculty in their fields. On This Page Computing Systems & Controls Electronic Materials & Devices Photonics & Optics Power Electronics Space Science and Engineering Computing Systems & Controls Systems and controls engineering utilizes mathematical and computational techniques for modeling, estimation, and process management. Applications of these techniques advance our understanding of complex systems, including human cognition and learning, toward the greater goal of service to society. Research Subfields Artificial intelligence Cloud computing and embedded systems Computational social systems High-throughput computing Machine learning Signal Processing Soft computing Researchers George Cybenko Amro M. Farid Geoffroy Hautier Elizabeth L. Murnane Kofi M. Odame Laura Ray Eugene Santos Jr. Stephen Taylor Electronic Materials & Devices Materials and devices with unique electrical properties and functionality are advancing innovation in the areas of sensing, photonics, and biomedicine. Research Subfields Analog integrated circuits Biological circuit design Computational materials design Electronic assembly High-performance printed and flexible devices Micromechanical and electromechanical systems (MEMS) Neuroelectronics Optoelectronic materials and devices Researchers Hui Fang Eric R. Fossum Geoffroy Hautier Weiyang (Fiona) Li Jifeng Liu Kofi M. Odame Rahul Sarpeshkar William Scheideler John X.J. Zhang Photonics & Optics Harnessing the fundamental properties of light across the entire electromagnetic spectrum continues to uncover new applications for medicine, sensing methodologies, and security systems. Research Subfields Advanced imaging systems Integrated nanophotonics Molecular imaging Near field optics Solid-state image sensors Researchers Petr Brůža Scott C. Davis Eric R. Fossum Jifeng Liu Kimberley S. Samkoe Fridon Shubitidze Power Electronics The capability of power electronics to control and convert electrical energy is essential to the use of many modern high-efficiency components such as LED lighting and brushless motors as well as interfacing renewable energy sources to the power grid. Research Subfields Integrated circuit design for power electronics Resonant switched capacitor (ReSC) and other advanced power converter topologies Applications in battery management, photovoltaics, and digital systems Magnetics and passive component modeling, design and optimization Wireless power transfer Microfabrication of power magnetics for integrated power conversion Researchers Jason T. Stauth Charles R. Sullivan Space Science and Engineering To investigate the influence of the Sun on the near-Earth space environment and the flow of energy through the geospace system, researchers use ground-based radar measurements of the motion of plasma in the ionosphere made by the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN). Dartmouth engineers are responsible for two radars in the network, located in central Oregon, and are constructing two additional radars in Iceland. Research Subfields Ionospheric remote sensing Global-scale magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling Convection climatology Radiowave propagation Data assimilation and synthesis Researchers Simon G.
