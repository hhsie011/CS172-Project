The card is used for almost all services on campus including: dining plans, checking-out library books, accessing residence halls and attending athletic events. About the Card The Dartmouth Card is the simplest and fastest way to pay for everything you need. If your Dartmouth Card is lost or stolen, simply notify the Dartmouth Card Office during regular business hours (call at 603-646-3724), or the Department of Safety and Security (call at 603-646-4000) to have it deactivated for the safe-keeping of your accounts. For more information, see "Lost or Stolen." Door Access The Dartmouth Card Office does not determine the validity of door access requests. We do not have authorization to add or alter door access privileges. Please contact the building manager of the area which you are seeking to access. Support & Policies Customer Support The Dartmouth Card Office provides Administrative Fees and Fines customer support and can help identify the office or department responsible for posting specific charges. This information is also available by viewing your account transactions through Banner Student or a registered GET Funds account. Please know that while the Dartmouth Card Office does hold the Administrative Fees and Fines account, we are not responsible for the charges posted to it (with the exception of the lost or stolen Dartmouth Card replacement fee). Questions relating to specific charges should be directed to the individual College department that posted the charge. Dining Plan Changes Support Dining plan change requests are only accepted from the student. Change requests are only accepted through the online change form. For security and consistency, students must log into web authentication in order to submit a change request. When active, the form will be available through a link on the DartCard information page for Dining Plan Change Requests. Answers for frequently asked questions and general facts about dining changes can be found on the DartCard information page for Dining Questions & Concerns. Policies Administrative Hold: Unpaid Fees & Fines The practice to place holds against registration Check-In for unpaid balances in the Fees & Fines account associated with the student ID card has been suspended. As of August 2019, any owed balance in the Fees & Fines account associated with the student ID card will be reset and transferred for billing to the student account with Campus Billing/D-Pay in time for the tuition bills release each term. Students are invited to monitor their Fees & Fines balances and charges through the “Dash Account” feature in DartHub. Be sure to select the Fees & Fines account in the dropdown for transaction detail. If students would like to pay Fees & Fines before they are billed to their student account, they may do so through GET Funds or the CBORD GET Mobile app. Unpaid Balances Reset Card account Fees & Fines owed balances are subject to reset each billing cycle. A system operation clears any negative balances owed on the transaction processing system, and then transfers them to the student account/D-Pay for billing. After such action has occurred, the Dartmouth Card Office no longer holds those balances and cannot accept payment toward them. Payments for owed balances transferred from the Dartmouth Card accounts must then be processed on D-Pay. The DASH Discretionary account will only support a positive balance. The Unpaid Balances Reset only applies to the Fees & Fines account. GET Funds Online Deposits Accepted payment card types: MasterCard, Visa, Discover or American Express. When accessing the GET Funds site, please be sure to use Firefox or Safari from a computer. For mobile devices, we recommend obtaining the mobile app "GET Mobile" developed by The CBORD Group, inc. Disclosure IMPORTANT: ALL QUESTIONS ABOUT TRANSACTIONS MADE WITH YOUR DARTCARD MUST BE DIRECTED TO DARTMOUTH COLLEGE, AND NOT TO THE BANK OR OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTION WHERE YOU HAVE AN ACCOUNT FROM WHICH YOU LOAD YOUR DARTCARD. Individual purchases made with your DartCard are listed in DartHub, as well as on the GET app, which are updated in real time. Dartmouth will not send you a periodic statement listing transactions that you make using your DartCard. Click on “DA$H Accounts” in DartHub to see the current balances and transactions details. You may also link to GET in order at add funds to your DA$H Discretionary account and to pay your Fees and Fines account. You may also install the GET app on your smartphone. If you have any questions about one of these transactions, call or write us at the DartCard Office, 603-646-3724 during normal business hours, via email to Dartmouth.Card@dartmouth.edu, or at 6132 McNutt Hall, Room 103. Pre-Funding your DA$H Discretionary account: When you prepay money into your DA$H Discretionary account, you will receive an email receipt called a “GET deposit confirmation.” These deposits will appear on the statement issued by your bank or other financial institution, and are also listed on your DartCard Account found in DartHub, as well as on the GET app. Check this information against the account statement you receive from your bank or other financial institution. Please note: loading funds into your DA$H Discretionary account from a credit card may be more expensive than loading funds directly from a checking or savings account; please consult your credit card agreement or contact your credit card issuer to determine whether transactions loading money into your DA$H Discretionary account from a credit card will be processed as a “cash advance” or as a standard purchase. In Case of Errors or Questions About Your Electronic Transfers, telephone us at 603-646-3724, write us at 6132 McNutt Hall, Room 103, or email us at Dartmouth.Card@dartmouth.edu as soon as you can, if you think the information on your DartCard account on DartHub, the GET app, or email receipt for deposit is wrong, or if you need more information about a transfer. We must hear from you no later than 90 days after your financial institution sent the FIRST statement on which the problem or error appeared. (1) Tell us your name and account number (if any). (2) Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe it is an error or why you need more information. (3) Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error. If you tell us orally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within 10 business days. We will determine whether an error occurred within 10 business days after we hear from you and will correct any error promptly. If we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 days to investigate your complaint or question. If we decide to do this, we will credit your account within 10 business days for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have the use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation. If we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 business days, we may not credit your account. For errors involving new accounts, point-of-sale, or foreign-initiated transactions, we may take up to 90 days to investigate your complaint or question. We will tell you the results within 3 business days after completing our investigation. If we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation. You may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.
