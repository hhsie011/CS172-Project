IMPORTANT: Update your goals in Ignite. This ensures your manager will see the most current status when your goals are pulled into your performance review. If you would like to get started early or draft your self-evaluation out of system, you can use this template as a guide to start composing your thoughts for this year. Keep in mind that your final responses will need to be entered into the online version of the form in IGNITE once it becomes available. Describe your goals from the past year. Were they achieved? Delayed? Changed? What contributions did you make to each and what were the challenges of each? Include major accomplishments and successes you would like to highlight such as significant projects and accomplishments not included in the goals. Consider significant unexpected challenges or setbacks you experienced, the impact on your results, and how you were able to adapt to or overcome them. Looking back on the past year, how do you view the work you did and the way in which you accomplished your work in relation to the Core Commitments? Tips Review your one-on-one notes, project notes, calendar from the past year, etc. to help remember and identify key projects, successes, and challenges. Your self-evaluation should focus on highlights rather than being a full list of job tasks. Be specific and provide concise examples. Use metrics where possible. There should be enough detail to support the ratings you give yourself. It can be helpful to frame weaknesses or set-backs as opportunities or possible goals. Incorporate positive feedback received from others. Proofread to catch any typos or grammatical errors. Use this job aid to help navigate Ignite to enter your self-evaluation. 2021-22 Staff Performance Review Process - Who Participates?
