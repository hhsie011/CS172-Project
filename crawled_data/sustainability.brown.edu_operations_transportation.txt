Breadcrumb Home Sustainability in Operations Sub Navigation In This Section Energy Food & Nutrition Waste Diversion Water Transportation Transportation Brown is offering a variety of transportation options that connect the community while taking steps to minimize emissions. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the transportation sector accounts for approximately 29% of U.S. greenhouse gases. To actively decrease its transportation-related emissions, to improve accessibility and as a way to promote healthy lifestyles and community building, Brown is proud to offer its community members free access to the Brown University Shuttle (B.U.S.), and the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA). Brown also works to continuously improve biking, electric vehicle, and walking infrastructure and resources in collaboration with Providence and Rhode Island. The Brown University Shuttle The Brown University Shuttle connects off-campus community members to Brown, the Jewelry District to College Hill, students and faculty to the hospitals, and more. Take the Shuttle 2021 Shuttle Rides 46,907 daytime shuttle rides 680 SEAS shuttle rides 36,636 evening shuttle rides 26,208 OnCall shuttle rides RIPTA U-Pass Program Brown University has made great strides toward increasing the availability of public transportation with the Rhode Island Public Transportation Authority (RIPTA) U-Pass program. The program subsidizes all Brown University ID holders so they may ride any RIPTA bus or trolley free of charge anywhere in the state of Rhode Island. A 2020 study found Brown to be the #1 patron of the RIPTA bus service. 110,431 RIPTA rides in 2021 through the UPass program Numbers for RIPTA ridership decreased due to COVID-19, but are expected to rise again in the future. Driving and EV Stations Brown is committed to improving its transportation infrastructure and focuses efforts on encouraging community members to replace gas miles with electric miles sourced from renewable electricity. One way the University does this is by continually increasing the number of Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations on campus.
