Summer hours will be posted shortly and will begin on Monday, May 23, 2022. Do You Want to Play Intramural Sports? We are reaching out to the campus community for a little assistance. Our Intramural Sports Program has been significantly impacted by the pandemic. We will be conducting a campus survey over the next 3 weeks to gather feedback. Responses will help guide us in our decision making on what, when, where and how we offer our Intramural Sports to the campus community. The survey will only take 1-2 minutes and your participation would be greatly appreciated. Survey Link: Do You Want to Play Intramural Sports? The Student Recreation & Wellness Center and Aquatic center is now open.
