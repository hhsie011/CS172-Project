The Compagnia offered the equivalent of $240,000 in support and began working closely with the Italian Academy to bring to Columbia a series of renowned professors to promote the knowledge of those areas of Italian learning which have contributed so greatly to the development of culture. Founded in 1563, the Compagnia di San Paolo is a private, non-governmental organization that generously and consistently supports education; art and the preservation and development of cultural heritage and activities; scientific, economic and juridical research; health; and assistance to the socially deprived. These Visiting Professors teach courses in Columbia departments (see details below), and each one also offers a major public lecture to the broader New York audience. Videos of past lectures can be found here: Prof. Ottani Cavina on art in 2012; Prof. Borio on music in 2013; Prof. Ficara on literature in 2014.
