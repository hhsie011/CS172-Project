4:30 PM Columbia Global Centers | Beijing, No. 26, 1F Core Plaza, 1 Shanyuan Street, Zhongguancun, Haidian District, Beijing Columbia Global Centers | Beijing, China Youth Climate Action Network (CYCAN), Greenovation Hub, and Kuaishou invite you to a panel discussion on China's communications strategy, practice, and experience in climate change. The year of 2020 marks a milestone for the past 25-year-long climate action. Nevertheless, humankind has not managed to slow down the pace of global warming. Remarkably, the recent IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C and the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate, as well as the UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2019 have set off alarm bells for nations to take immediate and substantial action. The way to interpret the urgency of climate change revealed by science-based findings will have a direct influence on public perceptions of and behaviors responding to climate change. In the past 10 years, the number of reports on climate issues has increased significantly. Meanwhile, civil society organizations have created a favorable public opinion environment for China's active participation in climate management and low-carbon development, through advantages in issue dissemination and public participation. According to the "2017 National Public Opinion Survey Report on Climate Change in the Chinese Mind", the Chinese public is paying more and more attention to climate change issues, with a higher awareness of the impacts of climate change. However, according to the "Low-carbon City Public Cognition Survey" published in 2018, the Chinese public's understanding of climate change science and required behavioral change is relatively limited, and there is still a large demand for science-based communication. An informed public of the facts about climate change and its serious impacts, is the key for promoting progressive climate action. Entering into the 5G era, people get to meet a larger variety of information needs in a more diverse way. In this circumstance, only through enhancing the public awareness and understanding of climate change, could we maintain a sustainable driving force for climate action. This requires innovative forms of climate change communications in China, to explore new ways of communicating climate change knowledge and action, in response to the new communication ecology of the Internet era, to generate increasing awareness, understanding and participation of the society in climate action.
