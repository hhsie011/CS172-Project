Bruce Duthu “ Share Meet our graduates "On behalf of my colleagues in Native American Studies, I want to extend our heartiest congratulations on your graduation from Dartmouth. The path toward receiving a college degree is never easy, but your class has endured challenges that, in isolation and collectively, have been monumental and unprecedented: a global pandemic whose effects will still be felt for months or years to come; a nation as deeply polarized over issues of race, class and politics and as inclined to violence as we've ever experienced in our history; and the existential crisis of climate change that may soon dwarf these other issues. In many respects, the challenges awaiting the graduates of your generation have perhaps never been greater. At the same time, we recognize that there are few better prepared to take on the burdens unfairly laid before you and to work towards a better, healthier, and more just society", writes Professor N. Bruce Duthu.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Native American and Indigenous Studies Undergraduate Overview Major and Minor Courses Honors Program Waitlists and Applications NAS 85 Independent Study Rules & Procedures NAS Students Writing Prize Award Recipients Alumni - Tell Us Your Story 2020 2021 Funding for Internships and Independent Research Off-Campus Program Research Overview Gordon Russell Visiting Professorship Gordon Russell Visiting Professorship Alumni Charles Eastman Fellowship Eastman Fellowship Alumni Tribal Scholar Fellowship Program Tribal Scholar Fellowship Alumni Resources News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
