Baoli's research primarily focuses on medieval Sinoscript literature and its modern repercussions, manuscript culture, Chinese poetics, empire studies, and Silk Road studies. In her Research Matters presentation on April 21, 2022, PhD candidate in the Comparative Literature Department at Brown, Baoli Yang, introduces “sinoscript,” a keyword in her dissertation, and its contributions to East Asian and comparative literary studies. Sinoscript denotes medieval Chinese writing within and beyond Chinese political boundaries. Its influence can still be felt in today’s Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. Disseminated in the format of manuscripts, Sinoscript culture was one lens to understand the entanglements of politics and literature in medieval East Asia in Baoli’s research. Research Matters event provides her an opportunity to share her work with a broader audience in Brown’s intellectual community. In the Research Matters program, the two-week training in public speaking under the guidance of the Graduate School Dean Vanessa Ryan also prepares Baoli, a multilingual speaker, for her teaching and instructing. Research Matters is an annual event hosted by the Brown Graduate School, featuring presentations by graduate students discussing why their research matters. You can find more information about the program on the Graduate School website. Congratulations to Baoli for this exciting achievement!
