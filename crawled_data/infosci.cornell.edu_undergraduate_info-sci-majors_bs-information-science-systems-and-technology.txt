Student Spotlight Sinclair Among Cornell's Top Graduating Seniors Sarah Sinclair, a graduate of the Information Science, Systems and Technology (ISST) program through the College of Engineering, is the first student affiliated with Cornell Information Science to be named a Merrill Presidential Scholar. Info Sci's First Merrill Scholar Information Science offers a Bachelor of Science through the College of Engineering in Information Science, Systems, and Technology (ISST). The ISST major studies the design and management of complex information systems, with an emphasis on information systems engineering in broad application contexts, where issues at the confluence of information science, technology, and management are the primary concerns. Students take classes in operations research modeling techniques, statistics, computer science, economics, and the social and organizational contexts in which transformative information systems exist. See the Admission to the Major page to learn more about how to declare the ISST major, transfer into the major from another Cornell college, or transfer in from another institution. The Degree Requirements page details the program's core courses and its specializations. Students must meet certain criteria for good standing at the end of each semester. See the Criteria for Good Standing page for more information. In the College of Engineering, there are two types of recognition for student excellence that can appear on the diploma. See the Honors Requirements page to for further details. For more information about the major, please feel free to contact us by email, visit our undergraduate program office located in 520 Rhodes Hall, or call 607-255-9837.
