They are meant to supplement NIH's FAQs. Other Support See section 2.5.1 Just-in-Time Procedures in the NIH Grants Policy Statement (NIH GPS). The NIH GPS states what researchers must disclose as “Other Support” at the Just-in-Time (JIT) point of the application process and in Research Performance Progress Reports (RPPRs). Per the NIH GPS: "Other support includes all resources made available to a researcher in support of and/or related to all of their research endeavors, regardless of whether or not they have monetary value and regardless of whether they are based at the institution the researcher identifies for the current grant. This includes: Resources and/or financial support from all foreign and domestic entities that are available to the researcher. This includes but not limited to, financial support for laboratory personnel, and provision of high-value materials that are not freely available (e.g., biologics, chemical, model systems, technology, etc.). Institutional resources, such as core facilities or shared equipment that is made broadly available, should not be included in Other Support, but rather listed under Facilities and Other Resources. Consulting agreements, when the PD/PI or other senior/key personnel will be conducting research as part of the consulting activities. In-kind contributions, e.g. office/laboratory space, equipment, supplies, or employees or students supported by an outside source. If the time commitment or dollar value of the in-kind contribution is not readily ascertainable, the recipient must provide reasonable estimates." For additional details on what must be included in Other Support, continue with 2.5.1 Just-in-Time Procedures in the NIH Grants Policy Statement (NIH GPS), and read the full set of Other Support instructions. Biosketch 3/12/2021 - NIH Biosketch format pages and instructions and FAQs 5/10/2021 - For our latest guidance on the completion of the Biographical Sketches, see the Town Hall slides. Various changes were made to the NIH Biosketch format page. Specific changes to Section B are below, in bold italics. Section B: Positions, Scientific Appointments, and Honors was updated to read: List in reverse chronological order all positions and scientific appointments both domestic and foreign, including affiliations with foreign entities or governments. This includes titled academic, professional, or institutional appointments whether or not remuneration is received, and whether full-time, part-time, or voluntary (including adjunct, visiting, or honorary). High school students and undergraduates may include any previous positions. For individuals who are not currently located at the applicant organization, include the expected position at the applicant organization and the expected start date. Also see section 2.3.7.12 Biographical Sketches (Biosketches) in the NIH Grants Policy Statement (NIH GPS), which states: "NIH requires submission of a biographical sketch (also referred to as biosketch) for each proposed senior/key personnel and other significant contributor. Applicants and recipients are required to submit biosketches in 1) competing applications for all types of grant programs; 2) in progress reports when new senior/key personnel or other significant contributors are identified; and 3) to support prior approval requests for changes in senior/key personnel status and changes of recipient organization. NIH staff and peer reviewers utilize the biosketch to ensure that individuals included on the applications are equipped with the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to carry out the proposed research. Applications containing one or more biosketches that do not conform to the required format may be withdrawn." Foreign Component If any portion of an NIH-funded or proposed project is being conducted outside the U.S., it requires prior approval by NIH and you must check “Yes” to the application question of “Does this project involve activities outside of the United States or partnerships with international collaborators?” This section of the December 209 NIH GPS has not changed, but whether projects include foreign components is a subject of particular interest to NIH. Use Field 6 of the Research and Related (R&R) Other Project Information form to indicate whether your project involves activities outside the U.S. or partnerships with international collaborators. If “YES” then a “Foreign Justification” attachment must be provided in Field 12, Other Attachments. See instructions. Certain grant-related activities must be reported in section G.9 of the RPPR if they involve a foreign component, defined as significant scientific activity that was performed outside of the United States, either by the grantee or by a researcher employed by a foreign organization, whether or not grant funds were expended. The following grant-related activities are significant and must be reported: involvement of human subjects or research with live vertebrate animals; extensive foreign travel by grantee project staff to collect data, or conduct surveys or sampling activities; or any grantee activity that may have an impact on U.S. foreign policy. Examples of other grant-related activities that may be significant are: collaborations with investigators at a foreign site anticipated to result in co-authorship; use of facilities or instrumentation at a foreign site; or receipt of financial support or resources from a foreign entity. Foreign travel for consultation does not meet the definition of foreign component. See Section G of RPPR FAQs. If a project develops a foreign component during the course of the project, prior approval must be obtained. Contact your SPA Project Officer in this situation.
