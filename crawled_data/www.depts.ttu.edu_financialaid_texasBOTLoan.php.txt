Texas Tech University Directory Raiderlink A-Z Index Financial Aid Menu Search TTU Financial Aid Home Texas B-On-Time Loan The Texas B-On-Time Loan is a no-interest loan for eligible Texas students. This loan carries the added benefit that, if the borrower meets specified goals, the entire loan amount can be forgiven upon graduation. This loan is funded by the State of Texas, with repayment made to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board Hinson Hazelwood program. During the 2015 Texas State Legislative Session, House Bill 1 was passed limiting B-On-Time (BOT) loans to renewal applicants only beginning with the 2015-16 award year. Therefore, to receive a BOT Loan in 2015-16 and in future aid years, a student must have received a BOT disbursement in 2014-15 or a prior award year.
