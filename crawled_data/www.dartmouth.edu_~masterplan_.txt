The strategic master plan is an important opportunity to ensure that the design of the campus continues to support the College's mission and goals. Building on a legacy of thoughtful campus planning, this new master plan will provide a framework for sustainable development and preservation within the main campus including buildings, landscape, open spaces, and infrastructure; local area real estate; the Moosilauke campus; and the Second College Grant. Development of this plan presents a significant opportunity to ensure that the campus design and space provision continue to support evolving needs of Dartmouth College as a global institution.
