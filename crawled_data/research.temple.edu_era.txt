Training Tutorials & Documentation FAQ ERA Login Meet Our Staff Home â€º ERA Electronic Research Administration eRA at Temple University Temple University has undertaken a major effort to achieve excellence in the delivery of administrative services within a framework that focuses on satisfying customer requirements, empowering the faculty and work force, and continuously improving service delivery processes. Information systems and technology will be used to facilitate and encourage the re-design of administrative processes rather than merely to automate current methods. Our goal is to ensure that neither work effort nor information is unnecessarily duplicated, that controls that remain in place are required for valid business reasons, and that technology not only transports information seamlessly through each required step in a process, but also makes the information readily accessible to everyone who has a "need to know."
