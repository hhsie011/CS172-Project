The Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps has a strong tradition at Iowa State as it stood up its first cadet corps in January of 1949. Since then, we have called the Armory building our home. Cyclone Squadron has produced countless top-notch leaders who have made a difference in the world we live in today. WHAT IS AFROTC? Find out more about Detachment 250 by watching the video below. FRESHMAN ORIENTATION TRAINING EXERCISE FORTE usually starts on the Wednesday before classes begin at ISU. The first day starts by helping new AFROTC freshmen move into their dorms and becoming familiar with their new homes. Additionally, briefings by the Detachment Commander, FORTE Commander, and an ice cream social, help parents and new Cadets get to know current Cadets, learn more about AFROTC, and get many of their questions answered. Find out more about FORTE. HOW DO I JOIN? Prospective cadets looking to join Detachment 250 have two different paths: direct from high school and already enrolled students at one of our detachment’s universities. Because of the nature of the program, most students join the program direct from high school or as a college sophomore. Joining as a junior or senior is rare, but those students can contact the Recruiting Officer and schedule an advising session if interested. Please see our Joining Detachment 250 page for more information on joining Air Force ROTC and for additional scholarship information. READ MORE EVENTS AFROTC cadets can participate in a variety of events including POW/MIA Day and Capitol Run, FORTE, Dining In, Dining Out, Flag Football, Ledges State Park Morale Hike and the Notre Dame Basketball Tournament.
