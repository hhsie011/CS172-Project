Across our vibrant organization, staff seek to work more closely together and to set in motion a change process that enables a culture of experimentation, in balance with the high-trust suite of services our constituencies depend on. We foster a more agile, laboratory-like practice that encourages creativity and innovation, provides opportunity for staff development, reduces barriers and streamlines processes that make our library work with more speed and efficiency. We find and value within ourselves a breadth and depth of diverse expertise positioned to connect the seemingly unconnected. Our unique skills and knowledge substantially contribute to the heart and core of the Universityâ€™s success in fulfilling its mission. 2018 - 2019 Accomplishments Shared results of the Fall 2018 Employee Engagement Survey with all staff and developed a set of action items focused on operating transparently, timeliness of execution, and two-way communication Increased support for Libraries-funded travel for all officers and created a more inclusive policy for staff at all levels to receive travel support 2017 - 2018 Accomplishments Created a regular communications forum for information-sharing about organizational changes and projects Established a baseline assessment of participation in staff development activities Launched an employee engagement survey to measure staff perceptions about their work environment Streamlined the process for staff to establish new vendors and procure library materials for users Columbia University Libraries 535 West 114th St. New York, NY 10027 (212) 854-7309 [email protected]
