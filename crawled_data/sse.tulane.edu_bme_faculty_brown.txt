Quincy Brown Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering jqbrown@tulane.edu (504) 865-5851 School of Science & Engineering Education Louisiana Tech University, Ruston, LA., 2005 Ph.D. Biomedical Engineering Louisiana Tech University, Ruston, LA., 2001 BS Biomedical Engineering Duke University, Durham, NC., 2009 Postdoc Fellow, Biomedical Engineering Biography Research in our laboratory focuses on the application and translation of quantitative spectroscopy and imaging tools for the improvement of cancer management in the clinical setting. We develop translatable optical methods to directly address gaps in clinical care, and carry those through to clinical validation in humans alongside our physician collaborators. A major theme in this work is the use of imaging devices to improve patient outcomes in surgical tumor removal in a number of organs. We also develop enabling tools and strategies using optics to answer interesting biological questions in cell and animal models.
