Veterinary Sciences Current: Research Research Team research both within and outside the department and college is utilized and published in both peer-review journals and producer-oriented publications to communicate scientific results. Our current research focus areas include One Health, Physiology/Genetics, and Nutrition. One Health One Health is defined as “the integrative effort of multiple disciplines working locally, nationally, and globally to attain optimal health for people, animals, and the environment.”. Learn more about One Health here. Co-sponsored by the SC TRIMH and SC BioCRAFT Centers, our group focuses on applying this approach in the following areas: Antimicrobial resistance mitigation Comparative Medicine/Translational Research Zoonotic Diseases Disaster preparedness and response Food Safety and Security Human - Animal bond Education and training of the next generation of One Health professionals Welfare / Well-being of animals Current Members: Khaled Abdelaziz, DVM, Ph.D. Ahmed Ali, DVM, Ph.D. Brian Booth, Ph.D. Hamp Bruner, DVM, Dipl.

In animal nutrition, an in-depth understanding of several disciplines is necessary to undertake its exploration. Some of these areas are Animal Physiology, Nutrient Metabolism, Microbiology, Analytical Chemistry, Biochemistry, Anaerobic Fermentation, Management Practices, Statistics, Ecology, Forages, among others. Our research encompasses the improvement in nutrient content of meat, milk and eggs with the overall goal of achieving a healthier environment and human population. During your research in your graduate program, you will gain the skills to analyze, synthesize, plan and critically evaluate independently new and complex phenomena, problems and situations in animal nutrition while seeking and investigating possible solutions.
