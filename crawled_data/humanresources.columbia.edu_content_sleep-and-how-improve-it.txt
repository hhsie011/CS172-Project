Yet, according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than one-third of American adults are not getting enough sleep on a regular basis. Plus, some say sleep quality has more impact on your overall well-being than sleep quantity. Read on to find out how your Columbia benefits can help you improve both. Expand all Collapse all Sleep Problems You’re tired, but falling and staying asleep is a challenge Solution: More physical activity throughout the day Exercising can reduce stress and strengthen circadian rhythms, which drive your internal clock. By exercising, you can increase the time you spend in deep sleep, the physically restorative sleep phase. Take a walk around the block; start walking uphill; build up to a run. If you don’t exercise regularly, getting started can be as challenging as any lifestyle change. Finding help, however, is easy. Your Columbia benefits include one-on-one wellness coaching and self-guided tools. And did you know about the discounted gym membershipsoffered through the University’s Office of Work/Life? Tip: Avoid stimulants like smoking, caffeine or large meals in the hours leading up to bedtime. Not convinced? Oregon State University researchers found that 150 minutes—just 2 ½ hours—of physical activity per week provide a 65% improvement in sleep quality. Your mind races as you lay awake at night Solution: Relieve Stress If your to-do list keeps you up at night, you’re not alone. One in four Americans develops insomnia each year and stress is one of the leading causes. If exercise (see You're Tired, above) isn’t doing the trick, try a hot shower, burn a scented candle (lavender is known to soothe) and consider your caffeine intake (stimulants can increase anxiety). Your Columbia benefits include resources to help with stress reduction, which can contribute to a better night’s sleep. What’s on your mind?
