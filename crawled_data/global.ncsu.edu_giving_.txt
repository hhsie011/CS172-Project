NC State Global Receives Memorial Gift in Honor of Dr. Dmitri Zaykin Read more We welcome one-time or recurring gifts to the funds below at any time. Each of these funds supports various aspects of our “Global Learning for All” strategic framework, and represents current critical priorities. To discuss naming opportunities, endowments, planned giving or other opportunities to support NC State’s global work, please contact us at ncstateglobal@ncsu.edu. Support Study Abroad Students Scholarship support is increasing, but more is needed to ensure that all NC State students, regardless of financial need, have access to life-changing international experiences that contribute to their degree programs. Support International Students Current funds for emergency loans are too limited to address the urgent needs which arise, due to circumstances beyond the control of our international students. Support for emergency funding enables students to complete their degrees and can change their lives. Additional funds would provide scholarships and other forms of sponsorship and program development, including student leadership and success programs, conferences, internships, or joint service-learning projects together with U.S. students. CV Pao Scholarship Endowment During his 40 years as a mathematics professor at NC State, Dr. Chia Ven Pao left a life-long impact on both the academic performance and student success at NC State. His specific role as a faculty advisor to international students has made significant contributions to their personal and professional development, particularly those from China. A group of former students has been working on an endowment fund to honor his legacy which will financially support graduate students at NC State University. Support Global Strategic Initiatives Support critical initiatives such as seed grants for faculty research abroad, region-based events to expand faculty engagement in strategic partnerships, networking activities to increase interdisciplinary collaboration, workshops that include international participants, and programs to welcome visiting scholars from abroad who enrich our campus.
