Now a venture capital investor with a focus on edtech and “future of work” companies, Monsalve is leading the new Entrepreneur-in-Residence program at GSE, where he counsels students and faculty on innovative projects in education and helps connect them with leaders outside academia. The experience of leaving his home country as a child helped him develop a trait he considers critical for a successful entrepreneur: a sense of adventure. “You can’t be set in your ways,” he says. “You have to do things that make you uncomfortable.” June 29, 2018 Photo by Lyudmila Christie More Community stories Salina Gray, PhD '14 Teaching science for social change Read this story Marisol Jimenez Espinoza, MA '19 Policy, Organization, and Leadership Studies Expanding mentorship opportunities Read this story Ian Bott, MS '23 Education Data Science Tackling puzzles in learning Read this story ⟵ Go to all Community stories Back to the Top Stanford Graduate School of Education 482 Galvez Mall Stanford, CA 94305-3096 Tel: (650) 723-2109 Improving lives through learning Contact Admissions Site Feedback Site Map Web Accessibility HelpSU GSE IT Career Resources Faculty Open Positions Explore Courses Academic Calendar Office of the Registrar Cubberley Library Webmail StanfordWho StanfordYou 25Live Login Facebook Twitter LinkedIn YouTube Flickr Stanford Home Maps & Directions Search Stanford Emergency Info Terms of Use Privacy Copyright Trademarks Non-Discrimination Accessibility © Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305.
