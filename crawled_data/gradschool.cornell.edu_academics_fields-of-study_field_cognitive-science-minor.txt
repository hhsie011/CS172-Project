Among the many topics examined are logic and the justification of belief; the nature of mind and action; knowledge representation; knowledge acquisition; the knowledge, use, and acquisition of language; perception; concepts and conceptual change; artificial intelligence and parallel distributed processing; and the neurobiology of cognition. The cognitive science minor is open to students who have elected a major field in which the minor can be appropriately included. Field members offer guidance to students in setting up and carrying out an integrated program of interdisciplinary study in conjunction with their major field. Major fields include (but are not limited to) computer science, human development, information science, linguistics, management, mathematics, neurobiology and behavior, philosophy, and psychology. All cognitive science graduate minor students must take at least two 6,000-level courses: some 4,000-level courses will be allowed with the approval of your minor committee member. One course should be taught outside your discipline (in another cognitive science affiliated department); the other is the required COGST 6101: Cognitive Science Proseminar (spring). This course surveys the study of how the mind/brain works, drawing primarily from six disciplines: philosophy, psychology, developmental science, neuroscience, linguistics, and computer science. Although at least two courses are required, we encourage you to take more courses offered by the program. Please email the program manager (cogst@cornell.edu) with your course choices for approval. The field sponsors a series of lectures and colloquia by internationally recognized scholars. Students are encouraged to meet with the speakers for informal discussion during their visits. Each spring the program hosts Sprocket, the Cognitive Science Film Series in conjunction with COGST 1101. The evening, complete with pizza and conversation, is free and open to the Cornell community. Travel funding for conferences and workshops is available to minor students. The Annual Grad Convo/Info Blitz lunch is held each May in order for students to share their research with peers and faculty. This is a minor field. Application for admission is made only to the major fields. After matriculation, a student may select minor subjects from the major or minor fields.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
