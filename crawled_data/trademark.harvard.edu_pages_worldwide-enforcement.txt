Besides the many legitimate trademark registrations owned by Harvard University worldwide, a monitoring service notifies the Trademark Program whenever an attempt is made by an unaffiliated party to obtain a "Harvard" trademark registration anywhere in the world for any goods or services. The Trademark Program also uses a service to monitor the Internet for the registration of “Harvard” formative domain names and takes appropriate action whenever these domains lead to websites that infringe on Harvard’s trademark rights. Additionally, the Trademark Program has legal counsel, licensing agents, and licensees throughout the world who bring to its attention anyone attempting to use Harvard’s trademarks without the University's permission; and all of Harvard’s licensees are required to identify their products as being officially licensed by Harvard University. Finally, Harvard faculty, students, staff, and alumni constitute an excellent network for identifying the unauthorized use of Harvard’s trademarks, whether used on insignia items or by unauthorized "Harvard" schools or other individuals or organizations making use of the Harvard name and other Harvard University trademarks without permission.
