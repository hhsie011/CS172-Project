Each student will receive one semester bill with charges for all summer classes. Summer Financial Settlement must be complete by the due date listed on your bill. If you register after the due date, payment is due in full one business day after receiving your bill (two business days after you register). A 2-installment Payment Plan will be available for the summer. If you choose to use the Payment Plan, the first payment is due by the due date on your bill and the second payment is due June 30. If you have any questions about summer billing, please contact Student Accounts.
