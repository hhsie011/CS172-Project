Shocker Racing Baja is an intercollegiate design competition run by the Society of Automotive Engineers, where the teams of students research, design, build, and race off-road style cars. WSU Baja is a sub-section of Shocker Racing here at Wichita State. We compete with various universities across the country, with the occasional teams from Mexico and Canada. This organization is open to any students, and teaches a real world application of engineering, business, and art while gaining the skills of working within a team, to compete in various off-road style races. While the team members are primarily engineering majors, we are open to all majors!
