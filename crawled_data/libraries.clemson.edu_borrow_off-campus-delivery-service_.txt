Since not every Tiger is found on the main campus or may have difficulty accessing our facilities, the Libraries extend the use of physical materials through a unique partnership with UPS. Eligibility The Off-Campus Delivery Service is limited to the following borrowers: Students registered with the Office of Student Accessibility Services. Active Clemson University students, faculty, and staff who reside outside of a 30-mile radius of the University’s main campus and are enrolled in online courses or University-sanctioned Off-Campus Programs Domestic shipping only—international materials delivery requests cannot be fulfilled. Patrons using the Off-Campus Delivery Service have the same borrowing privileges as on-campus students, faculty, and staff. Standard item due dates, as well as holds and recalls, apply to shipped materials. Items requested through Interlibrary Loan are also eligible for Off-Campus Delivery Service. Eligibility for this service is the same as above. Item due dates and recalls apply to shipped materials. To request a renewal of an Interlibrary Loan item, please email cuill@nullclemson.edu.
