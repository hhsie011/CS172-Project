As early as their first year, undergraduates are able to work one-on-one or in small groups with faculty members on cutting edge research projects. The Sc.B. degree provides a thorough foundation for further graduate study or for entry-level technical positions in each area. Students seeking the Sc.B. may either pursue the standard Chemistry concentration or one of the two optional tracks: Chemical Biology or Materials Chemistry. Students may also pursue the A.B. degree in Chemistry, which provides a core education in the discipline. Standard program for the A.B. degree CHEM 0330 Equilibrium, Rate, and Structure 1 CHEM 0350 Organic Chemistry 1 CHEM 0360 Organic Chemistry 1 CHEM 0500 Inorganic Chemistry 1 CHEM 1140 Physical Chemistry: Quantum Chemistry 1 1 CHEM 1150 Physical Chemistry: Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics 1 1 CHEM 1160 Physical Chemistry Laboratory 1 1 Two advanced science/math electives. 2 2 Total Credits 9 1 Note that the physical chemistry courses (CHEM 1140, CHEM 1150, CHEM 1160) have mathematics and physics prerequisites. 2 At least one must be a chemistry course. BIOL 0280 is credited as a chemistry elective for chemistry concentration purposes. Non CHEM electives are upper level science/math courses with a significant molecular focus or those that cover tools/techniques that are of utility to a chemist. You should discuss your elective choices with the Concentration Advisor to craft a course of study that is appropriate for your interests. Standard program for the Sc.B. degree The Chemistry Department offers three tracks for the Sc.B. Chemistry Concentration – a Chemistry track, a Chemical Biology track and a Materials Chemistry track. These tracks are not separate concentrations – your degree will still be an Sc.B. in Chemistry. The Chemical Biology track is designed for students who have a strong interest in the interface of chemistry with biology. The Materials Chemistry track is designed for students who have a strong interest in the interface of chemistry with nanoscience and materials science. The expectation is that courses required for the concentration will be taken for a letter grade. Concentrating in Chemistry – Three tracks The required/recommended courses for the three tracks are given below. Chemistry Track: CHEM 0330 Equilibrium, Rate, and Structure 1 CHEM 0350 Organic Chemistry 1 CHEM 0360 Organic Chemistry 1 CHEM 0500 Inorganic Chemistry 1 CHEM 0970 Undergraduate Research 1 or CHEM 0981 Undergraduate Research - Writing Designated CHEM 0980 Undergraduate Research 1 or CHEM 0981 Undergraduate Research - Writing Designated CHEM 1140 Physical Chemistry: Quantum Chemistry 1 CHEM 1150 Physical Chemistry: Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics 1 CHEM 1160 Physical Chemistry Laboratory 1 MATH 0180 or equivalent 3 1 Two Physics courses 2 Seven electives (at least three must be in Chemistry) 1 7 Total Credits 19 Chemical Biology Track: CHEM 0330 Equilibrium, Rate, and Structure 1 CHEM 0350 Organic Chemistry 1 CHEM 0360 Organic Chemistry 1 CHEM 0500 Inorganic Chemistry 1 CHEM 0970 Undergraduate Research 1 or CHEM 0981 Undergraduate Research - Writing Designated CHEM 0980 Undergraduate Research 1 or CHEM 0981 Undergraduate Research - Writing Designated CHEM 1140 Physical Chemistry: Quantum Chemistry 1 CHEM 1230 Chemical Biology 1 CHEM 1240 Biochemistry 1 BIOL 0280 Biochemistry 1 MATH 0180 or equivalent 3 1 Two Physics courses 2 Select three of the following: 4 3 BIOL 0470 Genetics BIOL 0500 Cell and Molecular Biology BIOL 0510 Introductory Microbiology BIOL 0530 Principles of Immunology BIOL 0800 Principles of Physiology NEUR 1020 Principles of Neurobiology Three other electives 1 3 Total Credits 19 Materials Chemistry Track: CHEM 0330 Equilibrium, Rate, and Structure 1 CHEM 0350 Organic Chemistry 1 CHEM 0360 Organic Chemistry 1 CHEM 0500 Inorganic Chemistry 1 CHEM 0970 Undergraduate Research 1 or CHEM 0981 Undergraduate Research - Writing Designated CHEM 0980 Undergraduate Research 1 or CHEM 0981 Undergraduate Research - Writing Designated CHEM 1060 Advanced Inorganic Chemistry 2 1 CHEM 1140 Physical Chemistry: Quantum Chemistry 1 CHEM 1150 Physical Chemistry: Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics 2 1 CHEM 1700 Nanoscale Materials: Synthesis and Applications 1 MATH 0180 or equivalent 3 1 Two Physics courses 2 2 One of the following courses 1 BIOL 1090 Polymer Science for Biomaterials (or) BIOL 1120/ Biomaterials (or) BIOL 1140 Tissue Engineering (or) ENGN 1470 Composite Materials (or) ENGN 1490 Biomaterials (or) Five electives, at least two must be chemistry courses. 1 5 Total Credits 19 1 BIOL 0280 is credited as a chemistry elective for the chemistry concentration. Non CHEM electives are upper level science/math courses with a significant molecular focus or those that cover tools/techniques that are of utility to a chemist. You should discuss your elective choices with the Concentration Advisor to craft a course of study that is appropriate for your interests. 2 For students with a more Engineering bent, the following substitutions can be made - ENGN 0030/ENGN 0040 can be substituted for PHYS; ENGN 0410 can be substituted for CHEM 1060; ENGN 0720 for CHEM 1150. 3 NOTE: MATH 0180 has additional prerequisites. 4 NOTE: Many of the BIOL courses have BIOL 0200 as a prerequisite. In each of these cases, CHEM 0970/CHEM 0980 /CHEM 0981 should be carried out with a faculty member with an appointment in the Chemistry Department. Research with faculty advisors outside Chemistry may be allowed in some special cases. In this event, the student should speak with a concentration advisor to discuss this possibility. Honors Requirements for Chemistry All Chemistry concentrators who have grades of A or S with distinction in a majority of their concentration courses will be considered for Honors; no separate application is necessary. The requirements for Honors in Chemistry are: * Grades of A or S with distinction in a majority of courses taken for the concentration. * Two semesters of Independent Study (CHEM 0970, CHEM 0980, CHEM 0981 or equivalent. Guidelines and requirements associated with Independent Study are in the Undergraduate Concentration Handbook which can be found at the department website. * A Thesis in a form approved and recommended by the research advisor. Additional information about thesis guidelines will be provided to seniors by the Concentration Advisor. * A Poster presentation at the chemistry department's spring undergraduate poster session.
