Diversity and inclusion are cornerstones to delivering on that mission. Among the attributes of wisdom are the inclusivity and empathy to understand and work effectively with others, and core to decisiveness is the ability to thoughtfully seize opportunities. It is through wise, decisive leadership that bold decisions can be made to substantially improve business performance and the world we live in. DEI Mission To foster a culture and environment where all members of the Tuck community feel included and have the support to thrive. We will honor diversity in all its forms, welcome each person as they are, and provide the spaces and opportunities to engage in respectful, meaningful, and growth-oriented discussion and debate. We will model what truly diverse and inclusive leadership looks like within academic and business communities. Action Plan The Tuck Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Action Plan, released September 2021, is based on a year-long strategic review of community culture, curriculum, MBA student recruitment, employee hiring and retention, co-curricular and community engagement activities through the lens of diversity and inclusion.
