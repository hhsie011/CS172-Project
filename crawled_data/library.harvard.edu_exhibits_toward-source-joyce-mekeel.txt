French Gallery Loeb Music Library 3 Oxford Street Cambridge, MA 02138 See All Hours Map On view at the Loeb Music Library are manuscript scores and personal memorabilia of the American composer, teacher, anthropologist and sculptor Joyce Mekeel (1931-1997). Composer... Mekeel wrote music for many musicians and musical ensembles, among them Fenwick Smith (principal flute of the Boston Symphony Orchestra) and the Empire Brass Quintet. She collaborated, researched and experimented, and left traces of all of these activities in the collection. Teacher... She also had a long career as a composition teacher, with appointments at the New England Conservatory and Boston University. Examples from her personal library of scores in graphic notation are on display. Anthropologist and sculptor... In her short life, Mekeel explored several disciplines. Her forays into anthropology took her to West Africa twice, and she created an enormous number of abstract sculptures. Join us for the official opening of the exhibition, featuring an exhibition viewing and reception, on Friday, March 8th at 4 p.m. On view through June 3rd.
