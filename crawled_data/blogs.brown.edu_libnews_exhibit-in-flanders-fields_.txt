These collection pieces explore both the iconic 1915 poem “In Flanders Fields” (by Canadian doctor and officer John McCrae) and a selection of the many musical settings of this poem that were published in the waning years of the war. Although this seemingly-pastoral work describes battle and death, it became a rallying point for recruitment of new troops and, in the U.S., the rejection of isolationist policy.
