In addition, it provides certain additional services which institutions may utilize such as self-service enrollment verification. What information is on an enrollment verification form? Verification forms include your name, enrollment status, and the valid dates of that status. Do enrollment verification forms include any academic information such as GPA? No, these forms do not include GPA. If you require academic information, such as a "good student discount," you must request an official transcript.

It will only verify enrollment for the term(s) in which you have been or currently are enrolled (registered for courses). I am a new student who has not yet registered for classes.
