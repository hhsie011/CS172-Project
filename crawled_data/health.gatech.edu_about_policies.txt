Understanding Your Health Record/Information Each time you visit a hospital, physician, or other health care provider, a record of your visit is made. Typically, this record contains your symptoms, examinations, test results, diagnoses, treatment, and a plan for future care or treatment. This information, often referred to as your health or medical record, is used in many ways to contribute to your individual health. At Stamps Health Services, we use an electronic health record (EHR). The information contained within the EHR contributes to individual health in the following ways: A basis for planning your care and treatment A means of communication among the many health professionals who contribute to your care A means of electronically prescribing medications Medical Records Stamps Health Services is committed to allowing individuals to exercise their rights under applicable federal and state laws and will take necessary steps to address individual requests to access, inspect, and/or obtain a copy of their health information in a timely and professional manner. All requests for the disclosure of protected health information are handled by the Medical Record Department. Your medical record is kept confidential at all times and is not associated with your academic record. Medical records are retained for a period of 10 years following graduation or last treatment at Stamps.
