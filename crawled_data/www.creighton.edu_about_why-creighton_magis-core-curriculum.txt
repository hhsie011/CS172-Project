When you enroll in the core curriculum courses, you’ll have lots of options. You’ll only be required to take a one-hour oral communication course. All the rest are up to you. You can choose the courses that fit your personal interests and professional goals while satisfying the requirements of the Magis Core. More access to faculty. At many colleges and universities, courses are taught by teaching assistants or a grad student. At Creighton, you’ll be taught by expert faculty members. More flexibility.
