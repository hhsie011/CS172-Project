Herald, 1851 Posted on January 5, 2018 by [email protected] Annual Address of the Carriers & Newsmen of the New York Herald: On the Opening of the Year 1851 Carriers’ Addresses were published by newspapers and local newsboys delivered these greetings in verse each New Year’s Day to customers who understood that a tip was expected. Lasting for more than two centuries in the United States, the custom originated in England and was introduced during colonial times. The poems, often anonymous, describe the events of the past year, locally, regionally, and nationally, and end with a request for a gratuity for the faithful carrier. Often the poem referred to the carrier’s diligence and hardships during winter weather. Illustrated with wood-engravings and decorative borders, carriers’ addresses are distinctive examples of popular publishing in nineteenth century America.
