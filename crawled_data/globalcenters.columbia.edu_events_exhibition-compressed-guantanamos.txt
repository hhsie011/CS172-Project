A collaboration of Columbia Global Centers | Istanbul and Studio-X, the exhibition is comprised of two parts: the Guantánamo Public Memory Project and the Open Memory library. The "Guantánamo Public Memory Project" displays the collective effort of students from eleven different universities in the United States who launched a public debate on this controversial subject through a critical examination of Guanatamo’s history and the current questions it poses. Along with this, "Open Memory" presents a selection of books on history, memory and space from New York, Rio de Janeiro, Mumbai, Beijing and Istanbul, surfacing narratives usually excluded from conventional discourses. "The Hidden History of Cities," a series of panel discussions open to the public, will be held at Studio-X throughout the course of the exhibition. Organized in collaboration with the Truth Justice Memory Center, an organization working to uncover past human rights violations, the series will explore histories relating to a number of cities around Turkey: "Diyarbakır Prison," "Ankara after 1980" and "Faded Memories: Istanbul’s Armenian Past." University students will also have the opportunity to participate in a workshop, while a publication documenting Turkey’s prisons, “Closed Book,” also accompanies the exhibition. The book will be available in bookstores and at Studio-X Istanbul after May 7. Professor Elazar Barkan, the director of the Institute for the Study of Human Rights at Columbia University (which hosts the "Guantánamo Public Memory Project") and the project’s director Liz Sevcenko, will speak at the opening of the exhibition.
