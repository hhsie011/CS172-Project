Date and time: Monday, May 25, 10:00 - 12:00 Venue: Columbia Global Centers | Istanbul Address: Sıraselviler Cad. No: 49 Yeni Hayat Ap. K:2 D:5 Beyoğlu - Istanbul RSVP: https://edam.eventbrite.com Stephen Tindale, former research fellow at the Centre for European Reform (CER), will outline the key points of the CER’s policy brief, 'Cleaning the neighbourhood: How the EU can scrub out bad energy policy', after which Gökşin Bavbek, research assistant at the Center for Economics and Foreign Policy Studies (EDAM), will introduce EDAM’s forthcoming report on solar energy in Turkey “Solar Photovoltaic Market in Turkey: Prospects and Challenges”. Sinan Ülgen, chairman of EDAM, will then moderate Q&A discussion. The Centre for European Reform is a London-based independent, not-for-profit think-tank devoted to making the European Union work better and strengthening its role in the world. Until recently, Stephen Tindale was a research fellow at the Centre for European Reform, working mainly on energy and climate policy, drawing from previous experience at power renewables, Greenpeace UK and as an adviser to British Environment Ministers. The CER’s policy brief 'Cleaning the neighborhood: How the EU can scrub out bad energy policy' looks at the EU's Energy Community initiative which aims to improve energy efficiency and develop cleaner energy in the EU's neighborhood, shifting surrounding countries' current focus away from coal. The policy brief first identifies the incentives for the EU to help its neighbors, and then assesses the impact of the Energy Community in three of its members (Serbia, Montenegro, and Ukraine) as well as in Turkey, an observer. The report provides an analysis of the energy policy and practice in these countries and also looks at the effectiveness of the Energy Community hitherto. It suggests what could and should be done to create a successful and clean Energy Community. The EDAM Report ‘Solar Photovoltaic Market in Turkey: Prospects and Challenges’ attempts to provide a holistic look into the emerging solar photovoltaic market in Turkey and aims to identify the major barriers that have so far prevented significant capacity increases from taking place. The effectiveness of the current policies is evaluated and several policy options are then discussed which could help in eliminating the barriers identified. Particular focus is given to the role of the permitting processes and the financial mechanisms in determining the attractiveness of the market for the prospective investors. The session’s working language will be English, and copies of both papers will be available at the event.
