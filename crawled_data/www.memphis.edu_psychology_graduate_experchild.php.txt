The common core of faculty research interests is a commitment to examining age-related cognitive, cultural, emotional, health, and social factors across infancy, childhood, and adolescence. Basic and applied research projects are conducted in a variety of settings, including community agencies, day care and preschool programs, homes, hospitals, and schools. From this diversity across faculty interests, graduate students can construct individualized programs of study and be involved with a wide variety of research topics and populations. The Child, Adolescent, and Family Studies faculty have teaching assignments to courses related to the research area, and many provide supervised practicum experiences through the department's Psychological Services Center. Open colloquium series meetings are held monthly on Friday afternoons during which faculty, students, and community partners present their research findings.
