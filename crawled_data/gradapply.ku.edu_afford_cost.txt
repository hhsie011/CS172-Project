Tuition and fees KU’s tuition rate is reviewed every year by KU leadership and approved by the Kansas Board of Regents. We take tuition seriously and communicate transparently about changes to rates and how student dollars are spent. Campus fees support health and wellness, recreation facilities, campus unions, transit, child care, campus sustainability, and other resources accessible to all KU students. Depending on their degree program, students may also pay course fees to support academic programs and instruction in their specific schools.
