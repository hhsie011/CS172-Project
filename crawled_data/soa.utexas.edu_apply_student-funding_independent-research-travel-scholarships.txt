SOA international research travel scholarships are on hold for the 2021-2022 academic year. Independent Research Travel Scholarships are competitively awarded to SOA students for independent study or advanced research travel. The majority of the funds are designated for international travel in a typical year. Eligibility These scholarships are only for independent student research travel. Official faculty-led study abroad programs (such as Architecture in Europe), studio trips, any type of external coursework, conference, and residency travel are not considered under this category. Students should check with their studio instructors for off-campus studio funding. Recipients should be prepared to comply with the student travel policy for international locations. Please note: Group Proposals: Students may elect to travel together in groups of two or more to conduct their research. In cases where students travel together, all students must submit their own individual proposals, including project descriptions (see below). Each research project must be independent and clearly distinct from other projects proposed by those traveling together. The committee will evaluate each proposal individually. Mebane Recruitment International Travel Scholarship Recipients: Students offered a Mebane recruitment international travel scholarship as part of a recruitment funding package must submit a proposal for review following these deadlines and application process. Include your offer documentation in your proposal. Proposals for Previously Completed Travel: Travel scholarships may be applied to travel that has already occurred. Scholarships for completed international travel require the same application process as for future travel and must include Texas Global travel authorization documentation with the proposal to be eligible. In no case will student travel scholarships be disbursed nor may travel occur after a student's graduation. Application deadlines Applications for independent research travel are accepted twice each year for travel within the academic year (September 1st to August 31st). Fall Application (for travel during winter break) N/A for Fall 2021 Spring Application (for spring break and summer travel) February 18, 2022 Summer Application April 8, 2022 Travel scholarship application process Please review the Sample Travel Proposals before you submit your proposal. You must submit the Qualtrics survey and email a pdf to have a complete application. All applications must be complete and submitted by 5:00 pm on the deadline. 1. Submit the Qualtrics survey 2. Submit one single proposal pdf. Save the pdf file as YourLastName_FirstName_Spring or Summer 2022. Include these documents in this order: Page 1 | Your Travel Scholarship Application Form *Add your electronic signature after you've combined all the pages into a single pdf. Page 2 | A one-page résumé summarizing your qualifications Page 3 | A project description of no more than two pages to explain: The overall goals of your research. Joint proposal applications must specify which student will complete each part of the research project. The goals for the travel portion of the research. The methods you will use to conduct your research. Why the travel is a necessary part of your research. The overall importance of the project and how it will benefit your academic career (for example: contribute to your thesis research, professional report, a master design project, etc.). Your destination(s) and timeline for the travel and completion of the research project. Detailed travel costs, include the specific amount requested from the School and your individual contribution. This pdf must be electronically submitted. Hard copies or other file formats will not be accepted. Committee review A faculty committee evaluates the applications and ranks applications based on merit. The committee then recommends how to distribute available funds among the strongest applications. Given the limited funding available, most awards cover only a portion of each student's total travel costs. Notification and disbursement The SOA Scholarship Coordinator will notify applicants of the committee's decision. Recipients must follow the Travel Scholarship Recipient Instructions to receive their scholarships. Changes to approved research or travel proposals For any changes to the approved travel or research plan, recipients must contact the SOA Scholarship Coordinator in advance of any travel. The proposed changes must be approved by the Travel Scholarship Committee. Failure to receive approval in advance to changes in the travel or research plan will result in returning any funds that may have already been disbursed. Possible additional funds If funds remain after the February scholarship process, the Travel Scholarship Committee may issue another call for proposals late in the spring semester that will be announced via the student email list. Students are also encouraged to pursue other scholarship opportunities to fund their travel, including the Texas Global online scholarship database, Global Assist.
