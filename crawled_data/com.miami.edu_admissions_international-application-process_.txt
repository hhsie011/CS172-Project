Upon submitting, you will be asked to pay a $70 nonrefundable application fee. Be sure you use the same email address for every part of the application process, including registering for standardized tests. In the Common Application, you will be asked to respond to one of seven prompts, using 650 words or less. This essay portion of the application gives you the opportunity to demonstrate your ability to develop your thoughts, to communicate them clearly, and to write them concisely conveying your unique voice. We also ask that you list your involvement in extracurricular activities outside of school involvements and/or commitments; these will be evaluated as another factor in the admission process. STEP 2 Send Official High School Transcripts If you have attended a secondary school outside of the United States, you must submit your official secondary school documents (transcripts, mark sheets, certificates, examination results, etc.) to Josef Silny & Associates, Inc. for a course-by-course evaluation and grade point average calculation. Exception: If you attend a U.S. school, are pursuing an IB curriculum, or are currently attending a school in Canada (except Quebec), the United Kingdom, or the Caribbean, do not submit your documents to Josef Silny & Associates, Inc. Instead, submit a Request to Waive Evaluation of Foreign Educational Credentials. If your request is approved, have your official high school transcripts sent directly from your high school. A school official may submit them electronically via Common Application or by mail to one of the following addresses: University of Miami Office of Undergraduate Admission P.O. Box 249117 Coral Gables, FL 33124-9117 If sending via FedEx, DHL, UPS, or courier: University of Miami Office of Undergraduate Admission 1320 S. Dixie Highway Gables One Tower, Suite 945 Coral Gables, FL 33146 STEP 3 Send Official Test Scores Applicants currently studying OUTSIDE the United States All students whose native language is not English are required to submit official results of the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or the International English Language Testing System (IELTS). For information on scores, visit the English Proficiency Requirements page. Submitting ACT and/or SAT scores is optional for students graduating from a secondary school outside the United States. Applicants currently studying IN the United States Students graduating from a high school in the United States are required to submit ACT and/or SAT scores regardless of the time spent in the United States. We only accept official scores directly from the ACT and/or the SAT. For the ACT, we only consider the English, Math, Reading, and Science sections; for the SAT, we only consider the Reading and Math sections. The Essay and/or Writing sections for both exams are not required for admission. There is no limit to the number of test scores you may submit with your application. If you take the test more than once, please ensure that the testing agency sends us all of your scores as we will superscore your test results. Be sure to complete all testing by the following dates: November 1 if applying Early Decision I or Early Action January 1 if applying Early Decision II or Regular Decision Test Codes for UM: ACT Code: 0760 SAT Code: 5815 TOEFL Code: 5815 IELTS Code: 4861 STEP 4 Complete the School Report The School Report should be completed by your high school guidance counselor and can be found on the Common Application. It is often submitted along with your high school transcript and information about your high school. STEP 5 Letters of Recommendation We require you to submit two letters of recommendation: one from a high school guidance counselor and one from a teacher. These should be submitted electronically through the Common Application or Naviance, by emailing them to mydocuments@miami.edu, or by mailing them to one of the following addresses: University of Miami Office of Undergraduate Admission P.O. Box 249117 Coral Gables, FL 33124-9117 If sending via FedEx, DHL, UPS, or courier: University of Miami Office of Undergraduate Admission 1320 S. Dixie Highway Gables One Tower, Suite 945 Coral Gables, FL 33146 STEP 6 Submit Educational Activities, if applicable If you have a time gap of three months or more during your educational career or from the time you graduated high school to the date of your intended University of Miami enrollment, you must submit an Educational Activities statement explaining the reason for the gap(s) and include the dates. You may provide this explanation within your Common Application or by emailing it to us separately at mydocuments@miami.edu. Be sure to include the subject line “Educational Activities” and your full name and date of birth on all correspondence. This information is required to complete your application file. STEP 7 Submit Financial Aid Documents, if applicable Visit the Applying for Aid page for a financial aid checklist of documents and dates needed to be considered for need-based financial aid. STEP 8 Send conduct updates, if applicable If there is any update to your conduct (academic or behavioral) or your standing as a student in your high school (suspension, expulsion, withdrawal, etc.), you must alert the Office of Undergraduate Admission immediately at conductupdate@miami.edu. All other nonconduct updates can be sent to mydocuments@miami.edu. Be sure to include your name and date of birth on all documents.
