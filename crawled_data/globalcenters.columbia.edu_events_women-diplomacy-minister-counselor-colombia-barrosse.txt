The discussion will be followed by a brief cocktail reception. About Colombia Barrosse Colombia joined the Foreign Service in 1989 and brings with her a wide variety of consular and cross-functional experience, both in Washington and overseas. Her initial overseas assignments were in consular positions in the Dominican Republic, Spain, and Argentina. From 1998 to 2000, she was Deputy Political Counselor at Embassy Lima, subsequently extending her assignment in Peru to serve as Cultural Affairs Officer. In 2003, she joined the Public Diplomacy team in Paris as Assistant Cultural Affairs Officer. Arriving in Port-au-Prince as Consul General just several months after the 2010 earthquake, Colombia led the consular team in reinstating full services. From there she went on to Naples, Italy, where she was Principal Officer covering all Southern Italy. In August 2020, she was asked to return to Port-au-Prince to lead the Consular Section’s operational transition through the COVID pandemic. Colombia’s Washington experience includes serving as a Special Assistant, first to Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs, Mary Ryan, and then to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. She also worked in Washington as the Consular Bureau’s Executive Office as a Management Analyst covering Europe. From 2007-2010, she was Cultural Programs Division Chief in ECA, where she handled global cultural programming. She later served on the Board of Examiners (BEX), first as an assessor and then as Deputy Director. Prior to her return to Haiti, she was Senior Advisor in the Office of Policy, Planning and Resources (R/PPR). Born in New Orleans, Colombia grew up in Latin America, where her father’s USAID assignments took the family. She has a B.S. in Biology from the College of William and Mary and a J.D. from the Marshall Wythe School of Law in Williamsburg, Virginia. She is married, with two adult children. She speaks Spanish, French, and Italian.
