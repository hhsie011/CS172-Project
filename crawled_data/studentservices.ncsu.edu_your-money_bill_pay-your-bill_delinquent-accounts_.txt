Accounts that remain unpaid are considered delinquent and, in accordance with the requirements of General Statute 147-86.23, interest will be assessed on any unpaid balance. The current 5 percent annual interest rate is established by the State of North Carolina. Calculation of Penalty and Interest Charges are considered delinquent 90 days after the due date. Interest is assessed on the unpaid balance when a charge becomes delinquent and is calculated at the rate of 5 percent per year until paid. A one-time 10 percent penalty will also be charged. Late-payment penalty and interest charges are considered payable when charged. Additional Information In addition to incurring interest on an unpaid balance, students may also incur a hold on their account, may not be allowed to register, and their schedule may be cancelled.
