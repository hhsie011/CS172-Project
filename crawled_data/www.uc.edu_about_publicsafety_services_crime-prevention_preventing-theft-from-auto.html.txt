Please see the safety tips below for more information on how you can reduce your risk. Lock your doors and close your windows. Criminals look for opportunity, and unlocked doors and open windows are easy opportunities. Do not leave your keys or key fobs in your car. It may be convenient, especially for those with a push-button ignition, but it leaves your car vulnerable to auto theft. Do not leave your valuables laying out. Take them with you, or hide them in your vehicle before you arrive at your destination. Do not leave items, such as phone chargers and change, in a visible place. Park in well-lit and well-populated areas, preferably a parking garage. Never leave your car running unattended. If you are parking your vehicle for several days, check on it periodically. Have your keys ready to use, but concealed, as you approach your car. If someone approaches your car, do not roll your window down low enough that they could reach into your car. A messy car is not a deterrent, and tinted windows will not prevent thieves from seeing your belongings. Keep a copy of your registration and insurance in safe (local) place. Back up your documents on a service such as Google Drive or Dropbox. That way, if your laptop is ever stolen, you will not lose your work. If you see any suspicious activity, contact UCPD immediately when you feel safe to do so by calling 9-1-1 or, if you cannot make a call, using the tip feature on the Bearcat Guardian app. Department of Public Safety 51 West Corry Boulevard Cincinnati, OH 45221-0215 Main Number: 513-556-4900 Background Checks, Keys and IDs: 513-556-4925 UC Tools Canopy & Canvas One Stop Email Catalyst Shuttle Tracker IT Help UC VPN Bearcats Landing About Us Maps & Directions Jobs News Diversity Governance & Policies Directory Events Calendar University of Cincinnati | 2600 Clifton Ave. | Cincinnati, OH 45221 | ph: 513-556-6000 Alerts | Clery and HEOA Notice | Notice of Non-Discrimination | eAccessibility Concern | Privacy Statement | Free Speech | Copyright Information © 2020 University of Cincinnati Department of Public Safety 51 West Corry Boulevard Cincinnati, OH 45221-0215 Main Number: 513-556-4900 Background Checks, Keys and IDs: 513-556-4925 © 2020 University of Cincinnati scroll up to the top
