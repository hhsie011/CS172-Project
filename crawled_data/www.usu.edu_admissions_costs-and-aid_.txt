The student must have graduated from a Utah high school or attained the equivalent of a high school diploma (GED) in Utah. Students must submit their official high school transcript(s) validating three-year high school attendance in Utah and graduation from a Utah high school. A student, who is without lawful immigration status, must file an affidavit with Utah State University stating that he or she has filed an application to legalize immigration status, or will file an application as soon as he or she is eligible to do so. Students who hold a nonimmigrant alien visa are not eligible for this exemption.

Students meeting the criteria will have the nonresident portion of their tuition waived, but continue to be classified as nonresidents. Students who qualify for this exemption are not eligible for state and federal financial aid. Procedures for Requesting the Exemption Fill out the application. In addition to any credentials necessary for admission to Utah State University, you must arrange to have your final Utah high school transcript verifying graduation sent directly to the Utah State University Admissions Office.
