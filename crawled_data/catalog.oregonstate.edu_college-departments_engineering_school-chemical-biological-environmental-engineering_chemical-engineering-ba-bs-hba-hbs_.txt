Chemical engineering is the discipline that focuses on the science and engineering of processes to convert raw materials into valued chemicals and products at a manufacturing scale. These include products found in everyday life such as transportation and heating fuels, plastics, pharmaceuticals, household and paper products (soaps, cosmetics, health care and cleaning products, etc.), as well as more advanced products like solar cells, computer chips, and advanced composites for jet aircraft. Chemical engineers find employment in traditional chemical industries such as pulp and paper manufacturing and petroleum refining, high-tech industries such as semiconductor device manufacturing, biopharmaceutical production, aerospace, and emerging industries, particularly sustainable energy. Alumni of the chemical engineering program will be work-ready engineers, problem solvers, responsible professionals, and interdisciplinary collaborators. Program educational objectives can be found here. The chemical engineering undergraduate curriculum is designed to meet the student objectives through relevant course content, structured collaborative learning experiences, and hands-on laboratory and design experiences at the first year through senior levels. The school has a core curriculum where students from all three programs housed within the school (CHE, BIOE, ENVE) take common courses in the areas of first-year engineering, material and energy balances, thermodynamics, transport phenomena, and senior year laboratory. Chemical engineering students have opportunities to obtain internships offered through the School of CBEE, and through the Multiple Engineering Cooperative Program (MECOP). Many scholarships are available on a competitive basis for chemical engineering undergraduate students. More detailed descriptions of the curriculum and requirements may be viewed here. Major Code: 303 Identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics. Apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors. Communicate effectively with a range of audiences. Recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts. Function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives. Develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions. Acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies.
