Now, you inspire us. From our first bachelor’s graduates to former doctoral students to HUP alumni, our alumni community has a daily impact on health care. Alumni are making a difference out in the world — and also right here in Philadelphia. Working at the bedside, lab, desk, podium, or courtroom, alumni leadership and involvement play a crucial a role in our shared community and in the growth of current Penn Nursing students. You ensure the ongoing success of Penn Nursing’s education and practice and the advancement of its scholars. Many serve as preceptors, lecturers, guest speakers, alumni board members and more. Penn Nursing’s commitment to our alumni is lifelong. From online webinars to help you expand your knowledge, to finding alumni contacts when moving to a new city, job postings, mentors and volunteer experience to special interest communities on LinkedIn, there is a place for you. There are many ways to stay connected to Penn Nursing. Volunteer as a preceptor for students, serve as an event host in your local city, mentor current students, nominate an outstanding alumnus/a for an alumni award, give to the Annual Fund, be the class representative for your reunion during Alumni Weekend, or talk with students about job opportunities and interview skills.
