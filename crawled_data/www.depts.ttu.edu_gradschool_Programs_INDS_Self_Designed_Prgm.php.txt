Texas Tech University Directory Raiderlink A-Z Index Graduate School Menu Search TTU Graduate School Self-Designed Programs The Interdisciplinary Studies program allows students to create a program that best fits their interests and career aspirations that might not be offered in the pre-designed graduate programs. With seven colleges to choose from, a minimum of three areas of individualized focus and 2,000 program combinations, students have a variety of courses and graduate certificates to choose from. With this option, a student chooses courses from two different colleges with a minimum of three different disciplines. Each discipline is 9-12 credit hours. During a student's last semester of study, the student should complete a final comprehensive component. This component demonstrates the student's ability to synthesize knowledge from their chosen areas. Like a discipline specific master's degree, an interdisciplinary master's has a final element that will access your ability to synthesize what you have learned during your degree program. At Texas Tech, you have the choice of thesis and non-thesis options.
