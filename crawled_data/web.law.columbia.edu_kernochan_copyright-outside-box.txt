We will investigate two principal issues: (1) Fixation: when is the work fixed? How long must it stay in a given form to be considered “fixed”? (2) Who creates the work, and what is the significance of outside forces, e.g., nature and acts of third parties? What is the significance of these factors for various types of conceptual art? Panelists: Zahr Said, Assistant Professor of Law, University of Washington Law School Megan Carpenter, Professor of Law & Co-Director, Center of Law & Intellectual Property, Texas A&M Law School Robert Clarida, Partner, Reitler Kailas & Rosenblatt LLC Agnieszka Kurant, Visual Artist 11:45-1:15 Panel 2: Concepts of Authorship in Computer-Generated Works This panel will examine concepts of authorship in the specific context of computer-generated works, compare human authorship and robot creators, and discuss incorporation of randomness in authorship. Panelists: Bruce Boyden, Associate Professor of Law, Marquette Law School Annemarie Bridy, Professor of Law, University of Idaho College of Law James Grimmelmann, Professor of Law, University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law 1:15-2:30 LUNCH (Provided) 2:30-3:30 Panel 3: Fringe Works—Typefonts, Yoga, and Tattoos This panel will examine issues of functionality and scope through examples of three kinds of works on the fringes of copyright: typefonts, yoga sequences, and tattoos. Panelists: Gloria Phares, Of Counsel, Hoffmann Marshall Strong LLP Christopher Buccafusco, Professor of Law, Cardozo Law School Yolanda King, Associate Professor of Law, Northern Illinois University College of Law 3:30-3:45 BREAK 3:45-4:45 Panel 4: Manageability—if authorship, what then? This panel will examine instances in which concern for the manageability of the work augurs a determination that the claimant is not an “author” in the first place (e.g., 9th Circuit en banc decision in Garcia v. Google and the problem of critical editions such as the Dead Sea Scrolls). It will also explore the prospect that recognizing authorship brings too many authors and ask 'Has the derivative work replaced the original work?'. Panelists: Jennifer Rothman, Professor of Law, Loyola Law School Eva Subotnik, Associate Professor of Law, St. John’s University School of Law Jay Dougherty, Professor of Law, Loyola Law School 4:45-5:00 CLOSING REMARKS Directory Columbia University Directory Navigate the site Home About the School Admissions Academics Faculty Centers and Programs Courses Students LawNet School Events Academic Calendar School News Magazine Alumni Giving Careers Library Latest Tweet Read the latest tweet...
