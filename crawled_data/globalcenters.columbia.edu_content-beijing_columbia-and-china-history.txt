The connection between Columbia University and China can be traced back to the Qing Dynasty in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1871, suggested by Yung Wing (1828-1912), the first Chinese student to graduate from an American university, the Qing government initiated the Chinese Educational Mission, sending a group of Chinese students to live and study in New England, where they received American college education.1 TANG Shaoyi, the first Prime Minister of the Republic of China2, WU Yangzeng, one of the primary founders of the modern mining engineering in China3, and ZHOU Changling (also known as Shouson Chow), a successful businessman and a pioneer in the development of Chinese telegraphy technology4, pursued their study at Columbia University5. Although they were called back by the government before finishing college due to political interference, these predecessors greatly contributed to the modernization of China in many of the key sectors, such as philosophy, education, literature, chemical engineering, business, law, and politics6. Starting from 1909, a remarkable group of Chinese students came to study at Columbia University under the guidance of world-renowned scholars like John Dewey and Paul Monroe7, which included TAO Xingzhi, a leading educator and reformer applying liberal ideas to the Chinese education system8, CHANG Poling, the founder of Nankai system of schools and the early advocates of Olympic game promotion in China9, KUO Ping-wen, the founder of the first Chinese modern university, National Southeastern University, JIANG Menglin, the former president of Peking University and National Chekiang University10, and HU Shih, a prestigious Chinese philosopher and writer. This group of pioneers adapted progressive education ideas to Chinese conditions and initiated reforms that laid the foundation for the modern Chinese education system11. Till today, generations of Chinese students and scholars came to Columbia University to work towards their academic goals and broaden their view. Their achievements as scientists, educators, artists, investors, business leaders, doctors, and lawyers have been widely recognized by both their nation and the world. According to the incomplete statistics from the International Students and Scholars Office at Columbia University, in 2020, there were more than 6,200 Chinese students in the 16 schools of the University12. Their footprints have been scattered throughout the campus and their outstanding performances have added to the uniqueness and essence of the Columbia community. Columbia Global Centers | Beijing, as an important regional hub for the University community and the Global Centers network in East Asia, has been striving for enriching learning experience and increasing global engagement of Columbia students and alumni. An ancient Chinese proverb says “A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step” (千里之行，始于足下). The “Columbia University and China” history series will dig into the ties between the University and China to reflect on the huge legacy, in the hope of inspiring more intercultural communication and collaboration that generate a deeper understanding between the U.S. and China.
