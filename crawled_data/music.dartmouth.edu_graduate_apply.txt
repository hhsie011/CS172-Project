A bachelor's degree in a field relevant to their creative and/or scholarly practice. 2. Demonstrated knowledge and experience in the field of sonic arts. This could be sound art, composition, music theater, instrumental performance, songwriting, improvisation, electronic music, etc. Master's students are generally awarded a full tuition scholarship, as well as an annual stipend, which typically allows students to devote full-time to their studies. The acceptance of financial support entails a commitment to a variety of activities and responsibilities vis a vis the graduate program and the studio: including studio management and development, research, informal teaching, and full participation in the artistic and intellectual life of the program. Occasionally, graduate students may serve informally as research or teaching assistants in the Departments of Music, Psychology, Computer Science, or the Thayer School of Engineering. Application Deadline Please note that the application deadline is FEBRUARY 1st and that the Graduate Record Examination is no longer required. Since our goal is a small, high-quality program, we typically only admit three new students each year.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Music Undergraduate Music at Dartmouth Major and Minor Courses Spring 2022 Summer 2022 Fall 2022 Winter 2023 Spring 2023 Honors Honors Projects Funding Graduate Overview Apply People Current Students Performance Overview Individual Instruction Student Recitals Performance Laboratories Hopkins Center Ensembles Practice Rooms Instruments and Lockers Foreign Study Overview London FSP Vienna FSP News & Events News Events Arts Awards Leonard J.
