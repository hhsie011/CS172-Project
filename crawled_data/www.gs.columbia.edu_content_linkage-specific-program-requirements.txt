This is even more important for the linkage applicant because of the binding commitment that the applicant makes to attend, if accepted. Many schools have non-negotiable requirements that may pertain to grade point averages or MCAT scores, and in some cases, non-academic experiences. In short, the student interested in linkage must do his or her research before applying for nomination. It could be a serious mistake to take the attitude that one “just wants to get into some medical school” or to assume that strengths in one area of one's record will compensate for shortcomings in another. Programs Below is the list of schools maintaining linkage agreements with the Postbac Premed Program. The applicable requirements are those on record during the academic year in which the prospective applicant is eligible to seek nomination. Note: These requirements are updated each year, but students should confirm requirements with their academic advisors.
