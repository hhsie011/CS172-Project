The ability to communicate effectively is essential for success-oriented graduates, and acquiring the competence to communicate in a language other than English can often provide a competitive edge in today's global economy. Communicating effectively in a second language is more than the acquisition of language skills. Students also gain insight into another culture which often provides ivaluable perspectives and greater sense of appreciation for alternate ways of life and thought.The department views language, culture and literature as integrally related facets of communication that help us achieve better understanding of ourselves and others in the rapidly changing world we live in. The study of a foreign language and culture, as with other humanities and social sciences disciplines, fosters scholarship and values, social responsibility, free and critical inquiry, empirical analysis, and leadership skills. Together, these elements prepare students for intellectually rewarding lives, responsible citizenship, and a wide variety of careers by developing critical thinking, clear writing, problem solving skills, and a heightened understanding of the human condition. The Japanese Program offers courses that lead not just to mastery of the language but also to an understanding of the Japanese culture and people. We feel that learning a language in a social vacuum is not meaningful. Our goal is to enable you to communicate culturally and intellectually with the Japanese people.
