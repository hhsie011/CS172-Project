Imagine yourself choosing from a variety of diverse career opportunities. That’s accounting. The Ivy program will prepare you to analyze, synthesize, and report data so you can pursue diverse careers in business. This could include auditing, consulting, public accounting, budget, forecasting, and more. As an accountant, you will be solving real business problems. You can use your accounting education to provide accurate data for your company, data that will be used in daily decision-making. You can ensure the integrity of the financial data for your company and work in partnership with others in your company, using your accounting knowledge and skills to help drive your company’s success. The field of accounting offers a range of interesting career choices. Certified public accountants, or CPAs, often operate their own businesses and provide financial and tax-related services to organizations and individual clients. Another branch of accounting, auditing, focuses on identifying errors and discrepancies in financial records that indicate mismanagement. These occupations play an important role in the country’s overall economic health. For this reason, experts predict strong demand for jobs in accounting in the years to come.
