There is no student application process for prizes, as those are awarded to students whose work is nominated by faculty, but the Pembroke Center invites applications from current Brown students, from any concentration or field, to apply for our research grants. Please see individual grant descriptions and guidelines. Students with projects appropriate for more than one grant may apply for multiple grants, although it is unlikely a student would be awarded more than one.
