Did the establishment of an extensive Islamic empire connecting the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean cut off western Europe from the south-eastern borders of the Mediterranean, or did it create opportunities for new commercial activities and exchanges? In this lecture, I will use archaeological, papyrological and historical material to discuss how the Mediterranean was connected to a global system of exchange that reached – at times – from Africa to South Asia and how this system was effected by political power structures in the region and beyond. Using a globalisation model where interconnectness results from frequent and diverse interactions, I will show that a great degree of integration did not necessarily lead to uniform cultural expressions. Petra Sijpesteijn is a professor of Arabic. Her research concentrates on recovering the experiences of Muslims and non-Muslims living under Islamic rule, using the vast stores of radically under-used documents surviving from the early Islamic world. Starting in 2017, she manages an international research project entitled "Embedding Conquest: Naturalising Muslim Rule in the Early Islamic Empire (600-1000)", funded by the European Research Council. Petra will join us for a lecture about: Global Networks in the Medieval Mediterranean. The event will start at 5:30 pm. In partnership with the Laboratoire Histoire des économies et des Sociétés Méditerranéennes (Université de Tunis) & Diwan Tunis.
