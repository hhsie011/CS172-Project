With a number of factors in play, it is hard to say exactly what swayed the votes of the members of the Corporation, although they heard arguments in favor of the city’s central location, availability of materials and workers, number of libraries, and money pledged to support the effort. When the dust settled, Providence prevailed, in a vote of 21-14 and it was “…therefore Resolved that the said Edifice be built in the Town of Providence, and there be continued forever.” Brown University Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA Phone: 401-863-1000 Maps & Directions / Contact Us © Brown University X
