Yet many parts of the country have poor availability and quality of power. Nearly 250 million Indians live without electricity. The needs of consumers and enterprises in urban areas differ from rural ones. The power industry and experts recognize that the key to reform lies in electricity distribution. This lecture will showcase results from efforts in India and other parts of the world to suggest possible ways forward. Some technological pathways illustrate how the goals of meeting consumer expectations of service versus utility constraints in the short term can be triaged to find a way forward for the entire sector.
