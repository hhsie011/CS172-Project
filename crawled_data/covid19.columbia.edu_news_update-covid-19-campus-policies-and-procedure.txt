We would like to share with you updates on our January 5th message regarding Columbia University COVID-19 policies and procedures. We continue to observe reassuring data on the effectiveness of vaccines and boosters in the prevention of severe illness and hospitalizations and to note consistent overall favorable COVID-19 situation in our City and campuses. As such, below are adjustments in our gatherings and visitor policies. Beginning on the dates noted, the following types of gatherings (which may include CU and non-CU affiliates) will be permitted: February 1, 2022: Academic, research and administrative gatherings are allowed with no capacity restrictions February 7, 2022: Social gatherings are allowed with no capacity restrictions February 14, 2022: Eating/drinking onsite (indoors or outdoors) is allowed at gatherings with minimizing of removal of masks For attendees of any of the above types of gatherings who are not CU affiliates, such individuals would be required to follow the visitor policy and must have proof of vaccination and booster as well as comply with other Columbia University safety protocols. Individual schools or departments are expected to ensure vaccine/booster compliance when such visitors are invited. As a reminder, masking indoors at Columbia will continue through March 31. We strongly recommend wearing of masks even outdoors when in crowded settings. As always, we continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic status in the New York City metro area and among our affiliates and may make necessary changes to protect the safety of our campus.
