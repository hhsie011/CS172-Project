This begins our busiest time of year as we prepare to collect new backpacks and supplies for many of our area’s neediest children. Who are we? The Cornell Elves Backpack Program began in the fall of 2007 with 284 backpacks donated. Support has grown steadily over the past ten years, and last year we over 1100 new, filled backpacks to 28 schools! This year, we are working with 25 area schools (please see list of schools and program contacts at the bottom of this email). You can also check out our website for additional information about the Elves Programs: http://elves.cornell.edu/ How does the program work? Children who receive these backpacks are entering kindergarten through sixth grade and are identified by the nurses/social workers at the schools represented by the program. Our sponsors include Cornell employees, students, local families, neighbors, businesses, and organizations such as the Girl Scouts. How can I help? It’s so easy to make the first day at school special for a local child! You can choose to donate to a particular school from the list at the bottom of this email, or bring the backpacks to my office where it will be donated to the schools who may still be in need. Buy a backpack & supplies: A new backpack and all of the supplies can be purchased for $20 - $25 once all of the back-to-school sales begin. See the Supply List and enjoy shopping the sales! Donate supplies: Did your business buy too many pencils or notebooks this year? Have extra glue sticks? We’ll get them to classrooms where they’ll be used! Write a check: Don’t like to shop? No problem. Our elves know how to stretch a dollar and get what kids need most. Any amount will make a difference to a needy local child! Checks can be made out to “The Elves” and sent to my attention at the address below. Are donations tax-deductible? Donations to the Backpack Program are not tax deductible because we are not a registered non-profit organization. There is significant expense and ongoing paperwork involved in becoming a nonprofit. We are proud of the fact that we are simply concerned Cornell employees trying to support our communities. We have absolutely no overhead costs, and every penny donated goes directly to help children who are truly in need. What is the deadline to provide donations? In order that we can get the backpacks to the schools in time for the kids to pick them up before that first day, I ask that backpacks being dropped off at my office, be brought no later than August 24, 2018.
