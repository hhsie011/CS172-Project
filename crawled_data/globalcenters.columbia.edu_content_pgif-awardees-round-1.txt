A total of 87 proposals were submitted by more than 100 faculty from 13 Schools and from 12 departments in Arts and Sciences. With the help of a 15‐member faculty review committee, a total of 20 proposals were selected for funding. The full list of funded projects follows below. This program is designed to provide support for faculty who wish to use the resources or facilities of one or more of the University’s eight Global Centers for teaching or research activities. The aim is to increase opportunities for research, teaching and service around the world. The projects selected in this first round cut across a broad range of disciplines, from psychiatry to environmental engineering to art history. They engage every Global Center, with research topics that include children’s health, sustainable cities, migration, and slavery networks. The projects will provide opportunities for students to engage in global research, education, and service in new and meaningful ways.
