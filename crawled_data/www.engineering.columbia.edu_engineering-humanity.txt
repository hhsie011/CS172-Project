Since then, its graduates and faculty have transformed entire industries with inventions including early steamboat technology, a punch card system, FM radio, the Pupin coil, the radio proximity fuse, the Kalman filter, and technology that made the mass production of antibiotics possible. They have also led such groundbreaking projects as New York’s first subway and the world’s first nuclear submarine.
