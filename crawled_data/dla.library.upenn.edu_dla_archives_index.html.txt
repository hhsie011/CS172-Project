Main Content About the University Archives Digital Image Collection The University Archives Digital Image Collection offers an expanding database of over 5,700 digital images of items found in the collections of the University Archives and Records Center. Delivered by the Penn Libraries, the database contains digital photographs and scans of items relating to the history of the University of Pennsylvania, prominent persons associated with the University and the history of the Philadelphia community in which the University resides. This sampling of items found in the collections of the University Archives includes not just photographs, but also decorative objects and memorabilia, drawings, graphics, prints, maps, manuscripts and printed text. This interface offers a faceted search as well as full-image and slideshow views. The slideshow feature is powered by Cooliris and can be enhanced by installing an optional browser plugin, which enables a movable, 3D array of image results.
