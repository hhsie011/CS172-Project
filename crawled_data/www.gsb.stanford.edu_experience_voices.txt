The Experience Voices Voices of Stanford GSB Explore our growing collection of personal stories reflecting the diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and pursuits of the Stanford GSB community. Hear first-hand from students, alumni, fellows, and faculty, across all of our programs. MBA Students MBA Students People won’t remember how clever you are; they’ll remember how kind you are. Tamar Schamroth MBA ’22 I describe myself as a pretty boring person, which probably helps. Not having hobbies opens up a lot of room for efficiency. Kathy Ku MBA ’22 I spent a life in medicine calculating and eliminating risk, but the GSB has taught me to embrace risk. Harpreet Mangat MBA ’22 My mom always said: ‘Surround yourself with people who raise you higher.’ Conor O’Meara MBA ’22 See More MBA Student Voices MSx Students MSx Students Surfing taught me humility, but also perseverance. You feel your smallness when you’re under a 20- to 25-foot mountain of water. Felipe Freitas MSx Class of 2021 The world we live in today is all hyphenated and intertwined already — we just need the media to catch up. Marty Chen MSx Class of 2021 When you’re in a crisis, you have to look at the problem with a certain amount of naked honesty and convey what you really think to your employees. Malli Coimbatore MSx Class of 2021 I was encouraged from an early age to chase my passions, and one of those passions was storytelling. Ian McMilan MSx Class of 2019 See More MSx Student Voices PhD Students PhD Students These very large, detailed data sets allow us to study economic behavior and human behavior. It’s an exciting time to be doing research. Susan Cherry PhD ’24 It‘s clear from my work that we experience disagreement, especially in the domain of politics, in a deeply personal way. Charles Chu PhD ’23 That’s how I landed in organizational behavior, because I saw a lot of problems with work relationships. Lara Yang PhD ’23 At Stanford, a lot of work is done in teams. That didn’t come naturally to me. Nadia Kotova PhD ’21 See More PhD Student Voices MBA Alumni MBA Alumni A lot of what I do you can relate to my career in sports. You want to win, but you also need to work well with others. Dan Grunfeld MBA ’17 I’m a kind of shapeshifter, a business executive with the heart and soul of a journalist. Jim Friedlich MBA ’85 Our tribe elects me to represent them and it’s deeply gratifying work. Jennifer Fate Velaise MBA ’88 That’s why I’m still here at 104 — because I’ve been adaptable and optimistic. George Jedenoff MBA ’42 See More MBA Alumni Voices MSx/Sloan Alumni MSx/Sloan Alumni That’s the beauty of one’s journey. Instead of hiding changes and difficulties, you showcase them. It means you tried and survived. Lamiaa Daif MS ’20 I had a chance to return home with knowledge and experience and connections. Guram “Guga” Tsanava MS ’12 If this is what this looks like today, what does tomorrow look like? Ed Kargbookorogie MS ’18 I was convinced there was both a big opportunity to work on and that I was capable of working on it. Tom Stevens MS ’17 See More Sloan/MSx Alumni Voices Executive Education Executive Education Participants Stanford is about always thinking big. David Burke SEP ’19 One in five people have a diagnosed disability, but everyone has something they struggle with. Annabelle Williams SEP ’19 You have to find the perfect balance of the quantitative brain and the passionate heart. Warrick Chu SEP ’19 I think for any entrepreneur, there’s a risk in being overconfident in your own decisions. That’s something I want to improve. Xiaorong (Hazel) Hu SEP ’19 See More Executive Education Voices Faculty Faculty Companies talk about their good intentions. I’d much rather have good institutions than good intentions. Ken Shotts The David S. and Ann M. Barlow Professor of Political Economy I believe behavioral science is exactly what we need to make a difference in this world. Szu-chi Huang Associate Professor of Marketing My main hope remains education... This crisis in capitalism and the crisis in democracy are intertwined. Anat Admati The George G.C. Parker Professor of Finance and Economics I’ve been focusing on and talking about these issues of social change for a very, very long time.
