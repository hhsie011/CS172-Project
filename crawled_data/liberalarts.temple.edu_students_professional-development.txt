Pathways to Professions Stipend Program Temple University’s College of Liberal Arts (CLA) encourages all of its students to complete at least one internship before graduation as it will facilitate career exploration and job marketability. However, the majority of nonprofit and government internships are unpaid, which can present challenges to those students pursuing this type of work, but cannot afford to take time off from their paid-jobs. This is why generous Temple CLA alumni have provided donations to offer a $2000.00 stipend to a select group of students completing unpaid internships for the summer.
