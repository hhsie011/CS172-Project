To that end, Iowa State University has adopted informal and formal processes through which discrimination and harassment complaints can be resolved. Iowa State University takes all claims of discrimination and harassment seriously. If you feel that you have been discriminated or harassed based on race, color, age, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, genetic information, sex, marital status, disability, or status as a U.S. Veteran, you may report a concern with the Office of Equal Opportunity via the following methods: Via phone: 515-294-7612 or Hotline: 515-294-1222 Via email: eooffice@iastate.edu In person: 3410 Beardshear Hall, 515 Morrill Road by appointment Monday - Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. If you wish to file a complaint with an external agency: Iowa Civil Rights Commission U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights Conflict Resolution You may seek informal resolution or file a formal complaint.
