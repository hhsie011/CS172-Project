During the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, prestigious institutions of higher education founded on Christian principles began a relentless retreat from their spiritual heritage. During that time and into the Twenty-first Century, Baylor has remained one of the few to persist in the belief that not only can its Baptist heritage inform a vital approach to life in general, it can also inform the life of the mind specifically. Baylor continues to hold firm to the conviction that the world needs a preeminent research university that is unambiguously Christian, where such a commitment does not imply a lack of scholarly inquiry, but rather requires scholarship and creative endeavors at the highest levels of quality to complement and inform its teaching and service. The foundation for Baylor's position in higher education is articulated in its mission statement, foundational assumptions, core convictions and unifying academic themes. These commitments motivated the founding of Baylor and have guided the University at every point in its history. They continue to define Baylor's exceptional character, purpose and vocation in the world of higher education. Chapel The oldest tradition in American higher education and at Baylor University is Chapel. The need for members of an academic community to come together to focus on the God who made them and the universe in which they live and study has not changed. Chapel provides an opportunity for students and faculty to gather on Monday and Wednesday mornings at 9:05, 10:10 and 11:15 in Waco Hall to hear from people who excel at what they do as an expression of their commitment to Christ. Demographics Our student body comes from 49 states and more than 85 countries, and that diversity means a variety of background, cultures and beliefs. Despite assumptions to the contrary, students are not required to embrace the Baptist tradition to become part of the Baylor family and enjoy all that Baylor has to offer. Students encounter a variety of beliefs on campus, and they are encouraged to broaden their understanding of the rich cultural diversity found throughout the world and reflected in the Baylor family. The Baylor family includes members from these faith traditions: African Methodist Episcopal Anglican (Church of England) Assembly of God Atheist Baptist Buddhist Catholic Christian Church Church of Christ Church of God Church of the Nazarene Congregational Church Disciples of Christ Eastern Orthodox Episcopalian Evangelical Free Four Square Gospel Full Gospel Greek Orthodox Hindu Independent Bible Islam Interdenominational Jehovah's Witness Jewish/Judaism LDS (Mormon) Lutheran Mennonite Methodist Missionary Alliance Non-Denominational Pentecostal Presbyterian Protestant Seventh Day Adventist Unitarian No Religion George W.
