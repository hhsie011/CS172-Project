They cover a variety of topics and types of involvement from campus, to the local Cincinnati community, and even destinations domestic and abroad. The pre-approved experiences will count as honors experiences if completed as directed (by the contact listed) and showcased in your learning portfolio within one month of completing the experience. Application deadlines can be months earlier than the beginning of the experience, so plan accordingly. Important considerations Please note that some of the programs listed on these pages have competitive application processes and/or specific deadlines. For more information about a particular program/project, please visit the website or contact the individual listed below. Most pre-approved experiences can only be counted one time as an honors experience; if you are completing a pre-approved honors experience for a second time, please contact your honors advisor to see if it can count as an additional experience.
