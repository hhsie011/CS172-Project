The degree requires 51 credits within the major (122 credit hours total, including the University Curriculum and electives) and culminates in the production of a collaborative project, or an individual thesis film/media project Admission and Degree Requirements Admission to the B.F.A. is limited and requires application through a selective process. Applicants should consult the B.F.A. Admission Process for portfolio submission details and deadlines. If accepted, a student must complete FILM 1304 (Production 1) and FILM 2354 (Screenwriting 1) with a cumulative 2.7 or better GPA prior to declaring the B.F.A. in Film and Media Arts. Upon declaration of the B.F.A., in addition to the course requirements below, students are required to pass FILM 1301 (Art of Film & Media) with a grade of C- or better to receive their degree. Note on class attendance: Due to limited class space and enrollment pressures, a student who fails to appear on the first day or who fails to attend three consecutive class meetings during an academic term without establishing contact with the instructor may be administratively dropped from a course. B.F.A. Thesis Film B.F.A. students intending to do the thesis film capstone option must submit a thesis project proposal in the spring semester of their junior year; proposals are due by the end of the first school week after spring break. Details about what to include in the proposal packet are available in the department office. Proposals will be reviewed by the faculty and students will be notified about any potential problems that need to be addressed prior to registration in FILM 5311 Thesis Film 1. Students not submitting proposals will not be allowed to register for this course or shoot a thesis project. The ensuing academic year, B.F.A. students will register for FILM 5311 (Thesis Film 1) in the fall and then FILM 5313 (Thesis Film 2) in the spring. Each senior B.F.A. student will be required to present his/her project at the close of the semester (usually during or just after finals week) after it has been approved by the committee. All students registered for FILM 5313 will have, at most, until the second day of final exams that semester to complete the proposed project to the satisfaction of their committees. This means thesis defenses should be scheduled no later than mid-April to allow time to address any issues or concerns raised by the committee at the defense. B.F.A.
