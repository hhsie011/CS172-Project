Beavers mean Business Our Commitment to you We have one job — and that’s to prepare you for the challenges and opportunities of a rapidly changing business world. That includes this one. Since 1908, we've been educating beavers for business. We’ve always embraced change — this time adapting to put student and community safety first. We’ve consulted with our industry advisors to expand the degrees and specializations that we offer you and launched our award-winning business and design curriculum. We've been leading the space for years now in creating learning opportunities — fully online as well as flexible learning formats — that are supportive programs for transferring students, and welcoming to all our learners. You’re not just earning a degree — you’re gaining the professional and leadership skills that will serve you, your business and your community throughout your life. We are leading together. 22 We have 22 student clubs aligned with our majors, options and community interests to enhance the learning and leadership experiences of our business and design students. 5% Our college and our accounting program are accredited by AACSB International — The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. Less than 5% of business schools worldwide have earned AACSB accreditation and only 1% separately accredit accounting. 77% 77% of College of Business students have an internship while still studying at OSU (for the class of 2019), and, thus boost their employment prospects at graduation. Business and Design Core As a Business student, whether you're interested in launching a startup, or becoming a business consultant, or anything in between, our core business classes provide a solid business foundation. You explore modern management theories, relevant business practices and current industry trends. As a Design student, you take a set of core design classes that includes coursework in design thinking and marketing. We include professional development in both the business and design core curricula, giving you practical strategies and skills for success. You discover your career interests along the way, choose your major, and tailor your degree to those interests. Learn more about core classes Majors Choosing your major program of study is an exciting process, and, indeed, a major decision. The 100- and 200-level courses focus on the fundamentals of business, critical thinking and technical skills and other core requirements. As you complete these courses, you have time and flexibility to zero in on a major. Focusing on the major curriculum, the 300- and 400-level courses immerse you into an area of expertise in business or design that most interests you. We have 14 business and design majors to choose from as well as a full double degree track (for students outside of business who want to double major). We're in WUE! Out-of-State Discounted Tuition Opportunity Oregon State University is part of the Western Undergraduate Exchange (WUE) network, a partnership that helps students in 18 U.S. states and territories with paying for college. WUE allows us to offer a tuition discount — the WUE scholarship — to out-of-state students. WUE limits non-resident tuition as a College of Business student to no more than 150% of in-state tuition rates; this translates to nearly $15,000 of savings per year. If eligible, when you apply to OSU, you'll be considered automatically for this scholarship. + Find out more Explore our majors Accounting Apparel Design Business Administration Business Analytics Business Information Systems Design & Innovation Management Finance Hospitality Management Innovation Management Interior Design Management Marketing Merchandising ManagementSupply Chain and Logistics Management Options International business, digital marketing analytics, merchandising management, supply chain — those who follow business trends know that these are thriving careers both in Oregon and well beyond. And they are options of study for our College of Business students. Options are areas of specialized study attached to certain of our major programs, for example, accounting, business administration and business analytics. We also have an international business option available to most majors at the college, and an elite, high-achieving Dean’s Academy option for honors level students. We developed program options – in close partnership with our industry advisors — in order to elevate certain technical skills and subject knowledge that these future employers need. Industry has long turned to the College of Business to create such program options that lead to the skilled, career-ready graduates they want to hire. Explore our Options Accounting Information Systems Dean's Academy Digital MarketingFamily Business Financial Planning Hospitality Management Information Security, Assurance, & Analytics Innovation & Entrepreneurship International Business Marketing Merchandising Management Retail Management Supply Chain and Logistics Management Human resource analytics Digital Marketing Analytics Market Research and Consumer Analytics Minors Step into the College of Business for a business minor that elevates your skill set and prepares you for expanded career opportunities. Alongside global businesses like Nike and Daimler, and major success stories like Reser Fine Foods, Oregon also is a place of small businesses – often operations with four or fewer employees or enterprising startups. That’s why we want every student – engineer, forester, artist, agriculturalist – to study business fundamentals. We have several business minors to choose from, achievable in about seven to eight classes, that’ll help your ideas and career plans become real. Minors are extremely accessible to business students eager to enhance their skills, and business minors are excellent choices for OSU students from every discipline. Please get in touch with our advising team to discuss the potential to earn a business minor. Explore Minors Accreditation Business programs aacsb-accredited.png The College of Business’ business and accounting degree programs are accredited by AACSB International — the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. AACSB International is the premier accrediting agency for business degree programs. The OSU College of Business, founded in 1908 and accredited in 1960, is one of 500 accredited schools in the United States and one of just 189 institutions globally to have achieved additional accreditation for our accounting program. To achieve accreditation, a business school must meet a broad range of quality standards and be committed to continuous improvement relating to business curriculum, degree requirements, faculty credentials, research and scholarship and more. Since 1916, AACSB has provided quality assurance, business education intelligence, and learning and development services to over 1,700 member organizations and more than 840 accredited business schools worldwide. Design programs Our design degree programs — apparel design, interior design, merchandising management, and design and innovation management — as well as our specialized business degree in hospitality management do not come under the AACSB accreditation process due to the interdisciplinary curriculum of the degree program, and they are not AACSB accredited programs.
