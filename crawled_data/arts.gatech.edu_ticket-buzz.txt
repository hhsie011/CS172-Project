But what if Georgia Tech Arts could package up some of these experiences and send them to your home? Georgia Tech Arts is excited to launch its inaugural Art Box Program. You can now own a piece of all that we do with a lovingly curated box of artworks and creative outputs from 2020-2021 Series artists, as well as Georgia Tech alumni and students who you have met through our virtual programming. We commissioned only 20 limited edition boxes, so we encourage you to act quickly to secure your box! Take a peek inside the latest art box! Get Your Art Box The 2020 Art Box is available for $250* and not only supports the participating artists and creatives, but also includes a tax-deductible donation to Georgia Tech Arts. This gift is instrumental in helping us continue bringing artists, performances, installations, and free virtual programming exploring the intersection of arts, science, and technology to you and our community of supporters. *This is a one-time charge and includes a tax-deductible donation of $130 to Georgia Tech Arts. This is one-time gift and purchase, and it does not automatically enroll you in future editions of the Art Box. At check out, there is an option to choose free contactless pickup or $5 domestic shipping. Please note that orders will be shipped out each Friday. Free curbside pick-up can be scheduled for Monday through Friday.
