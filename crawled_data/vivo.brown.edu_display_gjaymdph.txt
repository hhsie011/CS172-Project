Full Text PubMed Research Research Overview Dr. Jay has investigated the lubricating properties of synovial fluid and what role it may play in degenerative joint diseases. He confirmed that lubricin is a mucinous glycoprotein and showed that the glycosylations on this molecule provide for a lower coefficient of friction between both biological and non-biological rubbing surfaces. He is interested in more immediate translational studies in the areas of automated pulsus paradoxus monitoring in emergency medicine. He has developed and/or tested a portable hyperbaric chamber system, bedside co-oximetry, and other novel devices. Research Statement Dr. Gregory D. Jay, Associate Professor, received his M.D., Ph.D. from the Medical Scientist Training Program at the State University of New York at Stony Brook in 1990. He completed training in emergency medicine at the University of Massachusetts from 1990 through 1993 and became a fellow of the American College of Emergency Physicians in 1996. Dr. Jay also served in the Air National Guard during 1986 through 1998 serving as a flight surgeon in the 106th Aerospace Rescue & Recovery Group and the 143rd Tactical Airlift Group. Dr. Jay is an Associate Professor of Emergency Medicine, Medicine and Engineering, and is an Adjunct Professor in Biomedical Sciences at the University of Rhode Island. He has published over 50 peer-reviewed publications, and has 13 U.S. and international patents. Dr. Jay serves as Director of Research in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Brown University. He has been the principal investigator or co-investigator on multiple National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Science Foundation (NSF) grants supporting his research on mammalian joint lubrication and how this system prevents degenerative joint disease. He has also developed and investigated the clinical utility of automated pulsus paradoxus monitoring in emergency medicine. Dr. Jay has also worked constructively with industry in helping develop portable hyperbaric systems, bedside co-oximetry, and other novel devices.
