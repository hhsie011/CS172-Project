Brown actively strives to create a socioeconomically diverse applicant pool and undergraduate student body. All first-year applicants who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents will be admitted to Brown on a need-blind basis. First-year, first-time undocumented and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) students will be considered under the University's need-blind admission policy. In addition, the University will meet 100% of their demonstrated financial need. Brown will continue to consider transfer and international students' financial need when making admission decisions. The Brown Promise Brown does not package loans in its financial aid awards. Through an initiative called The Brown Promise, the University has replaced all packaged loans in all financial aid packages for Brown undergraduates. Instead, our financial aid packages are based on scholarships that do not have to be repaid. We are committed to ensuring that talented students from all income levels from around the world are able to join the Brown community.
