You are billed tuition based on the number of credit hours (including audit courses ) that you are registered for at the beginning of the quarter. Rates Tuition rates are maintained by the Office of Planning & Budgeting and are based on your grade classification, residency status, tuition graduate tier and the total number of credit hours for which you are registered. This includes classes that you audit. Rates differ depending on which campus you attend, due to slight variations in Services & Activities fees. If a graduate student falls into two tuition tiers, they will be charged the greater of the two tier rates when producing the tuition bill. To view which tuition tier you belong to, please review the list of Programs in Each Graduate Tier (by campus). Tuition Rates: Quarterly/Summer Tuition and Fee Schedules Current and Prior Year Tuition and Fee Schedules For questions regarding tuition and fee distribution, please visit the Office of Planning & Budgeting website for contact information.
