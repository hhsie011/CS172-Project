The University of Cincinnati offers online opportunities for the TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) Graduate Certificate/Endorsement in response to the growing population of English language learners in U.S. classrooms and the academic demand at national and international levels. The Graduate Certificate/Endorsement in PreK-12 TESOL is aligned with the TESOL International Association’s standards and the State of Ohio’s TESOL standards. In-service teachers who have a standard, current Ohio teaching license and teach within the State of Ohio may be able to get the Graduate Certificate and Endorsement upon successful completion of the program. Pre-service teachers in Ohio and those outside of the state are able to get the Graduate Certificate. Any pre-service and/or in-service teacher who wishes to teach English language learners can enroll in this graduate non-degree, professional development program. Admission Requirements The following are requirements for admission: The applicant must possess a Baccalaureate degree from an accredited college or university. The applicant must have a minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.0 at the undergraduate level leading to the Bachelor Degree. The applicant who possesses a master’s degree prior to admission must have a graduate grade point average of at least 3.0 in any graduate level work undertaken before admission. All calculations are based on a 4.0 scale. In rare instances, candidates who graduated from a non-accredited college or university or who do not meet the minimum grade point averages requirement for admission may be admitted based upon an evaluation of evidence submitted by the candidate. As a minimum, the evidence must address mastery of the knowledge prerequisite to the courses required by the program, acceptable writing skills, the ability to engage in critical thinking, and a personal commitment to completing the program. The evidence, very often including Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores, must convincingly demonstrate the candidate's potential for success in graduate level work. Admission decisions are not be made on the basis of race, age, sex, color, religion, sexual orientation or disability. Candidates who are not accepted for admission may reapply once they have addressed the weaknesses identified during their initial application review. During that period, such applicants may be encouraged by the program to enroll in appropriate course work to develop the knowledge, skills, and values deemed necessary for admission into the program, or to demonstrate that the applicant already possesses such qualifications. Whether such course work may apply to the degree program is left to the discretion of the program. Applicants may also be encouraged to take or re-take the GRE. Completion of recommended course work or the GRE does not guarantee admission into the program. Advanced standing for a limited amount of course work taken prior to admittance to the program is possible. Course work completed 5 or more years prior to admission will not be applied to the requirements. To maintain active status in the program, students must register for at least 1 semester credit every academic year. The application is not complete, and cannot be reviewed, until the School of Education has received all of the following: A cover letter clearly stating to which degree and program strand (i.e., K-12 TESOL or Adult/International) the application is being made. A statement of the applicant's academic and professional goals, approximately two pages long. This writing sample will be used as one of the criteria for evaluating the application. The applicant should explain specifically what areas s/he would like to study so that an appropriate advisor may be assigned to the applicant if admitted into the program. A resume relevant to academic and professional data. It should include the applicant's name, address, phone, email, colleges attended with degrees, dates conferred, and grade point average, employment history, professional experience, present employer, and names of references. Three letters of recommendation from people familiar with the applicant’s academic and professional abilities. At least one letter should be from a faculty member in higher education. Those writing letters should explain who they are, their relationship to the applicant, and what they know of the applicant’s academic and professional abilities. The applicant should be prepared to provide the recommenders e-mail addresses in the electronic application. Since recommenders are not prompted to submit their letters until the electronic application has been submitted, and application fee paid, it is wise to encourage recommenders to prepare their letters in advance so that they can upload them immediately upon receipt of the prompt.
