Apple AirTags — which weigh less than an ounce and are an inch wide — can track a person’s keys, wallets, purse and more. They use the Find My network of iPhones, Macs and iPads rather than cell service. The AirTag’s battery can last for up to a year. How do I know if I’m being tracked by an AirTag? There are tools available to find and disable AirTags, both for iPhones and Android. If you have an iPhone or iPad running iOS/iPadOS 14.5 or later, it keeps track of whether a bluetooth ID is moving from place to place with you. If so, you’ll get a notification that tells you there’s an AirTag moving with you, and — when tapped — provides additional information including how long it’s seen this AirTag and the locations that your device has transmitted associated with the AirTag. What do I do if I find or detect an unknown AirTag or Find My Network accessory? If you detect an unknown AirTag, Find My network accessory, or AirPods, click here to learn about it, find it, and disable it. If you're using an Android device, you can download the Tracker Detect app to find an AirTag or Find My network accessory that's separated from its owner and might be traveling with you. When an AirTag is away from its paired iPhone or iPad for three days, the AirTag will beep when moved. If you find an AirTag after hearing it make a sound, you can use any device that has “near field communication,” a method of wireless data transfer, such as an iPhone or Android phone, to see if its owner marked it as lost and if you can help return it. If you feel that this AirTag or Find My network accessory might be tracking people without their consent, you can get instructions on how to disable it.
