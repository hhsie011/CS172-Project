Preliminary results, Statement of Results, or unofficial photocopies cannot be used to grant credit. Official certificates for exams taken in June are generally issued in October. Learn more about sending official final exam certificates. Once an official copy of the final exam certificate is received by the Office of Admissions, credit will be recorded on your UW student record. To view courses and credits awarded, access your unofficial transcript via MyUW. Please allow 2-4 weeks for exam certificates to be processed and credit posted. A Level and AS Level Policy Overview The UW recognizes A Level/AS Level curriculum as a challenging academic program that provides excellent preparation for university study. In general, 15 quarter credits will be granted for A Level exams with a passing grade and 7.5 quarter credits for AS level exams with a passing grade. A maximum of 45 quarter credits (one year) awarded for A level and AS level exams may be applied towards a UW degree. In some cases credits are awarded with equivalencies for specific UW courses. In other cases credits are awarded that do not have a specific UW course equivalency. See below for further information about UW course designations. No world language credit is awarded when it is the student’s first language. No grades are posted for A Level or AS Level exams. Students who complete two exams with duplicate or overlapping content or who complete an exam and a college course with duplicate or overlapping content will be awarded credit for only one exam or course. Duplicate credit will not be granted in the same subject area for multiple exams such as A Level, AS Level, AP, or IB. Credit awarding policies are reviewed on a regular basis and are subject to change. Students who entered the UW prior to Autumn 2020 can see the previous A Level and AS Level exam credit award schedule.

I&S UW Course Designations “Dept” 1XX Credits awarded in a UW subject area as 1XX instead of a specific course number are not equivalent to a specific course at the UW. The 1XX designation indicates the course is considered a first-year level college course and 2XX indicates a second-year level course. UW 1XX Credits awarded as UW 1XX do not correspond to an academic program at the UW but are still applicable as elective college credit. In these cases, it may be that the exam subject is interdisciplinary in nature or the UW does not have a department in a comparable discipline. When an exam subject is assigned the UW 1XX equivalency, the credits may be used towards graduation requirements as appropriate. Exam subjects not listed Most exam subjects are listed in the table above. Subjects not currently listed will be reviewed on an individual basis. However, college credit is not awarded for vocational or technical subject areas or courses not considered college-level.
