OSU was one of 420 schools on the 2022 list, which chooses schools based on a survey concerning their sustainability-related policies, practices and programs. Universities were rated on a scale of 60-99 and OSU received a 90 based on such factors as transportation alternatives on campus and percentage of college budget spent on local/organic food. The Princeton Review is known for its annual ranking of best colleges and best value colleges. It has been releasing a free Guide to Green Colleges since 2010 for students interested in attending colleges with strong commitments to the environment and sustainability. "Given the sobering indicators of climate change and global calls to prioritize sustainability, we are pleased to shine a light on these schools and recommend them for their exceptional commitment to the environment,” said Rob Franek, editor-in-chief of The Princeton Review. $skip Share Facebook Twitter Pinterest Princeton Review's Guide to Green Collegessustainability Back To Top Back To Top Oklahoma State University Stillwater, OK 74078 Campus & Parking Maps (405) 744-5000 Careers at OSU Hire OSU Grads OSU Institutions Stillwater (Main) Oklahoma City Tulsa Center for Health Sciences (Tulsa) Institute of Technology (Okmulgee) Veterinary Medicine (Stillwater) Follow OSU NewsEventsInside OSU Social Media Directory Facebook Twitter Instagram Linkedin Snapchat OSU Athletics >> © Oklahoma State University.
