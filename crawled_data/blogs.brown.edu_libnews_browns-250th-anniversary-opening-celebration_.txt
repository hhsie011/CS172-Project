For 250 years, Brown University has been presented through a succession of printed views of the campus. The images display the history of Brown’s evolution from a small, Baptist-run college in Rhode Island into an internationally-ranked institute of higher education. The University’s campus has extended far beyond its original boundaries, when University Hall served as classroom, campus center, and dormitory. The prints, photographs, and postcards in this exhibit are from the Brown University Archives and will be on display from March 8th to April 27th. For more information about the images, check out the historical essay on images of the Brown University campus by University Curator Robert Emlen.
