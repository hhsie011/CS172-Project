Since 1994, the Fellowship has grown from 20 Yale students working full-time for eight weeks during the summer to more than 30 Fellows working for up to eleven weeks during the summer in different organizations. The President’s Public Service Fellowship has built a strong reputation with organizations in New Haven, and has created a legacy of current Yale students and recent graduates who have a sophisticated view of community development and remain active in community building in New Haven and in other cities. Over 900 Yale University undergraduate, graduate and professional school students have contributed more than 380,000 hours of community service to New Haven nonprofit and public sector agencies as President’s Public Service Fellows since 1994. Fellowship Selection and Application In the past, Fellows have been selected from a competitive applicant pool of more than 150 students, and in 2021 the Fellowship offered placements to 30 qualified applicants. Students not in their final year of study may apply for placements proposed by New Haven agencies. Student applications and additional information can be found on the Information for Applicants page. Length of Placement, Fellowship Requirements and Compensation For the summer of 2022, placements can be for any consecutive period of eight to eleven weeks between May 31 and August 12,2022.
