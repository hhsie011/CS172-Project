The ones who bleed and have to stitch themselves back together again. I created A #BLM Picture Book as a form of catharsis. It was a labor of love and hope. Many times, I drew the pages through tears and heartache. The thoughts, ideas, and words that have been swirling in my head burst onto these pages.‚Äù On the Anniversary of George Floyd‚Äôs death, we want to share a #BLM picture book created back in 2020 by former Do Good Ambassador Sadia Alao in the wake of George Floyd's death and the BLM protests. Read the full article with Sadia‚Äôs picture book at the link in bio. Congratulations to the Class of 2022 and to all of the Do Good Medallion recipients!
