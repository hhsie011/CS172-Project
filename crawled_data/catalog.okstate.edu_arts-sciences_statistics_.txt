Faculty Statistics is the science of learning from data. It is concerned with the development of theory and with the application of that theory to the collection, analysis, and interpretation of quantitative information. Because statistics is important in many scholarly disciplines, a degree in statistics provides the opportunity to enter not only the statistics profession but also many other fields which make extensive use of statistics. The areas of application include agriculture, the biological sciences, engineering, the physical sciences, the social sciences, education, business, and home economics, among others. Statistics also promises to be important in emerging endeavors such as pollution and environmental research, energy utilization, and health-care administration. Those who pursue the study of statistics should be interested in scientific inquiry and should have a good mathematical background. In addition, it is desirable that they have a genuine interest in some other subject which uses statistics. Careers in government, industry, and education, involving the disciplines previously mentioned, are open to the statistics graduate. In government and industry a statistician usually serves as a researcher or as a consultant to research scientists and decision-makers. In education, of course, the teaching function is added to those of research and consultation. In almost all careers, the statistician uses the computer. The Statistical Laboratory operates within the department to provide statistical consulting to researchers—both faculty and student—across the campus. The Department of Statistics offers the BS and MS degrees to those interested in applications of statistics, and the PhD degree to those who wish to make original contributions to the theory of statistics.

In some instances, it may be advantageous to have an undergraduate degree in another field. However, the student should have acquired a good mathematical background and some statistical background as an undergraduate. Also, each student is required to have completed CS 1113 Computer Science I (A) or to have demonstrated competence in a programming language such as C. This should be equivalent to the required courses in the bachelor's program: Course List Code Title Hours MATH 2144 Calculus I (A) 4 MATH 2153 Calculus II (A) 3 MATH 2163 Calculus III 3 STAT 4013 Statistical Methods I (A) 3 MATH 3013 Linear Algebra (A) 3 MATH 4013 Calculus of Several Variables 3 CS 1113 Computer Science I (A) 3 Students admitted to the program with deficiencies will be required to remedy such deficiencies. MATH 3013 and MATH 4013 are not required for the Master of Science in Applied Statistics. The Master of Science Degree The Master of Science degree in statistics is designed to prepare students for work as a statistician or doctoral studies in statistics. It may be completed by following one of the three plans listed in the "Graduate College" section of the Catalog. Normally, the all-course work plan will be initiated at the suggestion of the faculty. Each student will be required to attain an introductory knowledge of some field of application outside of statistics, mathematics, and computer science. This requirement may be satisfied by having taken a three-hour graduate course in an approved field of statistical application. The Master of Science in Applied Statistics Degree The Master of Science in Applied Statistics (MSAS) degree can be completed with online coursework. It is intended to be a terminal professional master’s degree. It is not intended to be preparation for doctoral work in statistics. Neither comprehensive exams nor a thesis or formal report is required for completion of this degree. A two-hour creative component course is required at the end of the matriculation through the program. More information regarding this degree can be found on the OSU Statistics Department website. The Doctor of Philosophy Degree The PhD requires the completion of 90 hours beyond the BS degree. A maximum of 30 of these credit hours may be earned by research for the dissertation. Each student will be required to attain an introductory knowledge of some field of application which may be satisfied by taking two three-hour graduate courses outside the fields of statistics, mathematics, and computing.
