If you have already submitted your degree application as a PDF via email to the Registrar, there is no need to use this e-form. Any questions about the process outlined below should be directed to your CSA adviser. Degree Application Process You cannot change your legal first or last name on this form. Any changes to your legal first or last name must be made via the Registrar’s “Name Change Affidavit” process. If you want your middle name to appear on your diploma, ensure that it is included on this form in the “Name” field. You may request that your middle name be abbreviated or omitted if you prefer. You will get an email receipt from the Registrar once your application has been received. You will see that your application has been marked as submitted on your SSOL account, under “Degree App Status." You cannot log back on to the degree application to make changes to your form once it is submitted. If you need to make any changes to your submitted application or have further questions, please contact diplomas@columbia.edu. Diplomas If you don’t know yet where you want your diploma to be delivered, you should enter your permanent address now, and you can update your “Diploma Address” on SSOL up to two days before your graduation date. If you do not have access to SSOL, or if you want to change your Diploma Address after your degree has been conferred, please contact diplomas@columbia.edu. Diplomas will take about four weeks from the graduation date for diplomas to be mailed. Please email diplomas@columbia.edu with any additional questions you may have.
