Scheduling of the facilities needs to be as flexible as possible due to the dynamic nature of program design, development and implementation, the need to schedule program meetings on short notice, and the importance of having maximum flexibility in the use of the Polycom technology. Priority is given for programmatic use; however, other groups may use the facility, if available. To schedule, complete the online reservation form.
