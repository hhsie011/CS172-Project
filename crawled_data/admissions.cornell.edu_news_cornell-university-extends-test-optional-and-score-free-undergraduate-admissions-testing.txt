Three of Cornell’s undergraduate colleges—Agriculture and Life Sciences; Architecture, Art, and Planning; and the Cornell SC Johnson College of Business—do not use test scores as part of their admission process. Applicants to Cornell’s four other undergraduate colleges—Arts & Sciences; Engineering; Human Ecology; and the School of Industrial and Labor Relations—have the option to submit SAT and/or ACT scores, although they are not required. In extending the existing policies to the high school graduating classes of 2023 and 2024, Cornell recognizes the continuing risks of COVID-19 transmission during in-person testing around the world. At the same time, the university is entering a two-year period of deliberate experimental review in order to guide admission testing policy requirements beyond these two years. We will engage both in self-study about the role of testing in promoting access and success at Cornell and systematically review admission assessments in partnership with other universities and higher education organizations. The Ivy League has suspended testing requirements for prospective student-athlete applicants for Fall 2022 (current year) and Fall 2023. The League has not yet determined requirements for student-athlete applicants beyond 2023.Cornell will continue to follow the guidance and policies of the Ivy League regarding testing requirements for applicants who expect to participate in a varsity sport.
