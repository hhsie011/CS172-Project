The LGBTQ Identity Center is currently located at the Sarah Doyle Center for Women and Gender (SDC). The Sarah Doyle Center for Women and Gender, established at Brown in 1974, seeks to provide a comfortable yet challenging place for students, faculty, and staff to examine the multitude of issues around gender. Brown is renovating the existing 22 Benevolent Street building for use as a new LGBTQ Identity Center. The project includes a small 275 sf footprint addition, which will act as a connector between 20 and 22 Benevolent Street and will house a new limited use limited application (LULA) style elevator that provides accessibility to both 22 Benevolent Street and the adjacent 20 Benevolent Street and a handicap accessible bathroom. When complete, the building will house offices, meeting spaces, and communal space for the growing Center. This program is in alignment with Brown's strategic plan Building on Distinction: A New Plan for Brown (2013). The project is currently in construction, with expected completion to occur September 2022.
