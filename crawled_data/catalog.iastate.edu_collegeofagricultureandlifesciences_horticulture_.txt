The diversity of interests and need for flexibility are reflected in the impressive array of horticulture courses offered. The Department of Horticulture offers six options within the horticulture major: Greenhouse Plant Production Horticultural Food Crop Production and Management Landscape Design, Installation, and Management Public Horticulture Horticulture Research Turfgrass Management Graduates possess the technical knowledge and skills to become professional horticulturists. They understand principles of life science, plant growth and development, and are familiar with cultural and management practices for a wide assortment of horticultural crops. They are able to work and communicate effectively with fellow horticultural professionals and other citizens who share an interest in horticulture. Graduates also understand the ethical and environmental dimensions of problems and issues facing horticultural professionals. A degree in horticulture opens the door to employment opportunities with production nurseries, seed companies, interior landscaping firms, greenhouses, garden centers, conservatories, landscape design/installation firms, public gardens and arboreta, orchards and vineyards, food processing companies, vegetable farms, fertilizer cooperatives, agricultural chemical companies, golf courses, sports fields, sod production companies, and lawn care businesses. Several allied plant-science industries also provide employment opportunities in the areas of sales, management, and communication. Opportunities exist for careers in research, teaching, extension, and business after obtaining advanced training in graduate school. Student Learning Outcomes Upon graduation, students should be able to: Acquire, integrate, and apply knowledge of plant science to manage systems. Demonstrate interdisciplinary knowledge and competency in managing horticulture systems. Synthesize knowledge and use insight and creativity to better understand and improve plant systems. Appreciate and communicate the diverse impacts of horticulture on people. Demonstrate professionalism and proficiency in skills that relate to horticulture.

Both minors are earned by taking HORT 221 Principles of Horticulture Science plus 12 additional credits with a maximum of 3 credits at the 200-level and a minimum of 9 credits at the 300-level or above. The minor must include at least 9 credits that are not used to meet any other department, college, or university requirement. Horticulture minor The Horticulture minor is a broad-based minor that does not focus within a specific area of horticulture. The 12 additional credits for this minor can be selected from the full list of Horticulture courses. Landscape Management minor The Landscape Management minor focuses on landscape management including plant selection, landscape installation and management, and turfgrass management. The 12 additional credits for this minor can be selected from the following courses: HORT 240 Trees, Shrubs, and Woody Vines for Landscaping, HORT 281 Landscape Graphics, HORT 330 Herbaceous Ornamental Plants, HORT 341 Woody Plant Cultivars: Shade Trees, Ornamental Trees and Woody Shrubs, HORT 342 Landscape Plant Installation, Establishment, and Management, HORT 351 Turfgrass Establishment and Management or HORT 444 Landscape Construction Management. Graduate Study The graduate major in horticulture leads to the M.S. (thesis and non-thesis option) and Ph.D. Some faculty members of the department serve as major professors for students in interdepartmental graduate majors in plant biology; genetics and genomics; molecular, cellular, and developmental biology; ecology and evolutionary biology; sustainable agriculture; and environmental science. Graduates possess a broad understanding of horticulture and the allied plant sciences. They are able to communicate effectively with members of the scientific community, industry groups, and other interested citizens. They are experienced in conducting research and communicating the results from that research. They are capable of addressing and solving complex problems that confront the many horticultural, agricultural, and plant science professions. They also understand the ethical, legal, social, and environmental issues associated with modern agricultural/horticultural practices.
