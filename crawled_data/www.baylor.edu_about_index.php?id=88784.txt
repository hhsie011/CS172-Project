At Baylor, service is integrated into the fabric of campus life, grounded in a Christian understanding of hospitality that motivates humble service to all. This exists within the classroom, where world-class faculty commit themselves to the education of Baylor students. It exists in the Waco community, where students, faculty and staff engage with their local community to impact people's lives. And it exists on the other side of the world, as students work to serve people of all nations as the teachings of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ teach us. Calling oneself a Baylor Bear means confessing membership in a dedicated community of academic excellence and servant leadership. Caring for Students A lot is expected from Baylor students, and the University is eager to provide the support and encouragement they need to reach their potential and make their Baylor experience one to remember. Whether it's adjusting to college life, dealing with personal challenges, or seeking out support to meet increased academic standards, Baylor wants its students to know they do not walk this exciting journey alone.
