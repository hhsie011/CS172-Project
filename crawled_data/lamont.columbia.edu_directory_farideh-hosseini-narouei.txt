Her research primarily focuses in the field of analytical chemistry including electrochemical detection, characterization of nanoparticles and dissolved ions, and the development of sensors/biosensors for environmental and clinical applications. She was the founder of Clarkson University Electrochemical Society Student chapter (CU-ECS), she is a recipient of President’s challenge 2020 best research award at Clarkson University for her novel sensor development, and she was recognized and awarded for her leadership skills several times. During her most recent research, she worked on the electrochemical treatment of landfill leachate and industrial wastewaters for the removal of PFAS, heterocyclic compounds containing nitrogen and heavy metals. Farideh calls herself an electrochemist and analytical chemist interested in developing sensors and treatment methods for environmental applications.
