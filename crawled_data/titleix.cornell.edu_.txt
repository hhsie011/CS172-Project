Due to the hybrid work model, we encourage you to make an appointment in advance. We are happy to accommodate in person or remote appointments or training requests. We ask that anyone experiencing symptoms, recently exposed to someone with COVID-19, and/or awaiting test results make a remote appointment. We continue to work hard to ensure the safety of our community and minimize the risk of COVID-19 exposure within the office. Consistent with the communication that went out to the Cornell community on March 11, 2022 regarding changes to the University’s masking requirements, masks are no longer required in our suite. The choice to continue masking, even when not required, is a personal one, and no one should be made to feel uncomfortable because of their choice. If you have any questions, contact us at titleix@cornell.edu (for sexual harassment or other sexual misconduct) or equity@cornell.edu (for other protected-status harassment, prohibited discrimination or bias), and/or visit titleix.cornell.edu. U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights Q&A On July 20, 2021, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights released “Questions and Answers on the Title IX Regulations on Sexual Harassment.” This document provides information related to the regulations issued in May of 2020 that specify how institutions must respond to allegations of sexual harassment consistent with Title IX’s prohibition against sex discrimination. The Office of Institutional Equity and Title IX is carefully reviewing this information.
