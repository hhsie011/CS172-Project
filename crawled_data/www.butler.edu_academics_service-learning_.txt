Service-learning offers an eye-opening way of viewing service, through personal interactions with the community and reflective class-based discussion. Ultimately, these experiences will enhance your ability to “make a difference in the world.” You will learn about your strengths and develop capacities for interpersonal relationships and empathy—capacities essential for a meaningful life and successful career. Students report statistically significant learning gains from service-learning in their capacity to work with others across differences, and their commitment to ongoing involvement as community actors.
