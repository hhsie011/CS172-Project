The department currently has 14 faculty. The department is the strongest and largest of the civil engineering departments in a public institution in the western Tennessee area, and is experiencing additional growth. We are also thrilled that you are interested in majoring in civil engineering. We offer a strong undergraduate program in Civil Engineering, which is accredited by ABET (Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology). Our passing rate of Fundamental of Engineering (FE) was 90% in Fall 2019 and 100% in Spring 2020. Our classes are taught primarily by full-time faculty. While the University of Memphis is a large urban campus, the Department of Civil Engineering has been able to maintain smaller class sizes. This means that not only will the faculty know you by name, but you will easily be able to interact and make friends with your peers. We believe this gives you the best of both worlds - a large university experience as well as a closer-knit community within civil engineering. The Herff College of Engineering provides a unique Engineering Residential College experience designed to promote a living and learning together atmosphere. In addition, supplemental instruction for students in engineering-designated sections of math and free tutoring sessions are available to help students transition successfully to engineering courses. Civil Engineers are responsible for the health, safety, and welfare of the public. Demand for Civil Engineers has always been steady. A Bureau of Labor Statistics report projects that employment for civil engineers is expected to grow by 11 percent, which is faster than the average growth projected for the overall engineering profession, due to population growth and the related need to improve the Nation’s infrastructure. A report published by CNNMoney.com ranks careers in environmental engineering and civil engineering 5th and 6th, respectively, out of the top 100 careers. In addition, the report projects 31% growth in environmental engineering jobs and 24% growth in civil engineering jobs. The University of Memphis is located in the beautiful part of Memphis with an assortment of cultures and entertainment activities. Should you choose to make the University of Memphis your home, there are so many ways to get involved in our department, even as a freshman - from joining one of our student organizations like the American Society of Civil Engineers and Earthquake Engineering Research Institute (EERI) to getting engaged in research, to becoming part of the STEM Ambassador program that works to encourage K-12 students to pursue STEM majors and careers. Being located in a large metroplotian area, students find internship and engineering summer jobs easily, which help them financially and provide them with practical experience. We want you to know that we are proud that you are considering our program, and we hope that you decide to join us. We would love for you to become part of our Tiger family!
