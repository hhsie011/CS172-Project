Different than study or work abroad programs, the International Plan develops in-depth competency and the ability to function effectively in multi-national work environments. International Plan work is integrated into the student’s program of study, can be completed within the normal 4-year time frame, and is recognized on the transcript and diploma by the designation "International Plan." The plan entails globally focused coursework, international experience, second language proficiency, and a capstone course in the student’s major.
