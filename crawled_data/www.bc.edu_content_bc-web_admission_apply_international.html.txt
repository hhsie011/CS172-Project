Boston College's 9,445 undergraduates come from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, leading to a vibrant and enriching campus atmosphere. A student is considered an international applicant if he or she is not a U.S. citizen or U.S. permanent resident. With the few exceptions listed below, international students must submit the same application credentials as other first-year or transfer students. Standardized Test Scores & English Proficiency Exams Boston College has adopted a test-optional policy for first-year applicants to the Classes of 2027. This policy does not include English proficiency examinations. Learn more here. In addition to submitting ACT or SAT scores, Boston College requires that non-U.S. citizens submit TOEFL (CEEB Code: 3083), IELTS, or Duolingo English Test examination scores. TOEFL ITP Plus, TOEFL iBT Home Edition, TOEFL Essentials, and IELTS Indicator will not be accepted. If you do not have access to a testing center, please register for the Duolingo English Test. Please note that Boston College does not superscore English proficiency exams and TOEFL MyBest Score reports are not considered in the evaluation process. The English proficiency requirement can be waived if an applicant meets at least one of the following three options: English is your native language; You have attended a U.S. high school or another majority native English speaking country for at least three years, and you are enrolled in a traditional academic curriculum without ESOL coursework; or You score 650 or above on the SAT EBRW or 29 or better on the ACT English section.

Financial Aid Boston College is unable to provide need-based financial aid to students who are not U.S. citizens or U.S. permanent residents. Therefore, international students should be prepared to finance the full cost of their Boston College education. Once admitted, international students will receive a link to the Boston College Certification of Finances form. This form will outline the costs of attending Boston College for the upcoming year. I-20 forms will not be mailed to admitted students until they have verified that they can fully meet the financial obligations outlined in the Certification of Finances. Boston College only accepts the Certification of Finances form for admitted international students. Therefore, applicants who have not yet received an admission decision should not send this form. All international students who do hold U.S. citizenship or a Green Card are fully eligible to receive financial aid.
