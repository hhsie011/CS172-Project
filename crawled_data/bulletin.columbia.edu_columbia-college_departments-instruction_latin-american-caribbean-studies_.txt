Victoria Murillo, 832 International Affairs Building; mm2140@columbia.edu Senior Manager of Business & Student Affairs: Eliza Kwon-Ahn, 827 International Affairs Building; ek2159@columbia.edu The major in Latin American and Caribbean Studies stresses knowledge of a dynamic, historically deep and extensive region, but it also focuses on social, political, and cultural phenomena that transcend physical boundaries. The major thus reflects multidisciplinary dialogues that are transnational yet remain anchored in the common historical experience of Latin American societies. Thanks to the broad range of courses on Latin America offered in different departments of instruction and centers at Columbia, the major provides a multidisciplinary training on politics, history, culture, economy and society. The Institute of Latin American Studies coordinates the major and offers access to research support, study abroad options, and linkages and credits toward the M.A. program in Latin American and Caribbean studies.
