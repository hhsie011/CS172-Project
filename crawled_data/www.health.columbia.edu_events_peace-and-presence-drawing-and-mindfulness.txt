The program envisions a space where survivors feel held, understood without having to explain themselves, and given space to breathe and connect with one another in profoundly spiritual and experiential ways. Through its multi-faceted approach to mindfulness, movement and nurturing of one’s body, this program hopes to aid survivors to recognize and cherish their innate capacity to transcend trauma while being connected to a caring community of allies. The Drawing & Language workshop will be focused on creating a Circle of Protection, which beckons a safe sense of one's own boundaries through self-created imagery. Weaving language into one's mandala-like drawing, the workshop emphasis will be on creating a sense of wholeness within the container of one's being.    Poetry, music, body awareness and expressive ideas will be brought into the workshop, as points of inspiration and reliable healing properties, which one can call upon for ongoing healing. For this workshop we invite participants to gather paper and anything else they would like to draw with before class (i.e. pens, pencils, markers, crayons, or paint).  To Register for This Event Please Visit: https://columbiahealth.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_aPXUPHIFTOCaZgYdNXS3gw Columbia University makes every effort to accommodate individuals with disabilities.
