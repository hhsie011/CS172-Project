With funds raised through its annual campaign, CCS makes grants to local nonprofit organizations focused on education, food and emergency services, eldercare, the arts, and the environment and parks. Because the three schools cover all administrative expenses, 100% of funds raised are distributed through grants. CCS also facilitates in kind contributions, volunteer opportunities, and workshops that connect the University community to local nonprofits.
