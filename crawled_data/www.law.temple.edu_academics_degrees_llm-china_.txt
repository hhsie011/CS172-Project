Beasley Professor of Law Shen Weixing, Dean, Tsinghua University School of Law Thank you for your interest in the Temple-Tsinghua Master of Laws (LL.M.) program in Beijing, the first accredited foreign law degree program in China. Temple established this program in 1998 as part of the rule-of-law initiatives launched by Presidents Jiang Zemin and Bill Clinton. To date, nearly 800 students have graduated from this program. The friendship between Temple and China dates back to 1979, when Temple bestowed an Honorary Doctor of Laws degree upon Deng Xiaoping. Since then, Temple has built enduring bonds of cooperation with the Chinese government and universities, especially Tsinghua University. The Temple-Tsinghua LL.M. program is the most renowned cooperative legal education program in China, having been recognized by both the U.S. and Chinese governments. The U.S. Senate stated that Temple “has succeeded in furthering the goal of promoting collaborative legal exchanges between the United States and China.” Similarly, President Jiang Zemin noted the program’s “lofty mission in educating qualified legal professionals in China.” Show more > Students benefit from systematic study of U.S. law as well as a diverse classroom environment with students from the public and private sectors.
