GLACIER Tax Compliance System GLACIER is a secure web-based tax compliance system Temple University uses to gather all pertinent information regarding payments made to foreign nationals. The system helps determine tax residency status, withholding tax rates and tax treaty eligibility for the foreign individual. If required, during the new employee onboarding process the employees will receive instructions on how access and enter the required information into the system. For a nonemployee foreign national receiving a payment from the university, contact Accounts Payable for instructions and next step(s). For additional information on taxation of a foreign national, please refer to the IRS section for International Taxpayers.
