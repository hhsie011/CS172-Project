Our Course Reserves program either allows faculty members to loan books from their personal collection to the library for student use, or to request that the library pull books from its own collection to set aside for a specific course or program. Comparatively, the McFarlin Textbook Reserve program purchases required textbooks over $100 for all undergraduate classes so that students have equal and reliable access to course materials while on-campus. Students Looking for something that your instructor has put on reserve? Search the library's Course Reserves List. You can search by course number or the instructor's last name. If you know the exact title of the book, you can search for it in the Library Catalog. Textbook Reserves List Please note that this does not include every required text for every course. More information about the textbook reserves program can be found on the policy page. Faculty Do you need to put something on Course Reserves?
