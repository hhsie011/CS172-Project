Adobe Creative Cloud Subscriptions to the Adobe Creative Cloud normally cost $50 per month, but you have access to all 20+ creative desktop and mobile apps as a part of the University‚Äôs IT fee. A subscription includes 32 Adobe applications, Photoshop, InDesign, Premiere Pro, After Effects, Lightroom and more. The Creative Cloud Library also lets you sync assets (like colors, brushes and images) between devices. You have access to two licenses, which means you can have one instance on your professional machine and one on your personal machine. Sign in to adobe.com using your @clemson.edu email address to get started. Microsoft Office 365 You also have complete access to Office 365 from Microsoft. You probably know about Word, Excel and PowerPoint, but have you made a survey in Forms? Automated a task or process in Flow? Organized a group in Teams? You can do all that and a lot more in Office 365, which also includes storage in OneDrive. Work on the same project from any device, all in the cloud. Current full-time employees at Clemson may install available software on personally owned machines for work-related purposes. Get started at 365.clemson.edu. Virtual Private Network CCIT offers a Virtual Private Network (VPN) that maintains a secure, private connection to the Clemson network from anywhere in the world. Connect to the VPN if you need access to the Clemson network for certain software while working at home, or if you need to send sensitive data from public wifi (like buying something online while you‚Äôre at a coffee shop or airport). You can connect to the VPN with your Clemson credentials from any of your devices, including your phone or tablet, with Cisco Anyconnect. Visit our Knowledge Base to learn more and get started. Cloud Storage Along with OneDrive, you have cloud storage options with Box and Google Drive. Box is great for sharing documents among a group or keeping research data safe, while Google Drive integrates with a Google environment across the web. All three are fantastic options that offer syncing services to automatically back up your data, which you should do regularly (be sure to only choose one sync option, though). Survey Tools In addition to Google Forms and Microsoft Forms, you also have access to Qualtrics, one of the most powerful survey tools on the planet. Thorough support documentation and walkthrough wizards help make creating surveys in Qualtrics easy, too. Read more on our Qualtrics page. Training Percipio provides free professional development opportunities for faculty, staff and students. Choose from a wide range of courses, audiobooks, certifications and more. Get started at clemson.percipio.com. Software You have a whole host of free and discounted software options at your fingertips.
