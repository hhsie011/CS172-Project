Throughout the spring semester, students visited various museums, performances, cultural sites, and met with a variety of Houston-based artists. Through these interactions students developed a creative writing practice to respond and contribute to the city’s ever-broadening artistic identity. This event will showcase their interdisciplinary work through a reading and exhibition of original writing and artwork.
