COVID-19 Dashboard, Spring Semester 2022 Daily Reporting, Quarantine, and Isolation FAQs Frequently Asked Questions Health & Safety Butler Employees Face Mask Policy FAQs Well-Being Support Vaccination Requirement FAQs “This new reality invites some large questions about how we engage with community, how we find meaning and purpose in virtual worlds, how we serve others without being in contact, how we balance realism with optimism, and how we adapt to change.” —Daniel Meyers, Director, Center for Faith and Vocation Visit BU Be Well Mental Health Resources Latest Updates 2/26/22—Given the rapid decline of COVID-19 cases, Butler University is making face masks optional across campus, including classrooms, dining areas, and residence halls, effective Wednesday, March 2. Some faculty members may continue to require face masks in their classrooms. 1/21/22—Butler University will host a third COVID-19 vaccination booster clinic Wednesday, February 2 from 11:00 AM–5:00 PM in the Health and Recreation complex (HRC) lobby. You can schedule an appointment for your vaccination booster shot via our registration website. Appointments are limited and expected to be filled very quickly. Please remember to bring your immunization card with you to your appointment. 1/10/22—Due to the national shortage of COVID-19 test kits, Butler University is suspending surveillance testing of unvaccinated students until further notice. Students who are experiencing symptoms consistent with COVID-19 can seek testing at the Health and Recreation Complex, while supplies last. 1/4/22—Butler University will resume in-classroom instruction January 10, 2022, as scheduled. In light of the recent surge in COVID-19 cases, masks will be required indoors for students, faculty, and staff except in dorm rooms and personal offices. Per the latest CDC guidance, people infected with COVID-19 can end their isolation period after five days if they are asymptomatic or if their symptoms are resolving (without fever for 24 hours) and should take precautions such as wearing a mask on days 6-10. Students, faculty, and staff who experience symptoms and/or test positive for COVID-19 are still required to complete the Health Reporting Form. Weekly testing of unvaccinated students (as well as ongoing testing of symptomatic students) will continue through the end of the spring semester. While booster shots are not required, we encourage all eligible students, faculty, and staff to get booster shots and send a copy of their immunization card to Health Services. 10/29/21—Effective immediately, masks will no longer be required in Hinkle Fieldhouse and Butler Arts and Events Center facilities, unless required by the performing artist. Beginning January 3, 2022, masks will be optional in all non-classroom facilities on campus. Masks will continue to be required in classrooms until further notice. 8/6/21—Effective Monday, August 9, all students, faculty, staff, and visitors (regardless of vaccination status) will be required to wear masks indoors when in classrooms, hallways, and common areas. This temporary policy is being implemented as a response to the surge in positive COVID-19 cases attributed to the Delta variant, and will be reviewed weekly. Butler intends to lift this requirement when the current surge in positive cases subsides. 6/21/21—Butler University is announcing today that the COVID-19 vaccine is required for all students, faculty, and staff. Read President Danko’s message and learn more about the COVID-19 vaccination requirement. This is a complex and fluid situation that continues to evolve rapidly.
