Keep in mind that credit evaluations will only take place after the student has been admitted to the University. Once all the required documentation has been submitted and processed, admitted students will be able to view a detailed transfer credit evaluation with any possible UM course equivalencies in their applicant portal. Please carefully read the First-Year and Transfer Credit Information sections below to learn more about our transfer of credit policies. Open All Tabs Credit Information: First-Year The University of Miami allows students to receive college credit hour toward graduation from the following programs: Advanced Placement (AP) International Baccalaureate (IB) General Certificate of Education (GCE) Cambridge Pre-U Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination (CAPE) Unit College Level Examination Program (CLEP) Dual Enrollment In order to have credit hours evaluated for work that you have already completed through any of these programs, you are required to first submit all official test result reports and/or official college transcripts to the Office of Undergraduate Admission no later than by the end of the first semester of enrollment for review. Documents submitted after this time period will not be reviewed and credit hours will not be awarded. Once all the required documentation has been submitted and processed, admitted students will be able to view a detailed transfer credit evaluation with any possible UM course equivalencies in the applicant portal. The University will accept no more than 60 credit hours from these programs to count toward the 120 credit hours required for graduation. Credit Information: Transfer Transfer admission may be granted in most fields of study to students who have earned credit hours from other regionally accredited colleges or universities. The University of Miami suggests that students follow a general liberal arts curriculum. Students at two-year colleges are encouraged to follow the Associate of Arts path. At UM, the transfer of credits is a two-part process: 1. After the student has been admitted Transcripts are reviewed on a course-by-course basis. The student will receive a detailed transfer credit evaluation with any possible UM course equivalencies. 2. After arriving on campus Students will meet with their academic advisors or departmental deans. Advisors will determine how the transferable credits satisfy degree requirements and approve the course equivalencies. Credits that will not be accepted Credits taken at an institution that is not regionally accredited Courses with a Grade Lower than C Physical Education, Professional, or Technical Courses The following credits completed through a Two-Year College: Study Abroad, Independent Study or Internships Courses that have grades of C- or lower will not transfer; however, these grades will still be used to compute an admission grade point average. English composition, math, foreign language, psychology, sociology, criminal justice, and history courses that are taken online will need approval from the UM department chair in order to award credits. Required Credit Hours in Residence at the University of Miami A student transferring credit hours from a 2-year community or junior college (this being the last school attended) must complete a minimum of 56 credit hours in residence at the University of Miami to earn an undergraduate degree.
