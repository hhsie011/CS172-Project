Having an updated hierarchy is critical for systems and functions such as the performance development, salary increase and time management. Managers and department administrators are strongly encouraged to use the hierarchy system frequently to verify their hierarchies and employee distribution(s). Below are the organizational hierarchy systems and their associated documentations. Organizational Chart The organizational chart, or OrgChart, provides a method of readily verifying reporting relationships, position titles and department assignments, and helps ensure an up-to-date hierarchy. It also provides planning tools producing illustrative renderings of results for tasks that involve reorganizations, change management and expansion/contraction of workforce. Access to OrgChart To use this application, the user must install Microsoft Silverlight on their computer. Access to this application is by request only. For information about obtaining access to this application or any other hierarchy-related questions, email orgchart@temple.edu. OrgChart website. Using OrgChart To assist you with using OrgChart, we put together a reference manual for your convenience. It is a comprehensive manual that covers how to use the application. Organizational Hierarchy The organizational hierarchy website serves as a quick reference to view an employee’s reporting structure. To access the site, log in to the organizational hierarchy website using your AccessNet credentials. Updates/Changes Updating and/or changing an employee's reporting detail shown in the organizational hierarchy is done via EPAF in TUportal. To make an update and/or change an employee's organizational hierarchy, refer to this instructional video. Access to EPAF To request access to EPAF, you will need to complete the Administrative Systems Access (ASA) application.
