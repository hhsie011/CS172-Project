These changes create an emerging global environment where globally oriented agriculturalists can play a significant role. This increased leadership responsibility in the international marketplace necessitates that agriculturalists broaden their knowledge and understanding about how agricultural practices and policies influence global dynamics. To assist undergraduate students in preparing for these new positions of leadership, the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences offers a curriculum in International Agriculture Program. This is an interdisciplinary undergraduate program designed to provide future leaders with an opportunity to pursue a secondary major or minor in international agriculture. The flexibility of the International Agriculture Program allows students to individualize their learning experiences by focusing their coursework on the global aspects of their primary major. Students in this program can study subject matter in international economics, food security, crop diversity, soil fertility, seed science, sustainable development, or cultural relations. To broaden students' applied global knowledge, the program incorporates a combination of interdisciplinary coursework, internships, and study abroad experiences. Program participants have the opportunity to improve their knowledge of international agriculture while learning to apply their knowledge and skills outside the classroom. Practical insight gained by participation in the International Agriculture Program can improve a student's career placement opportunities by involving them with international activities and agencies that can assist them with developing their personal skills and networks. These experiences combine to refine a participant's critical thinking and problem-solving skills as well as enhance understanding of the analysis and management of global agriculture issues at home and abroad.
