Experimenting first with intaglio and later with woodcut techniques, Amenoff produced two distinct projects each with its own formal and emotional sensibilities. Ink drawings of the Chianti region in Tuscany inspired the moody, atmospheric landscapes of Amenoff’s etchings, bringing to mind the tonalist work of Albert Pinkham Ryder and Ralph Albert Blakelock. These lie in stark contrast to the vibrant, geometric woodcuts he made fourteen years later during a second residency at the Neiman Center. Amenoff is Professor of Painting at Columbia University and has taught at Yale University, the Rhode Island School of Design and the School of the Visual Arts. He is the recipient of numerous awards from organizations including the American Academy of Arts and Letters, National Endowment for the Arts, Tiffany Foundation and is the recipient of the 2011 John Solomon Guggenheim Fellowship. He has shown widely in museums and galleries throughout the United States and Europe and his work is in the permanent collection of more than 30 museums including the Whitney Museum of American Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art and Museum of Modern Art in New York.
