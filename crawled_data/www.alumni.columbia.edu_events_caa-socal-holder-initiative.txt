Integral to that conversation, of course, is the historical context and current state of voting rights in the United States. For this installment of the American Voter Project series, the Eric H. Holder Jr. Initiative for Civil and Political Rights invites you to join us for a panel discussion on the past, present, and future of voting rights in the US. Panelists* Eric H. Holder Jr. '73CC, '76LAW, 82nd Attorney General of the United States Heather Gerken, Dean and Sol & Lillian Goldman Professor of Law, Yale Law School Desmond Meade, President and Executive Director, Florida Rights Restoration Coalition (FRRC) Michael Waldman '82CC, President, Brennan Center for Justice Moderated by Jelani Cobb, Ira A.
