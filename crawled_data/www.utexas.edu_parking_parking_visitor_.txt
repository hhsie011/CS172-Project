Parents, friends of the university, official visitors, conference attendees, and vendors are all vital to the function of the schools, facilities, and services. There is no free visitor parking on the main campus (aside from loading zone parking). Visitors are advised to park in university parking garages. No permit is required to park in the garages; just pull a ticket on your way in and process it at the exit, a paystation, or the garage office before you leave. Fees are calculated based on the amount of time you are in the garage. Garage daily parking offers the closest, most convenient spaces to all areas of the university for visitors. All surface parking lots as well as street parking require permits specific to the area from 7:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m., Monday through Friday. Outside of these hours, most spaces require any university permit with limited spaces open for parking without a permit. Caution: Read signs carefully. Each surface parking lot is signed at the entrance and further restrictions are usually designated within the lot. Visitors to Pickle Research Campus are advised to make arrangements with the department with which they have business prior to their visit. All visitors are required to follow the university's Parking & Traffic Regulations if they are bringing a car onto campus.
