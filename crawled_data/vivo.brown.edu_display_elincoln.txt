Full Text Research Research Overview I am interested in the networks formed by communities of readers (including artists, printers and patrons) that go beyond the usual social markers, demonstrating areas where boundaries of class, education or religious identity are penetrated by interaction with printed books and images. To this end I am interested in investigating Roman printing and knowledge networks in the early modern period through the creation and use of a digital platform for the identification of contributors and the responsibilites of those involved in Roman printing at that time. I am also writing about color in Renaissance art and theories of vision. Research Statement My interest in the history of printmaking and book illustration has led me into the larger visual, literary and scientific cultures of early modern Italy, and the roles and creation of imagery in other media. The Invention of the Italian Renaissance Printmaker (Yale UP, 2000) discusses the history of the technology and uses of printing in the formation of artist's careers in late 15th- and early 16th-century Italy, seeking to identify the roots of a common literacy in disegno, which was judged to be the basis of all artistic practice. By investigating the value of disegno in fields other than the fine arts, this book points out how modes of drawing that were developed in other trades and under different circumstances were brought to bear on the mythological, technical and religious imagery of Italian Renaissance prints in the first hundred years of printing. Subsequent research has focused on the roles of book illustration and literacy in vernacular scientific and religious treatises printed in 16th- and 17th-century Italy, particularly in Rome. In a series of articles and a book, "Brilliant Discourse: Pictures and Readers in Early Modern Rome" (Yale UP, 2014), I explore the role of illustrations in creating authorial credit and claims for particular knowledge among a newly created community of authors, publishers, printers and their patrons. New notions of intellectual property and self-consciousness about the status of authorship, the development of printing, image-making and publishing conventions for the attribution of authorship in the face of Church censorship, the stated and covert relationships between objectivity and observation, the representation of truth claims in pictures and text, the creation of an authorial voice and the rise of professionalism in the arts in the early modern period (1400-1800) are all part of my more recent work.

I am also a member of the Committee on Science and Technology Studies. My thematic graduate and undergraduate seminars take up topics in the history of the book and print culture in the early modern period, often taught in the special collections libraries at Brown. I also teach graduate and undergraduate seminars in Italian art and visual culture in the Departments of the History of Art & Architecture and Italian Studies, as well as the graduate Methods seminar, and Graduate Practicum in the History of Art. I have directed Honors Theses on diverse subjects: the history of an atlas at the John Carter Brown Library, women in Renaissance art, patron saints, Flemish portraiture, Mannerism, Piranesi, and garden automata, among others. Graduate dissertations I have directed tend to be interdisciplinary in the fields of the history of collecting, history of science, anthropology and ritual, gender studies, and print culture, primarily centered in early modern Italy, but also in France and Portugal.
