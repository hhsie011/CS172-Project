Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute is deeply committed to the training of future generations of neuroscientists through our graduate fellowships and interdisciplinary scholar awards for postdocs. Through everything we do, we are bringing together brilliant people from diverse disciplines to tackle the unanswered questions in neuroscience. POSTDOCS Interdisciplinary Scholar Awards The Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute Interdisciplinary Scholar Awards provide funding to extraordinary postdoctoral scientists at Stanford University engaging in highly interdisciplinary research in the neurosciences. Learn More GRADUATE STUDENTS Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellowships Stanford Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellowships affiliated with Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute provide current graduate students, whose research interests are in the interdisciplinary neurosciences, with three years of funding support. The Institute plans to grow our Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellowships Program to a total of 30 fellows over time. Learn More NeuroTech Graduate Training Program The new NeuroTech graduate training program immerses PhD students from technical departments into neuroscience. The trainees bringing emerging technologies to advance neuroscience discovery and human health. Learn More Mind, Brain, Computation and Technology Graduate Training Program The Center for Mind, Brain, Computation and Technology’s graduate training program believes that contemporary neuroscience research requires the integration of experimental and technical methods. We support young scientists from empirical, technical, or theoretical backgrounds as they stretch beyond their primary discipline to learn complimentary approaches from another field, advancing their research and developing them into leaders and innovators in neuroscience. Learn More GRAD STUDENTS AND POSTDOCS Pathways to Neurosciences The Pathways to Neurosciences progam serves late-stage graduate students and early-stage postdoctoral fellows who identify as being from an underrepresented group in neuroscience, with the aim of fostering belonging, excellence, and leadership. Learn More Sammy Kuo Awards in Neuroscience In memory of Sammy Kuo, these awards are presented to the graduate student and postdoc authors of the best neuroscience papers published each year. Learn More UNDERGRADS Neuroscience Undergraduate Research Opportunity (NeURO) Fellowships The Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute's Neuroscience Undergraduate Research Opportunity (NeURO) fellowship program immerses undergraduates into the world of neuroscience research. NeURO fellows will learn research skills, explore neuroscience topics and conduct summer neuroscience research in a Stanford lab. Learn more HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS Stanford Institutes of Medicine Summer Research Program The Neurosciences Institute is one of the proud supporters of the Stanford Institutes of Medicine Summer Research Program. SIMR is an eight-week program in which high school students from diverse backgrounds are invited to perform basic research with Stanford faculty, postdoctoral fellows, students and researchers on a medically-oriented project.
