Application Process International Application Process Counselor Information Veterans Clemson Home Admissions Undergraduate Admissions Current: Undergraduate Admissions Appeal Process Appeal Your Admission Decision Each year, Clemson University receives more applications for undergraduate admission than there are spots available. The admissions process is competitive and academically selective, so all applicants cannot be granted admission. The Office of Admissions takes great care in the consideration of our applicants, and successful appeals are rare. However, applicants with new and compelling information that were denied undergraduate admission to Clemson University may submit an appeal to be considered for admission again. Before submitting an appeal, please note the following: We strongly encourage students to wait to submit the Appeal Form until they have all supporting documentation ready to submit along with the form. Once the form is submitted, it will be forwarded to the Appeal Committee based on the calendar below. Therefore, all supporting documentation must be received by the submission deadlines on the calendar. Students who are placed on the waitlist are not eligible for appeal until a decision is made on their application. If a student on the waitlist is denied admission and has new and compelling information, an appeal would then be considered. Students who are offered admission through the Summer Start program are not eligible for appeal because this decision is considered an admission to Clemson. Personal interviews with the Appeals Committee are not permitted. Meeting with the admissions staff will not affect the outcome of an appeal. Admissions does not allow for second appeals. If your appeal is denied, you may not appeal the decision a second time. Do not submit a second application for Summer and/or Fall admission. How to Submit an Appeal Appeals will be accepted beginning on February 21, 2022. Fill out the Clemson University Admissions Appeal Form. Please use the same email and password that you use to access your Applicant Portal. In order to submit the Appeal Form, you will be required to upload a current high school or college transcript, or degree progress report (unofficial copies are acceptable). You are also encouraged to upload additional supporting documentation with the form. (Please view the Appeal Information below.) If you need to submit additional supporting documentation after submitting the Appeal Form, please send to appeal@admission.clemson.edu. *Note: Once the Appeal Form is submitted, it will be forwarded to the Appeal Committee based on the calendar below. For example, if you submit the form before or on March 4, your appeal will be moved forward to the Committee on March 4. Any supporting documentation we have received for your file by March 4 will also be forwarded, but anything sent after the deadline will not be included. This applies to all submission deadlines on the calendar. Appeals Calendar Appeals will be accepted beginning on February 21, 2022. Submission Deadline (appeal form and supporting documentation) Notification Date March 4, 2022 Week of March 27 March 25, 2022 Week of April 10 April 15, 2022 Week of May 1 May 6, 2022 Week of May 22 May 27, 2022 Week of June 12 June 10, 2022 Week of June 26 Appeal Information for Incoming First-Year Students If you are an incoming first-year student, you must provide an updated high school transcript showing improved academic performance and are encouraged to also submit one or more of the following: Improved SAT or ACT scores (unofficial copies accepted). One to three letters of recommendation. Supporting documentation for situations that are outside of the student’s control. If you have been admitted to other universities and are considering waiting on an appeal decision from Clemson before accepting another offer, we recommend being prepared to pursue alternative educational plans. The Office of Admissions takes great care in the consideration of our applicants, and successful appeals are rare. Since there is no guarantee that an appeal decision will offer admission to Clemson, students should consider a backup plan should your appeal be denied or sustained. Appeal Information for Transfer Students If you are a transfer student, you must provide an updated college transcript that shows at least 30 hours of transferable credit and a minimum 2.5 cumulative GPA and are encouraged to also submit one or more of the following: Supporting documentation of situations that are outside of the student’s control. One to three letters of recommendation.
