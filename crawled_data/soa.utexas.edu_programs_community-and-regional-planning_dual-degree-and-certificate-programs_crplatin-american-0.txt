The program leads to the simultaneous award of the Master of Arts in Latin American Studies and the Master of Science in Community and Regional Planning. Students learn the fundamental technical and conceptual skills necessary to effectively address planning issues while also studying the cultural, socioeconomic, and geographic challenges and opportunities characteristic of the region. LLILAS affords students the opportunity to research many facets of the contemporary Latin American situation through its interdisciplinary approach to the study of the region. The program combines study in the fields of anthropology, economics, geography, government, and sociology as well as community and regional planning. CRP provides students with the skills necessary for working in community and regional development in Latin America, whether through the public, private, or nonprofit sector, and to address the urbanization and development issues at the forefront of contemporary policy concerns in Latin America. The dual degree program offers research, internship, and service learning opportunities in Latin America through CRP and LLILAS coursework, formal programs, and informal engagements with faculty projects. Program Structure The dual degree program is structured so that students admitted can earn a Master of Arts in Latin American Studies and a Master of Science in Community and Regional Planning degree simultaneously in three academic years. It is recognized, however, that some students may find it necessary to enroll for an additional semester or summer session in order to complete all requirements of the joint program. A student must apply for admission to both the dual degree program in CRP and Latin American Studies (Dual Degree Code 6-59801). A student currently enrolled in Latin American Studies program or the CRP program may apply for admission to the dual degree program. If a student is not admitted to the dual degree program, he or she may be offered admission to the MA program in Latin American Studies (Degree Code 6-59800) or the MSCRP program (Degree Code 6-25400). All course requirements of both programs must be met, except that each school retains the option to waive or replace any of its required courses with the approval of the dual degree coordinators, Graduate Advisers, and appropriate graduate faculty. The student will write a professional report or master's thesis during the third year of the joint program. The report will be supervised by a minimum of two faculty members, one from each program. One faculty member will serve as Chair and the second as Reader. Course Requirements Students must complete 30 credit-hours in community and regional planning, either 30 or 33 credit hours in Latin American studies, depending on the plan selected (Plan A or B), and 6 hours of elective CRP courses with Latin American content approved by the dual degree program advisers for a 66-69 credit-hour total. Students may elect to write a thesis or professional report. The thesis or report must be read and approved by a supervising professor and a second reader. The supervising professor may be chosen from CRP or Latin American Studies. One reader must represent Latin American Studies and the other will represent Community and Regional Planning. The Latin American studies language requirement must be met during the first semester in the program. Language Requirements for MA Students [PDF, 31k] Community and Regional Planning Students in the Community and Regional Planning Program must complete a minimum of 24 semester hours of core courses. Students may petition instructor to complete a different course that satisfies the core requirements. They must also complete a minimum of 6 credit hours of electives, including internship TOTAL: 30 credit hours Latin American Studies Students may choose one of several Concentrations and either a Thesis or Report option: Plan A: Thesis Option 15 hours with Latin American content from the major discipline 9 hours with Latin American content from the minor discipline 6 hour thesis (LAS 698A and LAS 698B) in the major field on a Latin American/CRP topic TOTAL: 30 hours Plan B: Professional Report Option 30 hours of LAS coursework selected from three disciplines (no fewer than 6 hours must be taken in each discipline) 3 hour report (LAS 398R) on a Latin American/CRP topic taken in the last semester of study TOTAL: 33 hours Dual Program Students must complete a minimum of 6 credit hours of CRP electives with Latin American content approved by the dual program advisers.
