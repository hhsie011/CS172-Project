Students ordinarily pursue those objectives by taking advanced courses, participating in organized and informal seminars, and carrying out and reporting on research projects in their major subject. Students normally conduct research during the summer and receive financial support for this purpose. With the consent of the Special Committee, a student may elect one or two minors from the above list or from another field. Entering students are required to register with the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at the beginning of their first term. They consult with the Director of Graduate Studies and with their temporary Special Committee. Proficiency tests in inorganic, organic, and physical chemistry are required of all entering Ph.D. degree candidates. These tests are given a few days before registration for the fall term. Results are used to help the Special Committee plan the student's program. Remedial course work may be required of students with poor test scores. Students majoring in organic or bio-organic chemistry must prepare and defend an original research proposal, usually after passing the Admission to Candidacy examination. Specific inquiries from prospective graduate students are welcomed and should be addressed to the graduate field office or to any faculty member in the field.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
