San Andreas Fault Dating The San Andreas Fault in California has variable slip behavior along its length, with a stable central section sandwiched between the earthquake-producing northern and southern sections. Because the central San Andreas fault relieves strain through aseismic creep, it is not thought to nucleate earthquakes. What still remains a relatively open question though, is whether earthquakes that nucleate in either the northern or southern locked sections can propagate into or through the central San Andreas fault.
