In either case, a furnished studio in a high-rise building in Manhattan will typically start in the low $2,000’s per month, while one-bedrooms range from $3,500 to $6,000. Short-Term Housing Providers Below are a few providers that offer furnished short-term accommodations in Manhattan: Staynovo Corporate Housing WeLive BridgeSuites Furnished Quarters AKA Apartments Churchill Corporate Living Subletting Most New York City apartment leases are for 12 months, and tenants occasionally need to move or travel for an extended period of time before the end of that 12-month period. Rather than breaking their lease, tenants occasionally choose to “sublet” or “sublease” their individual bedroom in a shared apartment or full apartment to another tenant. If you choose to sublet, be wary of potential scams, and keep these tips in mind: Start with your network. Before searching for a sublet online, you may want to reach out to your friends to see if they know anyone in New York City who is looking to sublet their room or apartment. Read the lease. Before agreeing to the sublet, ask the tenant for a copy of their lease, and make sure it expressly indicates the rules surrounding subletting in their building. If they cannot or will not produce a copy of the lease, walk away. Check in with the apartment owner/landlord. Confirm with the landlord/apartment owner whether their approval is required for the tenant to sublet. Obtain a written agreement signed by all parties. You, the current tenant, and landlord should sign a document that outlines the duration of your stay, the agreed monthly rate, and any other subletting rules. Know NYC rental restrictions. Whole-apartment rentals of less than 30 days are illegal in New York City.
