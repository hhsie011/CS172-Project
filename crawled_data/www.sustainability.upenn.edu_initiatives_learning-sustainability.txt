For students, Penn’s goal is to increase access to degree programs, research opportunities, career preparation, and educational pathways. For faculty, the goal is to support excellence in scholarship and improve cooperation and collaboration among departments and academic centers. For the entire Penn community, the goal is to expand awareness of critical issues, highlighting Penn’s leadership role in creating a more just and equitable local, regional, and global society. At the same time, the Sustainability Office will work with select faculty and students to identify and develop research opportunities that use Penn’s campus as a living lab that, in promoting campus sustainability, have potential broader application beyond campus.
