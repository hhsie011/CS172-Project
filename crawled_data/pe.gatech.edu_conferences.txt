We will not rent or sell your personal information. Leave this field blank Georgia Tech Professional Education helped us prepare for the conference with sincere devotion and the utmost competence. Not only were they proactive in matters related to preparation and running the conference at an offsite hotel, but they played a vital role in advising us – with all of their suggestions cost-cutting. Overall, I could not be happier with the service I received. It was worth far more than the fee I was charged. - S. Mostafa Ghiaasiaan Ph.D., P.E. Professor, G.W.
