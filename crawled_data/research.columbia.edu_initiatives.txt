Traditionally, such interdisciplinary efforts focused primarily on natural scientists, engineers, and medical researchers; increasingly such collaborations also embrace social scientists, humanists, and experts in public health, social work, and education, as well as Columbia’s professional schools of law, business, and policy. ORID supports efforts to secure external funding for such collaborations and administers a seed fund for early-stage research that falls outside the traditional boundaries. ORID also focuses on helping plan and build research infrastructure, such as the Shared Research Computing Facility and the Columbia Nano Initiative facilities.
