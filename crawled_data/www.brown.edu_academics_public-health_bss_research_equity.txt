As a result, many BSS faculty members direct their research efforts toward addressing avoidable and preventable inequalities due to social, cultural, and environmental injustices. Advanced quantitative and qualitative research methods are implemented across interdisciplinary teams using a community-based approach to prevent, reduce, and eliminate health inequities across diverse populations, including among racial and ethnic minorities, sexual and gender minorities and those in resource-limited settings—both domestically and globally. BSS faculty members conduct health equity research in the following content areas: HIV/STIs; mental health; obesity, nutrition, and physical activity; and, alcohol and other drug use.
