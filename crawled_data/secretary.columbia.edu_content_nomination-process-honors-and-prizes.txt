Candidates who were previously nominated are presented again for consideration, although individuals who have not received serious consideration by the Honors and Prizes committees for at least two consecutive years are generally removed from the list of candidates. The president then formally submits a slate of honorary degree and University Medal for Excellence candidates to the Trustees for their approval. Invitations to the proposed honorees are typically sent out during the summer; the list of honorees is formally announced just prior to Commencement. 211 Low Library535 West 116th Street, Mail Code 4324 · New York, NY 10027 Contact Us secretary@columbia.edu Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
