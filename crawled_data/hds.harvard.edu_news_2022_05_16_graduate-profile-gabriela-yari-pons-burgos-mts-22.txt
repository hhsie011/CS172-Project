How I've Changed My appreciation for finding and nurturing community has grown. HDS provided the space to form meaningful connections that I anticipate will last many years. Favorite Class or Professor Professor Patton and Professor Rivera. Future Plans I hope to continue grounding myself in community and history, engaging with my Caribbean heritage and connecting, island to island, with the Pacific Islands. My time at HDS has allowed me to explore the deep-rooted ties between the struggles of both island regions, and I aim to keep exploring these ties, as well as, hopefully, contributing to them.
