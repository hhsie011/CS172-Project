Specializations At the University of Memphis, MSW students learn about social work practice from the micro to macro levels. The first half of the program prepares students for generalist practice and introduces students to the broad, versatile field of social work. In the second half of the program, students select an area of specialization: Advanced Practice with Children, Youth, & Families or Advanced Practice with Adults & Families. Within each specialization, full-time, extended study, and advanced standing tracks are available. Please use the links below to view the curricula of each specialization and study track option. Advanced Practice with Children, Youth, & Families prepares students to engage with families and children. Areas of focus include behavioral interventions for children with special needs, child welfare, practice in schools, foster care and adoptions, childhood trauma, abuse & neglect, children's mental health, community programs for children, and advocacy on behalf of children and families. Advanced Practice with Adults & Families prepares students for practice across many populations and social issues: military members and veterans, family and community violence, corrections, homelessness, poverty, geriatrics, health care settings, disability & long term care, clinical interventions in mental health and substance abuse, and neighborhood development. Electives Students are encouraged to utilize allotted elective credits to either deepen their social work knowledge by taking a special topics elective in social work, or to expand their interdisciplinary skills by taking electives offered by other graduate programs at the university.
