Under the direction of Jim Rothman (2013 Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine), the Institute comprises research groups with diverse interests across cell biology, physiology, biophysics, and nanotechnology. Taking a multidisciplinary approach, researchers in this Institute seek to unravel the cellular organization and dynamics by developing and utilizing cutting-edge tools to dissect and build complex biological assemblies. This Institute will catalyze the development of biosensors, analytical and imaging techniques, genetic switches, and biocompatible materials.
