In an effort to ensure we are offering you the highest quality and most quickly accessible care, Brown has partnered with HealthiestYou, a robust teleclinical service which offers students remote consultation with clinicians and mental health providers licensed throughout the country. Students can access telehealth and telemental health care via the HealthiestYou app 24/7 from any location, especially while living, studying, or traveling outside of Rhode Island both nationally and internationally. The app allows students to identify providers, find low-cost prescriptions, compare care prices, and can connect with their insurance. When going abroad, it is easiest for a student to use the app if they have established a pre-existing relationship with a HealthiestYou provider. This service is intended to supplement existing local resources to provide students with easily accessible and dependable care, regardless of location of study. The app will be available to all enrolled Brown students throughout the year, spanning the fall, spring, and summer semesters. Care provided by HealthiestYou providers is unlimited and there is no additional cost to students. We encourage you to take advantage of this offering when outside of Rhode Island by downloading the HealthiestYou app and creating your account today. Please reach out to HealthiestYou at 1-866-703-1259 for assistance with setting up an account.
