History Faculty Interview Series Watch the Interview Dr. Alicia McGill Dr. Alicia McGill is an Assistant Professor in the Department of History and contributes to the PhD program in Public History. She has always been fascinated by human diversity in the past and present and the ways that people connect with history and have conducted archaeological and cultural anthropology research in Cyprus, Honduras, Belize, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and Colorado. Prior to teaching at NC State, she was a visiting assistant professor at Indiana University, South Bend. She has conducted extensive research in Belize, focusing on the ways constructions of the past are promoted through public venues like tourism, education, and archaeological practice, and how these constructions shape the cultural production of young citizens. She is particularly interested in the ways messages about the past are interpreted and negotiated by teachers and youth as they navigate racial and ethnic politics in the present. Her most recent publications focus on national cultural diversity rhetoric in the Belizean state and intersections between colonial dynamics, community connections with the natural landscape, and local heritage work. 9:1 Student/Faculty Ratio NC State's History Department provides a small college experience inside a big university LATEST NEWS More Stories Events Submit an Event‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ History Events‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ NC State Academic Calendar‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ Featured News North Carolina and the Green Book Through her work with the North Carolina Green Book Project, public history doctoral student Lisa Withers collects experiences of African American travelers during the Jim Crow era.
