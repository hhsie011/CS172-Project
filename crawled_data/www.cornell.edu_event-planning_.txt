Event Planning Each year, thousands of events are sponsored by student organizations, university departments, and visitors to Cornell University. Cornell's beautiful campus and buildings form a memorable backdrop for any kind of special event. To preserve the beauty and historic nature of these buildings and areas, and to ensure the safety of all participants, Cornell University has established a set of requirements governing the registration process & procedures, as well as the appropriate use of these spaces during your event. These policies and procedures must be followed to ensure that the event is safe and in compliance with university policy. During certain times of the year, Cornell has additional requirements or limitations on usage. You will need to check with the sponsoring office or department to learn about possible limitations. Examples of university-wide events include the following: Slope Day, Homecoming, Orientation, Senior Week, and Commencement/Convocation. Conference & Event Services provides numerous resources to those wishing to plan events on Cornell's campus. Staff members can assist with: Contract Negotiation Ticketing Budget Management Production Safety & Security Talent/Artist selection Promotion and Publicity Hospitality Volunteer and staffing issues Please contact us if you're interested in learning more about event planning/management resources available to you or your organization.
