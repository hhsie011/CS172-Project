How I love them! How I need them! I'll have a long beard by the time I read them. â€• Arnold Lobel, author of the Frog and Toad books . #PennLibraries #UPenn #LibrariesOfInstagram #Bookstagram #BookQuotes #LibraryLove #LGBTAuthors #PrideMonth #Pride2021 #OnThisDay in 1613, the Globe Theater in London burned to the ground. The theater had been built in 1599 in William Shakespeare's company of players, the Lord Chamberlin's Men, and is associated with the playwright to this day. At the Penn Libraries, you can learn about Shakespeare, his contemporaries, and the history of Shakespearean performance when you explore the collections of the The Horace Howard Furness Memorial Library. . #UPenn #PennLibraries #TodayInHistory #WilliamShakespeare #Shakespeare #GlobeTheater #RareBooks #LibrariesOfInstagram #OnThisDay in 1969, police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in New York Cityâ€™s Greenwich Village. Patrons resisted arrest, and for six days fought back against the police who threatened the bar. A year later, a coalition of advocacy groups commemorated the event with a demonstration now known as the first Pride Parade. To help you celebrate Pride Month, staff, students, and faculty of Pennâ€™s LGBT Center have put together a selection of books and films that explore the LGBTQ experience from a wide variety of perspectives. Here are some of their recommendations. Kissing the Witch by Emma Donoghue George by Alex Gino Queer: A Graphic History by Meg-John Barker and Julia Scheele Under the Udala Trees by Chinelo Okparanta The Handmaiden, directed by Chan-Wook Park Ma Vie en Rose, directed by Alain Berliner The Watermelon Woman, written and directed by Cheryl Dunye . #UPenn #PennLibraries #Libraries #LibraryLove #LibraryPride #LibrariesOfInstagram #TodayInHistory #Stonewall #PrideMonth #Pride2021 "People were stupid, sometimes. They thought the Library was a dangerous place because of all the magical books, which was true enough, but what made it really one of the most dangerous places there could ever be was the simple fact that it was a library. " â€”Terry Pratchett, Guards, Guards . #UPenn #PennLibraries #BeautifulLibraries #Shelfie #LibrariesOfInstagram #LibraryStacks #Bookstagram #GuardsGuards #TerryPratchett #GNUTerryPratchett WE'RE HIRING STUDENTS!
