The version of this work copied in Paris near the beginning of the fourteenth century in the manuscript Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France ms. f. fr. 146 includes famous illuminations illustrating the adventures of a strange wild horse. The discussion will focus on the performance practice of monophonic and polyphonic songs in the manuscript in the context of their musical notation. Vocalist, harper and scholar Benjamin Bagby has been an important figure in the field of medieval musical performance for more than 30 years. After musical studies in the USA (Oberlin Conservatory and Oberlin College) and Switzerland (Schola Cantorum Basiliensis), he and the late Barbara Thornton formed the renowned vocal ensemble Sequentia in 1977 in Cologne, Germany, where the ensemble was based until Mr. Bagby moved to Paris in 2002. Since 2005 Bagby has been on the music faculty of the Université de Paris - Sorbonne, teaching in the master’s programme for medieval music performance. In addition to researching and writing more than 70 program books for festivals and concert series, and writing (or co-authoring, with Barbara Thornton) more than 25 CD booklets, Mr. Bagby has written about performance practice, with articles appearing in Early Music, Early Music America, in the Performer’s Guide to Medieval Music (IU Press) edited by Ross Duffin, in the Basler Jahrbuch für historische Musikpraxis, and in a recent collection of essays, Performing Medieval Narrative. This event sponsored by Paris-Sorbonne University and Columbia Global Centers | Paris is presented in conjunction with the FAB-Musiconis project of Columbia University and Paris-Sorbonne University.
