Unlike traditional disciplines in engineering and the mathematical sciences, the fields address the role of the human decision-maker as key contributor to the inherent complexity of systems and primary benefactor of the analyses. ISyE Fields of Specialization Interdisciplinary Research Centers ISyE Centers and Labs ISyE Postdoctoral Fellowship Program Georgia Tech pursues leading-edge research with industry, government, and community partners. At ISyE, we are a national leader in 10 core fields of specialization: Advanced Manufacturing, Analytics and Machine Learning, Applied Probability and Simulation, Data Science and Statistics, Economic Decision Analysis, Energy and Sustainable Systems, Health and Humanitarian Systems, Optimization, Supply Chain Engineering, and Systems Informatics and Control.

Home Research ISyE Fields of Specialization Advanced Manufacturing Other Research Areas Advanced Manufacturing Analytics and Machine Learning Applied Probability and Simulation Data Science and Statistics Economic Decision Analysis Energy and Sustainable Systems Health and Humanitarian Systems Optimization Supply Chain Engineering System Informatics and Control Advanced Manufacturing Ben Wang, ISyE professor, Gwantney Chair in Manufacturing Systems, and director of GTMI, introduces manufacturing innovation at Georgia Tech. ISyE faculty and students in the advanced manufacturing area focus on processes through cutting-edge computational, experimental, and statistical techniques. The group also works closely with industry and government partners and collaborators to validate and implement research results. Advanced Manufacturing makes extensive use of technologies related to automation, computers and computing, high precision, and information and data science. The goal is to develop production systems capable of creating a variety of products in small or large volumes with both the efficiency of mass production and the flexibility of custom manufacturing in order to respond quickly to customer demands. Manufacturing plays a key role in America’s economy and innovation. In 2013, manufacturers contributed $2.08 trillion (12.5 percent of GDP) to the U.S. economy, and nearly 70 percent of private company R&D investments and 70 percent of issued patents originate in manufacturing. Realizing the significance of manufacturing, the U.S. government and industry sectors have recently placed substantial emphasis on advanced manufacturing. Numerous investment and funding programs have been created for advanced manufacturing in the past two years, such as the multi-agency Materials Genome Initiative (MGI), National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI), and NIST Advanced Manufacturing Technology Consortia (AMTech). Interdisciplinary Advanced Manufacturing Research Working closely with colleagues in ISyE (e.g., Logistics, Statistics, and Systems Informatics and Control Groups) and Georgia Tech Manufacturing Institute (GTMI), ISyE faculty and students in the advanced manufacturing area conduct both fundamental/methodological studies and applied research sponsored by government agencies including AFOSR, DOE, NIST, NSF, and VA, as well as industrial companies such as ATK, Boeing, Cytec, and OG Technologies. Ongoing interdisciplinary advanced manufacturing research projects at ISyE include: Development and optimization of additive manufacturing (3-D printing and printed electronics) processes for composite structures and next generation electronics (such as flexible electronics and advanced sensors) fabrication. Scalable nanomanufacturing of multifunctional carbon nanomaterials. Process modeling, sensing/monitoring, control, and optimization of advanced manufacturing processes (additive manufacturing/printed electronics, composites, nanomaterials, and hot forming). Stream of Variation (SoV) modeling and analysis for multistage manufacturing systems (assembly, machining, progressive forming, nanomaterials processing, etc.). Model-based systems engineering for advanced manufacturing. Development of advanced materials and manufacturing processes for medical device (e.g., prosthetics) applications. Supply chain management for production systems supported by additive manufacturing.

Spiridon Reveliotis is addressing a cutting-edge approach to automation in manufacturing known as flexible automation. This concept involves variable-size batch production and the ability to reconfigure and rebalance the shop floor quickly to accommodate differing product mixes. H.
