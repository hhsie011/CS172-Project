Essays written in these settings represent the "capstone" experience for majors and minors described on our website and in the ORC. It is typically these pieces of undergraduate writing we deem "prize-worthy" at our year-end awards ceremony. We encourage newly declaring majors and minors to consider with some care which HIST 96s they will take to complete their degrees. Several reasons why HIST 96 enrollments should be planned well in advance and discussed with a history faculty adviser are: 1. The success of these classes depends on a strict enrollment limit of twelve students per class. 2. We have found that students have the best academic experience when they select their 96s related to a topic they have encountered previously. This prior exposure can be in the context of course work (either at the introductory or upper-level) or through work in the Presidential Scholars, London Foreign Study, Dartmouth Vietnam Project, or Independent Study (Hist 97) programs. 3. Undergraduate work in history (like that in the liberal arts) combines both breadth and depth. We achieve breadth through a set of distributive requirements that require students to survey the histories of a range of places and times. HIST 96s can be used to meet these distributives. The second objective of depth can be achieved in many ways, though it is often best done by reaching the 96 via a cluster of related coursework. Considering History 96 as a "destination" can provide some structure in considering the overall major or minor plan. 4. While we allow students to enroll in two 96s in the same term, we ask them to do so only after considering the rigors of these classes (and, by extension, of the work of historical practice). Early planning (and, ideally, the completion of at least one 96 by majors in their junior year) helps to avoid the need for two in a single term. This brief guide provides information for the versions of History 96 that will be offered through the spring of 2024. You should discuss these options with your faculty adviser when you are completing your major worksheet. Please note: Enrollment in seminars is by instructor permission only. This permission is issued by the professor teaching the course. When completing the major or minor worksheet, students should contact the professors teaching the seminars they wish to take in order to inquire about the enrollment process and to be placed on the enrollment list. 2021-22 HIST 96 Seminars Summer 2021 96.12 (J): Race, Ethnicity and Immigration in U.S History (Orleck) 96.37 (K): Topics in Economic History - States and Economic Development: Global Histories and Comparisons (Link) Fall 2021 96.38 (10A): Crisis and Continuity in Twentieth-Century US Social Movements (Rabig) 96.39 (2A): Saints and Relics (Gaposchkin) Winter 2022 96.03 (2A): Topics in British History (Estabrook) 96.08/NAS 81.03 (3A): Pen and Ink Witchcraft: Native American History Through Treaties (Calloway) Spring 2022 96.01 (3A): Colonialism and Culture in Asia and Africa (Haynes) 96.28 (2A): America in the 1970s (Moreton) 96.29 (6B): Debating Democracy in the Nineteenth Century (Butler) 2022-23 HIST 96 Seminars Summer 2022 HIST 96.12 (10A) Seminar: Race, Ethnicity, and Immigration in U.S. History (Orleck) Fall 2022 HIST 96.29 (6B) Debating Democracy in the Nineteenth Century (Butler) HIST 96.33 (3A) Global History of Human Rights (Nikpour) HIST 96.34 (London FSP Students) London Archives (Bonner and Gaposchkin) Winter 2023 HIST 96.03 (2A) Topics in British History (Estabrook) HIST 96.08/NAIS 81.03 (10A) Pen and Ink Witchcraft: Native American History Through Treaties (Calloway) Spring 2023 HIST 96.25 (2A) World War II in the Pacific, 1931-1945 (J.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of History Undergraduate Overview History FAQs for First Year and Transfer Students How to Declare a Major or Minor in History Major Modified Major Minor Transfer Credit Policy Course Descriptions First-Year Seminars Introductory Africa, Asia, Latin America & The Caribbean (AALAC) Europe (EUR) Interregional & Comparative (INTER) United States (US) Seminars & Colloquia Independent Study & Honors Course Schedule 2021-2022 Schedule 2022-2023 Schedule 2023-2024 Schedule Course Syllabi Honors Thesis Program General Timeline Guidelines for the Class of 2022 Guidelines for the Class of 2023 Honors Theses By Year Phi Alpha Theta Honors Society Prizes After Graduation Alumni Update Research Overview Faculty Research Initiatives Dartmouth History Institute Student Research Initiatives and Resources The Dartmouth Vietnam Project History Librarian Research Funding Resources Undergraduate Research Database Student Class Projects Foreign Study News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
