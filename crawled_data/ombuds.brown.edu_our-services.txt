Informal Mediation The Ombuds Office offers informal mediation between two or more parties in a conflict. Informal mediation through the Ombuds Office is confidential and informal, making it a safe space to try to work out disputes before or instead of moving to formal and less confidential processes. Facilitation The Ombuds Office provides facilitation services to assist groups in managing conversations. Shuttle Diplomacy Sometimes parties to a conflict are unwilling or unable to meet in person or speak directly to one another. Training and Presentations The ability to manage conflict increases as we learn about and apply effective tools and strategies for navigating it. To support this learning, the Ombuds Office offers training on a variety of topics related to conflict management and effective communication.
