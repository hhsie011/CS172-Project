Sciences, MS Comparative Biomedical Sciences, PhD Veterinary Medicine, DVM Home/ College of Arts and Sciences/ Integrative Biology Integrative Biology Overview Courses Undergraduate Programs Graduate Programs Minors Faculty The Department of Integrative Biology offers BS degree programs in biology, physiology, and zoology. The undergraduate degree in biology is appropriate for students wanting to obtain a broad background in the life sciences. Students complete coursework in animal, plant and microbial biology, genetics, ecology, physiology, and evolution. This degree meets the requirements for admission to graduate and professional schools and also prepares students for a broad range of biology-related employment opportunities. Students who choose this degree can also select options in allied health, environmental biology, pre-medical sciences, or secondary teacher certification. The undergraduate degree in physiology offers specialized coursework as preparation for graduate school or a medically-related professional school. The bachelor’s degree in physiology requires courses in biology, genetics, microbiology, comparative anatomy, biochemistry, physics, and chemistry. The mammalian physiology lecture and lab sequence provides a unique capstone experience. Students may also choose to pursue an option in pre-medical sciences. The curriculum in zoology is designed to provide a thorough background in the biology of animals and prepares students for graduate school and many applied and professional careers. The zoology degree requires courses in ecology, evolution, genetics, and vertebrate and invertebrate zoology. Students participate in unique research experiences and/or internships and develop a good foundation in the related fields of chemistry, physics, and mathematics. Options with the zoology degree include ecology and conservation biology, pre-medical sciences, pre-veterinary science, and secondary teacher certification.
