Different from large undergraduate programs, this professional master’s program is designed to create a ‘community of practice’ where we all push each other to grow and improve, in both traditional public health knowledge areas, and in professional competence (e.g., “soft skills”, “leadership”, “emotional intelligence”, etc.). We are a small cohort of students and core faculty, drawing on expertise from across campus and across the world. At this time, we offer two concentration areas, with interdisciplinary instruction from both researchers and practitioners: Infectious Disease Epidemiology Graduates are prepared to manage, prevent, identify, and respond to infectious disease threats, covering ongoing and emerging viral, bacterial, fungal or parasitic disease concerns in both humans and animals. Students learn how to track disease spread, map and disseminate appropriate public health communications, and to lead a coordinated response to address the public health need. This includes training in epidemiological techniques specifically related to infectious diseases and outbreak investigation, as well as training in vector borne diseases. Food Systems for Health Students learn to take a systems approach to assess and coordinate policies or interventions that ensure safe and sustainable land use, food production, food storage, food processing, food delivery, and consumption. This includes training in toxicology, food safety, food and water security, and/or nutrition. Students learn how to engage local and global communities to assess systems or needs, develop interventions from a One Health approach, and lead monitoring and evaluation processes to ensure public health needs are being met.

Learning Outcomes Learning Outcomes Cornell’s MPH curriculum is designed to help build and develop competence in performance areas that are critical for public health. Competence is the ability to access and integrate knowledge and skill do something successfully and efficiently in a given context. Students gain knowledge that is core to public health practice and learn how to continuously build their knowledge base. Students learn specific skills that are strategic for public health practice. Students are pushed to integrate their knowledge and skills to complete projects or address problems from the real world. Students practice ongoing self-assessment and continuous improvement of competence across scenarios and situations. To demonstrate knowledge and skills, and the ability to integrate and apply them in real-world settings for public good, students complete and submit at least 25 products. Each product has been designed to mimic or build skills towards what you might do ‘on the job’ in a public health setting. These products are developed with a future employer in mind and presented in a portfolio. View a a full list of MPH competencies (knowledge and skills) our students develop.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
