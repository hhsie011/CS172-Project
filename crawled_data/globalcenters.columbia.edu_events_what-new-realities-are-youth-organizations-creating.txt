Minorities and marginalized areas have no or little support from institutional power. In many favelas as the one in Rio de Janeiro, the COVID-19 responses were youth-led. Young people from different backgrounds became leaders by getting together in collaborative and self-organized spaces in their communities, to identify problems and human rights violations, creating solutions and mobilizing donations and resources. This session will discuss the final perceptions from the participatory research led by Restless Development on the role of youth civil society in the pandemic, and highlights the youth role at the forefront of the COVID-19 fight and their importance as stakeholders to debate on how to overcome the impacts of COVID-19 and create new realities, Join us for the event celebrating the International Youth Day hosted by the Columbia Global Centers | Rio de Janeiro, Committee on Global Thought (CGT), Observatório Internacional da Juventude, and Restless Development.
