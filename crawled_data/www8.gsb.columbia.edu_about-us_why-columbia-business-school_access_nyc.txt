At the Very Center of the World's Most Dynamic Business Environment Columbia’s location in New York City cannot be underestimated when choosing an MBA program. The city fuels so much of what happens at the School, and the School feeds back into the city with current students, new graduates, and visiting faculty members. Our students rave about the Morningside Heights neighborhood that surrounds the Business School. It's easy to understand why. To the west of campus is Riverside Park. A stretch of green space abutting the Hudson River, it's a great place to bike, run, or stretch out in the sun. To the east is Morningside Park, which slants down to nearby Harlem. Since its inception, Columbia Business School has maintained a symbiotic relationship with New York City. The city is the nexus for business research and the implementation of ideas that impact industries. Columbia Business School’s proximity to an extraordinary concentration of business leaders means that our students get constant access to the best minds in business, who regularly visit to teach, speak, and meet with students. (In fact, no business school has more on-campus visits than we do.) Columbia Business School alumni have found their place in nearly every top industry in the city and are often willing to help with internships, job strategies, and one-on-one advice. The Ultimate Urban Laboratory At Columbia, the Business School and the city are intertwined. And no matter what your specific interest, New York is the perfect place to explore it. Often, students find our more than 100 student-run clubs and organizations a good place to start. In the Small Business Consulting Program, for example, students work closely with real businesses from the area, advising owners while gaining hands-on experience putting the theory they learn in the classroom into practice. Past clients have included everything from a local theater company to Harlem retailers to a foundation for war veterans and their families. There are plenty of other ways you'll engage with the city as a student, as well, thanks in large part to our extensive local alumni network. The Media and Technology Program's annual Career Night, for instance, draws more than 800 students and alumni, including executives from major firms like the New York Times, BET, and Reuters. Courses like Experiential Marketing bring students to brick and mortar retail outlets to analyze their practices, and recruiting events regularly involve field trips to corporate headquarters in the city. Throughout their experience at Columbia, our students find the School inseparable from the global business hub it's located in. Columbia isn't just in New York, it is New York. Sidebar Content By the Numbers 500 Speakers a year visiting campus, offering unparalleled access to the pulse of business. 44,000 Alumni around the world — an impressive network to tap into as a student and after you graduate.
