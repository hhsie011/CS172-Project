Kernberg, who is the Past-President of the International Psychoanalytic Association, also referred to the latest advances in the neurobiology of personality disorders, the scientific study of which has advanced significantly in the last decade. A renowned expert in the field, Kernberg has made a significant contribution in the identification of psychological structures that interact with neurobiological bases of human behavior to produce personality dysfunctions. At the conference, he reviewed the different systems that configure the functioning of personality – such as regulation of affection, identity and mentalization - and addressed the different ways in which these systems can present dysfunctions. During the conference, Universidad Católica’s School of Psychology acknowledged Kernberg for his invaluable scientific and clinical contribution in the field of personality disorder. Kernberg was invited to Chile in the last of the four-part Global Mental Health Series, sponsored by the Santiago Center, the Millennial Institute for Depression and Personality Research (MIDAP) and Universidad Católica’s office of the Vice-Provost for Research. The series - featuring Columbia University experts focusing on mental health issues - was inaugurated in early July by Lena Verdeli, Founder and Director of the Global Mental Health Lab, and continued in October by Madelyn Gould, Irving Philips Professor of Epidemiology in Psychiatry at the Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. In December, Pablo Goldberg, Associate Professor of Clinical Psychiatry and Medical Director of Pediatric Anxiety and Mood Research Clinic at the Columbia University Medical Center, discussed how to diagnose and address adolescent depression.
