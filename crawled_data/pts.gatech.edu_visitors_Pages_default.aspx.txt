Zipcar has several locations on campus for hourly car rentals. Metered Parking & Pay-by-Phone Parking meters offer a short-term parking solution. Many meters can be paid for using ParkMobile, which allows customers to pay for Georgia Tech parking meters using their cell phone. Customers may also opt to receive text message alerts and reminders prior to the meter’s expiration. Once you are registered with ParkMobile, use a mobile app, the internet, QR code, or call toll free (1-877-727-5714) to pay for parking at metered spaces. Also, customers may opt to receive text message alerts and reminders prior to expiration. Visit ParkMobile Accessible Parking ADA permit parking on Georgia Tech's campus requires a state-issued disability tag or license plate and a Georgia Tech parking permit. Parking is authorized in any ADA space on campus with these credentials. ADA visitor space parking requires that a state issued disability tag or license plate and an hourly fee apply to customers parked in an ADA space within visitors parking areas. In some cases, ADA permit parking and ADA visitor parking are located in the same location. Vehicles parked in an ADA parking space without displaying a state-issued disability tag or license plate will be immediately result in a fine up to $200 and possible impoundment/towing with associated costs. Temporary and Weekend Permits To accommodate campus guests, PTS offers Temporary and Weekend Permits for permitted parking areas. Please bring the vehicle’s registration and the driver’s official ID to the PTS office when purchasing temporary permits for visitors. Weekend permits are not available when campus is hosting a Saturday home football game.
