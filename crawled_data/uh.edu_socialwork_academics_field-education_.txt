Field Education Practicum The Field Practicum is an essential component of the College's professional education for social work practice. The purpose of field education is to provide students with opportunities for development, integration, and reinforcement of competence through performance in actual service delivery situations. As students undertake learning within the reality of agency life, theory from the classroom is applied, skills are developed and refined, and attitudes and values are examined. Students are afforded opportunities for analysis of the effects of social policy on programs and services, opportunities for the development of research questions in relation to practice efforts, and opportunities for evaluation of practice interventions. Field practicum is the primary pedagogy or learning modality for social work education. The GCSW provides various methods for connecting with affiliated agencies to support practicum experiences. The UH-GCSW is affiliated with over 200 social service agencies in the Greater Houston area and beyond. Field instruction is provided by qualified, affiliated social workers and supported by field faculty from the College.
