Three Florida State University students have earned Critical Language Scholarships through the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs to help further their study of foreign languages and cultures. According to the State Department, the CLS provides “rigorous academic instruction in 15 languages that are critical to America’s national security and economic prosperity. CLS participants are citizen ambassadors, sharing American values and promoting American influence abroad.” Jesse Wieland, associate director of the Office of National Fellowships said the CLS gives students a multi-faceted experience that goes beyond language. “The main purpose is to help provide students who are passionate about language with a greater understanding of how that language is crucial to their academic and career goals,” he said. “The program provides classroom time, cultural excursions and conversation partners. This year’s winners are: Maelyn Zitzke Zitzke, graduated in December from FSU with her bachelor’s in international affairs. Zitzke, who is originally from Milwaukee, Wisconsin will travel to Morocco to study Arabic. “I am just really interested in this part of the world and it’s such an exciting opportunity,” she said. “I am still deciding what I want to do next with graduate school. Maybe, Arabic studies, or middle eastern studies, or international affairs and urban development.” Zitzke said she started taking Arabic classes during her sophomore year which sparked an interest in the Middle East that she hopes will see her spend much time in the region in the future. “This experience will for sure help my language learning, help me make the improvement that I’ve been wanting to make and really solidify what I’ve learned so far,” she said. “I am really excited about this as a cultural experience and getting a greater understanding of a region that I want to work in and see in the future.” Meagan McLaughlin McLaughlin earned a CLS in 2021 but travel restrictions prevented her from travelling abroad and pivoted her to an online experience. This year, the Tampa native is excited to say that she is traveling to Amman, Jordan where she will continue to study Arabic. “Being named a recipient the first time was a dream come true but being named a second time and getting to go abroad, it’s meant to be,” she said. McLaughlin, who graduated from FSU with dual degrees in international affairs and political science, said she looks forward to immersing herself culturally. “To go there and speak with people in person and really learn the mannerisms will really help me feel more confident in my Arabic proficiency,” she said. “To see how people carry themselves, how they greet each other and see them living their life in this culture you get to understand a different perspective.” Lauren Thornberg Thornberg, a master’s student studying urban and regional planning from Lewes, Delaware, will use the CLS to continue her study of Mandarin Chinese. Thornberg’s CLS will be completed online, a fact she said isn’t necessarily a drawback given that she has already been to China two times, including a year spent working as an au pere. In China or from a computer in her parents’ basement where she says she’ll be working, Thornberg said she’s happy to have earned the CLS. “Since I’ve started graduate school I’ve lost some of my fluency,” she said of her Chinese. “So I am looking forward to that level of intensive study and just the opportunity to continue my Chinese studies.” “My specialty is environmental planning, which entails climate change and resilience,” she said. “In China, there are a lot of successes and losses as far as climate change resilience. They are pioneering advanced solutions to flooding and concerns about heat. Those solutions could be brought over to us and it would be beneficial to help communicate that to Americans. This will help give me the tools to do that.” Posted in: Students & Campus Life, Uncategorized, University News | Tagged: Critical Language Scholarship, FSU Global, FSU Global Post navigation Previous Article Previous Article: Student leader and recent FSU graduate receives scholarship from NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Next Article Next Article: FSU sociology professor named director of FSU’s Claude Pepper Center Sidebar Related Stories Nine FSU students earn Fulbright Scholarships FAMU-FSU College of Engineering names esteemed scholar, innovator as new dean FSU statistician named fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics FSU Career Center launches tool to aid student success and career planning FSU to offer new bachelor’s degree in human rights Recommended Stories FSU Expert Pitch: FAMU-FSU College of Engineering center pushes preparation for storm season Nine FSU students earn Fulbright Scholarships Triumph Gulf Coast board approves $7.6M grant for FSU PC’s Collegiate Laboratory High School Florida Center for Reading Research partners with Maya’s Book Nook to strengthen reading development in Leon County FSU dance professor continues to be recognized as trailblazer in performing arts Search Florida State News Search for: Categories: Any Category Announcements COVID-19 Announcements Multimedia FSU Headlines Photo Galleries Radio Stories Video Stories News Arts & Humanities Business, Law & Policy Education & Society Expert Pitches Faculty/Staff Briefs Health & Medicine Science & Technology Students & Campus Life University News Student Stars The Big Story Uncategorized News Archives News Archives Select Month May 2022 April 2022 March 2022 February 2022 January 2022 December 2021 November 2021 October 2021 September 2021 August 2021 July 2021 June 2021 May 2021 April 2021 March 2021 February 2021 January 2021 December 2020 November 2020 October 2020 September 2020 August 2020 July 2020 June 2020 May 2020 April 2020 March 2020 February 2020 January 2020 December 2019 November 2019 October 2019 September 2019 August 2019 July 2019 June 2019 May 2019 April 2019 March 2019 February 2019 January 2019 December 2018 November 2018 October 2018 September 2018 August 2018 July 2018 June 2018 May 2018 April 2018 March 2018 February 2018 January 2018 December 2017 November 2017 October 2017 September 2017 August 2017 July 2017 June 2017 May 2017 April 2017 March 2017 February 2017 January 2017 December 2016 November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 July 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 August 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 August 2010 July 2010 June 2010 May 2010 April 2010 March 2010 February 2010 January 2010 December 2009 November 2009 October 2009 September 2009 August 2009 July 2009 June 2009 May 2009 April 2009 March 2009 February 2009 January 2009 December 2008 November 2008 October 2008 September 2008 August 2008 July 2008 June 2008 May 2008 April 2008 March 2008 February 2008 January 2008 December 2007 November 2007 October 2007 September 2007 August 2007 July 2007 June 2007 May 2007 April 2007 March 2007 February 2007 January 2007 December 2006 November 2006 October 2006 September 2006 August 2006 July 2006 June 2006 May 2006 April 2006 March 2006 February 2006 January 2006 December 2005 November 2005 October 2005 September 2005 August 2005 July 2005 June 2005 May 2005 April 2005 March 2005 February 2005 January 2005 News Topics Arts & Humanities Business, Law & Policy Education & Society Health & Medicine Science & Technology Students & Campus Life University News All News Faculty/Staff Briefs Expert Pitches Multimedia Video Stories Radio Stories Photo Galleries FSU Headlines All Multimedia About FSU The Big Story Student Stars Publications Highlights/Rankings Seminole Tribe For Journalists News Contacts Media Resources Experts Expert Categories Title IX © Florida State University Tallahassee, FL 32306 FSU Directory Assistance Questions or Comments Privacy Policy Copyright Like Florida State on Facebook Follow Florida State on Instagram Follow Florida State on Twitter" Follow Florida State on Youtube Connect with Florida State on LinkedIn More FSU Social Media
