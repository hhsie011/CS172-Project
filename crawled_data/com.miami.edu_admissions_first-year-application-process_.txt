Upon submitting, you will be asked to pay a $70 nonrefundable application fee. Be sure you use the same email address for every part of the application process, including registering for standardized tests. In the Common Application, you will be asked to respond to one of seven prompts, using 650 words or less. This essay portion of the application gives you the opportunity to demonstrate your ability to develop your thoughts, to communicate them clearly, and to write them concisely. We also ask that you list your involvement in extracurricular activities, outside of school involvement and/or commitments; these will be evaluated as another factor in the admission process. Please note: Your application is not complete and we cannot begin your application review until we receive all required forms. Your $70 non-refundable application fee can be paid when you submit the Common Application. For students applying for Spring or Fall 2023 admission, the Common Application will be available starting August 1, 2022. Once you submit your application, it will take approximately three days for us to receive and begin reviewing it. Please allow us several weeks from the application deadline to process your documents and post them in CaneLink. During the busy application period, CaneLink is your best resource, as we are continually updating students’ applications and documents.

The Essay and/or Writing sections for both exams are not required for admission. There is no limit to the number of test scores you may submit with your application. If you take the test more than once, please ensure that the testing agency sends us all of your scores as we will superscore your test results.
