The division encompasses almost all of the university's proud traditions and walks beside Baylor students from their first steps on campus long past their graduation. This is fertile ground for investing directly into the lives of students. Your contribution to Baylor Student Life provides food for students who are food-insecure. It provides opportunities for leadership training and growth, and it allows us to continue to build on the programs that were so impactful in your experiences as a Baylor Bear.
