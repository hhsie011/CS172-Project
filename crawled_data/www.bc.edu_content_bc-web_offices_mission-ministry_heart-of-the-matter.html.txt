In the HEART OF THE MATTER the postings come from the heart and pertain to our Mission, formative education, faith, community, and the world. Postings will be messages of hope, support, and challenge. The purpose of this section is to provide “food for thought” to be pondered, inspire, and lead to prayer, action, and personal reflection.
