I use numerical modeling tools to study these processes. In particular, I am interested in putting geophysical, geological and geochemical observations in a geodynamically coherent framework to better understand the dynamics of the finite lithosphere deformation, mantle convection, and their interaction with surface processes in space and time. I am also interested in investigating the instantaneous state of the stress and strain rate in the fault zone areas, crustal deformation, earthquake cycles, and seismic hazards using geodetic and seismic data.
