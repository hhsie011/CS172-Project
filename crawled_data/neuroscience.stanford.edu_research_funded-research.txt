Santa Maria, MBBS, PhD, Guosong Hong Sensorineural hearing loss is an increasingly prevalent condition that causes disability to over a third of US adults aged over 65. This team is developing a breakthrough device to restore high-frequency hearing that preserves residual hearing through a reversible and minimally invasive approach. Remote reliable measurements of movement using bluetooth enabled engineered keyboard for diagnosis of neurological diseases - Renewal NeuroHealth | Neuroscience:Translate Lead Researcher(s): Helen Bronte-Stewart, MD, MS, Allison Okamura This team is developing a device that will enable accurate diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease via telemedicine. They initially introduced the technology of Quantitative DigitoGraphy (QDG) using a repetitive alternating finger tapping (RAFT) task on a musical instrument digital interface (MIDI)... Autism digital therapy with embedded endpoints and artificial intelligence for progress tracking and adaptive care - Renewal NeuroHealth | Neuroscience:Translate Lead Researcher(s): Dennis Wall, James Landay, Gary Darmstadt System uses computer vision algorithms and emotion classifiers integrated into gameplay to detect emotion in the child’s face via the phone’s front camera to determine agreement with the displayed prompt, along with other features such as gaze, eye contact, and joint attention. Development and validation of selective novel small molecule therapeutics for Parkinson's Disease NeuroHealth | Neuroscience:Translate Lead Researcher(s): Mehrdad Shamloo, Katrin Andreasson, Kathleen Poston, MD, MS This team will use their Neuroscience:Translate award to develop small-molecule therapeutics with immunomodulatory properties linked to Parkinson’s disease and test their potentially therapeutic effects in cell cultures and animal models of the disease. Extended Reality(XR) enhanced behavioral activation for treatment of Major Depressive Disorder NeuroHealth | Neuroscience:Translate Lead Researcher(s): Kim Bullock, MD, Jeremy Bailenson This team has created an extended reality–enhanced implementation of "behavioral activation," one of the most effective forms of evidence-based psychotherapy for major depression. They will use the Neuroscience:Translate award to test the efficacy and scalability of this approach and accelerate the... Topical Hedgehog modulators to enhance motor nerve regeneration after injury and repair NeuroHealth | Neuroscience:Translate Lead Researcher(s): Jon-Paul Pepper, MD, Philip Beachy This team has identified a small-molecule drug pathway that can improve functional recovery from nerve injury. The team will use the Neuroscience:Translate funds to test several approaches to topically apply this compound directly to damaged nerves during surgery to safely improve patient outcomes. Assessing the generalizability of individual brain models NeuroDiscovery | Postdoctoral Fellowship Lead Researcher(s): Elizabeth DuPre Cognitive neuroscience has traditionally focused on identifying the neural basis of psychological traits or state effects across large samples of participants. Recently, researchers have pushed towards providing more precise estimates of individual functional organization to better understand both... Next-generation brain imaging in freely moving animals NeuroDiscovery | Postdoctoral Fellowship Lead Researcher(s): Christopher Miranda Calcium imaging in freely behaving animals allows for the tracking of neuronal activity under approximately normal behavioral conditions. However, the slow response time of calcium imaging inhibits high resolution voltage and temporal measurements. To address this issue, modern molecular tools have... Optogenetic screening of the gut-brain axis via an internal light source NeuroDiscovery | Postdoctoral Fellowship Lead Researcher(s): Zihao Ou The gut-brain axis is implicated in many essential physiological and psychological functions, ranging from feeding, emotion, motivation, to memory. As a critical component of the gut-brain axis, vagal sensory neurons exhibit distinct projection patterns to target specific visceral organs.... Restoring multi-limb motion in people with paralysis via brain-computer interface NeuroDiscovery | Postdoctoral Fellowship Lead Researcher(s): Darrel Deo Intracortical brain-computer interfaces (iBCIs) can restore lost communication and motor function for people with severe speech and motor impairment due to neurological injury or disease. iBCIs measure neural activity from the brain, decode this activity into control signals, and use these signals...
