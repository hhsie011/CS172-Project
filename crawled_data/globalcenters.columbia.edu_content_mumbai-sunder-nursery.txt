Due to a lack of awareness and information, many in urban India are afraid of bees and often destroy hives they see around them. This has led to a decline in honey bee populations, harming global food security and biodiversity. Columbia Global Centers | Mumbai and the Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC) in India launched this campaign as part of the Sunder Nursery project to increase awareness about honey bees and inspire citizens to participate in bee conservation efforts.
