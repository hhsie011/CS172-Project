In this spirit, the SDSN will launch the SDSN20 next month in Istanbul, with the aim of gathering National and Regional SDSN from the G20 nations each year to promote the SDGs within the G20 processes. Professor Jeffrey Sachs, Director of UN SDSN | Global and Columbia University’s Earth Institute, will join the SDSN | Turkey in hosting a two-day high-level workshop on the SDGs in the G20. The Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) is a global network of knowledge institutions which works closely with partners in academia, government, business, civil society, and the UN to support evidence-based solutions for realizing the SDGs. The goals revolve around three themes: empowering people, eradicating poverty and protecting human dignity; shared prosperity and decent, fair jobs for all; protecting the planet and tackling climate change. Only two months after Heads of State and Government gathered in New York to approve the SDGs, one week ahead of the G20 meeting in Antalya, Turkey, and two weeks before the COP21 climate negotiations in Paris, this event will provide a crucial opportunity to discuss the role of the G20 countries in achieving the SDGs by 2030.
