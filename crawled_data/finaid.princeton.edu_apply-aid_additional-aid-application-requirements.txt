Non-custodial Parent's Form If your parents are divorced, separated or unmarried and living in separate households, your non-custodial parent must complete a Non-custodial Parent's Form. If your custodial parent is remarried, you do not need to complete this form. The custodial parent and stepparent information will be used to evaluate eligibility for need-based financial aid at Princeton. The Non-custodial Parent's Form is available in three different versions: U.S. form Canadian form International form Your non-custodial parent should complete the appropriate version. This form, along with 2020 income documents, may be uploaded after the PFAA is submitted or sent directly to our office. It is Princeton’s policy to require information from both parents in order to determine eligibility for financial aid. Under exceptional circumstances, the non-custodial parent's information may be waived at the discretion of the Financial Aid Office. Applicants may receive consideration for a waiver by submitting the Non-custodial Parent Waiver Request Form. This form, along with the necessary statements, may be uploaded after you submit the PFAA. If a waiver has been granted in a prior year, you do not have to submit a waiver request in any subsequent year.
