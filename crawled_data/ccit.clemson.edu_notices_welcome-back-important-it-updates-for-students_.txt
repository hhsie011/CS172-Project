As the semester begins, we‚Äôd like to remind you of some tips to help you succeed this semester and beyond. PaperCut is your printing solution PaperCut has replaced PawPrints as Clemson University‚Äôs student printing and plotting solution. Effective May 24, students will no longer be able to print using PawPrints. PaperCut features a similar method of printing to PawPrints using your TigerOne card or mobile ID at an available printer, but you will need to install PaperCut if you plan on printing from your laptop or mobile device. Learn more and download updated installers at clemson.edu/papercut. TigerOne Mobile ID In addition to iOS, you can now add your TigerOne Mobile ID to your Android device. Open doors, buy food, check out books and more right from your phone. Learn more at clemson.edu/campus-life/tigerone Connect your streaming devices with ResMediaNet Unfortunately, most streaming devices like TVs and gaming consoles don‚Äôt support the WPA2-Enterprise security used by eduroam. Instead, you can use the resmedianet wireless network to connect your TVs, gaming consoles, Rokus, AppleTVs, etc. to wireless. Find out more at ccit.clemson.edu/wireless. How can we help? Need a password reset? Avoid a call to the Support Center! If you‚Äôve forgotten or would like to update your Clemson login password, you can reset it online by clicking ‚ÄòPassword Reset‚Äô in the Quick Links box on the CCIT homepage at ccit.clemson.edu. Google Workspace passwords can be reset by visiting clemson.edu/emailforwarding and clicking the link near the bottom of the page. Need software? You can download and install licensed campus software without a trip to the CCIT Support Center! Find and download available software at download.clemson.edu. Information on specialty software can found under the ‚ÄúCurrent Students‚Äù section of ccit.clemson.edu/support. You can also access our new CUApps powered by Citrix to use a wide range of software in the cloud without having to install it to your computer. More information is available at clemson.edu/cuapps. Text, chat tech support available Every page at ccit.clemson.edu has an orange chat box that can connect you instantly with a CCIT Support Center representative during operating hours. In addition to calling the CCIT Support Center at (864) 656-3494, you can send a text to that same number and receive immediate assistance. Of course, you can always send an email to us at ITHELP@clemson.edu or visit us on the second floor of Cooper Library (COVID clearance required). Want to know about system maintenance and outages? CCIT maintains a status page with up-to-date information about issues and maintenance affecting university systems at status.ccit.clemson.edu.
