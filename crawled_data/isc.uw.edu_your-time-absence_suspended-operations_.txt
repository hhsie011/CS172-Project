See Executive Order 27 for additional details. Employees identified by their unit as performing an essential service are required to report to work during any period of declared suspended operation. Employees in designated non-essential positions do not report to work when operations are suspended. Suspended Operations Policy and FAQs Visit UWHR’s Suspended Operations page for an overview of UW’s Suspended Operations policy, as well as answers to these FAQs and more: Who needs to enter suspended operations time off and makeup time? Can you use sick time during suspended operations? Who is eligible to telework or work remotely when operations are suspended? Can you use overtime for suspended operations makeup time? What To Do in Workday The process for tracking suspended operations and makeup time is substantively different in Workday than it was in OPUS. During Suspended Operations, non-essential workers may be approved to: Work remotely, and enter time in Workday as usual -OR- Take a day of paid or unpaid time off and thus request time off in Workday as usual -OR- Choose to make up the lost hours at a later date, but within 90 days* of the Suspended Operations. See “Entering Make-Up Time” below for more information. Regardless of which option a worker chooses, they will receive their salary. Any unpaid time off must be entered on the actual day(s) of Suspended Operations to ensure correct salary rate. *Most employees have 90 days from the last day of Suspended Operations to make up any lost work hours. However, per their contract, SEIU 925 employees have 60 days. Entering Make-Up Time The Suspended Operations – Enter Make-Up Time User Guide provides step-by-step instructions for non-exempt (overtime-eligible) campus employees in non-essential positions who will need to enter “Suspended Operations Time Off” and subsequent “Suspended Operations Makeup Time.” Information for Workday Administrators Administrators should refer to the Suspended Operations How-To’s page for information about preparing their units for suspended operations, as well as identifying and tracking which employees can or need to make up time due to suspended operations.
