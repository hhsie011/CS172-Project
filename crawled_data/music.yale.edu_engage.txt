Engage with Music at YSM At the Yale School of Music, we feel a responsibility to advocate for music in communities at home and beyond. In New Haven, the Music in Schools Initiative allows School of Music students to share their expertise with young musicians in the New Haven Public Schools while supporting local music educators. The Initiative’s biennial Symposium on Music in Schools recently yielded the Declaration on Equity in Music for City Students. In the summers, the Norfolk Chamber Music Festival–Yale Summer School of Music offers the next generation of chamber musicians the chance to work with and perform alongside accomplished and esteemed artists in an idyllic setting. Even after musicians graduate from the Yale School of Music, they are part of a growing community of alumni and friends that extends around the world. My goal is to have the audience come to a concert ... with a kind of curiosity. Melvin Chen, Deputy Dean and Director of the Norfolk Chamber Music Festival Concerts at YSM The Yale School of Music presents hundreds of concerts each year featuring students, faculty, and guest artists. Many of these concerts are free and open to the public and streamed live, online. view concerts Engage with us The Yale School of Music experience is so much more than just a student’s daily activities on campus during the academic year, and even during their degree program.
