the world celebrates the Women’s History Month, Columbia Global Centers | Tunis organized an event about Women's Social and Political Activism: Past & Present. The discussion was a pair of conversations about women’s roles and contributions from the 1950s independence revolutions to the 2020s Hirak movements. The first conversation was about women as actors in nationalism and revolution, the second considered women's social and political activism. The event ended with a conversation between all four panelists about these topics and the campaigns for women's rights in today’s Maghreb. Women are an integral part of the North African social and political structure. Their place in Maghreb societies has been and remains the subject of intense debates as well as many stereotypes, but they have always been crucial actors at every level. Their importance is even more accentuated when their vanguard place across history is examined. Be it in politics, society, arts or trade, Maghrebi women appear regularly as respected leaders and innovative figures. Examples abound, and the trend continued until the recent period. Speakers: Dr. Dalenda Largueche, Professor of History and Gender Studies at the University of Manouba-Tunisia. Dr. Amel Boubekeur, sociologist at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales. Nadrah Mohammed, PhD candidate in French at Columbia University. Moderated by Dr. Madeleine Dobie, Professor of French and Comparative Literature and Department Chair at Columbia University.
