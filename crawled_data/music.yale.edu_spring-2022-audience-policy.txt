Unvaccinated children and individuals with any type of exemption are not permitted to attend Yale events at this time. For major concerts (e.g. Yale Philharmonia, Yale Opera, Yale Cellos), tickets must be reserved online at music-tickets.yale.edu in advance due to capacity limits. Online reservations close one hour before each concert. Reservations will not be accepted via phone or email. Walk-ups will not be permitted. For other concerts (e.g. Chamber Music, student recitals), reservations are no longer required; walk-ups are permitted. Please see individual concert listings to confirm requirements for each concert. All concertgoers must: show your vaccination card and photo ID at the door. wear an ASTM or N95-equivalent mask at all times inside the building. leave at least one empty seat between your party and others (when space permits). Individuals who cannot attend concerts in person are invited to watch livestreams of concerts presented by the Yale School of Music at music.yale.edu/live. updated April 13, 2022 Engage with YSM Norfolk Chamber Music Festival Tel 860 542-3000 norfolk@yale.edu Music in Schools Initiative musicinschools@yale.edu YSM Box Office concerts@yale.edu Quick Links Alumni Hub Concerts at Norfolk Concerts at YSM Giving at YSM Music in Schools Initiative Follow Us See YSM Directory Buy Concert Tickets General Inquiries YSM Offices Tel 203 432-1965 YSM Box Office Tel 203 432-4158 PO Box 208246 New Haven, CT 06520-8246 Discover Yale School of Music Morris Steinert Collection of Musical Instruments Norfolk Chamber Music Festival Music in Schools Initiative Partner Institutions + Resources Quick Links For YSM Alumni Music Lessons Program Hire a YSM Student Music Teacher Hire a Yale Musician YSM Box Office Livestream Yale Sites Yale Department of Music Institute of Sacred Music University Libraries Arts Calendar Contact Us © 2022 YSM | All rights reserved.
