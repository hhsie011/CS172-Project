Made stronger by its deep and far reaching collaborations, the Hassenfeld Institute is led by and partners with key organizations throughout Rhode Island. Our core leadership resides under the following four institutions: Brown University’s School of Public Health, Hasbro Children’s Hospital, the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University and Women & Infants Hospital of Rhode Island. Researchers and child health professionals from other institutions, such as Bradley Hospital, The Miriam Hospital, and our community partners are also intricately involved. The work of our faculty and staff will enhance the understanding of the genetic, prenatal and early-life factors associated with children's health problems and will lead to novel strategies for prevention and treatment. Throughout, these strategies will involve careful coordination of medical care, social services and public health interventions. The discoveries in child health that are made here in Rhode Island will have broad applicability to other settings across the globe, thereby amplifying the Hassenfeld Institute's ability to improve population health and help children thrive. Mission The Hassenfeld Child Health Innovation Institute seeks to integrate research, clinical practice, public health efforts and educational programs to achieve the following four goals: Improve the health of children, making the communities we serve among the world’s healthiest places for children and their families Address the issue of poverty and how it impacts child health Serve as a national and international model for what can be achieved in child health Train the next generation of child health leaders About Mission & History Partners People Executive Committee Core Research and Evaluation Unit Faculty Scholars Data Core Survey Research Team Administrative Staff In the Spotlight Initiative Teams Scientific Committees Advisory Council Financial Team List of Faculty Hassenfeld Child Health Innovation Institute Hassenfeld Child Health Innovation Institute Brown University Box G S 121-4 121 South Main Street, Providence, RI 02912 Phone: 401-863-3855 Email [email protected] Twitter Twitter Facebook Facebook Instagram Instagram Info for study participants Subscribe to our monthly newsletter Brown University Giving to Brown Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA 401-863-1000 Contact Us Maps Directions Career Opportunities Campus Safety Accessibility All Social Media © 2022 Brown University | Back to top
