The case method places students in the role of decision-maker, confronting real-world business situations complete with the constraints and incomplete information found in real life. Teaching by the Case Method Preparing to Teach → Prior to each class session, instructor preparation involves careful planning of both content and process which includes: getting started , developing an instruction style, knowing your students, and planning the class session. Class Flow → Class flow provides a temporal dimension to execution as the instructor moves through time from pre-class arrival, to the opening, through sequences of questioning, listening, and responding, to transitions and, ultimately, to the closing of the class. Discussion Management → Discussion management issues cut across the entire class session, including the management of time, student participation and engagement, and the use of boards. Assessment & Feedback → Judging class success and assessing student performance, as well as instructor performance, are important components of any successful pedagogical environment and are compounded here by the importance of student participation and the shared responsibility between instructors and students in shaping the class session.
