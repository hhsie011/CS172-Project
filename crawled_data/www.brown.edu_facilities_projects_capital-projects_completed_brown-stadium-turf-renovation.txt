The turf renovation was made possible by the generous support of alumnus and Brown Athletic Hall of Fame inductee Richard Gouse '68, P'02, as well as many other Brown football fan donors. This project builds on the momentum of the BrownTogether campaign, the most ambitious fundraising effort in the University's history. Campaign priorities for Brown Athletics include facility enhancements and fully endowing varsity programs. R.A.D. Sports is leading the project in coordination with the Brown Facilities Management Office, Brown Athletics, and the Brown Sports Foundation. Click here to view the progress of the field construction.
