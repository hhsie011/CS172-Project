Printing, Copying, Scanning Printing Fee-based laser printing is available in all ISU Library facilities, via the campus-wide PaperCut (external link) system. Print jobs can be routed to either a networked laser printer or a networked photocopier. The general public may use a networked photocopier and pay with cash. For locations of printers and queue names for printing from your laptop, see the University Library's Printing webpage. Printing to a networked laser printer For a networked laser printer, the costs are charged to your university print subsidy (if applicable) or your University Bill. Charges are 5 cents per page for black & white, and 25 cents per page for color (when available). The Parks Library's only networked color laser printer is in the Learning Connections Center (Floor 1, Parks Library).

This option is currently available in the following locations: Parks Library: All public PCs (on all floors and tiers) are networked to a single black-and-white photocopier in the Learning Connections Center on Floor 1. For detailed instructions, see the Copying and Printing to the LCC Networked Photocopier handout [pdf].
