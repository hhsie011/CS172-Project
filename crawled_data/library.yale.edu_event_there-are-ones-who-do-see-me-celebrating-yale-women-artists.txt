Haas Family Arts Library 180 York Street New Haven, CT 06511 Open to: Yale Postdoctoral Trainees, undergraduate, Staff, Graduate and Professional, faculty, All Ages Description: As part of the celebrations of the 150th anniversary of Women at Yale, this exhibition highlights works by women who have graduated from the School of Art, Yale’s first coeducational school. The education of women has been a fundamental part of the School’s mission since its foundation. The initial bequest that made the School possible was a donation of Augustus and Caroline Street specifically for “a school for practical instruction, open to both sexes, for such as propose to follow art as a profession.” Drawn from Arts Library Special Collections, these artists books, prints, and photo books span the last six decades and offer a glimpse into the exceptional careers of 27 women artists counted amongst Yale University alumni. The title of the exhibition, “there are the ones who do see me” is a quote from Gertrude Stein’s How to Write (1931) as it appears in one of Eve Fowler’s (M.F.A. 1992) posters on display.
