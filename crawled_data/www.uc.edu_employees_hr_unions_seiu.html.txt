Its purpose is to discuss and resolve matters of mutual interest. Specific grievances and negotiations are not proper subjects for discussion in LMC meetings; the resolution of problems giving rise to grievances is a proper subject. Specific matters which are considered by the LMCs include, but are not limited to: health and safety, career paths, training & development, and dependent care issues. The LMC shall have no authority to modify in any way the terms of the collective bargaining agreement.
