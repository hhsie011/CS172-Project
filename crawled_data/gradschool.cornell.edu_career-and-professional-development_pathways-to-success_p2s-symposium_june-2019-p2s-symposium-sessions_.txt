But a richer reason is that communication is the essence of scholarship. Your research doesn’t become reliable knowledge until multiple audiences have heard it, played with it, reacted to it, engaged with you about it. In the process, you learn to identify what’s important about your work. You also gather information from multiple sources, get new ideas, new perspectives, new insights. Oh, yeah, and along the way you get some useful professional skills and satisfy your funders.

I will begin by framing revision as the most powerful route to better writing. The ability to revise our own writing improves not just the final writing product, but also the writing process. Having a good handle on revision helps us get started with a writing project and then move through the multiple iterations necessary for strong final drafts. We will consider different types of revision and establish the optimal way to sequence the revision process. Throughout this presentation, there will be opportunities to raise writing questions and to practice relevant strategies. Academic writing is a crucial and challenging aspect of the research process; during our time together, we will explore why it is so hard and how revision can help us become more confident writers. Workshop: Communicating Professional Boundaries – When and How You Can Say No! Janna Lamey Assistant dean for graduate student life at Cornell University Marika Nell Ph.D. candidate in civil and environmental engineering at Cornell University To manage your most valuable resource, time, you have to balance your professional and personal priorities. Since you cannot do everything, you need to learn when and how to say no. Through small-group discussion, we will describe common barriers associated with saying no and develop a list of criteria to help you determine when to say no. Finally, leave the session with strategies that can help you be more confident and effective in the art of saying no to others. Land Acknowledgement Cornell University is located on the traditional homelands of the Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' (the Cayuga Nation). The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
