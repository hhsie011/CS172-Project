They answer questions from prospective and admitted students, as well as assist in evaluating applications for admission. Enrolled students utilize graduate program advisers to oversee their progress through their degree program from first enrollment through graduation. Graduate program advisers are full-time resident faculty within their departments, so they understand the strengths and weaknesses of their department and where you might fit in, in terms of research interests and funding opportunities. However, please remember that graduate program advisers are faculty members, and it may take longer for them to answer questions during busy times in the semester and during the summer. If you are unsure about who to contact or have a general questions about graduate studies at TU, please contact the Graduate School at grad@utulsa.edu or 918-631-2336 or toll free at 1-800-882-4723 and we will be happy to assist you.
