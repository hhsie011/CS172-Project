Brown students are willing to take risks, so the classroom can become a place of exploration and exchange. Because students have chosen their classes freely, they are especially committed to the material. For this reason, Brown faculty report higher levels of satisfaction than their colleagues at comparable institutions. They also tend to be motivated to become better teachers, and to participate actively in our academic advising networks. This page provides information about policies and resources related to teaching and learning at Brown. Additional resources are available on the website of the Sheridan Center for Teaching and Learning.
