Testing Requirements for Transfer Applicants Standardized Tests Brown will extend our test-optional policy for transfer applicants through the 2022-2023 admission cycle. Learn more Sending Official and Self-Reported Test Scores to Brown If you have test scores to report, please either self-report your scores through the Common Application, upload them via your Brown Applicant Portal or have official test scores sent directly to Brown. Admitted transfer students who choose to enroll at Brown and have self-reported test scores will be required to submit official versions of those scores by June 15. Resubmitting Scores to Brown If you applied to Brown for freshman admission in the past and you wish to use the official test scores that you submitted with your prior application, then you do not need to resend those scores. English Language Proficiency English language proficiency must be achieved before a student is admitted. Brown does not offer courses in English as a Second Language for its undergraduates and does not accept, on a provisional basis, students who are deficient in English. We highly recommend that international applicants take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), the International English Language Testing System (IELTS), or the Duolingo and arrange for Brown to receive the official results. A minimum score of 100 on the TOEFL internet-based exam or 600 on the paper-based exam, a minimum score of 8.0 on the IELTS, or a minimum score of 125 on the Duolingo is expected in most cases. As your safety is our first concern, we do not expect you to sit for any of these examinations in person.
