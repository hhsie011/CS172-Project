Stories have come from a wide range of Cornell staff, faculty, students, alumni, and community members. They reflect diverse personal, cultural, religious, political, and philosophical beliefs and experiences. Each story is shared among friends and colleagues, traditionally over bowls of hot soup and bread. 2022 Speakers View this year's Speakers Bios, and watch the recording of their stories.
