Using an approach to education that fosters innovation, Clemson is preparing its graduates to be entrepreneurs in the workplace, and our entrepreneurs are consistently bringing technology and research findings to market. We have an economic development strategy built on listening to our partners, going to industries instead of making them come to us, and aligning our plans with the state’s economic priorities. Through public/private partnerships we have begun several unique campuses and institutes across the state of South Carolina that support research and economic development efforts.
