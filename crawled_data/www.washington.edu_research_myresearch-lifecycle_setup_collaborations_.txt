Now that your award document is here, it is time to formalize the collaborations with your team members outside the UW. If you are: Sharing information, data, or materials you may need to set up a Confidentiality Agreement (CDA), Dual Use Agreement (DUA) or Material Transfer Agreement (MTA). Working with a consultant who will provide specialized services on the project you may need a personal services contract. Collaborating with colleagues at other institutions you may need a Subaward agreement. Alternatively, you may be a member of a research team and receive an agreement from your external collaborator. For example, if you were part of another institution’s proposal, you can expect to receive an incoming subaward. Whether the agreement is incoming or outgoing, you will work with UW central offices on the review, approval, and processing of agreements for collaborations.
