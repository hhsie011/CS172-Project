When classes began at Baylor in 1846, virtually all were in disciplines now contained within Arts & Sciences, and the College was formally organized in 1919. The College of Arts & Sciences now consists of 25 academic departments and eight academic centers and institutes. The more than 5,000 courses taught in the College (in more than 100 areas of study at the undergraduate level) provide the largest portion of Baylor's nationally recognized core curriculum, the foundation upon which every student's educational experience is built. Arts & Sciences faculty conduct important research around the world. In pursuing new knowledge, faculty members create a community of learning that encourages their students to join them in the discovery and application of that knowledge. Because many valuable learning opportunities can take place outside the classroom, Arts & Sciences students are also offered numerous chances to pursue hands-on internships, national and international scholarships and study abroad. The College of Arts & Sciences is under the experienced leadership of its dean, Dr. Lee C. Nordt, and eight associate deans. Enrollment, 2020-2021 academic year The College of Arts & Sciences had 6,147 undergraduate (43 percent of Baylor undergraduates) and 689 graduate students (18 percent of Baylor graduate students) enrolled in Fall 2020 -- almost 38 percent of Baylor's record total enrollment of 19,297. The Arts & Sciences student body is diverse, coming to Baylor from 48 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and 67 countries outside the United States, and with an undergraduate minority enrollment of 44 percent. Academics About half of Baylor’s 1,096 full-time faculty members are from the College of Arts & Sciences. Most Baylor students must take courses offered by the College as part of their degree programs, and a large percentage of students go on to earn Arts & Sciences degrees. During the 2019-2020 Baylor academic year, 40 percent of undergraduate degrees and 17 percent of graduate degrees were from College of Arts & Sciences programs, representing 30 percent of all Baylor degrees. During 2019-2020, 75 percent of Ph.D. degrees awarded at Baylor were from programs in Arts & Sciences. Our faculty are affiliated with a number of special academic institutes and centers at Baylor, including eight institutes and centers within the College of Arts & Sciences itself.

Baylor has had 52 Fulbright Scholars since 2001, most of those coming from the College of Arts & Sciences. Students from Arts & Sciences have won other prestigious awards as well, including Truman, Goldwater, Gilman and Rotary Scholarships and National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowships. The Howard Hughes Medical Institute has chosen Baylor to join the Science Education Alliance, which engages Baylor students in scientific discovery on a national scale. Faculty in the College of Arts & Sciences have been awarded more than $5 million in grants and other funding to research and test new compounds and methods to both prevent and fight cancer. To help its students pay for their education, the College of Arts & Sciences has established 452 endowed scholarship funds with a book value of $54 million. University publications written and produced by Baylor Arts & Sciences students have a reputation for excellence, routinely winning top awards in national competitions. In 2018, the Society of Professional Journalists named Baylor's Focus magazine as the best college magazine in the nation, while the Roundup yearbook was awarded for overall excellence in Texas by the Texas Intercollegiate Press Association. Baylor's Model United Nations, Model Organization of American States and Model Arab League teams, advised by faculty from the College of Arts & Sciences, have an outstanding record of giving students experience in public presentation, debate, research and networking. During the past 25 years team members have won numerous awards in state and national competition. Baylor debaters have been taking home honors since the University's first intercollegiate debate in 1893. Since that time, Baylor has won numerous conference debate titles as well as three NDT national championships. To better serve the Hispanic population in the United States, Baylor's Department of Modern Languages and Cultures has developed a course tailored to meet the crucial need for medical professionals to cross language and cultural barriers. The course blends medical terminology in Spanish with practical, everyday speaking and an emphasis on cultural differences. Professor Robert Darden from the College of Arts & Sciences is the founder of Baylor's Black Gospel Restoration Project, a national effort to identify, acquire, preserve and catalog historic music from the black gospel music tradition that is in danger of being lost. Project materials are among the highlights of a permanent exhibit called Musical Crossroads in the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of African American History and Culture.
