These and other interests frame our faculty's scholarship and the opportunities we offer to students, through both collaborative and independent yet mentored student research. Some Questions We Ask How do empires rise and fall? What can we learn from ancient cities about patterns of resource use, labor, and political organization not only in the past but also as enduring features of the present? What does it mean to practice "traditional" medicine in the 21st century or to (re)invent tradition as a means of cultural survival, claims to sovereignty, or recognition of indigenous rights? How might we understand the meanings people ascribe to suffering and affliction and at the same time consider political-economic conditions that make some people more vulnerable, sick, or marginalized than others? How can the principles of comparative and integrative biology, human behavioral ecology, and an anthropological appreciation for the complexities of behavior tell us more about ourselves, our human ancestors, and primates – our kindred species?

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Anthropology Undergraduate Overview Major Modified Major Minor Global Health Minor How to Declare an Anthropology Major or Minor Courses Introductory Courses Archaeology Biological Anthropology Cultural Anthropology Independent Study Culminating Seminars Past Teaching Schedules Honors Program Honors Proposal Submission Form Transfer Credits Careers Alumni: Where Are They Now?
