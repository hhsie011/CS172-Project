The Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women celebrated Women’s History Month 2008 with an exhibit at the John Hay Library at Brown University. On display were materials highlighting the historical achievements of Brown and Rhode Island women as well as documents tracing the intellectual gains made by feminist theorists working in universities across the country. Spanning several generations of activists and scholars, the collection recognizes the courage and intrepidity of women who dared to challenge and thereby disturb the status quo–through interrogation, agitation, and persistence. Featured in the exhibit were the stories of such figures as Nancy Elizabeth Prophet, a Native-American/African American sculptor who battled with poverty as well as her own inner demons to create lasting works of art, and Annie Peck, who was refused admission to Brown in the 1870s but went on to become a celebrated mountaineer. The exhibit highlighted the successful efforts of Sarah Doyle, the moving spirit behind the Rhode Island Society for the Collegiate Education of Women, and the highly controversial work of such feminist scholars as historians Joan Wallach Scott and Louise Tilly and literary scholars Naomi Schor and Elaine Marks. Each of these theorists questioned conventional approaches to knowledge and contributed to making gender and sexual difference crucial categories of analysis. On display were artifacts bearing witness to the bold Pembroke College and Brown University women athletes who insisted on playing “men’s” sports such as hockey and activists who staged walk-outs to protest racial injustice on campus.
