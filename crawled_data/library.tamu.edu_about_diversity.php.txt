Skip To Content University Libraries About Us Diversity Matters Diversity Matters Diversity is a core shared-value of the University Libraries and part of the Libraries' Vision & Values. The Libraries' Diversity Plan complements the Texas A&M University Diversity Plan and ensures that we are on track as a model for diversity in the Texas A&M community. The University Libraries' Diversity Advancement Committee promotes diversity awareness and education, addressing diversity topics that affect both employees and the University Libraries' community, through programs and events. Working collaboratively with library administration, the committee also recommends priorities and actions to further foster an organization strengthened by its diversity. Recommendations are based on analysis of the Libraries culture including climate assessments from employees every three to four years. From student workers to administration, our employees create an inclusive environment where differences are valued and all individuals are welcomed.
