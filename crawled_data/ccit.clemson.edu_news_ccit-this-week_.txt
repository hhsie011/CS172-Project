This page will be updated throughout the week. Follow us on Twitter @ClemsonIT for daily information and timely updates. News Be aware of recent phone spoofing and gift card scams. University phone numbers are being used in a new Phone Spoofing campaign where cybercriminals are trying to trick our users into revealing information. In this latest campaign, the scammers were impersonating Clemson 656-xxxx numbers and targeting Clemson employees. Gift card scams, which typically target students in email phishing campaigns, are impersonating Clemson faculty and asking students for information. Typically, if you respond to the email, they will attempt to trick you into buying gift cards for them or disclosing your bank account information. Learn more about how to recognize these scams.
