Leading a European initiative, Friuli Venezia Giulia’s research institutions will now extend the open access approach to material research and nanotechnology and—on a more local scale—to industrial research with the Open Lab initiative. The Open Innovation System is a regionally funded and fully integrated initiative that brings together the principal actors in the innovation process to drive economic growth. This approach, developed in Friuli Venezia Giulia and successfully implemented in other regions of Italy, encompasses Technology Transfer, Valorization of Research Results, and Incubation of Start-Up companies, and has already gained international recognition at the European level.
