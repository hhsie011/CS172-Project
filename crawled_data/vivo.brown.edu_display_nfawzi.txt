In particular, we focus on 1) protein aggregates implicated in Alzheimer’s Disease and 2) liquid-liquid phase separated forms of RNA-binding proteins associated with inclusion formation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS / Lou Gehrig's disease) and frontotemporal dementia. He received undergraduate degrees in bioengineering and marketing at the University of Pennsylvania. He received a Ph.D. from the Joint Graduate Group in Bioengineering at the University of California, Berkeley and UCSF for his work with Teresa Head-Gordon on molecular simulation of protein aggregation, and completed postdoctoral training in the group of G. Marius Clore at the National Institutes of Health in biomolecular NMR spectroscopy of protein association and aggregation. Nicolas Fawzi joined the faculty at Brown in January 2013.

Full Text PubMed Research Research Overview My laboratory studies the structure, dynamics, and molecular interactions of protein granule assembly and protein aggregates implicated in neurodegenerative disease. Using a combination of novel NMR spectroscopy approaches and atomistic simulation supplemented by biophysical and imaging methods, we determine high-resolution structures of these species and their toxic interactions with other macromolecules and membranes, as well as their interactions with potential therapeutic agents.
