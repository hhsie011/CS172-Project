Chemical engineers participate in process of a multitude of industries including chemical, energy, biotechnology, electronics, and environmental. AIChE at Brown focuses on creating a community for students studying, or are interested in, chemical engineering. This student chapter prepares undergraduates for future career opportunities by holding an alumni panel and visiting a local industrial energy generation station. Students also attend the AIChE Annual Student Conference where they can compete in the student poster competition as well as meet with potential future employers at the recruitment fair. This chapter holds an annual Nitrogen Ice Cream outreach event in the spring, and is also planning to introduce a Boba Tea event this year (using chemistry to make bubbles!). It is FREE to register for AIChE as an undergraduate student. We strongly encourage everyone to sign-up to connect with the global community. 2021 AIChE Student Conference Attendees!
