Emphasis is placed on understanding normal and abnormal biological functions at the molecular and cellular levels. Using state-of-the-art biophysical technologies, research programs at the molecular level focus on understanding how proteins are synthesized, folded, assembled into functional macromolecules and trafficked throughout the cell. Reverse genetic approaches are used to elucidate the roles of newly discovered proteins and define functional protein domains. Research programs that bridge molecular and cellular levels focus on understanding mechanisms of basic cellular physiology (DNA replication, transcription, translation and protein sorting), molecules that control complex regulatory pathways (signal transduction, gene regulation, epigenetics, development and differentiation) and the molecular basis for cancer. Many faculty members have strong collaborative ties with Texas A&M University research groups in the chemistry and biochemistry/biophysics departments or belong to multi-disciplinary research groups affiliated with Texas A&M University, including programs in genetics, neurosciences and virology. Courses Molecular & Cellular Medicine graduate course descriptions can be viewed through the Texas A&M Course Catalog.
