These awards are intended to help raise the profile of our doctoral students and identify dissertations worthy of nomination for various national awards, including the prestigious Council of Graduate Schools / UMI Distinguished Dissertation Award. Awards are given each academic year for Humanities, Sciences, and Social Sciences. The winners will receive a $1000 cash prize and will be honored at the Outstanding Graduate Student Recognition Luncheon. A list of previous award recipients can be found here. Criteria To be eligible for the 2022 award, the dissertation must be defended and submitted to the Graduate School in time for commencement in August 2021, December 2021, or May 2022. Nominations Near the spring deadline for defense date, the Graduate School will issue a call for nominations. Graduate Program Directors are asked to submit one nominee per department. After receiving all of the nominations, the Graduate School will notify each of the selected students that their project has been nominated and is thereby recognized as the outstanding dissertation from their department.
