Life Insurance If you are currently participating in Columbia's life insurance plan, your group coverage will end upon retirement. You are entitled to convert to an individual life insurance policy from the insurer for any amount up to your current group coverage. You cannot be denied life insurance coverage due to your health status. This means that you do not need to complete an evidence of insurability (EOI) form when converting coverage. Please note that New York Life Insurance Company recently acquired Cigna Group Insurance (CGI). As part of this transition, Cigna has changed its name to New York Life Group Benefit Solutions. The transition does not impact your current coverage or access. Cigna Life will automatically send you a conversion notice and application when your retirement is processed. If you wish to convert your policy, you must complete the application and return it to Cigna. You are eligible for a life insurance benefit. The amount of life insurance depends on your union affiliation, upon retirement. Please refer to your collective bargaining agreement for details. Retirement Programs Whether you were receiving contributions from Columbia University to your University Retirement Plan or making contributions to your Voluntary Retirement Savings Plan (VRSP), the contributions will cease upon retirement but your funds will remain available.
