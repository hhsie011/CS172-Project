Whitaker Biomedical Engineering Building Giving Search Search form Search Portfolio Breadcrumb Home > Research > Research Areas > Biomedical Imaging and Instrumentation Biomedical Imaging and Instrumentation The biomedical imaging and instrumentation research focus area is centered on developing and evaluating new imaging methods and approaches, encompassing device and system development, novel methods of signal acquisition and reconstruction, synthesis of imaging contrast and therapeutic agents, algorithm design, and image processing and computational analysis. Core research areas include ultrasound, MRI, optical imaging, PET, functional and molecular probes, advanced image analysis methods, and clinical decision support. Biomedical imaging and instrumentation research acts as a bridge between the engineering work at Georgia Tech and the basic science and clinical studies at Emory. Much of our work is translational, with applications to cardiovascular disease, cancer, neuroimaging, image-guided interventions, immunotherapy, histopathology, and more. Core Competencies Instrumentation, architecture and design of imaging systems Diagnostic imaging and image-guided therapy Imaging physics, signal acquisition and image processing/reconstruction Imaging modalities including MRI, optics, ultrasound Imaging physics, signal acquisition and image processing/reconstruction Imaging contrast agents, theranostic agents, molecular probes and targets Integrated multimodal imaging and multi-scale imaging Advanced methods for image analysis, modeling, data science and informatics Research Focus Areas Biomaterials and Regenerative Technologies Biomedical Imaging and Instrumentation Biomedical Informatics and Systems Modeling Biomedical Robotics Cancer Technologies Cardiovascular Engineering Engineering Education Immunoengineering Neuroengineeing Application areas Neuroscience and neurology Cardiology and vascular diseases Infectious diseases Cancer diagnosis, image-guided therapy, and monitoring Guidance of interventional and surgical procedures Histopathology Latest News on Biomedical Imaging and Instrumentation research 3D in a Snap: Jia Lab Develops Next Generation System for Imaging Organoids Shu Jia Building Next-Gen Imaging for Live Cells with NSF CAREER Award His multiplexing microscopy platform aims for super-resolution, ultra-fast 3D images of cells Arvanitis, Jia Win Petit Institute Interdisciplinary Seed Grants Breaching the Blood-Brain Barrier to Deliver Precious Payloads Georgia Tech and Emory researchers use ultrasound to develop delivery system for potent RNA drugs The Science of Sound, Vibration to Better Diagnose, Treat Brain Diseases Multidisciplinary researchers uncover new ways to use ultrasound energy to image and treat hard-to-reach areas of brain Primary Faculty Costas D.
