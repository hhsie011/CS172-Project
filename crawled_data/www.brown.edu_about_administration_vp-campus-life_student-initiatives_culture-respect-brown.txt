The self-assessment is organized around six key pillars (Survivor Support, Clear Policies, Multitiered Education for the entire campus, Public Disclosures of Statistics, Schoolwide Mobilization with students, groups and leaders and Ongoing Self Assessment). These pillars outline a holistic framework to building infrastructure around interpersonal violence prevention and response. In alignment with the tradition of grassroots engagement at Brown, this initiative brings together campus organizers and practitioners who are engaged in advocacy, scholarship and support services university-wide. Current Campus Update February 2022: Creation and Fulfillment of Brown’s Individualized Implementation Plan The Individualized Implementation Plan (IIP) is a set of 10 specific goals, each aimed at improving a particular part of interpersonal violence prevention and response at Brown, that were identified during the evaluation process. After an evaluation for each of the six pillars, key takeaways were identified including strengths and opportunities. Based on the opportunities identified, 1-2 SMART goals per pillar were created. Once these goals were reviewed by NASPA to ensure they were both rigorous and attainable, they became our official IIP. The campus leadership team along with partners throughout the University are in the process of implementing these IIP goals, each of which has a designated lead and anticipated completion date.
