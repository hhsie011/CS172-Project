To fulfill this mission, Transportation Services has established the following goals: Acquire the type and number of vehicles necessary and appropriate to meet the needs of the faculty and staff to perform their duties. Rent the vehicles to qualified departments on either short or long term arrangements, whichever is most appropriate and economical, for their requirements. Manage the fleet in a manner that ensures the lowest possible operational cost while maintaining consistently high mechanical reliability. Organize a staff and maintain a facility which provides superior service, repair, reservation and dispatch, and administrative support to the University customer. Ensure that the service continues as a financially secure and self-supporting operation as it strives to achieve non-profit or break-even status. Maintain, repair, and dispose of the vehicles in a manner that brings the highest possible return on money spent. Establish policies and procedures that reflect the best way to operate the fleet with the customer in mind. Think independently and competitively to obtain the best ratio of dollars spent to miles driven.
