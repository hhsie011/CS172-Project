As participants move through the five modules of the seminar, they engage with colleagues from a variety of disciplines workshopping their course plans with one another. Registration is open to graduate students and postdoctoral fellows who have completed the Sheridan Teaching Seminar (Certificate I). Priority is given to advanced students nearing completion of their degrees. We also select participants to ensure disciplinary diversity. All participants are expected to be active participants in the asynchronous work for each module: discussion posts, responses to peers, timely assignment submission, and peer review of others submissions. Participants are expected to participate in at least four of five in-person sessions. If you are unable to commit to attending at least four of the five in-person sessions, please see the Sheridan Center website for our flexible workshop options, or to request an individual teaching observation or course consultation. Registration opens October 28 and closes on December 10; space is limited.
