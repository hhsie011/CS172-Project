In addition to the Undergraduate Program, the department offers a Doctoral Program in Theatre and Performance Studies, an MFA Program in Playwriting, and the Brown/Trinity MFA Programs in Acting and Directing. The department is also a part of the Engaged Scholarship Program at Brown University. The program offers undergraduate students the opportunity to study performance theory while simultaneously working with communities outside of the university to create and investigate socially engaged performance that tackles complex social issues.
