OSU’s College of Veterinary Medicine has several top priorities to help our students, faculty and veterinarians be successful in their animal care, research and growth. Give to the CVM Top Giving Priorities College of Veterinary Medicine Ranch | The OSU College of Veterinary Medicine Ranch is an off-site extension of the OSU Veterinary Medical Hospital specializing in equine and bovine breeding and reproduction services. This ranch is equipped to handle all aspects of large animal reproduction, both routine breeding work and more advanced techniques. Shelter Medicine Program | The Shelter Medicine Program is a surgical training of DVM students at the OSU College of Veterinary Medicine. This project will provide enhanced technology in new and existing classrooms and the teaching aids necessary to train the next generation of veterinarians. Clinical Skills Program | The program will engage students in hands-on learning experiences throughout the four-year program in a low-stress, low-risk environment. Students will augment curriculum offerings while minimizing live animal usage. Students will develop clinical abilities and improve skills over time through repetition using animal cadavers and simulated computer models.
