Harvard University offers temporary (contingent) staffing assignments and time-limited or term positions. Why Consider a Temporary Role? You need or want flexibility in your schedule. You’re looking for a new career path. You’re inspired by Harvard’s mission, and like the idea of working at one of the world’s leading institutions of higher education. You want to take on a project-based role. You want to network and build connections across the University Contingent Staffing Working on assignment at Harvard in a temporary (or contingent) role is a great way to get to know the University and gain valuable professional experience. We also welcome the return of former Harvard employees and retirees, who already know a great deal about Harvard’s campus, operations and programs, in a contingent role. New contingent work opportunities arise frequently. Harvard’s managed services provider for temporary staffing is DZConneX. DZConneX manages a network of temporary and staffing agencies that act as suppliers of contingent talent to Harvard. Through them, you can apply for temporary administrative, clerical, IT, lab/science, research, creative and operations roles at all levels. Additional information can be found on Harvard's Contingent Workers website. Time-Limited or Term Positions You can find time-limited or term positions on our job application portal, Harvard Careers. These positions are directly hired by individual University departments and they vary depending on the sponsoring unit. They are often an excellent way to connect with Harvard professionals in varied and multifaceted roles across the University.
