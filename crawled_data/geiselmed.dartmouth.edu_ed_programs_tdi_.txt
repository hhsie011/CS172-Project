The programs emphasize the need for understanding the health care system, using evidence to advocate for change and adopting scientific methods to serve the interests of patients. Dartmouth promotes a healthy skepticism of the "common wisdom" about health care and encourages students to accept findings and apply evidence only after a critical evaluation of its strengths and weaknesses. The Clinical and Health Services Research concentration provides the opportunities for students to Inform change in the U.S. health care system by conducting research in health and health care to create new knowledge, pushing science forward. The MS can be completed full-time in one year or part-time over two to three years. Masters of Public Health The Master of Public Health (M.P.H) degree is a unique program that explores the interface between traditional public health and the U.S health care system. Using an evidence-based approach focused on health outcomes and methods of analysis common to public health, students gain an understanding of the medical care and public health systems. With analytic tools of biostatistics, epidemiology and research methods, students learn to apply methods of quality improvement to initiate change, translate research findings into action, improve care and access to care and develop strategies to advance population health. Students gain knowledge through traditional classroom experiences, multiple opportunities in the field and through team-based projects with classmates composed of physicians, other health professionals and more recent college graduates. The MPH can be completed full-time in one year or part-time over two to three years. TDI Highlights TDI contributed three of the major concepts to the recent health care reform bill. In the past year, TDI was granted $64 million in sponsored research. Over 500 journalists have attended medicine and the media bootcamp conducted by TDI faculty to teach journalists how to report on medical information and findings more accurately and effectively.
