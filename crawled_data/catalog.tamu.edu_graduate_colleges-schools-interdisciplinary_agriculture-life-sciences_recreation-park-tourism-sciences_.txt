F. Petrick Graduate course offerings in the Department of Recreation, Park and Tourism Sciences are designed to generate and disseminate knowledge concerning the development, management and sustainable use of recreation, park, community, and tourism resources and opportunities. The focus of the program is on the relationships between people, recreational, community and tourism developments, and the natural resource base. The curriculum has five main areas of emphasis: recreation and park administration; recreation and natural resources management; tourism; community development; and youth development. The first emphasis deals primarily with the public sector, while the third deals primarily with the private sector. Recreation and natural resource management, community development, and youth development involve both sectors. Graduate study in these areas is interdisciplinary. Cooperative relationships exist with a wide range of outstanding graduate-level programs in the University. This provides students with an opportunity to structure an individualized program of study in the field of their choice. Courses selected within the department and in supporting fields are designed to serve the individual needs of students interested in teaching, public service, research, and administration of recreation, park, community and tourism developments. The Department of Recreation, Park and Tourism Sciences offers courses of study leading to the Master of Recreation and Youth Development (MRYD); Master of Science (thesis and non-thesis) and Doctor of Philosophy degrees in recreation, park and tourism sciences. The Master of Recreation and Youth Development program is designed for active and progressive youth development professionals. The MS thesis degree prepares students for advanced graduate study at the PhD level, which often leads to a career in university research and teaching. The MS non-thesis degree emphasizes professional development. It includes additional courses in the student’s selected field instead of a thesis. MYRD and non-thesis MS students may elect a professional internship.
