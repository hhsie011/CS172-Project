Student-Centered Approach Guide students to make choices that are deeply rooted in the students’ best interests and empower students to pursue professional opportunities and relationships that will be meaningful to them. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Recognize that each student is an individual that holds multiple identities and has had unique life experiences. Create an inclusive environment where all students feel valued, supported, and empowered. Sense of Possibility Encourage students to pursue their goals with optimism, to think boldly, and to greet new ideas openly. Hear from a Student Kaylee Drew, LSEHD '22 "I decided to nominate my supervisor for an Illumination Award because I wanted to formally thank her and recognize her for supporting and inspiring me. Her excellence in her own work and her dedication to uplifting me has inspired me greatly and set the example of how I hope to be as an aspiring professional. I know that I would not be where I am today without the support of my supervisor, so I was thrilled about the opportunity to nominate her for an Illumination Award so that she could get the recognition she deserves." Hear from Staff Maureen Simmons, Assistant Director, PreHealth Programs “Being nominated for the illumination award was a humbling experience for me personally as I took time to reflect on how many students I have worked with the past 7 years, across the gamut, from prospective freshmen, to current undergrads, and also with numerous alumni, in my role as Assistant Director in the Pre-Health Program. Our entire team is so dedicated to helping each student discern their path forward and to discover the best fit toward a future career which embraces their interests, talents, and attributes." Hear from Faculty David Goodman, PhD., Associate Dean for Strategic Initiatives and External Relations, LSED "I feel tremendously honored to participate in the lives of my students as they launch into their work in this world. It does not feel like labor to be joined to these amazing people and to witness where they are being planted. It brings me great joy and deep meaning to be a part of their journeys. So, when I received this award, it took me by surprise. That they thought to express their gratitude through this recognition means more to me than I can express." Nomination Process Print Nominations Students, recent alums (up to 2 years post-grad), faculty, and staff will be able to nominate faculty/staff from the start of the spring semester in January through March 23. Students and recent alums can nominate more than one faculty or staff member. The nomination form requires: First name, last name, and email address of the nominator. Whether or not the nominator wishes to share their identity with their nominee(s) or remain anonymous. Nominee’s role on campus (faculty or staff), first name, last name, email, department, job title, what topic(s) they helped their nominator with (see list above). A paragraph that provides specific examples of the impact the Illuminator had on the nominator’s career decisions and development (e.g. What has this individual done to mentor you through your decision-making, search, and/or graduate school planning process?). Nominators will be asked to indicate if/how their nominee has demonstrated the Career Center’s shared values of student-centered approach, DEI, and sense of possibility. Note: These excerpts will be shared with each nominee. Career Center leadership will review all nominations and determine which faculty and staff will receive this award. Nomination Review Criteria Is the nominee eligible (e.g. a faculty or staff member who works in a non-career services role within or beyond the BC Career Center)? Has the nominator provided clear evidence that the nominee helped them with their career development and planning? Has the nominator provided clear evidence that the nominee demonstrated a student-centered approach, a focus on DEI, or a sense of possibility? How to Submit Nominations must be submitted using the online form by Wednesday, March 23. Notifying Recipients After reviewing all nominations and selecting the award recipients, the Career Center will notify via email the nominee of their recognition and invite them to the recognition event towards the end of the spring semester.
