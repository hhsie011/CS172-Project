As last fiscal year’s actual administrative expenses were substantially less than the 14% budgeted, NWRDC will be issuing customer credits for the difference. Individual credits will be calculated based on each customer’s proportion of sales for FY 2020-2021. These credits may be used on either current or future invoices, but must be used before June 30, 2022. Look for an email from us with your credit memo in January!
