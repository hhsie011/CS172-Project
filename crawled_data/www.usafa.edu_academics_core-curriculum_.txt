In fact, achieving this balance is one of the most unique and critical contributions of the Air Force Academy to the officer corps. No other commissioning source can create the collaborative blending of rigorous academics, military training, character and leadership development, and competitive athletics than what defines the four-year experience cadets have at the Air Force Academy. Nowhere is the Academy’s commitment more evident than in the Core Curriculum, which all cadets are required to complete. As part of the Core, all cadets, regardless of academic major, complete 29 Dean of Faculty courses across a variety of academic disciplines, while also engaging in military training programs, participating in conferences and forums offered by our Center for Character and Leadership Development, and completing required Physical Education courses offered by our Director of Athletics. Importantly, these diverse programs are purposefully integrated to create a one-of-a-kind four-year experience that prepares our cadets to serve as commissioned officers in the Department of the Air Force.
