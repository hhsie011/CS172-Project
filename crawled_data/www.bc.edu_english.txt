Literature explores many of the enduring questions we confront as we grapple with our world. At the same time, it emboldens our capacity to re-imagine that world. The stories we tell matter, as does the language used to give those stories shape. Our programs explore the pleasures of reading and writing while strengthening skills in critical thinking and problem solving. Our faculty guide you in acquiring multiple literacies as you learn to interpret a wide range of texts and genres. Our programs prepare you for a wide range of existing careers; they also foster the adaptability to help you in careers that are still emerging.
