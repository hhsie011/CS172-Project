Rooted in a research collaboration between four strong academic departments (Applied Mathematics, Biostatistics, Computer Science, and Mathematics), the master's program offers a unique and rigorous education for people building careers in data science. The program is designed to provide a fundamental understanding of the methods and algorithms of data science, to be achieved through a study of relevant topics in mathematics, statistics, and computer science, including machine learning, data mining, security and privacy, visualization, and data management. The program also provides experience in important, frontline data-science problems in a variety of fields, and introduces students to ethical and societal considerations surrounding data science and its applications. Current Brown PhD students interested in applying for a doctoral certificate, see the doctoral certificate page.
