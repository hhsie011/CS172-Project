Otsuka Pharmaceuticals Novo Nordisk Merck: Savings Mothers, Giving Life Claritin/Bayer Hospital Decision-Making Simulation Otsuka Pharmaceuticals Novo Nordisk Merck: Savings Mothers, Giving Life Claritin/Bayer Hospital Decision-Making Simulation Merck: Savings Mothers, Giving Life Merck Phamarceuticals launched an ambitious program in 2013 to dramatically reduce maternal mortality in Zambia and Uganda. The multi-sectoral partnership was initially focused in eight districts in the two countries. Merck was interested in an independent, external evaluation to understand the real health impact of the initiative, and reached out to evaluation experts at Columbia Mailman to design a comprehensive program evaluation. Columbia researchers assessed the implementation of program interventions, assessed partnership and stakeholder engagement, identified best practices and barriers to implementation, and made strategic recommendations for phase 2 of the program. The evaluation confirmed significant reductions in maternal mortality and improvements in quality of care received in health districts in Zambia and Uganda, and the program was subsequently expanded to include Nigeria.
