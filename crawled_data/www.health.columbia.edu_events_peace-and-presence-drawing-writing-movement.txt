The program envisions a space where survivors feel held, understood without having to explain themselves, and given space to breathe and connect with one another in profoundly spiritual and experiential ways. Through its multi-faceted approach to mindfulness, movement and nurturing of one’s body, this program hopes to aid survivors to recognize and cherish their innate capacity to transcend trauma while being connected to a caring community of allies. Prompts are given to participants for them to describe the quality of the moment through a mindfulness lens.  As an example: Simple suggestions for drawing will be encouraged...with possible prompts for those who feel uncomfortable with drawing (i.e. blurry line for a hazy day, swirls for wind, etc.). Word prompts will follow to be peppered throughout the drawing created.  This will then be taken to movement, embodying the forces of nature that were drawn and written about.
