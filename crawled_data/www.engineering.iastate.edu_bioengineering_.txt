Iowa State University Biomedical Engineering Minor Program Menu Toggle Search Toggle Search CoE homepage BME Home Minor Requirements Participating Departments Research in BME How to Apply Contact Us Biomedical Engineering Minor Overview As an undergraduate engineering student at Iowa State, you can earn a minor to prepare you for a career in the biomedical engineering field. The biomedical engineering minor is a unique opportunity that gives you a multidisciplinary life sciences and engineering background along with a foundation that consists of core biology and engineering principles. Minor requirements build on two core biology courses with an introductory course on the application of engineering principles to biomedical problems. Because biomedical engineering draws on multiple engineering disciplines, the minor also requires students take a broadening course in an engineering field other than that of their major. You’ll finish the program with elective choices addressing biomedical applications within your particular department, which could include undergraduate research. Apply for the program today or contact us for more information. Ian C.
