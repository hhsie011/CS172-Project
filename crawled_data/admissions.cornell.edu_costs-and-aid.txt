We offer a robust need-based financial aid program, awarding aid based on the financial need of the family, ensuring that our financial aid funds are distributed equitably. The Office of Financial Aid and Student Employment is available to provide guidance, support and information for students and families interested in the financial aid process. Apply for Aid Applying for financial aid is a separate process from the admissions application. This means you will submit your financial information before you are aware of your admissions decision. Applying for aid by the financial aid deadlines will ensure that your financial aid award is available when you receive your admissions decision. We want you to have all the information you need before making the choice to attend Cornell.

We do not offer aid based on academics, athletic ability, or any other talent. Once Cornell determines your financial need, we are committed to meeting that need with options that include various grants, loans, and student employment opportunities. We work hard to be consistent in the way we consider your financial circumstances from year to year. If your family's financial circumstances remain relatively unchanged throughout your time at Cornell, you can expect a predictable financial aid package each year. Costs to Attend Cornell's estimated cost of attendance is based on tuition, fees, housing, dining, books, supplies, and personal items for a full-time student attending for both the fall and spring semesters. This cost depends on several factors, including which undergraduate college you apply to and if you are a New York state resident. Financial Aid Calculator All families are encouraged to use the Financial Aid Calculator, an online tool that will provide you with estimated eligibility for financial aid from Cornell.
