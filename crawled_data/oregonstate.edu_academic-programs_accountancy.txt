If someone isn’t keeping tabs on things, the company might just run out of gas. Business leaders look to accountants to explain how their organization is spending money, where revenue is coming from and which tax deductions can be legally claimed. Accountants also keep the back-end of the business rolling without hitches or delays — ensuring the numbers remain above board at all times. As an accountant, you’ll spend your days tracking daily financial transactions, while also keeping a strategic eye on the horizon. You hold the purse strings — paying employees, tracking cash flow and managing your organization’s most important assets. And when it comes time to scale up and seek outside funding, you’ll be the first person leadership asks for advice. Put your analytical mind to work. Become an accountant.
