Given the breadth of regulations and guidelines, research compliance is a shared responsibility between numerous University offices, including the Institutional Review Board, Institutional Biosafety Committee, Institutional Animal Care and Use Facility, University Laboratory Animal Resources, Office of Research Services, Center for Technology Transfer, and Environmental Health and Radiation Safety. We also work closely with the Office of General Counsel, the Office of Audit, Compliance and Privacy, and a number of School offices with oversight responsibilities for research. The Vice Provost for Research is responsible for Penn research compliance policies and procedures. Within the OVPR, the Research Integrity Office (RIO), led by an Associate Vice Provost for Research, has been charged by the Vice Provost for Research with management of the University’s Research-related Financial Conflicts of Interest Program and oversight of the Office’s commitment to Responsible Conduct of Research and Research Integrity. To better educate faculty, students, and staff in research regulatory requirements, the offices reporting to the OVPR also develop, implement, and oversee training and education programs.
