Richard, a speechwriter working in JFK’s White House, hasn’t slept in days – he’s overworked, terrified of nuclear annihilation, and even worse, he’s just been dumped. When the President asks him to write a speech declaring nuclear war (just in case!), it’s Richard who has a meltdown. Jupiter is a farce set during the Cuban Missile Crisis from both the US and Russian perspectives, mixing true history with fantasy to examine themes of self-determination, power, and the threat of nuclear war.
