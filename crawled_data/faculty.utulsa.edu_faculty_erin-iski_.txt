The first project is focused on understanding thin film formation and stability. This second project pertains to the origin of homochirality in biology, the preference for specific secondary structures of proteins, and the characterization of non-covalent supramolecular interactions. The use of ambient and EC-STM utilizes both the incredible molecular and atomic resolution of STM and the ability to apply the findings to real-world applications, since the data is obtained at ambient pressures and temperatures. The Iski lab has developed strong interdisciplinary collaborations in a variety of fields such as nanoscience, engineering, and biochemistry, and the TU Nanotechnology Institute. Students in her research group are trained in highly valuable scientific techniques, exposed to groundbreaking science, and obtain results publishable in notable scientific journals. Other notable collaborations include work with the Jet Propulsion Lab and examining a novel method for analyzing nano-scale surface redox chemistry of prebiotic mineral catalysts and the Erosion/Corrosion Research Center at TU, which is interested in understanding the fundamental principles behind the corrosion of steel.
