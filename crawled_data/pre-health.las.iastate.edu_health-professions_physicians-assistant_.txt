The number of hours varies greatly, so it is important to review the requirements of the schools to which you plan to apply. It is also important to understand what types of experiences PA programs count towards these hours. Some programs will require direct patient care while others will count shadowing. Additionally, some programs require paid experiences while others will accept volunteer hours. Because the number of hours can be very high, it is important to start exploring the requirements and gaining experience early in your preparation process.
