Students begin the course sequence primarily as AuD students and follow the clinical course sequence in the first three years. However, each semester, AuD-PhD students take at least one research-focused course (e.g., research design, statistics, research projects, etc.) per semester to expose them to research. The course sequence is modified to balance the clinical and research courses and reflect the student's interests while still meeting the requirements for both degrees. The PhD portion of the program requires that students work with a mentor. Information about our faculty and the research they do can be found here Students interested in this dual track must apply to each program separately and be admitted to both programs. Students apply using the common application system for Communication Sciences and Disorders (CSDCAS) for the Dual AUD-PHD Track. If you have questions about the process, email admissionscsd@memphis.edu.
