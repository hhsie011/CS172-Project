Login Welcome to the WellMD & WellPhD Center Since 2011, the Stanford Medicine WellMD & WellPhD Center has worked to advance the well-being of physicians and biomedical scientists. We’re jointly funded by the Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford Health Care, and Stanford Children's Health. Rather than place the onus of well-being on the individual alone, we work to orient the entire organization around creating the cultures and practices that reduce burnout and drive professional fulfillment. We focus on promoting well-being not only at Stanford but also on advancing the field globally, collaborating with leading healthcare organizations, associations, and societies.
