It works with a broad range of student, faculty, staff, and community constituents to help The University of Texas at Austin connect its intellectual resources to communities across Texas and offer education to those who may face the greatest challenges in accessing it. The Division focuses on four core pillars: campus culture, community engagement, education pipeline, and research. Inclusive Campus Culture The DDCE cultivates an inclusive campus culture that actively and intentionally engages diverse people, ideas, and perspectives to create a vibrant learning and working environment. Community Engagement UT Austin fulfills its mission by serving the people of Texas as a catalyst for positive social change. The DDCE accomplishes this goal by leveraging its intellectual resources to cultivate partnerships that address significant issues across Texas. K-12 Education Initiatives Children from underrepresented groups who are entering the Texas educational pipeline deserve both the opportunity to enroll and thrive in college. The DDCE is committed to increasing the success of students from PreK through 12th grade. Student Success Programs The DDCE offers the academic support, mentoring, and tutoring that students need to succeed at a tier-one university, obtain research experience, and gain exposure to graduate school.
