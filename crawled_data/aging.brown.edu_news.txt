October 20, 2021 Brown University researcher awarded NIH SenNet grant to investigate senescent cell microenvironments across multiple tissues The newly established NIH Common Fund SenNet Program was created to comprehensively uncover the characteristics of senescent cells across the body, across various states of human health, and across lifespan. The goal of SenNet is to provide publicly accessible atlases of senescent cells, the differences among them, and the molecules they secrete, using data collected from multiple human and model organism tissues. August 17, 2021 News from Brown Beware the ‘molecular parasites’ involved in aging and disease Brown researcher John Sedivy, lead author of a sweeping review article about transposons, explains what these mobile genetic elements are, how they are more harmful than benign and where their weaknesses may lie. June 12, 2021 Brown scientist to play key role in $10M study of cell structure in diseases, disorders and aging June 12, 2021 Brown researchers uncover novel mechanisms of osteoarthritis June 12, 2021 Marco DeCecco of the Sedivy Lab Published in Nature June 11, 2021 News from Brown After the FDA’s approval, what to know about the new Alzheimer’s drug Dr. Stephen Salloway, associate director of Brown’s new Center for Alzheimer’s Research who led clinical trials for the recently approved aducanumab, explained the key takeaways from the FDA’s headline-making decision. April 28, 2021 News from Brown With $30 million in support, Brown launches Center for Alzheimer’s Disease Research By bringing together biomedical research and discovery with world-class physician-scientists advancing care for patients with Alzheimer’s, the center aims to accelerate the pace of development for novel treatments and cures. December 10, 2019 News from Brown New grant will fund clinical trial of a novel approach to treating Alzheimer’s A major grant from the Alzheimer’s Association will enable researchers to test a drug that could reduce brain inflammation in Alzheimer’s patients and possibly slow the progression of the disease. February 6, 2019 News from Brown HIV drug could treat Alzheimer’s, age-associated disorders Research led by Brown found that blocking retrotransposon activity with a generic HIV/AIDS medication significantly reduces age-related inflammation in old mice and senescent human cells, providing hope for treating age-associated disorders. December 21, 2018 News from Brown Researchers detect age-related differences in DNA from blood The DNA markers from the blood of healthy centenarians are more similar to those of people in their 20s than people in their 70s. May 15, 2018 News from Brown Researchers find new way to stimulate cellular recycling process In research that could lead to future therapies for age-related diseases, Brown University researchers have found a new way to stimulate the process by which cells recycle their spare parts.
