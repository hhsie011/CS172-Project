Instagram Community Learning Teaching and Learning Teaching and learning are at the heart of what we do at HGSE — and what our students will do in the world. In addition to their academic coursework, students can delve deeply into their own practice, building skills in learning design, curriculum planning, classroom management, and much more.

Students can get involved with the TLL and apply what they are learning in their program in several ways, including internships, focus groups, and through the Teaching and Learning Lab Practicum course. Contact the TLL to find out how to get involved Instructional Moves Instructional Moves, a project of the Teaching and Learning Lab at HGSE, shares high-leverage teaching strategies used by Harvard faculty and demonstrates — through compelling video and resource kits — how to apply those same techniques in other contexts.
