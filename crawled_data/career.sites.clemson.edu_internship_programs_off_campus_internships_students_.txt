Now, more than ever, employers look to hire college graduates with internship experience in their field. Students should remember that while searching for an internship, there are criteria that University looks for before agreeing to award academic internship credit. For example, the opportunity needs to be tied to specific Clemson University majors or fields of interest, supervised by a professional working in the field, and the majority of the work needs to be non-administrative/non-manual labor. In short, a quality internship should outline either a strong shadowing experience with specific learning outcomes, or an assigned project with clearly stated responsibilities/expectations.
