Purpose: The purpose of this regulation is to define the process by which a faculty member may acquire a publisher complimentary textbook copy. 2. Definition 2.1. A "desk copy" is a complimentary copy of a textbook that a faculty member has selected for use in a class. The department or faculty member arranges for the delivery of these books by directly contacting the publisher or publisher's representative. Book publishers prefer that faculty members correspond with them directly to request desk and examination copies. 2.1.1. When requesting an examination copy, a student copy of the textbook should be requested, as an instructor's copy or text stamped Free Desk Copy cannot be sold. 3. Inability to Secure a Desk Copy 3.1. On occasion, a faculty member is unable to secure a desk copy in a timely manner. When this occurs, the Student Stores will loan the faculty member a textbook for a period of 60 days, if there is an immediate need. The new copy the instructor receives from the Publisher must be used to replace the loaned textbook. 3.1.1. When requesting a textbook desk copy from Dowdy Student Stores an authorization form must be completed, approved by the academic department, signed, and submitted to the store in order to charge the desk copy to the department. 3.1.2.
