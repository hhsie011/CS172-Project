As conservation technician at the John Hay Library, Erica H. Saladino has dealt with some unusual boxmaking challenges. She has designed and created housing for a wide variety of items ranging from miniature books to panoramic paintings, from 16th century monastic breviaries to contemporary artists' books. How an object is stored on a shelf has a direct impact on its condition. Ms. Saladino evaluates the individual preservation needs of each item as it comes into the lab and devises creative solutions for their long-term storage. This exhibit provided a brief look into the kinds of unique items collected by the John Hay Library and how the challenges of preserving them have been met.
