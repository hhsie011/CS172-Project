The day-long discussion is designed to introduce and establish an engagement between the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group and the City of Mumbai. C40 Cities is a network of the world’s mega-cities committed to addressing climate change by reducing both greenhouse gas emissions and climate risks. Mumbai is among the six Indian cities (Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore and Jaipur being the others) to have committed to being part of this global network, to develop best practices, facilitate peer learning, and engage in knowledge exchanges to cope better with the shocks and stresses of climate-related disasters. The workshop seeks to orient key policymakers and senior urban experts to the C40 Cities platform, explore initiatives in Mumbai that align with the objectives of C40 Cities, and collaboratively draw up a framework for future action. It will be led by Mr. Sanjay Sridhar, Regional Director for South and West Asia, C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group and Dr. Ravina Aggarwal, Director of Columbia Global Centers | Mumbai.
