It reflected on the absurdity of being. Each artist, in their own way, challenged the ‘socially appropriate’ norms and constructs. They confronted these issues by engaging in an expanded play. A play which can be, in turn, sculptural, performative, narrative and linguistic. Through reconstructing and reshaping that which is present, they created their own alternatives of what could be. m.i.o.k wished to set question marks around social consensus and norms. The artists works echo one unified conceptual methodology. Their uncompromising honesty, vulnerability and humor introduced new entry points to understanding a world and oneself within it. Supported by the Interdisciplinary Arts Council. m.i.o.k. m.i.o.k.
