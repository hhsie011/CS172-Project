If you feel there is an issue that leadership needs to know about, Baylor provides numerous reporting avenues. The list below is sequential in the order of escalation. Understand the reporting channels available and determine the most appropriate option for your needs. Academic Leader or Manager: Your supervisor, chair, or dean generally is the best person to partner with to find solutions, or to direct you to the best contact for the situation. If you do not feel it is appropriate to speak with your supervisor about the issue, there are many other options. Employee Assistance Program (EAP): A completely anonymous and confidential resource that offers counseling, resources and other support for personal and work-related problems and issues. Human Resource Consultant (HRC): HRCs provide employees, supervisors, and managers a forum for open communication to enable an excellent employment experience. Ethics Point: A simple risk-free way to anonymously and/or confidentially report activities that may involve criminal, unethical, or otherwise inappropriate behavior in violation of Baylor’s policies.
