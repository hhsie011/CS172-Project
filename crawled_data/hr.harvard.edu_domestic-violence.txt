Domestic violence can take place between spouses or adult partners, but it also reaches children, teens and elders. It can take many forms, including threats, intimidation, stalking, financial control, verbal abuse, sexual and other physical violence, and murder. Domestic violence cuts across all cultures, races, professions, education levels, religious affiliations and socio-economic classes. Domestic violence can move beyond a personal concern to an escalating problem for the wider family, the community and the workplace. Harvard offers these additional resources: Harvard’s Employee Assistance Program (EAP) (877-327-4278) Confidential consultation, assessment and referral, and short-term counseling to help staff, faculty and their household members. The EAP also provides unlimited consultation to managers and HR practitioners. Trained domestic violence counselors are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week by telephone. Harvard University Police Department (HUPD) (617-495-1212) The HUPD can help with a broad range of safety-related concerns. In addition to planning for a safe workplace, specially trained HUPD officers can assist with other steps toward safety such as considering and filing for restraining orders, understanding the court process and communicating with other police agencies. SafeLink (877-785-2020) This is a state-wide, toll-free, 24-hour hotline for those affected by domestic violence. Trained advocates provide support in English, Spanish and Portuguese, and have access to TTY and translation services to provide simultaneous interpretation in over 140 languages.
