Before they even finish their medical degree, our students are already making tremendous contributions to research and the community. The world needs what they have to offer and, because of philanthropic support, Brown can help meet that need. Financial aid is often the deciding factor for students when comparing prospective schools. Increased scholarship funding is essential for Brown to remain competitive in attracting the highest caliber candidates. A gift to financial aid for Brown medical students will: Support a pipeline of physicians prepared for the future of health care. Mitigate physician shortages by giving new graduates greater financial freedom to choose the best specialty for them, regardless of compensation. Diversify the physician workforce by making a career in medicine more accessible to the most gifted students, regardless of financial status. 71 % of medical students receive scholarship aid $ 44,500 average loan per student (each year) $ 154,473 average debt at graduation for a Brown medical student During their time at Brown, students are encouraged to pursue important and rigorous study beyond their regular medical coursework—experiences explicitly designed to prepare them to address the complexities of modern medicine. These experiences, supported by medical student research funds, are a vital part of the educational experience. But under our current financial constraints, Brown is only able to fund 76% of medical student requests for stipends to conduct research or present their work at national and international conferences. https://www.youtube.com/embed/-E_x9uovWR4 Opening Doors Krissia Rivera Perla ’15 MD’21 discusses her Brown experience to date and her plans to parlay her education and skills into better care for patients.
