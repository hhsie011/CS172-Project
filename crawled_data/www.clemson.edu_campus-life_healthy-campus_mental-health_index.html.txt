At Clemson University we acknowledge mental health as an important element of student health and well-being. We encourage you to learn skills to address mental health challenges and promote resilience and well-being. Check out our resources to learn how challenges impact college students and what practices support your mental health. Be Well There are many opportunities and events across campus that support positive mental health for our students. See our Be Well calendar here. Counseling and Psychological Services Students seeking services should call Counseling and Psychological Services at 864-656-2451 during business hours (8 a.m.-4:30 p.m.). Counselors will be available to conduct a brief phone screen to determine the best way to serve your needs. During this phone screen, students in need of assessment for services can be scheduled for an intake appointment. Based on this intake, the counselor makes recommendations for treatment that best meets the student's needs. This may range from a single session to skills-building workshops, online treatments or individual counseling.
