Texas Tech University Directory Raiderlink A-Z Index University Libraries Menu Search TTU University Libraries Document Delivery Document Delivery / Interlibrary Loan Document Delivery (Interlibrary Loan) allows users to request items held by Texas Tech Libraries and libraries around the world. This is a free service for faculty, students, and staff of Texas Tech & Texas Tech Law School. How does Document Delivery Work? Request anything any library holds. If we have what you need in our libraries or in remote storage, we'll find it and hold it for you. If we don't have it, we'll ask for it from another library. When your item is ready, you will receive an email sent to the address for your account. Physical items can be picked up at your preferred delivery site. Electronic items can be found in your Document Delivery account under "Electronically Received." Where is Our Office? Important Copyright Information The copyright law of the United States (Title 17, United States Code) governs the making of photocopies or other reproductions of copyrighted materials. Under certain conditions specified in the law, libraries and archives are authorized to furnish a photocopy or other reproduction. One of these specified conditions is that the photocopy or reproduction is not to be "used for any purpose other than private study, scholarship, or research". If a user makes a request for or later uses, a photocopy or reproduction for purposes in excess of "fair use," that user may be liable for copyright infringement. TTU Libraries reserves the right to refuse to accept a copying order if, in its judgment, fulfillment of the order would involve violation of copyright law.
