At regional and national competitions, teams are judged on construction speed, weight, and deflection for a prescribed loading scenario. The quality of fabrication and the aesthetics of the bridge are also considered in the final score. Students design the bridge for various loading cases using structural analysis software; constructability and fabrication must also be considered during the design. Each year, the bridge is fabricated by students at the Clemson Civil Engineering research facilities. Students cut, grind, and weld steel sections to create bridge members. University staff members coordinate with the team to help with equipment training and help fabricate some of the more complex parts. The assembly team is then responsible for the timed construction of the bridge. The team is made up of three to eight students who practice the staging and building of the bridge in preparation for the regional and national competitions. The Steel Bridge Team encourages undergraduate and graduate students to further expand upon structural design, construction management, and communication skills learned in the classroom. Steel Bridge challenges students and provides practical Civil Engineering experience that can be used in the real world.
