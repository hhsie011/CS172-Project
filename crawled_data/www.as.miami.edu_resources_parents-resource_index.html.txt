Life on Campus: The academic experience in the College and at the University is enhanced by a rich residential environment and setting that inspires students to complement their academic focus in a number of ways. It is with this in mind that the University offers programs and services that encourage students to participate in and contribute to the broader campus community. Moreover, our students bring a diversity of experiences, beliefs, and identities to bear on their studies and their lives outside the classroom, all of which contribute to the multicultural profile representative of University of Miami students.
