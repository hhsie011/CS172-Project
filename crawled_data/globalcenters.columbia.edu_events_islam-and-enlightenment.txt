Stanislawski specializes in modern Jewish history and European intellectual history. He received his B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. from Harvard University. His publications include Zionism and the Fin-de Siècle (2001), Autobiographical Jews (2005), and A Murder in Lemberg: The Assassination of the Reform Rabbi Abraham Kohn (2007). He also serves as director of the undergraduate program on human rights, and as the chair of the interdepartmental program of Yiddish studies. He is currently working on a cross-cultural study of the notion of religious tolerance in the early modern and modern eras. Rahul Markovits is maître de conférences in early modern history at the École Normale Supérieure. His work focuses on the circulation of people, texts, objects and cultural products on a transnational scale during the long 18th century. His PhD dissertation was awarded the 2012 Baluze prize in local European history. It was published under the title Civiliser l’Europe. Politiques du théâtre français au XVIIIe siècle (Paris, Fayard, 2014). His current projects include an examination of the global ginseng trade in the 18th century and a micro-history of four brothers travelling from India to London in the 1790s, which tries to make sense of what it was to be a trans-imperial subject on the move in the age of revolutions. Jean-Luc Chappey est Maître de conférences en Histoire moderne à l'Université Paris 1- Panthéon Sorbonne. Il est spécialiste de l'histoire politique et intellectuelle de la révolution française ainsi que de l'histoire des circulations et des transformations des savoirs en France et en Europe au 18ème et 19 ème siècles.
