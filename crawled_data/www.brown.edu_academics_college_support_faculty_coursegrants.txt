Mini-grants support small-scale projects, materials, or activities in undergraduate classes. Larger grants are available to develop new undergraduate courses or revise existing courses in ways that promote strategic initiatives. Brown faculty, including emeritus faculty, are eligible to apply. Recipients will typically be expected to report on their funded activities and the outcomes of the curriculum (re)design.

Funds may be used to support guest speakers, to purchase materials for a course, and to finance class field trips (see the University Policies on course-related travel, and, if necessary, download student travel waiver forms), among other expenses. Given our institutional commitment to equity and inclusion of all students regardless of available financial resources, we urge instructors to consider including requests for expenses that students might otherwise incur, including costs related to student projects and research. With the exception of September, when the volume tends to be highest, faculty can expect to hear back within approximately two weeks. Faculty who have received a grant during a given academic year may submit another proposal after March 1 if additional funds remain. Community-Engaged Course Development Mini Grants provide up to $500 to support the integration of community-engaged learning activities, such as guest speakers, and field trips, into existing courses.
