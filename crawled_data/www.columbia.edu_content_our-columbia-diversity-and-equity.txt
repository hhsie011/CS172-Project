At the same time, through our research, study, and action, Columbia is dedicated to finding solutions that address systemic injustice and inequity in our society. This important work requires our sustained commitment and collective focus. Across the University, in our schools, centers, institutes, and departments, many efforts—longstanding and new, and supported by deeply committed individuals—are dedicated to this critical task. This site seeks to provide a hub so that these efforts may be fully represented and visible across the Columbia community.

Bollinger committed Columbia to expanding and building upon existing diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives to fully become an antiracist community.
