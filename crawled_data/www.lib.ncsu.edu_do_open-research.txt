Practices like open science, digital humanities, and public/applied scholarship are introducing new forms of research outputs (pre-prints, data papers, enhanced monographs, experiential scholarship) and increasing the impact of scholarship in the public sphere.

We are also well-versed in a wide scope of the research tool landscape, and happy to investigate support for products beyond this list. ORCID - A persistent identifier – an ORCID iD – that distinguishes you from other researchers and acts as a mechanism for linking your research outputs and activities to your iD. Integrating into many publishing and grant funding platforms. The NC State implementation of ORCID is called Citation Index. Zenodo - A general repository for any form of research output. Sponsored and supported by CERN and the European Union, automatic DOI creation for every object, versioning, and the ability to choose a variety of open licenses for each individual object. Zotero - An open source citation management tool. Integration with Google Docs and featured one-button formatted bibliography output. Overleaf - An online LaTeX and Rich Text collaborative writing and publishing tool. Includes versioning for tracking changes and templates for many forms of academic writing, from CVs and bibliographies, to lab reports and journal articles. Hypothes.is - A collaborative annotation tool in the web browser. Ability to annotate webpages and PDFs, create public or private groups for labs, international collaborations, or classrooms. Dryad - General repository for data publishing. Assigns DOIs to datasets, and features usage and download tracking. Open Science Framework - A research collaboration hub for managing and publishing a project, especially gathering all project assets (data, code, presentations, publications, documentation) in one place. Interoperable with many common tools (e.g. github, Google Suite), and includes ability to create a DOI for a project. PubPub - An open source, hosted, community publishing platform. Built for modern academic publishing, including versioning, integrated peer engagement (reviews, comments, annotations), exportability to many formats (LaTex, EPUB, HTML), and the ability to create various forms of publications (journals, proceedings, books, etc.) Disciplinary archives - Sites like ArXiv, BioArxiv, EngrXiv, Humanities Commons, SocArxiv and more offer community maintained and governed options for sharing pre-prints, conference posters, and other research outputs. Most also assign DOIs to submitted objects. Spaces Data Experience Lab (DXL), D. H. Hill Jr. Library Need Help?
