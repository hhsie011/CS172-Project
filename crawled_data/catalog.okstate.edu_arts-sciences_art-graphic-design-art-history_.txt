Undergraduate Programs Graduate Programs Minors Faculty The Department of Art, Graphic Design and Art History offers courses for students who are interested in the visual arts or wish to major in studio art, graphic design or art history. Minors are also available in studio art and art history. Fields of concentration include drawing, oil painting, printmaking, graphic design, electronic media, photography and digital media, ceramics, jewelry/metalsmithing, sculpture and art history. The Bachelor of Art (BA) includes options in art history and studio art that can be combined with teacher certification; the Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) is a professional degree with options in studio art or graphic design. In order to qualify for graduation, art majors must have grade-point averages in Art Department courses of 2.50 for a BA in Studio Art, 3.0 for a BA in Art History, and 2.75 for a BFA in Studio Art or Graphic Design. Students who wish to major in graphic design must have a minimum overall GPA of 2.75 to enroll in 2000-level graphic design courses. As of Fall 2019, Students must have taken or be enrolled in two 2000-level graphic design courses (ART 2413 and ART 2423) and completed their foundations level studio art classes (ART 1103, ART 1203, and ART 1303) before their sophomore portfolio review, which is scheduled each spring semester. Students who wish to transfer into the graphic design program with earned credit in these courses are subject to the same review and must submit portfolio materials with application for admission into the program no later than April 1. This portfolio review determines which students are qualified to proceed to 3000-level graphic design courses. Students who pass the graphic design portfolio review are furthermore required to purchase a MacBook Pro laptop computer for use in the classroom and at home. Specifications are available on the Department’s website, http://art.okstate.edu. The Department of Art, Graphic Design and Art History is able to offer substantial scholarships at all levels, freshman through senior, on a competitive basis. The Gardiner Gallery of Art in the Bartlett Center for the Visual Arts, the Department’s main building, hosts up to ten exhibitions per year. Exhibitions include the work of faculty, students, and national and international artists. Students and faculty also curate special exhibitions in the Gardiner Gallery.

Over the course of the semester, we will examine the visual culture of social dance in order to gain insight into its historical functions as a tool for social cohesion, intercultural exchange, protest/activism, and identity formation, among other things. Through the practice of these dance forms, we will add an experiential component to our analysis of the roles that social dance has played in American culture over time. Same course as DANC 2563.

The Master of Arts Degree in Arts History This program differs from most traditional art history programs through its emphasis on intercultural connections, globalism and transnationalism. The program includes a broad geo-cultural spectrum with six full-time faculty members who specialize in the art of the Americas, Europe and Asia. In partnership with the OSU Museum of Art, Postal Plaza Gallery and the Gardiner Gallery of Art in the Bartlett Center, students may also take coursework and gain hands-on training in museum and curatorial studies. The MA degree requires a minimum of 30 hours of graduate coursework, a thesis and a defense. Students will select two geographic areas of concentration within the five currently offered in the Department of Art, one to be the major area and the other the minor (the current areas are Europe, United States, Latin America, East Asia, and the Islamic World). A selection of courses, both lecture and seminar, will be taken in these areas. At least one course outside the department will be in the major area. Generally, the master’s thesis will relate to the cultural connections between the major and minor areas. There is also a 36-credit non-thesis option. An additional museum and curatorial studies graduate certificate is also available as an option to students. Art History Admission Requirements All applicants must complete the online application (including the submission of transcripts, fee, and for international students, TOEFL scores), to be found at grad.okstate.edu. In addition, applicants should also submit three letters of recommendation, a statement of purpose and a writing sample (5-10 pages; an excerpt from a longer work is acceptable). Prerequisites include five undergraduate courses in art history; foreign language experience is also recommended. While many applicants will have majored in art history, the MA program welcomes applications from graduates with bachelor’s degrees in other fields. MA students may take prerequisites during the program; however, they will not count toward the 30 hours required for graduation. The Master of Fine Arts in Graphic Design This program specializes in a unique combination of Interaction Design, Motion Design and Visual Communication. Interaction Design and Motion Design in particular are among the most rapidly expanding areas in the field of graphic design. This is a three-year, sixty credit hour, terminal degree that will develop students’ expertise as graphic designers in Interaction Design and Motion Design, while developing their research, presentation and writing skills. MFA graduates will be able to respond to both the creative demands of the graphic design profession and the research and teaching requirements of academia. Graphic Design Admission Requirements All applicants must complete the online application (including the submission of transcripts, fee, and for international students, TOEFL scores), to be found at grad.okstate.edu. In addition, applicants should also submit three letters of recommendation, a statement of purpose and a portfolio of 15 to 20 examples of work.
