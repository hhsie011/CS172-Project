Full Text Research Research Overview Our group works in the field of nanophotonics at the interface of electrical engineering, materials science, optical physics, and physical chemistry. In particular, we study how light is emitted from a range of solid-state quantum emitters (including atoms, defect centers, ions, molecules, and quantum dots), and we develop new ways to control and enhance the process of light emission for photonic devices.
