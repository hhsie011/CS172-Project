Know your loan servicer and/or lender. Once you borrow your first federal student loan, you will be assigned a loan servicer. Your loan servicer should reach out to you via email or postal mail, not by phone. You can find out who your loan servicer is at the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS). Protect your personal information. Make sure you keep your passwords, account numbers and sensitive paperwork in secure locations. Don’t leave personal information where it might tempt someone to take it. Look out for phishing. Never give out your personal information like social security number or date of birth to someone who randomly reaches out to you via email or phone. Unless you can be absolutely sure of who is on the other end receiving this information, it’s best to protect it. In regards to your student loans, when in doubt call your loan servicer/lender directly. If it feels too good to be true, it just might be. If you randomly receive an email or call stating that you can have your loans discharged or the balance reduced and it feels too good to be true, follow your gut instinct. Call your loan servicer/lender directly and discuss your options. Unless you have met certain loan forgiveness requirements, loans are not discharged or reduced. More information on avoiding student loan scams can be found through the Federal Student Aid website.
