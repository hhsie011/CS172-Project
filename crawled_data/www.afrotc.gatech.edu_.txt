Welcome to the home of Air Force ROTC's Detachment 165, based out of the Georgia Institute of Technology and host to 11 cross-town schools in the metro Atlanta area. Since its inception in the 1920s, Detachment 165 has commissioned over 1,700 officers for the United States Air Force and was recently ranked in the top 10% of AFROTC detachments nationwide. The key to our success is simple, and can be identified easily as the three core values of the Air Force: Integrity First, Service Before Self, and Excellence in All We Do. Detachment 165's mission is to train cadets and develop leaders who will excel in the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Space Force and go on to positively impact their units, their airmen, and the world. â€” 165th Cadet Wing Commander, Fall 2021 What is AFROTC? Air Force ROTC is a college program that prepares you to become a future officer in the United States Air Force or United States Space Force. In AFROTC, you'll learn the fundamentals of effective leadership and apply those lessons in real-world environments and exercises. AFROTC cadets earn commissions as active-duty Air Force and Space Force officers upon graduation and go on to serve in rewarding careers across the globe. Learn more What does a typical training day look like? Training occurs on Tuesdays and Thursdays. A typical day begins in the morning with an hour-long physical training (PT) session. Cadets then shower and change into the uniform of the day before heading off to ROTC classes taught by active-duty cadre. Freshman and sophomore classes are one credit hour (meeting once a week), while classes for juniors and seniors are three credit hours (meeting twice a week). After class, leadership laboratory (LLAB) begins. LLAB is led by junior and senior cadets and overseen by cadre. LLAB applies lessons learned from class in a hands-on training environment. Subjects include marching and drill, small unit tactics, group leadership problems (GLPs), field training exercises, guest lectures, and more. After LLAB wraps up, cadets are free to attend normal college classes. Learn more How do I enroll? Ready for the challenge? Enrollment information for next semester can be found at the link below.
