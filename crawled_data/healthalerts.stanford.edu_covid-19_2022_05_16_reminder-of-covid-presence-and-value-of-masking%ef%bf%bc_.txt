So, with the university resuming more and more traditional campus activities and operations, we need to remain vigilant in our efforts to minimize COVID spread. In recent weeks, the number of positive student cases has been 144, 221, 160, 249 and, most recently, 167. Our analysis of campus wastewater has shown significant peaks and valleys in COVID levels associated with the university community. These numbers and the presence of circulating variants make clear, as Bay Area public health officers stressed last week, that COVID has not gone away. We want to remind you that Stanford continues to strongly encourage protections such as masking, regardless of vaccination status, both indoors and in crowded outdoor settings; unvaccinated faculty, staff and postdoctoral scholars are still required to wear masks and test twice per week. Masking continues to be required in classrooms, with exceptions for individuals while speaking; on Marguerite buses; and in healthcare facilities, including Vaden Health Center and Stanford hospitals and clinics. Community members should continue to test whenever you experience symptoms, become concerned about possible exposure or return to campus from travel. Any faculty, staff, postdocs or students should notify the university in the event of a positive test. We are fortunate to have a highly vaccinated community and are grateful for the countless steps you take each day to follow public health protocols. Thank you for all that you do to support health, safety and wellbeing at Stanford.
