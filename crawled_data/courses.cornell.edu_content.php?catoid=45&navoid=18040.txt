Other Costs In addition to the fees outlined above, there are other costs associated with attending Cornell including room, board, books and supplies. Tuition Refund Policy Amounts personally paid for tuition may be refunded if the student requests a leave of absence or withdrawal from the office of the dean of his or her college of enrollment. The date of this request will determine the tuition liability for the semester. All students refer to the “Proration Schedule for Withdrawals and Leaves of Absence” below. Repayment policy. Students receiving financial aid from the university who withdraw during a semester will have their aid reevaluated, possibly necessitating repayment of a portion of aid received. Repayment to aid accounts depends on the type of aid received, government regulations, and the period of time in attendance. Cornell is authorized to offset any credit balances against any debts owed by the student to the university. Students enrolled in classes which begin before the official “Instruction Begins” date on the academic calendar will have their refund percentages adjusted according to the day ranges listed after the date ranges. The day ranges are calendar days that include weekends and holidays. Proration Schedule for Withdrawals and Leaves of Absence* This schedule is based on the 2021-2022 academic year instructional calendar as of press time of June 30, 2021. Any changes to the instructional calendar may necessitate changes to the proration schedule as well. The most up-to-date proration schedule can always be found at Leaving and Withdrawing.

Electronic billing (E-billing) is the official method of billing. Paper bills will not be sent. Tuition and room and board charges will be billed in July and December and must be paid before registration. The due date for these semester bills will be August 7 for the July billing and January 7 for the December billing. All other charges, credits, and payments will appear on monthly statements. It is possible that some charges will not be listed on the first bill and will appear on a subsequent monthly bill. A student must be prepared to pay any charges appearing on a subsequent bill even though the student receives a financial aid stipend before the charges are billed. All payments are due by the 7th of the month; all payments must be received by that date to avoid finance charges. Payments are not processed by postmark. The Office of the Bursar conducts all business directly with the student. Monthly charges, as well as any awards, grants, scholarships, and loans, are listed and billed under the student’s name. Refund checks and direct deposit refunds are also drawn in the name of the student. Cornell is also authorized to offset any credit balances against any debts owed by the student to the university. Payments The Office of the Bursar acts as a clearinghouse for student charges and credits that are placed directly on a student’s bill by several departments and offices of the university. Because the Office of the Bursar does not have detailed records concerning many items that appear on a bill, students should contact the office involved if they have questions. An individual who has outstanding indebtedness to the university will not be allowed to register or re-register in the university, have academic credits certified, be granted a leave of absence, or have a degree conferred. University policy precludes the use of any current financial aid for payment of past-due charges. The Office of the Bursar offers several payment options. The preferred method of payment is electronic payments via CASHNet. Paying online via the CASHNet supports Cornell’s sustainability efforts. Other methods of payment are: the monthly Cornell Installment Plan, wire transfers, college savings plans, and third-party billing (for sponsored students). We accept check payments by mail, and check or cash payments in person. For further information, students should contact the Office of the Bursar, Cornell University, 260 Day Hall bursar@cornell.edu; tel. (607) 255-2336, Mon-Fri 10:00am-4:00pm; fax (607) 255-6442; www.bursar.cornell.edu. Bursar account information may be viewed in real time on Student Center, Student Essentials or CASHNet.
