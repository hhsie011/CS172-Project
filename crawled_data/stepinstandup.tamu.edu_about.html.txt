Stand Up. has been created to bring awareness to our community and encourage others to share our message. Aggies step in as active bystanders to prevent sexual harassment and sexual violence and stand up to support survivors. It creates opportunities to change the culture, the perception and the conversation. Created through the diligent and passionate efforts of the faculty, staff and student leaders of Texas A&M University, this campaign is a promise, a statement and a pledge — all in an effort to reduce incidents of sexual assault and sexual violence. We firmly believe that one incident of sexual violence is one too many. We will serve and protect others in alignment with Texas A&M University’s Core Values: excellence, integrity, leadership, loyalty, respect and selfless service. We hope you'll join us.
