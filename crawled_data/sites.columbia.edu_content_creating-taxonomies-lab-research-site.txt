You can add pages as needed at any time. However, setting up your taxonomy first will save you a lot of time down the road. Many pages use taxonomy in their setup. If you create these pages before creating the taxonomy referenced, you will need to go back and update the page later or, in some cases, not be able to create the page in the first place. For the Lab / Research Columbia Sites website, there are four taxonomy groups that need to get set: News article taxonomy terms: topics People profiles taxonomy terms: positions, groups Publication: publish type, research projects From the main menu, click Shortcuts and then Taxonomy to see all the taxonomy categories. Explanation of terms News Topics: Used when creating a news article. This creates a news kicker above the article title. People Profiles: Used when creating a person profile. These terms become the mechanisms from which users can sort profiles. Publish Type, Research Projects: Used for creating publications. These terms become the mechanisms from which users can sort the list of publications. Click List terms for the taxonomy you want. Click Add term if you need to create another item for the category. Add terms. Click Save. TAXONOMY IN ACTION News Profiles Publications Questions About the User Guide If you have any questions about the user guide, send an email to the Columbia Sites working team.
