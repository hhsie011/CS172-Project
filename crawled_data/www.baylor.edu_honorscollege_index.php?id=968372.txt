Harry and Anna Jeanes Academic Honors Week marks one of the annual highlights of our spring semester. Now in its thirtieth year, the week features thesis research presentations by seniors, a celebratory banquet for Honors Program and University Scholars Program seniors and their mentors, and the Academic Honors Convocation. During Convocation, we recognize outstanding students from departments across the University, honor Phi Beta Kappa inductees, and announce the Cornelia Marschall Smith Outstanding Professor of the Year. Together, these activities bring commendable attention to transformative undergraduate education at its best. The following faculty member and students deserve recognition for their accomplishments.
