Countries have invested trillions of dollars to prop up food systems that are unsustainable for farmers and for the planet. For example, a coffee farmer receives about $0.07 on average for a $2.80 cup of coffee (Specialty Coffee Association), and 23% of global GHGs are attributed to agriculture and land use (IPCC). We see opportunities to create food systems that support food sovereignty, facilitate adaptive and climate-friendly farming methods, and fit within local ecosystems, economies, and communities. However, transformation will require rethinking governance and the investment of financial, human, and technological resources in food systems. Join research experts, engaged students, and leaders from the private sector and civil society for a thought-provoking session focused on enabling transformation in food systems. Participants in this event will learn about key successes and critiques of the UN Food Systems Summit and explore real-world examples of cross-sector partnerships that transform food and energy systems to work better for all people and the planet. Moderated by Andrew Revkin, Founding Director, Initiative on Communication & Sustainability, The Earth Institute, Columbia Climate School Speakers: Jessica Duncan, Associate Professor at Wageningen University. IPCC for food systems, sustainable and regenerative food systems, policy and governance transformation.
