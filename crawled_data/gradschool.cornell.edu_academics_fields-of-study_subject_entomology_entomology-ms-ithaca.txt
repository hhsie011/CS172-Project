Students in Entomology are expected to communicate research findings orally and in writing. We expect students to… develop oral communication skills, including the ability to present research and/or extension and/or outreach material in a way that is compelling and audience appropriate. Beginning in the second year, students are expected to give a presentation in either JUGATAE or the January symposium at least every other year.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
