Contact: Yale University Library 203-432-1072 Time: Thursday, June 2, 2022 - 12:00pm to 1:00pm Location: Online Open to: General Public, All Ages Description: Topography is central to William Hogarth’s canonical progress series, in which London settings play a decisive narrative role. Lesser-known works by the artist, however, also engage with topographical representation. Pierre Von-Ow’s online exhibition “William Hogarth’s Topographies” considers the artist’s illustrations of national and colonized geographies beyond the metropole. Among international topographical views are Hogarth’s illustrations of Sápmi in the Scandinavian north, referred to at the time as “Lapland.” Artist Joar Nango and art historian Mathias Danbolt will discuss the legacy of historical representations of the Sámi and also their reworking of colonial archives in the service of Indigenous Sámi self-determination. https://walpole.library.yale.edu/programs/seminars-workshops Tags: Diversity and Inclusion, Arts and Humanities, Cultural and International, Talks and Lectures View full description on Yale Events Calendar Upcoming Events William Hogarth's Topographies: A Series of Conversations Mondays at Beinecke: Edmund White in Conversation with Bill Goldstein Mondays at Beinecke YAAA Book Club Discussion - On Juneteenth Mondays at Beinecke Mondays at Beinecke Readings of the Declaration of Independence and Frederick Douglass's 1852 Oration View All Events > Library News > Exhibitions > Facebook Twitter Instagram YouTube Site Navigation Find, Request, and Use Help and Research Support Visit and Study Explore Collections About Us Ask Yale Library My Library Accounts Hours Yale University Library P.O.
