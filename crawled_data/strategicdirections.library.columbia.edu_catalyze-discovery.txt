As vital collaborators in Columbia’s research ecosystem, we work with our academic colleagues to instigate new inquiry and support evolving investigations. The Libraries build dynamic information systems that enable our scholars to create, preserve and disseminate their research in the most nimble, open and broad-scale ways. Through our technical infrastructure, outreach efforts, and deep subject expertise, we integrate a libraries-wide network of research support services and programs into project collaborations. We marshal a unique array of human and information resources to enrich research processes, nourish creativity, and further understanding of our complex multi-disciplinary world. We pursue responsibility for multi-stream data identification and management. We develop strategies and champion initiatives that expand access to Columbia scholars’ research outputs to the broadest possible global audience. 2018 - 2019 Accomplishments With the Office of Research, Columbia University Information Technology, the Faculty of Arts & Sciences, and the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science, introduced a new Foundations for Research Computing training program to increase the computational skill sets of graduate students With the Provost's Advisory Committee on the Libraries, conducted a survey of faculty, researchers, and graduate students to better understand current practices involving research data, assess campus need for data management services, and identify potential gaps in existing services 2017 - 2018 Accomplishments Conducted an assessment of digital scholarship activities throughout the Libraries to better address the needs of students, faculty, and researchers With faculty advisers, examined the need for a central Libraries space to provide access to specialized hardware, software, expertise, and training for the University community, enabling interdisciplinary digital projects and partnerships Columbia University Libraries 535 West 114th St. New York, NY 10027 (212) 854-7309 [email protected]
