Students take courses in the architecture foundation program for the first two years of study then focus on preservation theory and practice in the third and fourth year. This program is well suited for students interested in research and application of architectural and historical knowledge. The degree offers an introduction to historic preservation and the agencies and frameworks within which preservation is carried out locally, nationally, and internationally. Coursework examines a number of global, national and local case studies. Students undertake an in-depth capstone research investigation of a selected case study to employ research methods utilized in preservation. Dedicated group work areas, woodshop, digital fabrication, and digital lab spaces allow for in-house research drawing, modeling, and digital visualization. Graduates of the program will be equipped to work under the supervision of an architect or an architectural historian to document historical buildings, undertake archival research or other more general aspects of architectural practice not requiring licensure. Graduates are prepared to apply for graduate studies in architecture, historic preservation or a related discipline. Sasha W.

Rome Option Students who plan to study abroad are encouraged to meet with an advisor as early as the freshman year. While the grid below suggests appropriate coursework, a semester abroad would require using free electives that ordinarily would be taken in other semesters. It will take careful planning with an advisor to ensure that the degree is completed as efficiently as possible, and that courses normally taken in the spring of junior year on Main campus are completed before the semester abroad. ARCH 3241 counts as an Architecture elective.
