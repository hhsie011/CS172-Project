Posted in Uncategorized Selected 2020 Summer Work Posted on August 29, 2020 by Wen Xing Summer 2020 is special. It is special for several reasons. This was the first, as well as the last time, I believe, for us to have Dartmouth ASCS 60.07 “Chinese Painting, Poetry, and Philosophy” course online. Here, we are pleased and proud to share our summer work: The order of the above paintings is random. They are selected representative parts of our hard work. Of course, none of them is perfect. But who cares? Each of them presents one (or more) particular aspect(s) of writing poetic Chinese literati painting in the context of Chinese yinyang cosmology. This is what we care. Posted in Uncategorized Selected 2019 Summer Work Posted on August 25, 2020 by Wen Xing It has been one year. However, “better late than never.” Yes, Professor Xing is lazy–he apologizes. But he never forgets your wonderful work. Never. Your success is proportional to your effort. Thank you. Posted in Uncategorized Proud Artists Posted on August 22, 2019 by Wen Xing Early submissions of the finals. Can you believe we started to write ink bamboo paintings just four weeks ago? Really take pride in our work! More coming soon! Posted in Uncategorized Summer Chinese Calligraphy and Painting at Dartmouth Posted on August 15, 2019 by Wen Xing We are approaching the end of the summer 2019 Chinese painting and calligraphy study with Prof. Xing at Dartmouth (ASCL 60.07 & 62.01). We never had enough time to discuss traditional Chinese calligraphy, painting, poetry, philosophy and religions in class. It is amazing how much we have achieved in three-week training of writing Chinese ink-bamboo painting (ASCL 60.07) and six-week practice of all the major scripts in Chinese calligraphy (ASCL 62.01). Prof. Xing says that there will be no surprise, as always, for him to see how amazing our final projects will be.

Posted in Uncategorized Professor Li Xueqin Posted on March 28, 2019 by Wen Xing Today is a birthday anniversary of the late Professor Li Xueqin 李学勤 (March 28, 1933 – February 24, 2019), one of the most important scholars in the field of early China. He was Dartmouth’s Montgomery Fellow in fall 1998. As a distinguished paleographer, his calligraphy is unique and archaic. Professor Li Xueqin will be greatly missed and forever remembered.
