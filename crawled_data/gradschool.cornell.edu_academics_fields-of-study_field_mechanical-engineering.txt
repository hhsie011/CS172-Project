The faculty is particularly strong and active in biomechanical engineering, fluid dynamics, turbulence, combustion, thermal systems engineering, multiphase flows, energy and power systems, transport processes in microgravity, mechanical systems and design, control and robotics, dynamics and control of space structures, mechanics of materials and materials processing, materials microgravity sciences and computational mechanics. The Ph.D. programs provide advanced levels of training suitable for students pursuing careers in research and development, education, or advanced engineering analysis and design. The field does not admit students into an M.S.-only degree program; applicants may apply for the Ph.D. program directly from a bachelor's degree. Doctoral degree candidates must take a qualifying examination in addition to the examinations required by the Graduate School. Teaching experience for two semesters, normally satisfied by a teaching assistantship, is required of Ph.D. students. The professional degree of Master of Engineering (Mechanical) provides a one-year course of study for those who want to develop a high level of competence in current technology and engineering design and who plan to practice engineering in industry or professionally. The program has a thirty-credit curriculum and requires an engineering design project. Though the M.Eng. curriculum is flexible, many students choose to specialize within one of the the following MAE focus areas: Astronautics Biomechanics Dynamics, Controls and Robotics Energy and Sustainability Mechanics of Materials Thermal-Fluid Sciences The formal requirements for obtaining an M.Eng. degree are outlined here. The M.Eng. degree is typically self-funded by the student. There are a handful of fellowships at the college level (typically one per field, or one out of ~80 students). There is also partial support as a TA for a small percentage of students. Application: Applicants should hold a bachelor's degree in engineering or the physical sciences. All applicants must submit GRE general test scores. Submission of GRE subject test scores in engineering, mathematics, or physics is strongly recommended. Admission is offered only for the fall semester, except in unusual cases. A field brochure is available on request from the graduate field office.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
