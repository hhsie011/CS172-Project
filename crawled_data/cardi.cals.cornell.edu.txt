Working with an extensive and diverse network of partners including Cornell Cooperative Extension, Cornell faculty, policymakers and community partners, CaRDI fostered trust and informed decision-making on social and environmental issues at the local, regional, and state level in support of Cornell University’s civic engagement and Land Grant mission. Via applied research, trainings, seminars and workshops, publication series, and critical engagement with policymakers and practitioners, CaRDI’s impactful applied research and outreach worked to strengthen the capacity, resiliency, and sustainability of communities in New York State. In 2020, the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell created the Department of Global Development to foster critical interdisciplinary research, teaching, and extension focused on the many urgent development challenges of our time. While “CaRDI” as an Institute was retired, the applied and engaged approaches used by CaRDI over the past three decades in focal areas such as food systems, energy transitions, demographics, environmental sustainability, community & economic development, etc., will be leveraged within this new local-global framework, as well as by new collaborative opportunities with a broad array of disciplinary perspectives. A key feature of the Department of Global Development will be an emphasis on engagement – between students, practitioners, communities, researchers, and policymakers - both in New York State and around the globe. This approach builds on the strong engagement legacy of CaRDI, with appreciated acknowledgement of our extensive network of stakeholders, partners, and collaborators. We look forward to strengthening these partnerships as we continue developing the new Global Development project. The Cornell Farmworker Program, Lead NY, Rust2Green, and the Rural Schools Association will continue on as programs within Global Development. hmm1 [at] cornell.edu (Heidi Mouillesseaux-Kunzman), dlk2 [at] cornell.edu (David Kay), and rmb18 [at] cornell.edu (Robin Blakely-Armitage) will focus their efforts on building initiatives that contribute to engaged learning, engaged research, and engaged policy and practice opportunities in the new unit. We invite you to be part of this new initiative, and to reach out to us with questions or ideas for collaboration. For more general questions, please contact mmh285 [at] cornell.edu (Matt Hayes), Director for Communications for Global Development. Previous CaRDI resources will be archived and available on the new department website later this fall. We will keep you up to date on publications, workshops, seminars, research projects, student engagement opportunities, and more, via new communication methods which you will have the choice to receive or not. Thank you for your contributions to CaRDI initiatives over the years; we are excited to write the next chapter with you.

CaRDI helped me connect to interested communities...and navigate the political and social factors in communities moving toward sustainability. I believe this helped communities to work toward sustainability and it certainly broadened my perspectives. Al George, Professor, Department of Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering, Cornell CaRDI has been a valuable resource for me over the years… bringing greater sophistication to the analysis of municipal data. Sharing results back-and-forth has led to greater insights and better data products. Additionally, the State-of Upstate Conferences have been helpful in bringing a variety of viewpoints together to focus on critical statewide issues. Janet Mayo, NYS Office of the Comptroller The Community and Regional Development Institute at Cornell University has been an invaluable asset for town officials seeking to make informed public policy decisions. From agriculture to workforce development, CaRDI has provided direct assistance through seminars, policy briefs, articles, workshops and round tables on a wide range of topics affecting towns throughout NYS. Christopher Anderson, Director of Research, Association of Towns of the State of New York The NYS Water Resources Institute has been fortunate to have worked with CARDI on shale gas and water infrastructure issues. CARDI’s involvement helped us to understand and address these issues from a community development perspective, and has facilitated presentation of a wide range of Cornell faculty research on sustainable water infrastructure, as well as contributed to this research through assessment of New York’s Smart Growth Act.

A combination of factors are increasing pressure on local and regional water resources infrastructure – reduced federal assistance, increased local fiscal stress, increased susceptibility to climatic events, and the concern over water supply and quality – underscoring the need for sustainable community development strategies and policies that address these issues from a variety of perspectives. The 2014 Community Development Institute will bring together a diverse group of local government officials (elected, appointed, & staff), CCE Educators, practitioners, economic developers, community leaders, and University and college faculty in the region. The 2014 Institute is co-sponsored by the Cornell University’s Community and Regional Development Institute (CaRDI) and NYS Water Resources Institute. The institute will focus on water resource infrastructure, economic vitality and smart growth. Over the two-day period, participants will engage in dynamic discussions and workshops to promote informed decision-making in support of sustainable community and economic development, support innovation and forge new partnerships, improve regional water quality, integrate scientific, economic, planning, governmental and social expertise, and to build comprehensive strategies for public asset and watershed management. Informed Communities, Informed Decisions (2013) CaRDI’s Community Development Institute: Informed Communities, Informed Decision focused on critical pieces of the community development process, and was designed for a diverse audience of local government and school officials, CCE Educators, practitioners, and other community leaders. Topics addressed included: framing the various approaches to community development; how recent socioeconomic and demographic trends impact NYS communities; resources for accurate community-level data; the role of leadership in strengthening community capacity; and how these approaches and resources can lead to informed decision-making. Special sessions focused on supporting recent initiatives in agriculture and food systems, community and energy, shared municipal and school services, and regional community and economic development. Over the two-day period, participants engaged in dynamic discussions, exercises, and trainings which form the heart of CaRDI’s mission – to promote informed decision-making in support of sustainable community and economic development.
