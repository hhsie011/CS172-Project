Information for Parents Welcome parents of prospective and current CSUF students. Our website will provide you with extensive information about financial aid at CSUF. College can be expensive and overwhelming but we are here to help. CSUF ranks No. 1 among regional universities in the West for students graduating with the least amount of debt, according to the U.S. News & World Report (Sept. 2014). We also partner with other campus departments to postpone payments for campus tuition, campus fees, and on-campus housing for eligible financial aid recipients.
