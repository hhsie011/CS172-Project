You can obtain your Baylor ID Number here. 2.

To access email on other devices, see more information on the Baylor Email TechPoint webpage. If you have any problems or questions, call the ITS Help Desk at 710-HELP/4357. After your Bear_ID has been activated, please begin checking your Baylor email on a regular basis. We will be using your Baylor email address to send all future correspondence including registration instructions and orientation information. Financial aid, cashier, and other Baylor departments will also be sending important messages to this account. 3.

To register for classes, manage time cards, view your payroll information, update your personal information, etc., through BearWeb, you must enroll with Baylor's Duo two-factor authentication platform. 4. Register for Classes BearWeb is the online service that students utilize to register for classes, check final grades, look at your transcript, and access your time-card (if working on campus). Once you have set up your account, you will be able to register for classes for the upcoming semester. For detailed information on registering for classes, please visit the MSW Registration page. 5.
