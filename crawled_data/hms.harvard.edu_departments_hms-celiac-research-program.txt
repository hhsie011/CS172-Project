With more than 30 years of combined clinical, research and education experience, the three organizations are sharing their expertise to advance research initiatives and education about celiac disease and other gluten-related disorders, including non-celiac gluten sensitivity and wheat allergy. The HMS Celiac Research Program brings together a dynamic group of physicians, researchers, nurses, dietitians and educators who engage in monthly collaborative meetings to review cases, present research topics and develop educational programming. The group hosts a monthly webinar series that is open to the public and features the world’s leading experts on celiac disease, related autoimmune conditions and nutrition.
