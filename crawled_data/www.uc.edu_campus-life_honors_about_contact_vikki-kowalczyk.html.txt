I love traveling and feel like I grew up on the road. Ohio is the 5th state I’ve lived in. I’m originally from Northern Michigan and North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee have been stopping points in my life. Having lived in a few different states and traveling as much as I have, you may notice that I picked up a variety of sayings and accents. Even though I have lived in southern, warm states and cities, winter is my favorite season. My partner and I love hiking and have also ventured out to try camping with our dog. I have completed 2 half marathons, but 5k and 10k runs are my favorite distances. I was one of those high school students who knew exactly what they wanted to major in, so I selected my college and moved states in high school with this goal in mind. Life happened during college and fall of my junior year I changed majors and started researching graduate programs. My activities, jobs, and mentors in college helped me figure out who I am and find my passion for working with college students. I’m excited to be guiding College of Engineering and Applied Science (CEAS) students through their UHP experiences. Ask me about... Shadow, my dog Dancing in a holiday parade in Charleston My “back-up” career plan What I’m reading My Lego collection Fun Fact I don’t need caffeine Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value.
