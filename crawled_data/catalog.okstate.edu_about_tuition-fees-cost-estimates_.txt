Sciences, MS Comparative Biomedical Sciences, PhD Veterinary Medicine, DVM Home/ About the University/ Tuition, Fees and Cost Estimates Tuition, Fees and Cost Estimates Tuition and Fees It is important that students carefully consider the total cost of financing their education, from the entering term to the completion of their degree. If financial help will be needed beyond those funds which the student or the family is able to provide, the student should make the necessary applications for financial assistance well in advance of enrollment. Students should pay particular attention to early deadlines for application for grants, scholarships, and work-study positions. While the needs and resources of each student differ, the University can provide a general list of fees and expenses normally encountered. Students are given information at the time they complete their enrollment on the procedures and deadlines for payment of tuition and fees. (See "Financial Obligation" in the “Bursar” section of this Catalog.) The required tuition and mandatory fees for resident and nonresident students at Oklahoma State University are listed below. Resident and nonresident tuition rates are based on the course level and program delivery. All course offerings are listed by four-digit numbers with the first digit indicating the course level. Undergraduate courses are all courses with a first digit of 0 through 4. Graduate-division and professional courses are all courses with the first digit of 5 or above. New freshmen who are Oklahoma residents are given the opportunity at the time of enrollment to select a guaranteed tuition rate that is locked in for four years. To maintain this rate, students must remain continuously enrolled as full-time students. The lock tuition rate is included in the undergraduate tuition and mandatory fees grid and detailed information is provided on the Office of the Bursar website at bursar.okstate.edu/lock-tuition-program. For the most recent student costs refer to the Office of the Bursar website at http://bursar.okstate.edu/tuition-and-fees. Included in this section is information regarding fee definitions, refund policies, and residential life rates. Tuition and fees are subject to change without notice, as provided by the University Board of Regents and OSRHE policies. Starting fall 2014, OSU implemented a new block rate that includes tuition and University-wide fees for undergraduate students taking 12 to 18 credit hours. The “block” rate is one of OSU’s strategies to help students stay on target to finish college in 4 years. University-wide fees (also called mandatory fees) include: student activity fees, student facility fees, library automation and technology fee, health services fee, student development fee, Daily O’Collegian fee, academic records and maintenance fee, academic excellence fee, transit/parking services fee, advising/assessment fee, university technology infrastructure maintenance fee, academic facilities, life safety and security fee and student union renovation fee. Academic Service Fees such as specific course fees and/or college based fees are not included in the block rate and continue to be charged on a per-credit-hour basis. Additional block rate information is available at: blockrate.okstate.edu.

Nonresidents will also be charged nonresident tuition per credit hour. Mandatory Fees for Special Services All students pay special fees each semester to contribute to the betterment and general welfare of the campus community. Students regularly enrolled in the University are assessed facility, health, and activity fees that entitle them to use the Student Union, the Colvin Physical Education Center, and the Health Clinic, and that provide support for student governance, organizations, and programs. The activity fees provide partial support to such programs, services, and organizations as the Student Government Association, collegial student councils and related student organizations, Allied Arts, fine arts, athletics, intramural activities and sports clubs, minority student organizations, and the Student Activities office. The academic facilities fee funds renovation, maintenance, operations, and construction of classroom and other academic facilities necessary to support contemporary instruction and the demands of growing enrollment. The academic excellence fee provides for new faculty positions and/or helps increase existing faculty salaries up to peer averages. The academic records and maintenance fee provides for the basic graduation cost, the maintenance of the academic record system and issuance of official transcripts. The advising and assessment fee provides for skills assessment and evaluation of students' capabilities at various stages of their academic careers, and to get feedback from students regarding their course work. This fee also supports the commitment to academic advising within each college to create a collaborative decision-making framework which students can identify and realize their educational goals. The goal is to preserve personalized advising services, reduce the advisor/student ratio in high demand areas and to develop advising technology such as degree audit systems to support an increased graduation rate. Support is also provided to students with career development, employment and internship services, including expanded interview opportunities, placement preparation, and other programs related to success after graduation. The health services fee is assessed for comprehensive health and pharmacy services. The library automation and technology fee defrays the cost of equipment, software, and other aspects related to operating the online computerized library service. This fee also protects student access to heavily-used electronic journals and other information services. The life safety and security fee provides for the assessment and continued implementation of campus safety measures that includes the "Code Red" emergency notification system to notify students and staff via voice mail, e-mail or text messages should there be an emergency situation. It also helps fund positions within the OSU Police Department. The O’Collegian fee supports the production and distribution of the newspaper, the Daily O’Collegian, which is an award-winning campus newspaper. The transit and parking services fee assists with maintenance and operations of the OSU Transportation Services. The student development fee is used to support student participation in orientation efforts which are linked to recruitment and retention of freshmen as well as transfer students. Development and leadership opportunities for minority students will also be provided by these resources. It is also used to support campus life to cover costs for the guest speaker series, Student Union programs and the Student Union Activities Board. The university technology and infrastructure maintenance fee provides for the maintenance of existing facilities, and the expansion and development of central and collegiate facilities, software, and multimedia capabilities. This fee also covers increasing costs in multiple areas, including network and system infrastructure, hardware and software costs and communications. Certain groups of students in special courses may be on campus for very short time intervals or may be required by the University to reside away from the campus area for the entire semester. Such students will be prevented from participating in campus activities and will not be charged student activity, health, student development, and transportation fees when enrolled: only in a specialized course(s) offered for a special interest group and not in any other course(s) in the University or in a course(s) which requires that the student reside out of area for the entire semester or summer session (clinical laboratory science, geology and forestry summer camps, etc.). Other extenuating circumstances may be cause to consider denying use of and charge for these facilities or participation in activities sponsored by these fees.

These courses typically are student travel courses and other special approved programs such as classes within a consortium agreement with an external institution.

Tuition and fees are final when the course is proposed by the related academic unit and approved by Academic Affairs prior to the first day of the course. Students may contact the College Outreach Office within the academic unit offering the course or contact the University Outreach (405-744-1000) to determine tuition and fees for a course. Other Expenses Books and supplies used by the student are available in the Student Union Bookstore at reasonable prices and may be charged to the student's Bursar account. Additional incidental and personal expenses such as clothing and entertainment will depend upon the individual student. Sponsored International Students Oklahoma State University charges a special administrative/management fee for sponsored international students and scholars who require third party billings and need extra assistance or whose sponsors have indicated a requirement for supplementary assistance beyond that of regular university programming. The customary sponsored student fee is $350 per semester. Sponsored programs may also include items such as special training, research costs, equipment, enrichment, required travel or any other needs deemed necessary by the sponsor. It is the charge of the Office of International Students and Scholars (ISS) to provide the most complete and appropriate educational program for sponsored international students and scholars. The ISS sponsored program is designed to coordinate, expedite and administer all aspects of procedures pertaining to related training. Sponsoring agencies should direct all matters to the Office of International Students and Scholars, 250 Student Union. E-mail may be sent to karen.sebring@okstate.edu. The fax number is 405.744.8120. Tuition and Fee Waivers for Faculty and Staff Permanent, full-time, active members of the faculty and staff who meet the requirements under University Policy and Procedures 2-0108 or 3-0744 are eligible to enroll for credit or audit one course per semester or a maximum of five hours during normally scheduled working hours and receive discounted tuition and fees as indicated below. To be eligible under this fee policy, an employee must submit a completed Request for Faculty-Staff Fee Waiver form to the Office of the Registrar prior to the beginning of classes. If the form is not on file prior to the beginning of classes, the student will not be granted the waiver in fees. There is no limit on the number of courses a staff member may enroll in after normal working hours. If enrollment does not exceed one course, only the department head's approval is needed to receive a fee waiver. If the staff member is enrolled in more than one course, his or her dean and vice president must also give approval for a fee waiver. For eligible full time 100% faculty or staff enrolled in University courses, the following fees will be waived: Student activity fees Student activity fee - Athletic fee Health Services fee Transit/Parking Services fee Student Development fee Daily O'Collegian fee Faculty and staff must pay 50% of the general tuition, 100% of any additional fees not listed above, as well as 100% of any special course charges.

For faculty and staff members who enroll in NOC-Stillwater courses, the fees listed above may be waived, but no tuition is waived. For more information, contact the department offering the course to determine whether the tuition waiver applies. Any individual 65 years or older may audit a class at no charge. The audit fee is also waived for faculty and staff who have retired from the University under the Oklahoma Teacher Retirement System's "Rule of 80" or "Rule of 90" regardless of age at time of retirement. Refunds Refunds and deposits that may be due a student will be first applied to encumbrances owed to the University. Drop/Withdrawal Refund Policy A student dropping a course: prior to the end of the sixth day of a regular semester, or the third day of the eight week summer session, or during the proportionate period for block or short courses, will receive a 100-percent refund of tuition and fees. A student dropping a course: after the sixth day of a regular semester but prior to the end of the second week, or after the third day of the eight week summer session through the fifth day, or during the proportionate period for block or short courses, will receive a partial refund of tuition and fees. A student dropping a course: after the second week of the regular semester, or after the first week of the eight week summer session, or during the proportionate period for block or short courses, will not receive a refund. (See Policy and Procedures Letter 02-0206.) The institution may be required to return Federal Title IV aid for students who received Title IV aid disbursements and subsequently drop/withdraw. If the institution is required to return Title IV funds, the student will be required to pay for the institutional charges originally paid by the aid returned. Please visit the Return to Title IV policy. Repayment Policy Financial aid is considered to be used first for direct educational costs (tuition and fees) and, if the student is in University housing, for room and board. If a student financial aid recipient withdraws and is eligible for a refund of tuition and fees and/or room and board, all or part of this refund will be used to reimburse Title IV federal financial aid program(s); state programs which apply to tuition (i.e. OKPromise); or institutional tuition and fee waiver programs. If a student receives Title IV federal aid in excess of institutional charges and subsequently withdraws, he/she may be required to return a portion of the aid. The student is ineligible for further aid until the required repayment has been made. The aid is returned on the student’s behalf and a charge is placed on the student Bursar account for the repayment. For additional information, please visit the Return to Title IV policy. Refund Policy for Students Entering Military Service If a student is called to active military service during the term in which he or she is enrolled and has not completed sufficient work for receiving grades, the University will waive tuition and fees for that term. The student should submit a withdrawal form to the Office of the Registrar. Once the student has withdrawn and submitted a copy of the military orders, the student will receive a 100% waiver of the tuition and fees or a 100% refund of tuition and fees paid. The military orders, if not available at the time of withdrawal, may be submitted at a later date at which time the waiver will be applied.

From national franchises to local favorites, healthy meals to indulgent snacks, the possibilities are endless. Whether you want an early-morning coffee or need a late-night snack, we've got it covered. We recognize that our students have varying needs and tastes when it comes to food; that is why we offer some of the most flexible plans in the nation. Being a part of “America’s Healthiest Campus”, means there are always well-balanced, nutritious options for our customers. Our Choose Orange food labeling program encourages students to choose healthier options while dining on campus by easily identifying better-for-you choices without having to read a nutrition label. The program is based on the U.S. Dietary Guidelines and qualified items are identified by the Choose Orange icon. All freshmen living on campus are required to have a meal plan at the bronze level or higher. Campus meal plans are available to on- or off-campus students and residents, as well as any staff or faculty members. How our Meal Plans Work One week before the start of each semester, your meal plan amount is automatically loaded on your student ID, which can be swiped at any dining outlet on campus like a debit card. You can immediately spend as much or as little as you want, whenever you want and your balance declines as you make purchases. Your meal plan is valid anywhere you can eat or drink on campus, including on-campus sporting venues. Each item on campus has a dollar value associated with it and you are only charged that specific amount each time you use your meal plan to dine on campus – no “blocks,” “meals” or limits! Didn’t use your full meal plan this semester? No worries! Each contracted meal plan has a “rollover” amount that will stay with you from semester to semester as long as you maintain a valid meal plan contract for the following term (this does not include the non-contract G plan). To learn more about everything UDS has to offer, please visit dining.okstate.edu. For meal plan questions, call 405-744-4920, email dining@okstate.edu, or visit the Meal Plan office at 301 Student Union. The table below describes the University Dining meal plans available: Current 2021-2022 Plans Meal Plan Fees Meal Plan Cost per semester Maximum Rollover with Valid Contract Platinum $2,275 $340 Gold $2,005 $300 Silver $1,755 $265 Bronze* $1,550 $230 Copper $1,180 $175 Plan G (non-contract)** $100 increments Not subject to rollover limits or restrictions. *Minimum meal plan for freshmen living on campus. **Option for students who wish to have occasional meals on campus.
