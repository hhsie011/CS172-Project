Students who successfully complete the Honors Program will have their degrees conferred with 'Honors' or 'High Honors' in mathematics; high honors is awarded only if the student submits a written thesis. Interested students should read carefully the section The Honors Program in Mathematics found in the Dartmouth ORC and consult with the Department Advisor to Mathematics Majors. This program can be especially important to those who contemplate graduate work in mathematics or a related field. Recent honors theses The following honors theses are available in PDF in full-text or abstract format.
