PreviousNext Opportunities If you think you might like to major or minor in art history, your first step should be to speak to an Art History faculty member, either one of our designated faculty advisors or another professor with whom you are acquainted. You don’t need to wait until it is time to declare your major. It can be very beneficial to start thinking about all available opportunities as early as possible in your Dartmouth career. A faculty member can help you explore what areas of art history you might be interested in; plan a coherent program of study in the major or minor; consider the possibility of writing an honors thesis in the senior year; choose other college courses to intersect with your interests in art history; and think about language study, programs abroad, opportunities for research and travel, internships, fellowships, and art-related campus activities. Worksheets You should also familiarize yourself with the requirements for the major and minors, as well as with the variety of courses the Department of Art History offers. To help you work out a program of study, the department has Majors, Minors, and Modified Majors worksheets available, as well as a guide to the Distribution of Subject Matter of art history courses. When you are ready to declare the major or minor, you should discuss your worksheet with the Department Chair (Ada Cohen) and submit the worksheet to the Department Administrator (Samantha Potter). To complete this process, you must register with Degree Works through Banner Student.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Art History Undergraduate Major, Minor and Modifications Overview Honors Courses Distribution of Subject Areas Foreign Study Careers & Opportunities Careers in Art History College-level teaching Museum Work Publishing and Freelance Writing Art Librarian and Visual Resource Librarian Secondary Education Art and Architectural Preservation and Conservation Art Galleries / Auction Houses Corporate Art Curator and Art Investment Art Law Governmental Agencies Internships in Museums, Galleries, & Auction Houses Museum, Gallery Internships & Select Fieldwork in the United States Internships and Field Experience outside the United States Fellowships and Opportunities External Fellowships Internal (Dartmouth-Based) Fellowships Graduate Study How to choose where to apply?
