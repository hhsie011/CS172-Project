The History of the Global Engineering Programs Global Engineering Programs (GEP) was founded in 2007 under the name “China Programs” and coordinated the first exchange between Tsinghua University and Stanford University engineering students. In 2008 the China Internship Program was added to partner engineering students exclusively with companies in China. GEP’s international programs now span several continents and encompass research, service work, internship opportunities, and academic study tours. GEP has sent hundreds of engineering students abroad and plans to continue improving the opportunities it offers future engineers to provide them with the skills and the knowledge to make decisions with a global perspective. The Global Engineering Program Statement of Inclusion Stanford’s School of Engineering believes that a student body that is both highly qualified and diverse in terms of culture, socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, background, work and life experiences, skills, and interests is essential. The School of Engineering and Global Engineering Programs especially encourages applications from African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, and women, as well as those whose backgrounds and experiences provide additional dimensions that will enhance GEP’s educational programs.
