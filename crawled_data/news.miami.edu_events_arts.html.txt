University events take place not just at our incredible venues and campuses, but also online and all over the world, and the Central Calendar is the website to discover it all. Not only is the Central Calendar a great tool for finding things to do, but it also makes it easy for you to share your own group's events with the rest of the 'Canes Community. Whether you're a student looking to get involved, a sports fan ready to cheer on the Hurricanes, or a faculty/staff member wanting to get the word out about your event, we've got you covered.
