Students will make all arrangements including payment through LightCourse. In addition, even though the courses are pre-approved for transfer credit, the transfer process is not automatic like last year. Students must submit official transcripts to the Office of the Registrar in order to receive transfer credit. Students also need to be aware of Baylor’s general Transfer Credit Policies. Please specifically note the policy that applies to transfer credit entered post-matriculation (after a student has been enrolled at Baylor University), which states that a maximum of fifteen (15) semester hours may be transferred for degree credit. Additionally, no more than two (2) courses transferred post-matriculation may share the same course prefix (e.g., ENG, HIS, or SPA). Please talk with your Baylor Academic Advisor to make sure that you have not already transferred your maximum number of credits Program Locations and Dates Baylor will offer courses through LightCourse in Chengdu, China at Sichuan University from June 27, 2022 - July 29, 2022. Costs Students will pay LightCourse directly for all tuition and fees. (Note This is a change from last year.) General Course Information Students may only take courses on the pre-approved list. Course list is at the bottom of this page. Courses will be taught in English. Courses will be taught to face to face unless the institution determines a need for virtual instruction. In order to receive transfer credit, students must adhere to Baylor’s Transfer Credit Policies and submit official transcripts to the Office of the Registrar after course completion. Registration Process Meet with your Baylor academic advisor to determine which courses from the list will count toward your degree requirements. Contact a LightCourse Advisor via email at studentservice@lightglobal.org or WeChat: LIGHTGLOBAL-LE. Your LightCourse Adviser will assist you in applying for the program and getting you registered in courses that Baylor has already approved. Arrangements (Arrival, Housing, etc.) Student are responsible for all costs of taking courses in China.
