ASI consists of two major components, the Associated Students and the Titan Student Centers. All regularly matriculated students are members of the ASI. View the ASI Overview document. About the Associated Students The Associated Students provides for student governance, shared governance of the university, programming of student activities, funding of campus organizations and athletics, and the operation of a nationally accredited child development center. As an auxiliary organization, the Associated Students does not receive any funding from state sources and does not fund campus operations customarily funded from state sources. The Associated Students provides student development opportunities through leadership, volunteer, and employment experiences. In addition, the Associated Students provides campus community members with important social, cultural, and recreational opportunities, as well as, a wide range of programs and services. The Associated Students encourages and supports the activities of all CSU Fullerton recognized student organizations whose activities stimulate individual and group participation within the university community. ASI History In November 1959, the students of California State University, Fullerton voted to organize a student government program. The program was initially known as the Student Senate. After 26 years in existence, the Student Senate opted to incorporate in an effort to enhance business relationships and improve fiscal independence. In 1976, the Student Senate was renamed Associated Students, CSUF, Incorporated and began operation as a California 501C3 non-profit organization. Student fees paid each semester support the ASI. By paying this fee, students are automatically members of ASI and help provide academic and co-curricular programs and services. Children's Center History The Associated Students, Inc. (ASI) at Cal State Fullerton celebrated the grand opening and building dedication of the new Childrens Center on March 24, 2011. The Childrens Center was designed by Carde Ten Architects of Santa Monica. It features ten classrooms in two buildings, each adjacent to extensive outdoor play and learning spaces. There is a third building with a full-sized kitchen, an area for parents, and spaces for staff development and administration. Funded entirely by the Associated Students, CSUF, Inc., construction of the Childrens Center was made possible through a student referendum passed in 1996. The new facility, accessible from State College Boulevard via the Lot A road, accommodates as many as 122 children ages 6-months to five years, of Cal State Fullerton students, faculty and staff. Founded in 1971, the Childrens Center began in several off-campus facilities and eventually relocated to the Cal State Fullerton campus in 1979, where it continues to operate today. In 2004, the center earned accreditation by the National Association for the Education of Young Children, and was recently re-accredited by this same organization. Articles of Incorporation ASI Articles of Incorporation About the Titan Student Centers The Titan Student Centers (TSC) is a major component of the Associated Students, CSUF, Inc., and includes the operations of the Titan Student Union and the Student Recreation Center . The TSC are governed by the ASI Board of Director’s Facilities Committee, which develops policies on issues ranging from operating hours to services offered. The purpose of the Facilities Committee is to establish policies that will assure that the Titan Student Centers will be a unifying force between students, faculty, and staff; a campus center for social, cultural, and intellectual activities and services; a place to provide further opportunities to broaden and strengthen interpersonal relationships and self-enhancement within a large urban university; and to provide experience in self-government and civic responsibility. Titan Student Centers History Titan Student Union (TSU) In 1966, CSUF students passed a referendum to construct a student union building on the Cal State Fullerton campus. The building was named the University Center and opened in 1976. Featuring a food court, study lounges, meeting rooms, a typing center, plant store, ice cream parlor, and a host of other facilities, the University Center provided services to meet students’ needs and interests. In 1987, another referendum was passed by the students to enlarge the University Center. In 1992, construction was complete on the expanded facility and the building was renamed the Titan Student Union. Featuring a conference center, expanded food court, and student organization offices, the Titan Student Union is roughly double the size of the original building. Student Recreation Center (SRC) In March of 2008, the Student Recreation Center opened on the campus of Cal State Fullerton. The vision to build this center was focused on offering the campus and the surrounding community with a quality fitness facility that enhances recreational, educational, and social development while contributing to overall physical fitness and wellness. The total construction cost was borne entirely through campus-based student fees, with no state funds used to build the center or finance ongoing operations. Featuring an indoor jogging track, a 35-foot high rock wall, an outdoor swimming pool, and 22,000 square feet of gymnasium space, the Student Recreation Center provides the campus community with a wide variety of amenities. Certified by the US Green Building Council as a LEEDGold facility, the Student Recreation Center is one of the worlds greenest, most energy efficient, and high performing buildings. 1976 ASI begins operations as a non-profit 60 Professional Staff Members 400+ Student Employees 9 Scholarships Offered Meet the ASI Staff Meet the ASI staff and get in touch with them for any inquiries.
