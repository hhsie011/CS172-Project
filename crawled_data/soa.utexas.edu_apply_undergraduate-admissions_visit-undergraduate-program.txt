Location The School of Architecture is located in Goldsmith Hall (GOL), Sutton Hall (SUT), West Mall Building (WMB), and Battle Hall (BTL), near the corner of Guadalupe and 22nd Streets. Buildings are open to the public Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m.-5:00 p.m. UT Map: Tower Area School of Architecture Map Visitors may want to download the UT app, which contains campus maps as well as a wealth of other information. Visitor Parking Metered street parking around the School is possibile, but is usually very difficult to find during the semester. The closest parking lot to the School is the privately-owned Dobie Mall Parking Garage on Whitis between 20th and 21st. There are also several surface parking lots on Whitis between MLK and 24th. These are all less than a 5-minute walk. The university also has several public parking garages and lots, but these are located farther from the School.
