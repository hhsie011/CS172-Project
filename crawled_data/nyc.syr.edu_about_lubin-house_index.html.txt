Lubin House is home base for Syracuse University’s New York City operations. The townhouse, nestled among such city landmarks as Central Park, The Pierre Hotel, and Bergdorf Goodman, houses a full-time staff of nearly 20 professionals from several University departments and provides overnight accommodations to Syracuse University employees and faculty while in town on business. Lubin House offers a wide array of programs and events, including alumni gatherings, industry discussion panels, and art exhibits. In addition, many of Syracuse University’s academic programs take advantage of the University’s NYC headquarters while professors and student groups are in the area. The building contains a collection of meeting spaces with a range of sizes and capabilities for use by University personnel. Central to Lubin House’s offerings is the Louise and Bernard Palitz Gallery, located on the second floor. As an extension of Syracuse University Art Museum, the Palitz Gallery offers Syracuse University a unique opportunity to extend its cultural exhibitions into New York City, as well as the chance to serve the interests of the city’s alumni population and the greater cultural community. The Lubin House is also home to a regional admissions office that serves as a great resource for future Syracuse University students. This team hosts numerous college workshops for both high school students and their parents, holds information sessions about the University, and conducts admission interviews with local applicants. In addition to Admissions, the Lubin House is also home to staff members from Advancement and External Affairs, including staff devoted to alumni engagement.
