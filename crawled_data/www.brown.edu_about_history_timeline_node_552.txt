According to President Simmons, the new program combined, “Brown’s strengths in science and engineering, humanities and arts, and social sciences with RISD’s renowned programs in art and design studies and the liberal arts…offering students an extraordinary opportunity to draw on the offerings of two outstanding institutions.” At the end of the five-year program, students are awarded both a Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) from Brown and a Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) from RISD.
