The programs in Women’s Studies and Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies examine the accomplishments and perspectives of women in history, culture, and contemporary society. The programs establish gender and sexuality as fundamental categories of social and cultural analysis. Drawing on disciplines across the university, the programs offer interdisciplinary perspectives from which to study the diversity of human experience. The courses foster critical analysis of the social meaning of gender and gender expression and examine sexual identities, discourses, and institutions as they intersect with class, race, ethnicity, nationality, and transnational movements, drawing on the full range of approaches adopted within feminist and Queer scholarship. Students wishing to major or minor in Women's Studies must register with the Women's Studies Office and develop their program of study in consultation with the Program Director. Directed individual study in Women's Studies and the Women's Studies internships must be arranged with the Program Director. Students should contact the Women's Studies Office each term for information concerning additional special topics courses and seminars that are not among the regular course offerings. If you would like to schedule an advising appointment, please contact Shannon Tucker at 644-9121 or email srtucker@fsu.edu.
