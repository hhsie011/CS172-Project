We hold monthly clinics throughout the academic school year where each cat is examined, scanned for microchip, ear tipped, spayed/neutered, vaccinated (rabies and FVRCP), and treated for parasites. Minor injuries are also addressed and treated. In addition to providing the cats and community a great service, each clinic allows veterinary and pre-veterinary students to gain valuable learning experiences about quality, high volume spay and neuter.
