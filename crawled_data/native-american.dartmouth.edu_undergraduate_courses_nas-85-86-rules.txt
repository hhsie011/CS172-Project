Proposals must: (a) provide an overview of the project in terms of subject matter and the central research question(s) to be investigated; (b) a brief review of the academic literature that you have or will consult as part of the work; (c) a brief description of the prior course work and/or experience that serves as a foundation for this independent study; and (d) confirmation of the faculty member who will oversee the work throughout the term. In essence, your proposal should demonstrate that your project has a clear focus; that you have the proper foundation/experience to undertake independent study work of this type and that you have a clearly laid out plan, working under appropriate faculty supervision, for how you see the work unfolding throughout the course of the term. Faculty Guidance and Student Responsibility Students who plan to do either NAS 85 or NAS 86 will work under the supervision of a faculty member who will offer guidance and suggestions. However, each student bears full responsibility for developing and sustaining the research project and for completing the work in a timely manner. An Independent Study or Independent Research course will require as much work as any other course and will also require that each student schedule and manage his/her own time effectively. Students who register to do an Independent Study or Independent Research in Native American Studies accept the responsibilities as well as the opportunities and challenges of carrying out a substantial piece of work on their own and bringing it to a successful conclusion. Students should expect that NAS 85 or NAS 86 will entail writing a paper of approximately thirty pages, or the equivalent amount of work as determined in the agreement with the faculty advisor. Process The student will produce a thorough bibliography and any other appropriate preliminary work by the second week of term and will make arrangements to meet regularly with the faculty advisor. It is in the student's best interest--and it is the student's responsibility--to provide the advisor with drafts of written work: an advisor can help best by responding to the written work produced. Faculty members have many other demands on their time and are unlikely to search out the student for the meetings and to check up on the student's progress. It is up to the student to do the work and to keep the advisor informed. Deadlines The project must be completed and handed in by the last week of classes so that the grades can be assigned and submitted to the Registrar's Office. Incompletes will only be approved under special circumstances, after the student has initiated the necessary procedure with his/her class dean. On-going grades can only be assigned to NAS 86 when NAS 87 (the writing of the thesis) is completed in the term immediately following.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Native American and Indigenous Studies Undergraduate Overview Major and Minor Courses Honors Program Waitlists and Applications NAS 85 Independent Study Rules & Procedures NAS Students Writing Prize Award Recipients Alumni - Tell Us Your Story 2020 2021 Funding for Internships and Independent Research Off-Campus Program Research Overview Gordon Russell Visiting Professorship Gordon Russell Visiting Professorship Alumni Charles Eastman Fellowship Eastman Fellowship Alumni Tribal Scholar Fellowship Program Tribal Scholar Fellowship Alumni Resources News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
