Full Benefits Eligible: This is defined as 30 or more hours per week or .75 FTE and greater, which applies to regular faculty and regular staff employees. Full benefits include all benefits in accordance with University System of Georgia of Board of Regents policy 8.2.9 Insurance. Partial Benefits Eligible: This is defined as 20 to 29 hours per week or .5 FTE to .74 FTE. Partial benefits eligible may apply to regular faculty and regular staff employees. Partial benefits include retirement and pro-rated leave accruals. Non-Benefits Eligible: This is defined as 19 or less hours per week (.49 FTE or less), which applies to regular faculty and staff employees. Non-benefits eligible also includes temporary faculty, staff, and student employees who may not work more than 1,300 hours in a 12 month period as defined later in this policy. Students may not be placed into a regular status. Life Event Changes If you experience a life event, such as marriage, divorce, or the birth of a child, you may be eligible to make changes to your current benefit elections. To make changes, visit the OneUSG Connect - Benefits website (accessible via TechWorks, click the doctor icon). Per IRS regulations, benefit changes are normally allowed only during the annual enrollment period between October and November. However, certain changes to your family or work status, may allow you to make mid-year benefit changes. Regulations require changes be made within 30 days of your life changing event, which is also the effective date of your benefit changes. If you are changing your name, click here. When you have a qualified life event, may make any change related to the life event — for example, if you have a baby, you may add the new child to your plan but you cannot add a spouse. Changes not made within 30 days of the event will have to wait until annual enrollment. Visit the OneUSG Connect - Benefits website for a list of qualified life events. Additional Georgia Tech Benefits Delta Dental HMO Offered provided through Delta Dental.

Learn More about Your Benefits Affordable Care Act The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was created by the federal government to make medical insurance available to all Americans. Beginning January 1, 2014, the ACA requires all individuals to have health insurance coverage. Employees who do not have insurance through their workplace or a government plan such as Medicare can enroll in insurance through the federal Health Insurance Marketplace. This notice is provided to all Georgia Tech faculty, staff, student, and temporary employees upon hiring. View USG Notice The Health Insurance Marketplace is designed to help individuals find health insurance that meets their needs and budget.
