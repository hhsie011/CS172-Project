We recognize today’s professional careers demand strong interdisciplinary as well as interpersonal skills and have designed our educational programs to provide a core education in the physical, chemical and geological sciences and the necessary training for applying this knowledge to the maintenance and improvement of our marine resources. Our faculty conducts cutting-edge research in coastal marine geology, physical oceanography, marine geochemistry, and coastal resources management that emphasize and support our degrees and course curricula. Our strength is the diversity of our faculty who utilize their experience from private, governmental, and academic careers to create extraordinary learning opportunities for students through “hands on” and “on the water” field and laboratory research as well as internships that give our students a competitive advantage for employment after graduation. We offer a variety of majors and minors in subjects centered on the coastal and marine environment. We offer a BS in Marine Sciences (MARS) and a BS in Coastal Environmental Science and Society (CESS). The License Option Program (MARS-LO) is also available to MARS majors to obtain a third mate’s license in the Merchant Marine upon graduation. We offer a minor in CESS. Graduate programs offer a Master of Marine Resources Management (MARM) and a PhD program in Marine and Coastal Management and Science (MCMS). We also offer a 3+2 program in which the student can attain a BS in CESS with a MARM degree in 5 years. Our faculty advise students in diverse MS and PhD graduate degrees on our campus such as the graduate program in Marine Biology (MARB) and programs in conjunction with departments in College Station such as Oceanography (OCNG) and Landscape Architecture and Urban Planning (LAUP). The departmental website (https://www.tamug.edu/mars/faculty/index.html) provides more information of our faculty’s fields of expertise and appointments with other departments and programs.
