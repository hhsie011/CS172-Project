Staff Newsletters Staff Newsletter: May 29, 2020 Staff Newsletter: May 15, 2020 Staff Newsletter: April 17, 2020 Staff Newsletter: April 10, 2020 COVID-19: Important Updates and Guidance Click here for important information, updates, and guidance regarding COVID-19 for the whole Barnard community TWU Bargaining Update - 12/2/19 TWU Bargaining Update December 2, 2019 Dear TWU Colleagues, As promised in my previous message, I am writing to update you on contract negotiations between the College and TWU Local 264. We are making serious efforts to negotiate a new contract that brings you financial advantages and benefits. To date, we have held three bargaining sessions with the Union, on September 25 and 26 and November 19. The College offered eight proposals in September and four additional proposals at the November 19 meeting. These proposals would give Union members a 2.5% wage increase every year for five years and would increase tuition benefits, child care subsidy, and uniform allowance. So far, the Union has not offered any proposals. At the November 19 meeting, the Union failed to provide any responses to the eight proposals offered by the College in September and indicated they had not even reviewed those proposals. In October, the Union agreed to five additional bargaining dates in December, but on November 19 they informed the College they would not bargain on those dates. The College plans to propose additional dates in December and January, but at this time we do not have any more bargaining dates scheduled. The College is committed to reaching an agreement on a new contract and has actively taken steps to do so. However, we cannot reach an agreement if the Union refuses to engage in good-faith bargaining, as they are required by law to do. The Union is your representative. If you would like a new contract, please let your representatives know that you want them to bargain with us. We continue to be ready to meet as frequently as necessary to continue negotiations that lead to an equitable contract. While we remain eager to reach a new agreement, you should know that the previous contract, which expired on September 30, continues in force while bargaining is underway. I will update you on the status of negotiations as new information becomes available. Please see a list of FAQs to learn more about the negotiation process. Sincerely, Catherine Geddis Vice President for Human Resources TWU Bargaining Update - 10/16/19 Dear TWU Colleagues, I am writing to update you on the status of contract negotiations between the College and your collective bargaining representative, TWU Local 264. The College and TWU Local 264 have had a successful collective bargaining relationship for decades and have amicably renegotiated our contract at each expiration point for many years. As mentioned at the all-staff meeting on October 3, 2019, the College values the dedication and work of the TWU membership on our campus and seeks to strengthen the relationship further through negotiation of a new contract. During the past few weeks, the College has tried to bargain with the Union. We have made several proposals for a new contract and have worked to make ourselves available on many dates for negotiation sessions. Unfortunately, to date, the Union has offered no proposals, refused to extend the prior contract (which, as a result, expired at 11:59 p.m. on September 30), and refused to agree to additional dates for negotiations until an on-campus meeting of the Union membership is held. We have offered to arrange a space for such an on-campus meeting and we are happy to provide technical assistance for those who cannot attend meetings in person. Additionally, we have offered to arrange for nearby off-campus locations for such meetings. We see no reason why issues regarding meeting locations should delay our negotiations any further. The Union has an obligation to represent its membership and bargain in good faith in compliance with the National Labor Relations Act; we are hopeful that the Union’s leadership will recognize that obligation and continue to negotiate in good faith. We remain ready to extend the prior contract and meet as frequently as necessary to continue negotiations that lead to tangible financial benefits for the membership and an equitable contract that benefits both the members and the College. I will update you on the status of negotiations as new information becomes available. Please see a list of FAQs here to learn more about the negotiation process.
