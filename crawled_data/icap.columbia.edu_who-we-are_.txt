Vision Healthy people, empowered communities, thriving societies. About Based at Columbia University with operations in more than 30 countries, ICAP is a leader in global public health, internationally known for tackling the world’s toughest health challenges—from HIV to tuberculosis, from malaria to maternal and child health, and the growing problem of non-communicable diseases, and most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic. Through innovative research, collaborative technical assistance, and a focus on strengthening health systems, ICAP helps to create better, more accessible, health services to reduce the burden of illness on people and communities. A beacon for inspiring change, ICAP disseminates knowledge and best practices to inspire better population health worldwide. ICAP was founded at Columbia’s Mailman School of Public Health in 2003 by Wafaa El-Sadr. ICAP was created at a time when an estimated 2.4 million people were dying every year from HIV around the world. As the global crisis unfolded, ICAP was determined to overcome the challenge of making HIV treatment available in areas with very limited health care infrastructure. ICAP’s pioneering approach was inspired by the experience of Dr. El-Sadr and her colleagues in the New York City community of Harlem, where HIV had been rapidly spreading and causing immeasurable suffering. Originally called the International Center for AIDS Care and Treatment Programs, ICAP quickly engaged in the global HIV response, enabling the successful scale-up of HIV care and treatment in some of the most resource-challenged countries in the world. The immediate results galvanized the global health community. Committed to a healthier tomorrow for all people, ICAP pursues a vision of a world where quality health services are available to all, so that people and communities can thrive and prosper.
