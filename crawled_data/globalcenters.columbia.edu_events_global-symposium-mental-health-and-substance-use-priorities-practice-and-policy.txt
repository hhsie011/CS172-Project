A public health model is replacing an enforcement and control model. A very high proportion of people with substance use problems also suffer from other mental disorders. Stigma and discrimination against people with substance use and mental health challenges hinders their access to health services and treatment. And, billions of dollars are being lost annually due to impaired productivity of the workforce. A specific target of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals is to strengthen the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, including narcotic drug abuse and harmful use of alcohol. This one day symposium will address the critical challenges that mental illness and substance abuse pose in the region and around the globe, bringing together thought leaders to discuss greater promotion of innovative strategies and solutions. Joined by a cross-section of international scholars, researchers, clinicians and public health advocates from around the region, we will engage in dynamic exchange prioritizing mental health policy and practice. As Latin America places increased emphasis on a public health approach, we will look at the most relevant, evidence-based thinking and recommendations for tackling the vicious cycle of inequality resulting from only 2% of the health care budget in the region being allocated to mental health.

Treatment is proven to be cost-effective in both developed and developing countries. To incarcerate offenders for drug use and dependence is not an effective prevention or treatment strategy.” World Health Organization Video: Ted Tokyo - Kathy Pike - Do not Call Me Crazy - Link: https://youtu.be/MTQHs6UpKq4 Upcoming Events Columbia Global CentersAmman / Beijing / Istanbul / Mumbai / Nairobi / Paris / Rio / Santiago / Tunis Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
