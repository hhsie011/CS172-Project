We study the nervous system at every level: from the macroscopic (behavior and cognition) to the microscopic (cells and molecules). Consequently, the questions that neurobiologists ask are wide-ranging: how do electrical and molecular signals allow neurons to process and transmit information from the environment? What guides the development of the immense number of precise connections in the nervous system? How can the complex signals of many thousands of active neurons be recorded, analyzed, modeled, and interpreted? What causes the profound behavioral deficits in Alzheimers disease or Autism Spectrum Disorders?
