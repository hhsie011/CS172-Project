In Esperanza and Good Day she randomly applied holographic paper and mirrored mylar onto multi-plate etchings as a way to explore color and reflection. Smith revisited her longstanding interest in moths and butterflies - classic symbols of fragility and metamorphosis - in Goat Moths a series of six etching and drypoints. Most recently, Smith made five additional intaglio prints at the Neiman Center two of which - Evidence and The Desire - are variable editions with distinct patterns of glossy and reflective papers collaged to their surfaces. Tidal, Smith’s first - now iconic - project as a visiting artist at the Neiman Center in 1999, employed photogravure to capture thirteen depictions of the moon set above an undulating ocean in an accordion-fold book. Smith took photographs of the moon at Columbia University’s observatory and the ocean during a late-night visit to Coney Island. Moon Three, a related triptych, was also printed using photogravure to create the sharp contrast between the rich black of space and the glowing moons. A prolific sculptor and printmaker, Smith (b. 1954) has been the recipient of numerous honors and awards, including the Skowhegan School of Art's Medal for Sculpture, membership in the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and the Athena Award for Excellence in Printmaking from the Rhode Island School of Design. Her work has been exhibited extensively throughout the United States and Europe, including major retrospectives at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis which traveled to The Whitney Museum of American Art and at The Museum of Modern Art, New York which focused on her sizable body of prints and multiples. Smith's work is in the permanent collection of numerous institutions including the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; The Metropolitan Museum of Art; and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. Smith lives and works in New York.
