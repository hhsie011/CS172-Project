Professional. Texas Tech University School of Law is a very special place. We are a family here at Texas Tech Law, and we offer an outstanding and innovative legal education. We always put our students first, and we focus on the real-world practical skills that every lawyer needs for a fantastic career in the profession. That has been the Texas Tech Law tradition since we first opened our doors in 1967, and we do it today better than ever. Our “students first” commitment is the secret to our success, and you can see it in everything we do at the Law School. Here on our website, you can find page after page highlighting our tremendous successes in advocacy, skills training, legal writing, live-client clinics, externships, law journals, and much, much more. We have a wonderful faculty. Texas Tech law professors are known throughout the state and the nation for their passionate commitment to teaching, research, and service. More than anything else, our faculty are dedicated to students. They teach, they mentor, they coach, and they build relationships that last a lifetime. Our alumni are a powerful network committed to helping the next generation of Texas Tech lawyers succeed. More than 8,000 strong, our graduates practice law at the highest levels across the nation. Texas Tech law alums have included the first woman to head a major federal law enforcement agency, the Army's highest-ranked military legal officer, and many of the nation's top litigators. Our graduates look back on their law school experience with gratitude and are eager to give back to today's students. I invite you to come see firsthand what makes Texas Tech Law so special and why so many students choose to call it home. Jack Wade Nowlin Dean and W.
