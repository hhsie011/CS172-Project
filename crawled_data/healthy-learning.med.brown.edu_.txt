Program for a Healthy Learning Environment The Program for a Healthy Learning Environment at The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University is committed to cultivating an inclusive scholarly community that ensures all students achieve their fullest potential while providing quality patient care. The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University is committed to ensuring all students achieve their fullest potential while providing quality patient care. To support this aim, the principle of our educational community is the promotion of a positive learning environment through respectful education of all community members, recognizing respecting diversity and practicing inclusion are essential components of medical education. Students must be able to learn in an environment free of mistreatment and/or microaggressions. The Program for a Healthy Learning Environment is an initiative launched in 2022 to support the promotion of a healthy learning environment with the following initiatives: Supporting Students: If and/or when a student experiences mistreatment and/or microaggressions, they should be supported, heard and when appropriate, acted upon. Their experience will be taken very seriously and responded to in a timely fashion. Supporting the Broader Community: Mistreatment and/or microaggressions are often not a reflection of a moral or ethical failing but are skills gaps that can and should be bridged. Supporting community members in both a proactive and reactive manner is a central goal of the Program. Tracking Mistreatment and Microaggressions: We are committed to identifying and responding to any patterns (on an individual or institutional-basis) that promote an unhealthy learning environment. Identifying & Recognizing Positive Champions: Community members who consistently demonstrate behaviors that promote a healthy learning environment should be celebrated and rewarded; this contributes to a community of affirmative change.
