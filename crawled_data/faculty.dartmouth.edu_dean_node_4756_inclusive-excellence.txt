Dartmouth's educational mission and core values have long recognized all forms of diversity as the bases of academic excellence. Nonetheless, much work remains to create an environment where all feel welcome and empowered to achieve their greatest potential for learning, teaching, researching, and creating. Dartmouth, like all of society, continues to grapple with historical legacies of exclusion and oppression based on race, color, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, socioeconomic background, and many other factors. This web page hosts the Arts and Sciences reports and plans related to Dartmouth's Action Plan for Inclusive Excellence (May 2016).
