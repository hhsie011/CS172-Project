Advanced Scholarship PLME students who wish to earn an advanced degree (MA, ScM, MPH) must meet the requirements of the graduate school. Many academic departments at Brown offer graduate programs; these are listed in the Brown University Graduate School Catalog. After matriculation into the College, students should discuss their interests and goals with a director of a graduate program in planning any study that might lead to an advanced graduate degree. Master of Public Health Program (MPH) The MPH program prepares students for careers in the public, non-profit, and private sectors. Our goal is to help students become skilled professionals committed to improving the health of communities by translating rigorous scientific research into sound, evidence-based public health policy and practice. MPH programs also introduce students to experts, which provide an expanded network of mentors and colleagues in the field of public health. These relationships provide enhanced opportunities for research collaboration and public health practice. Master of Public Health Program (MPH) Scholarly Concentrations The Scholarly Concentrations Program is an elective program through which Brown medical students may elect to pursue a course of study beyond the conventional medical education curriculum. Scholarly Concentrations allow students to translate personal interests and activities into scholarship. For PLME students, the program represents an opportunity to continue and expand a current area of interest such as their undergraduate concentration or extracurricular activities, or to potentially explore a new medically-related topic. Students who participate in a Scholarly Concentration will undertake rigorous independent scholarship in a cross-disciplinary field of interest related to medicine, public health, engineering, or a biomedically relevant topic in the sciences, arts, or humanities. In collaboration with their concentration area mentors, students will produce an academic product, such as a manuscript of publication quality, a curriculum project, or an equivalent product appropriate to the field of study. Currently, students can pursue concentrations in the following disciplines: Aging Biomedical Informatics Caring for Underserved Communities Global Health Integrative Health and Contemplative Practice LGBTQ Healthcare and Advocacy Medical Education Medical Humanities and Ethics Medical Technology, Innovation & Entrepreneurship Physician as Communicator Translational Research in Medicine Women's Reproductive Health Scholarly Concentrations Program Combined MD-ScM Program The Primary Care--Population Medicine (PC-PM) program is an innovative,dual-degree curriculum that focuses on preparing students for a career in medicine while providing comprehensive, longitudinal training in population medicine. The program will prepare medical students for leadership roles in health care on the local, state, or national level in areas ranging from primary care clinical service to research, education, and health policy.
