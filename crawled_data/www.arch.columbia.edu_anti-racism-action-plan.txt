The Action Plan outlines specific steps being taken to address the priorities voiced by the GSAPP community. Process and Resources describes how this work is being developed, and includes links to related communications, resources, and further readings. 1/31/22: Progress toward an Anti-Racist GSAPP Action Plan Process & Resources GSAPP is committed to addressing systemic racism and anti-Black racism across all its dimensions. Dedicating ourselves as a community to engaging in active anti-racist practices will enable new foundations from which to think through, engage with, and imagine the future of the built environment both more equitably and with more joy. As a school of architecture and the built environment, it is imperative that we acknowledge the role our disciplines and practices have played in constructing and upholding racial inequities in the built environment. GSAPP is engaging every aspect of the School with a collective commitment to changing these approaches and through shared efforts is intensifying its focus in the advancement of diversity, equity, and inclusion as a community and across our disciplines and practices. GSAPP’s strength lies in the diversity of its programs and positions as well as in the breadth of perspectives, backgrounds, and personal experiences that our students and faculty bring to the sustained and critical probing of our disciplines and practices, as a way to understand both what they are and what they can become. To better sustain and serve this breadth of approaches, we are committed to fostering environments that bring our community together across programs and forums to become an actively anti-racist institution. At the start of the Fall 2020 semester, GSAPP hired Diversity Dimensions Consulting (DDC) to partner with the School in outlining ways to become an anti-racist institution. In parallel, the faculty-led GSAPP Anti-Racism Task Force was formed to engage in conversations with the GSAPP community and to work toward an anti-racist GSAPP through re-imagining pedagogical approaches, curricula transformation, and programming. Dean Andraos’s Fall letter to the School was also the result of ongoing conversations with students, faculty, and staff across the School. The following Action Plan is the synthesis of those efforts and recommendations—Dean Andraos’s letter (December 2, 2020), DDC’s Executive Summary of Findings and Recommendations (December 21, 2020), and the Anti-Racism Task Force recommendations (December 21, 2020)—as a means to coordinate and render visible the ongoing work and progress across all of the School’s dimensions. This living document will be updated as work evolves; last update May 25, 2021. 1. SCHOOL CULTURE A central aspect of the work throughout the Fall 2020 semester was the development of a more thorough understanding of the varied experiences at the School. As a result, we identified concrete actions that we hoped would foster a more equitable and inclusive culture at the School. While “School Culture” encompasses all aspects of the School, the aim of these actions is to specifically address the day-to-day experience of being part of GSAPP and the different factors that influence it—from shared readings, courses, and workshops to increased administrative support of students and a framework to sustain the School’s anti-racist efforts moving forward.
