Events Past Event Women’s Rights in Afghanistan: What will the Future Bode for Afghan Women? Share Add to Calendar: Google Yahoo March 31, 2022 5:00 PM - 6:30 PM Twenty years after being ousted by US-led military intervention, the Taliban reclaimed power in Afghanistan. Immediately after seizing control of the country, and under immense pressure by the international community, the Taliban claimed that the new government would differ from the brutal regime of 1996-2001, with a more inclusive stance towards women, minorities, and dissenters. Despite these initial promises, however, the leaders of the Taliban have made systematic efforts to exclude women from social, economic, and political scene, and institutionalize gender-based discrimination and violence against women. This webinar will explore the status of women’s rights in Afghanistan with a particular emphasis on the restrictions imposed by the Taliban from 1996-2001, discuss what has changed during the two decades of US military intervention and whether women’s decades-long struggle for rights is at a loss as Taliban regained the control of the country.
