Each year, the program provides state-funded fellowships for South Carolina students who wish to pursue an education degree and a career in South Carolina’s public schools. Fellows receive up to $6,000 per year for four years in forgivable student loans while they complete coursework that leads to S.C. teacher licensure. Fellows agree to teach in South Carolina public schools one year for every year they are fellows. Teaching Fellows awards can be combined with other state scholarships and loans. Freshmen in the Teaching Fellows program will be required to live in the Teaching Fellows Living Learning Community (LLC), which will provide additional support and help students build relationships outside of the academic environment. Additional experiences exclusive to teaching fellows will include seminars, professional development and service learning opportunities, additional school placements, advocacy experiences, field trips, and social gatherings. Clemson is one of only 11 institutions in the state identified as a South Carolina Teaching Fellows institution. The Teaching Fellows program is administered through the Center for Educator Recruitment, Retention, and Advancement (CERRA). More information can be found at https://cerra.org/teaching-fellows.

The Teaching Fellows program prepares future teachers to positively impact education in South Carolina. Because Teaching Fellows have agreed to teach in a South Carolina public school one year for every year they have accepted the fellowship funds, most fellows are indebted for four years of service to the state. Current data shows that 77% of Teaching Fellows graduates who have taught for the required number of years to satisfy their loan through service are still employed in districts across the state. This retention rate is remarkable when compared to the attrition rate among teachers in the first five years of their career. Several studies have found that as many as 50% of new teachers leave within the first five years of entry into the profession (Smith & Ingersoll, 2004). Teaching Fellows participate in advanced professional development from their first year in the program. The professional development includes diversity education, leadership development, advocacy, and the use of technology to improve student achievement. The Teaching Fellows program helps prepare these novice teachers to lead from the beginning of their careers.
