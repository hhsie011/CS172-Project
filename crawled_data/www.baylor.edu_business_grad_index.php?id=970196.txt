These six competencies (three core and three enabling) align with our Program’s mission and desired student outcomes. The Army-Baylor program prepares early and mid-career Military Officers, Department of Defense (DoD), and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) civilians to play pivotal roles in healthcare administration in the 21st century. Our curriculum, centered on three core and three enabling competencies, provides the breadth and depth of knowledge, skills, and abilities that set our students to address the spectrum of modern healthcare leadership challenges. With 100% placement in the federal health system, most graduates will receive an entry- to mid-level management position. The Army-Baylor Program competencies nest into the executive level Joint Medical Executive Skills (JMES) competencies. We deliver our program through instruction by highly qualified faculty engaged in scholarship and practice, field experiences with our alumni and other practitioners, and extensive professional networking. In 2021, the Army-Baylor faculty developed this competency model to better capture program-level competencies related to the MHA, dual MHA/MBA degree program, and residency year. Army-Baylor students are offered the unique opportunity to attend residency at a Military Treatment Facility (MTF), VA hospital, or a reputable civilian health care partner such as Mayo, Cleveland Clinic, Methodist, and so forth. Understanding these program opportunities, the new Army-Baylor Program competency model accounts for the common need across any major federal or civilian health system for our graduates to be competent in knowledge in health systems management, business administration, and decision-making.
