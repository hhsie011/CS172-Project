This website will remain a work in progress as policies are added, updated and edited. View Policies Official Policies The Policy Library holds (or links to) the official version of each TC policy. While we are working to remove out-of-date policies that may exist in other locations, some are likely to remain available. To be sure that you have the current policy, always check the Policy Library. In addition to policies, the Library contains certain procedures and guidance of broad relevance to the college community. Finding Policies Policies are grouped by "responsible office." You will, for example, find the policy on Student Records and Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) under "Vice Provost/Enrollment Services and business expense policies under "Controller." You may also find policies by searching for a policy title or browsing the list of policies. Questions For information about the offices and senior staff members who are responsible for policies, see the Teachers College Policy on Policies. Most policies are publicly available but a few are restricted to affected members of the Community. If you have questions or comments about the Policy Library, please send them to policies@tc.edu.
