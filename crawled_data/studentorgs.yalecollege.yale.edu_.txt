Are you… A student leader of a registered student organization looking for resources? An undergraduate interested in registering a new organization? A student interested in becoming involved with an undergraduate organization? You’ve come to the right place! This website is managed by the Office of Student Affairs, which oversees registered undergraduate student organizations at Yale College. Here, you’ll find helpful information on how to register your group, plan events at Yale, and ensure your group is following University policies and procedures. If you’re a student interested in becoming involved with a group, our site also provides the only full list of registered undergraduate organizations. Student Organizations Consultants Student Organization Consultants (SOCs) are sophomores, juniors and seniors who are trained to assist student organizations with navigating Yale processes. Your group’s consultant is your first point of contact. They can help if you have questions about how to put together an event, who to contact with a request, or need an unbiased sounding board to talk through ideas you might have for your group. Please Note: Dwight Hall member groups are not assigned a SOC and should contact Dwight Hall or student.organizations@yale.edu for support. Questions? Contact student.organizations@yale.edu.
