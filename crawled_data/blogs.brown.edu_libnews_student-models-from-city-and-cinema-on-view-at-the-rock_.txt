Posted on January 4, 2013 by Amy Atticks Brown Undergraduate Ian Slater's the Bates House from Psycho, 1960. Director: Alfred Hitchcock. PROVIDENCE, R.I. [Brown University] —If you are on the Brown University campus in January, stop by the new exhibit in the Finn Reading Room on the first floor of the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Library! In fall 2012, Professor Dietrich Neumann taught a course at Brown in the Department of Art and Architecture entitled “City and Cinema.” The course explored chapters in the history of cinematic set design and film’s interaction with and depiction of urban space, examining film as a reflection, commentary, and experimental laboratory for contemporary architecture. The exhibit on view in the Rock features researched models submitted by Brown undergraduate students as final projects for the course. The Brown University Library is home to more than 6.8 million print items, plus a multitude of electronic resources and expanding digital archives serving the teaching, research, and learning needs of Brown students and faculty, as well as scholars from around the country and the world.
