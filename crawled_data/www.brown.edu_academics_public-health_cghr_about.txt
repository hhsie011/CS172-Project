Research findings published by our faculty inform healthcare delivery and policy for these vulnerable populations, with particular emphasis on those residing in post-acute and long-term care. The mission of the center is to enhance the quality of life of persons with chronic illnesses, especially older adults, through both methodological and substantial research. The research focus, both basic and applied, draws upon the social sciences as well as the clinical disciplines.
