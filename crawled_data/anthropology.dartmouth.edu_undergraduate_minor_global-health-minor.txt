Our Global Health minor is built around this understanding of global health. About the Minor in Global Health The Global Health Minor provides students with disciplinary introductions to sociocultural and medical anthropology, encourages an understanding of biological perspectives on global health, develops students' training in relevant research methods (qualitative/quantitative), and asks that students delve into interdisciplinary areas of inquiry related to global health. Core courses in medical anthropology provide an anchor for the Minor, but other offerings can be tailored to the intellectual trajectories of students. Students should submit to the Anthropology Department a brief rationale describing which course satisfies each requirement. The Anthropology Minor in Global Health consists of six course areas: An introductory course taken within the discipline. This could be any of the following: ANTH 01, ANTH 03, ANTH 5, ANTH 6, or ANTH 9. At least one course from each of the following five core approaches to the study of global health: Biological Approaches – Examples of courses that could meet this requirement include ANTH 06 (if not used for the Intro course), 12.18, 20, 40, 41, 43, 62, 64, 70 or courses outside of ANTH such as the infectious disease section of BIOL 11 Cultural Approaches – Examples of courses that could meet this requirement include ANTH 04, 09 (if not used for the Intro course), 12.01, 14, 27, 31, 32, 36, 37, 47, 48, 51, 58, 65 Interdisciplinary Approaches – Examples of courses that could meet this requirement include any ANTH course that exposes you to more than one subfield (biological, archaeological, linguistic, cultural) or otherwise stretches your exposure to the discipline and aligns with your interest in global health; you might also choose course outside of ANTH such as SOCY 34, 35, 65; GEOG 21.01, 8.01, 56; HIST 08.01, 36; ENGS 06, 12; PBPL 26 Methodological Approaches - ANTH 18 or another qualitative methods course such as SOCY 11, GEOG 11; a statistics course such as PSYC 10 or SOCY 10 (provided this is not counting toward your major); or a course that explores research methods applicable to global health problems such as GEOG 56, ENGS 12, MATH 04 Social Studies of Medicine, Health and Disease - Examples of courses that could meet this requirement include ANTH 17, 45, 55, 60 or courses outside of ANTH such as SOCY 34, 35, 65; GEOG 21.01; HIST 08.01, 36. Social Studies of Medicine, Health and Disease - Examples of courses that could meet this requirement include ANTH 17, 45, 55, 60 or courses outside of ANTH such as SOCY 34, 35, 65; GEOG 21.01; HIST 08.01, 36. Four of the six courses for the minor must be taken within the Anthropology department. Students cannot use the same course to satisfy more than one requirement. Students wishing to substitute courses not listed above should petition the Anthropology Department in writing in consultation with a department faculty member. The Global Health Minor can be pursued simultaneously with the Dickey Center's Certificate in Global Health.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Anthropology Undergraduate Overview Major Modified Major Minor Global Health Minor How to Declare an Anthropology Major or Minor Courses Introductory Courses Archaeology Biological Anthropology Cultural Anthropology Independent Study Culminating Seminars Past Teaching Schedules Honors Program Honors Proposal Submission Form Transfer Credits Careers Alumni: Where Are They Now?
