The China Initiative, housed at the Watson Institute for International Studies, seeks to foster academic activities that at once deepen our knowledge about Greater China (Mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong), and use that knowledge to challenge and expand our understanding of the wider world. Proposals will be welcomed from all parts of the university, including the social sciences and humanities, engineering, the sciences, public health, and medicine. Proposals may involve collaborations with partners in Greater China. The China Initiative is particularly interested in proposals that span multiple academic disciplines.
