He received his doctorate in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Vermont in 1996 and then served on the faculty of the Department of Orthopaedics & Rehabilitation at the University of Vermont for seven years. His primary research interests focus on the lower extremity with a particular interest in knee ligament injuries, soft tissue biomechanics and biomedical instrumentation. Recent translational projects include the development of experimental models to investigate graft healing and the progression of osteoarthritis following ACL injury, repair and reconstruction, the development of tissue engineering methods to stimulate ligament healing, the design of methods to non-invasively monitor the biomechanical properties of healing soft tissues, and the application of biotribologic principles to provide cartilage protection following joint injury. He is the Co-Director of the Bioengineering Core of the COBRE for Skeletal Health and Repair. Most of his research has been funded by the NIH or DOD. He has received several awards for his work including the William A. Grana Award for Best Original Research (2020); OREF Clinical Research Award (2020); O'Donoghue Sports Injury Research Award (2020; 2005); Kappa Delta Award (2013; 1994); Cabaud Research Award (2013; 2009), ACL Study Group Traveling Fellowship (2010-2012); Bruce Selya Research Award (2005), GOTS-Beiersdorf Research Award (2000), the American Society of Biomechanics Post-doctoral Young Scientist Award (1999), and the Albert Trillat Young Investigator Award (1997).

Full Text PubMed Research Research Overview The focus of the Fleming lab is to translate novel treatments of orthopaedics injuries from the bench to the clinic. Primary research interests focus on knee and soft tissue biomechanics, imaging and biomedical instrumentation. He has maintained a NIH funded research program for over 25 years. Research Statement Dr. Fleming's primary research interests focus on the biomechanics of the lower extremity and biomedical instrumentation. Recent projects include: 1) A randomized controlled trial comparing two initial graft tensioning procedures on ACL reconstruction outcomes and post-traumatic osteoarthritis is currently underway (12 to 15 year follow-up). At 7 years post-surgery, there were minimal differences between the two graft tension groups and both groups were presenting with post-traumatic osteoarthritis when compared to the matched uninjured control group. 2) In a collaboration with Dr. Martha Murray at Boston Children’s Hospital multiple pre-clinical studies have been performed to translate a novel ACL repair procedure from the bench to clinical trials. FDA regulated clinical trials are underway to demonstrate that the procedure is safe and effective. The BEAR implant was granted FDA approval in December 2020. 3) The lab is currently developing and optimizing MR imaging protocols to non-invasively evaluate ligament and graft healing after ACL surgery. We have shown that specific MR parameters are predictive of the biomechanical properties of the healing structure and reflective of the tissue histology. 4) In a collaboration with Dr. Gregory Jay, we have determined that the intra-articular administration of recombinant PRG4 reduces cartilage damage following ACL and meniscal injury. Work is currently underway to translate this into clinical use in the near future. 5) Additional studies and collaborations are underway to identify transcriptional and proteomic changes following joint injury to identify novel treatments to reduce the risk of post-traumatic osteoarthritis.
