The program envisions a space where survivors feel held, understood without having to explain themselves, and given space to breathe and connect with one another in profoundly spiritual and experiential ways. Through its multi-faceted approach to mindfulness, movement and nurturing of one’s body, this program hopes to aid survivors to recognize and cherish their innate capacity to transcend trauma while being connected to a caring community of allies. This Movement Medicine webinar is a virtual setting for survivors and co-survivors to move from their headspace into full-bodied presence through awareness of our breath, gentle stretches, and guided/free movement. By incorporating mindfulness and movement therapy practices, participants will learn tools to support the body, process emotions and trauma, and release stress. The class is open to all levels of movement. Throughout the workshop, soft and fast instrumental music will be played in the background. Instructor Renk Koctruk will be sharing affirmations, invitational language, and choice-making opportunities to bring participants closer to making decisions about their body.  To Register for This Workshop Please Visit: https://columbiahealth.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_mCqJ2IqCQouk9CjwpfsIwQ Columbia University makes every effort to accommodate individuals with disabilities.
