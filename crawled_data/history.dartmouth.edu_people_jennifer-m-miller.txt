Miller Academic Appointments Associate Professor of History Vice Chair, Department of History Connect with Us Twitter Jennifer M. Miller is a scholar of U.S. foreign relations since 1945, focusing on interactions between the United States and Northeast Asia. Her research examines the intersections between foreign policy and domestic ideas, ideologies, and political narratives; her work explores how new interactions between America and East Asia after World War II transformed both sides’ thinking about security, democratic order, citizenship, and economic growth. Miller received her Ph.D. in the history of U.S. foreign relations and international history from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2012. She currently offers courses on the history of U.S. foreign relations, the Cold War, and World War II in the Pacific Professor Miller’s first book, Cold War Democracy: The United States and Japan (Harvard University Press, 2019), offers a new interpretation of the postwar U.S.-Japanese relationship, one of the United States’ most significant international alliances. It argues that this alliance was not simply the product of American economic or security interests, but that it was fundamentally shaped by American and Japanese ideas about the values and practices necessary to build democracy. Drawing from research in government archives and materials from labor unions, intellectuals, philanthropic organizations, and activist groups, it argues that the Cold War fostered new ideas about democracy, specifically the belief that democracy was not simply political or institutional but also psychological. This emphasis on “spirit” over democratic practice offered a crucial language of reconciliation between American policymakers and conservative Japanese leaders in the aftermath of a massive war. Yet this shared governmental vision was heavily contested by Japanese activists, who articulated their own visions of democracy premised on active citizenship and government accountability to the people. These beliefs fuelled large-scale protests against the U.S.-Japanese alliance that altered the alliance’s security provisions. Bringing together the history of foreign relations, popular protest, and democratic thought, this book provides a new understanding the trans-Pacific Cold War order, and the impact of democratic visions, both domestic and foreign, on the conduct of U.S foreign policy. Choice named Cold War Democracy an Outstanding Academic Title for 2019. Professor Miller is currently working on a second book that examines how East Asian growth shaped American thinking about capitalism, political order, and social and cultural vitality from the 1970s to the early 2000s, with particularly attention to questions of the family and gender order. Her most recent article from this project explores neoconservative thinking about East Asian growth, the importance of tradition, and the nature of capitalism in the 1970s and 1980s. She has also written about the ways in which Japan’s economic rise in the 1970s and 1980s shaped President Donald Trump’s approach to international trade and globalization. The author of two oral history collections on the Korean and Vietnam Wars, Professor Miller is also a faculty leader of the Dartmouth Vietnam Project. + View more View Curriculum Vitae Personal Website Contact Jennifer.M.Miller@Dartmouth.edu (603)646-2523 410 Carson Hall 6107 Department(s) History Center(s) The John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding Education Ph.D. University of Wisconsin-Madison M.A. University of Wisconsin-Madison B.A. Wesleyan University Areas of Expertise International History /United States and the World /The Cold War /World War II in the Pacific /U.S.-Japanese Relations /History of capitalism Selected Publications "Neo Conservatives and Neo-Confucians: East Asian Growth and the Celebration of Tradition," Modern Intellectual History, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/S147924432000027X “From Mental Slavery to Brainwashing: Anti-Catholic Legacies in Anti-Communist Polemics,” in Todd Weir and Hugh McLeod ed., Defending the Faith: Religious and Secular Apologetics in Twentieth Century Politics.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of History Undergraduate Overview History FAQs for First Year and Transfer Students How to Declare a Major or Minor in History Major Modified Major Minor Transfer Credit Policy Course Descriptions First-Year Seminars Introductory Africa, Asia, Latin America & The Caribbean (AALAC) Europe (EUR) Interregional & Comparative (INTER) United States (US) Seminars & Colloquia Independent Study & Honors Course Schedule 2021-2022 Schedule 2022-2023 Schedule 2023-2024 Schedule Course Syllabi Honors Thesis Program General Timeline Guidelines for the Class of 2022 Guidelines for the Class of 2023 Honors Theses By Year Phi Alpha Theta Honors Society Prizes After Graduation Alumni Update Research Overview Faculty Research Initiatives Dartmouth History Institute Student Research Initiatives and Resources The Dartmouth Vietnam Project History Librarian Research Funding Resources Undergraduate Research Database Student Class Projects Foreign Study News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
