Normally, identity is verified with a password, but verifying with a second factor, such as a mobile phone, helps prevent anyone but the owner of an account from signing in, even if they know the password. Because 2FA mitigates the risk of stolen passwords, it’s an effective response to current threats to UW systems and data, including employee information managed in Workday. UW-IT has implemented Duo as the University’s 2FA solution. Enroll in Duo 2FA Duo is available to all faculty, staff, and student employees who sign in with a UW NetID to access systems protected by 2FA, such as Workday. Information on enrolling in Duo can be found on UW-IT’s Two-factor authentication page. Duo Eligibility for Former UW Employees Former employees are eligible to enroll in Duo through the remainder of the year in which they left the University, plus three years afterward. For example, an employee who left the UW in November of 2020 will be eligible for Duo through the remainder of 2020, all of 2021, 2022, and 2023; after 2023, they are no longer eligible. If you are outside of the Duo eligibility window, please refer to the Resources For Former Employees page for guidance. Signing In to Workday Using Duo 2FA Once enrolled, you can sign in to Workday using 2FA. View the ISC’s Quick Guide on how to log in to Workday using 2FA (PDF). Need Help? Support for 2FA and Duo is provided by UW-IT. More details about 2FA are available at IT Connect, which includes a 2FA FAQ. The UW-IT Service Center can be contacted at help@uw.edu or by phone at 206-221-5000.
