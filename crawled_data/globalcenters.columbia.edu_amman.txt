The Center has deepened engagement with local partners, international organizations, regional universities, and the Jordanian government to facilitate knowledge exchange between academia and practitioners. Through a multidisciplinary approach and a range of initiatives, we have supported the development of local capacity in research and data collection to address operational agencies’ programming and advocacy needs to inform policy recommendations.
