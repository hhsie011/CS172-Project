Here the world-class Dartmouth faculty---among the top researchers in the world in the targeted subjects of quantum and condensed matter physics, plasma and fluids, space physics, and astronomy, astrophysics and cosmology---work side-by-side with students.

The graduate curriculum includes rigorous core coursework, coupled with an intense program of specialization through close interaction with faculty, advisors and mentors. As the smallest of the Ivy League institutions, Dartmouth maintains a tradition of close student-faculty interaction, a tradition which is also followed in the Physics and Astronomy graduate program. The graduate program admits eight to ten new PhD students per year, with a total enrollment of approximately 50 students. The department has seventeen full-time faculty members and twelve research and adjunct faculty. In addition, there are typically ten postdoctoral research associates and visiting faculty in the department at a given time. The best way for students to get involved in research is to directly contact the faculty member whose research most interests them. Come find out about the experimental physics labs, state-of-the-art computing facilities, and access to telescopes and astronomical observatories. At Dartmouth, students not only push the frontiers of knowledge, they can break boundaries through interdisciplinary research with affiliated faculty in engineering physics at Dartmouth's Thayer School of Engineering and biomedical physics at the Dartmouth Medical School. Students also participate in the educational directives of the department as teaching assistants. All incoming graduate students receive interactive training in how to teach, how to run a course, and how to be a mentor. The life of the department centers around an active colloquium program and seminar series, featuring speakers from top universities and research centers. Seminar series in quantum and condensed matter physics, space and plasma physics, and astrophysics and cosmology augment the weekly meetings and journal clubs held by individual research groups. And a weekly tea- and coffee-time brings the department together socially. For more information about the graduate program, please contact the graduate admissions chair, Alexander Rimberg.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Physics and Astronomy Undergraduate Overview Information for New Students Physics Major Astronomy Major Engineering Physics Major Undergraduate Awards Honors Recent Senior Theses Undergraduate Requirements Physics and Astronomy Course Offerings Physics Society Student Research Opportunities Careers in Physics and Astronomy Astronomy and Your Career Undergraduate Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Graduate Overview Graduate Awards Apply Financial Aid Degree Requirements Courses Recent PhD Graduates Graduate Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Foreign Study Overview Astronomy FSP in South Africa Research Overview All Projects Astrophysics Current Projects Particles, Fields, Gravitation, and Cosmology Current Projects Gravitational Quantum Physics Quantum and Condensed Matter Current Projects Plasma and Space Physics Current Projects Resources Overview Weather Archive News & Events News & Events Colloquia Physics and Astronomy Colloquia Colloquium Archives (before 2017) Symposiums Symposium on Charles Young's 1869 Discovery of Coronium Jay Lawrence Symposium Archive Pressure of Light Symposium Public Lecture Archives Public Observing People Faculty & Staff Students Alumni Advisory Board Membership Directory Committee Assignments Department Chair Diversity Statement Graduate Advisor Undergraduate Advisor My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
