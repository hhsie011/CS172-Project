Resources for Helping Students The website of the Dean of the College has a number of resources for helping students with academic, personal, and institutional difficulties. For help with students' psychological or academic issues, Campus Life maintains a helpful list of contacts. Teaching Relief Faculty may receive teaching relief when they assume significant administrative duties, when they buy out one or more courses with outside funds, or when they are the primary caregiver of a child, in accordance with the policy on parental teaching relief. Brown's policy on administrative teaching relief in general: Faculty must teach at least one course per semester that they are in residence, so course releases are not available to faculty who normally teach fewer than three courses per year. The number of available administrative course releases is determined by the size of the department. All teaching relief is contingent upon the approval of the department chair and the relevant Dean.
