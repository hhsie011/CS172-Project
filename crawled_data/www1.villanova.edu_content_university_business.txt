According to a new study, adding female executives changes how the C-suite thinks about and pursues innovation. When female appointees join top management teams, the C-suite’s way of thinking changes in two ways to become more open to change and less risk-seeking. As a result of these changes in thinking, firms rely less on an acquisitive approach (e.g. performed fewer M&As) and more on building their innovative capabilities internally (e.g. invested more in R&D).
