Our collections support free and open inquiry, and we are committed to providing equitable access to our collections, exhibitions, and programming to a global community of students, scholars, and the public. Strategic Collecting Directions Six areas of thematic emphasis will be used as strategic foci for collecting (listed alphabetically). These strategic collecting directions also inform each other. This purposeful interconnectedness creates a holistic basis for research, education, and public engagement that encourages the kind of expansive and imaginative inquiry for which Brown University is renowned. They also create a richer and more cohesive intellectual context for a remarkable set of existing collections, allow for strategic and sustainable collecting, and create a path for reparative and community-based collecting.
