We wanted to let you know that we can now train virtually/remotely for the NNNS-II. In addition, we are offering an NNNS Rounds - first date in Fall 2021 (date to be announced soon). TRAINING OBJECTIVES: Trainees will learn to: 1. Use the required testing materials 2. Administer the items 3. Observe newborn behaviors during the evaluation 4. Score the exam Upon completion, trainees may be certified to administer the NNNS-II. IN-PERSON TRAINING SEMINARS: Training seminars are structured to meet the specific needs of those being trained. Training is intensive, didactic and very hands-on. The preferred approach is to arrange two training sessions several weeks apart to allow for a period of time between sessions during which the trainee(s) can practice administering and scoring the exam. However, with adequate preparation, most examiners can complete the training within a single 5-day* training session. *Some examiners with extensive infant experience and pre-visit preparation, can achieve certification in less than 5 days. IN-PERSON TRAINING LOCATIONS: Training may be provided at WOMEN & INFANTS HOSPITAL (WIH) in Providence, Rhode Island or a certified trainer may come to your facility.
