Explore Novel Biological Research and Thrive Beyond the Classroom Major in biology and get a background in chemical, mathematical, and physical sciences, as well as broad preparation in the biological sciences. The Bachelor of Science in Biology degree program at UCF allows you to choose coursework in general biology or select a track in one of five areas. Through electives selected with the help of your faculty advisor, you’ll have the opportunity to work in subspecialties, including molecular biology, conservation biology and marine biology. Additionally this program can prepare you for a future in human or veterinary medicine and other professional degrees. Program coursework helps you develop critical thinking skills and exposes you to a wide variety of scientific knowledge from various biology subdisciplines. You’ll learn skills related to the conduct of science, including hypothesis testing, experimental design, accessing and understanding scientific literature, analyzing data, as well as laboratory and field skills specific to certain scientific areas. Plus, through independent study contracts, gain first-hand experience and exposure to specialized topics beyond the classroom. The diverse background and training that you’ll receive through the biology program opens the door to numerous opportunities after completing your degree — from human health to environmental science to conservation. You can also continue on to more advanced study in medical, biomedical, life sciences, and other disciplines.
