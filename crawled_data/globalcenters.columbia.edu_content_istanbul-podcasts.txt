It revolves around Ishtar, a major ancient goddess of the region, who allows us to reimagine the arts of civilization as aspects of her all-encompassing nature and attributes, inscribed into the historical and archaeological record as if a diary. But these diaries are in a state of continuous becoming. Each time we engaged with them, we have come to redefine ourselves through them, reshape them, remember and forget some of their parts, and add new memories to them. These accumulating narratives are the biographies or diaries that we aim to explore in this podcast. Through this journey, we hope to challenge the colonial and patriarchal narratives and interpretations forced onto this heritage, to contribute to its preservation, to place it in the backdrop of original and often ethereal music produced by contemporary female musicians from the region, and to demonstrate that the ancient past is relevant beyond the realm of academia.

Museum of the University of Pennsylvania, Courtesy of the Penn Museum, object no. B16665. Listen to the episode here. In this episode titled In Praise of Ishtar, we invite the renowned Iraqi-American poet Dunya Mikhail to read excerpts from the "Exaltation of Inana", a hymn dedicated to the great Mesopotamian goddess Inana/Ishtar and composed by the priestess Enheduanna, daughter of King Sargon and high-priestess to the moon god Nanna. The hymn is dated to the 3rd millennium BC and makes Enheduanna the first known poet in history. Dunya Mikhail shares her own poetry and in this exchange of rhymes, ancient and new, we create a bridge between the first poet and a modern one, two women with shared heritage as well as shared experiences such as loss of home and exile. We invite our listeners to revel in the poetry but to also explore, guided by the lyrical voice of Ms. Mikhail, themes of war and alienation or the female voice, all in praise of Ishtar. Dunya Mikhail is an Iraqi-American poet and the author of several books of poetry, among them The Iraqi Nights, Diary of a Wave Outside the Sea, winner of the 2010 Arab American Book Award for Poetry, and The War Works Hard. She is also the author of a non-fiction book, The Beekeeper, an account of enslavement of women by ISIS.

In the first half of 2021, as well as working on further soundtrack work, Al Qadiri releases her third album on Hyperdub titled Medieval Femme which expands on ideas instilled from Atlantics to capture a dreamlike setting, shaded with colour and subtle friction. Inspired by the state of melancholic longing exemplified in the classical poems of Arab women, the theme of the album is the line between desire and desolation, questioning two seemingly opposite states and rejoicing in celestial sorrow. The Persian poem featured in the soundscape of this episode, "Dar Peykarehyi az Sang" (In A Body of Stone) was written by Sheida Dayani in 2013 in Amed, also known as Diyarbakir, Turkey, inspired by the marble statue of 'Tigris and Euphrates' by the Turkish sculptor Babek Sobhi.

What did the Babylonian sciences look like, and how did they read and interpret natural phenomena? What paradigms were at the basis of their predictive sciences? What role did the cuneiform script play in their philosophy of science? These are some of the questions that we will explore in a conversation with professor Marc Van de Mieroop. We discuss rational astronomy and irrational astrology, and whether these distinctions can be extended back in time by thousands of years when Babylonians practiced those sciences. We also engage with broader topics on how science has been redefined in different ways throughout history, our changing expectations from science, and our conceptions of rationality vs irrationality or logical vs illogical. Marc Van de Mieroop is a professor at the History Department at Columbia University, and specializes in the history of the ancient Near East from the beginning of writing to the age of Alexander of Macedon. He has also taught at the University of Oxford and Yale University, and is currently the Director of Columbia’s Center for the Ancient Mediterranean and Founding Editor of the Journal of Ancient Near Eastern History.

Provenance unknown, said to be from Dilbat, Iraq. 47.1a-h. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, Fletcher, Fund 1947. Listen to the episode here. In this episode we invite the Curator in Charge of the Department of Ancient Near Eastern Art at the Metropolitan Museum, Dr. Kim Benzel, to speak to us of ancient jewelry and how jewelry, in its shapes, materials, motifs and making is imbued with far more than the eye beholds. Dr. Kim Benzel who is an expert of ancient Near Eastern jewelry, and herself a maker having studied goldsmithing techniques, will speak to us of the multi-faceted nature of ancient jewelry making, and how these objects of superficial beauty can encapsulate other-worldly power, often transformed into objects of reverence themselves. We invite our listeners to join us for a fascinating exploration of the many meanings of ancient jewelry, with an expert who equally sheds light on complex techniques of making. In the exquisite objects we explore, another facet of the goddess Inana/Ishtar is revealed, as we discuss jewelry pieces fit for a goddess. Kim Benzel is Curator in Charge of the Department of Ancient Near Eastern Art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She holds a PhD in art history and archaeology from Columbia University, where her research focused on the grand funerary jewelry ensemble of an elite Mesopotamian woman of the 3rd millennium BC.

In this episode, we are following the trail of Ishtar from Southern Mesopotamia into the ancient Land of Cilicia. In the Mound of Tarsus and the hill-top citadel of Azatiwataya, we will talk about riveting ancient objects which bear traces of Ishtar as well as the illustrious women archaeologists who discovered and worked on them. We will talk about the contributions of Hetty Goldman, Machteld J. Mellink and Halet Çambel, whose lives intersected in these two sites, to the development of archaeology in Turkey. Within an archaeological and cultural landscape through which Ishtar travelled, we hope to narrate stories of women in ancient and contemporary times together.
