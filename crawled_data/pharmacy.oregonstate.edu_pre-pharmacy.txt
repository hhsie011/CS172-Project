Most pre-pharmacy undergraduates choose majors in the College of Science, and receive academic advising and other support services from that college while undergraduates. Many students choose to major in BioHealth Sciences with a Pre-Pharmacy option. Completing the prerequisite courses prepares students to apply to the Pharm.D. program. There are many benefits to completing your undergraduate prerequisite coursework at Oregon State, including opportunities to study and conduct research with College of Pharmacy faculty members, access to College of Pharmacy advisors, and participation in the Early Assurance Program. Apply for undergraduate admission to Oregon State through the Office of Admissions. Individuals who have already completed a bachelor's degree, but who want to take prerequisite courses at Oregon State, should apply for admission as post-baccalaureate or non-degree seeking students. Contact the Office of Admissions for more information.
