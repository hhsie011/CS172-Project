Scientists at all training and professional levels are encouraged to bring their expertise of the brain and the extraordinary resources of the university to the wider community. At CUNO, we believe that bringing scientists to education and bringing science to children results in a rich experience that both enhances the communication ability of future scientists and improves the scientific literacy of future citizens. CUNO seeks to achieve these goals by placing graduate students and other scientists in K-12 classrooms throughout New York City to lead workshops about the brain.
