To qualify, a person must have taught at least three credit hours as a Teacher of Record during the semester and be presently enrolled and pursuing a graduate degree from Baylor. Nominees are chosen based on student evaluations and the input of their Graduate Program Director, with a maximum of three nominations from each department. Previous winners are ineligible to apply for a second award. Nominees are informed of their selection and offered the opportunity to apply for the Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor Award. Applications include statement of teaching philosophy, participation in programs to increase teaching skills, recommendation letters from both a mentor and a classroom student, and the complete student evaluations from all courses taught during the semester. A panel of judges ranks each application to choose the top outstanding award recipient. The award is given in the areas of STEM, Social Sciences, and Humanities, for a total of 3 awards per semester, recognized at the annual Graduate School Awards Luncheon. Recipients are honored at an award luncheon, given a plaque to commemorate their achievement, and granted an additional travel award to be used to attend a conference or conference sessions that will further inform their teaching. 2020-21 Winners Jonathan Stanfill, Department of Mathematics Christina Lambert, Department of English Nate Scholten, Department of Curriculum & Instruction Note: The COVID-19 pandemic interrupted the award cycle in 2020 and 2021. 2019-20 Winners Taylor Thompson, Department of Mathematics Matt Turnbull, Department of English Julia Robinson, Department of Public Health Amanda Hernandez, Department of Sociology Mads Reynolds, Department of Mathematics Christopher Ruiz, Department of Political Science 2018-19 James Davidson, Department of Sociology Tori Hudgins, Department of Mathematics Kenneth Vaughan, Department of Sociology Nicholas Colgrove, Department of Philosophy Sara Dye, Department of English Samantha Hodges, Department of BioMedical Studies 2017-2018 Dani Crain, Department of Biology Corina Kaul, Department of Educational Psychology Elise Leal, Department of History Nicholas Werse, Department of Religion Blake Kent, Department of Sociology Kristina Amrani, Department of Health and Human Performance 2016-2017 Adina Johnson, Department of History Keith Kerschen, Department of Curriculum & Instruction.
