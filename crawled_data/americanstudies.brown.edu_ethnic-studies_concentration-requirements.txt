Courses taken toward the fulfillment of concentration requirements must be at or above the 1000 level. At the advisor's discretion, a student may count a single course below the 1000 level towards their requirements. This class must be taught by a core faculty member listed on the department's website and may be offered through another department. ETHN 1000 “Introduction to Ethnic Studies” Any two courses from the ETHN 1200 “Topics in Ethnic Studies” or ETHN 1750 “Advanced Topics in Ethnic Studies” sequence, or similar electives in AMST, as approved by the advisor Four classes that address the student’s focus area and that prepare them for the capstone experience. At least two of these classes must bear an ETHN designation. Of the other two classes, only one may be a Department Independent Study Project (DISP). If a student pursues that option, the class must be undertaken with core faculty, all of whom are listed on the department website, and it must be offered under an ETHN course number. Please consult the guidelines for designing a DISP. A Department Independent Study Project Form and a draft syllabus will be due to the Director of Undergraduate Studies no later than two weeks into the semester the DISP takes place. An ETHN 1650 methods class An AMST 1700 Junior Seminar ETHN 1900 “Ethnic Studies Senior Seminar” Honors in the concentration requires two additional independent study courses (taken semesters 7 and 8) and the honors seminar (taken semester 6). Course Substitutions/Exceptions All courses listed here are required unless stated otherwise. Class substitutions are discouraged for the following reasons: We want our students to have as many common experiences as a cohort as possible. This means, we are actively looking for ways to get more of you in the same class. We want these common experiences to be in courses taught by professors in our department who have a clearer sense of the entire concentration. We want our concentrators to prioritize Ethnic Studies. As always, consult with your advisor, and make an intellectual argument for any exception based on how a particular class is important to your focus area or your proposed capstone project. If you plan to study abroad, make sure your courses are materially relevant to the concentration and do not make you exceed the two non-ETHN classes permitted in the focus area. Stay in regular contact with your advisor and seek pre-approval. Outside Courses Under normal circumstances, up to two classes taught outside the ETHN tag can count towards the focus area, assuming they have 50% material relevant to Ethnic Studies. This is at the advisor's discretion, and you should consult the advisor at the moment that you are considering the class, during the shopping period, and present a syllabus at that time so they can pre-approve it. Please do not assume that at the end of the semester, the advisor will automatically approve a class. Questions To address any questions you may have about where you are in the concentration: Update your ASK profile so that you have listed all of the classes you wish to count towards the concentration, and so that your brief essay describes what your focus area is, which classes are counting towards it, and what you hope to take soon. Schedule a meeting. If you have questions that cannot wait, update ASK and email your questions to the advisor. Please do not ask to speak to a professor after class.
