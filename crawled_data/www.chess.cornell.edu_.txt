Join us as we celebrate the technical and scientific achievements made by the light source community over the past 75 years. Learn More HMF - A first-of-its-kind X-Ray facility X-rays can uniquely address fundamental, long-standing questions about the nature of matter in high magnetic fields. The new HMF facility will enable research that is currently not achievable anywhere in the world. Upcoming Workshop at CHESS - June 8 The Optical Control of Physical Processes Probed with X-rays workshop will identify forefront research opportunities for optical control of physical properties in biological, chemical, and materials systems. This workshop will also address instrumentation related to the implementation of optical experiments at x-ray facilities.
