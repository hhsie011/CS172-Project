Personal Librarians for First-Year & Transfer Students If this is your first year at NC State, your personal librarian is your "go-to" person for all things library-related. They can help you navigate our various resources and services as well as answer any questions you have, even if they're not library-specific. First-year & transfer students, find your personal librarian. Be on the lookout for emails and appointment invitations from them throughout the semester!
