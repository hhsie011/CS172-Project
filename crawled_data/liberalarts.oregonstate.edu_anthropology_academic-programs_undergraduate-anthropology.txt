Prehistoric, ethnographic, and linguistic study provides the basis for understanding how a variety of societies solve common problems. Anthropology bridges sciences and the humanities and develops critical thinking, communication skills, facility with group processes, and the ability to work independently. It can help students succeed in an increasingly interconnected and complex world.

It is part of a system of communication firmly rooted in individual and group identities within cultures around the world. When and how we eat, what is considered acceptable to eat, how we prepare it, and how we learn about producing and eating food are all fascinating questions to explore by humanists and social scientists. Histories of particular food commodities and changes in the way people think about sustaining healthy bodies richly contextualizes our present practices. Cultural analyses of food and food production lead us to question the level of social justice within the local and global food systems. Community food security is a condition in which all community residents obtain a safe, culturally acceptable, nutritionally adequate diet through a sustainable food system that maximizes community self-reliance and social justice. Students who complete this certificate will not only have a clear idea of the cultural bases of food and food production, but will obtain some experience working towards community food security. Language in Culture Certificate Description Are you intrigued by the nature of human languages and the central role of language in human culture? OSU undergraduates have the opportunity to focus their coursework in Language in Culture while pursuing the major of their choice. Students may enroll in this program in either Anthropology or World Languages and Literatures. They will then follow a coherent body of coursework in multiple departments and receive recognition of this fact on their transcripts and diploma. Students will learn about linguistic diversity, first and second language acquisition, and the ways in which communication patterns vary from cultural group to cultural group. The application of sociolinguistic research to real life problems is a cornerstone of the program. This certificate program can easily be completed within a 4 year B.A. degree since certificate credits can be concurrent with both major requirements and Baccalaureate Core requirements. Baccalaureate Core requirements, however, cannot be taken within the major department. Women, Gender, & Sexuality Studies Description The Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies undergraduate certificate is designed to facilitate the broad interdisciplinary study of gender and women’s issues. It emphasizes the diversity of women’s experience through a focus on disciplinary-based knowledge about women’s lives and relationships in the many schools/departments where courses on gender are taught. Certificate Code: C808 Minor A grade of C– or better is required for all courses used to complete minor requirements. Such courses cannot be taken for an S/U grade.
