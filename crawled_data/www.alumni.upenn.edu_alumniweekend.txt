Public health guidance at the University may differ from what has been advised at the state and federal levels. Guidance may change depending on COVID-19 trends and positivity rates on campus and within the University's surrounding communities. In alignment with policies of the University and the Philadelphia Department of Public Health, all event participants, spectators, and visitors must complete a day-of symptom check through PennOpen Campus and follow all other University public health guidance. As of April 22, masks are no longer required in indoor public spaces on campus. While there are no changes to our current policies, we encourage everyone to follow these precautions. Masks are strongly encouraged around others in all spaces. If you plan to attend events with food, we encourage you to distance from others while eating or drinking and to mask when not eating or drinking. Anyone attending an event indoors with food and drinks should consider taking a rapid test prior to attending. If you have a sniffle or a scratchy throat, please mask and test, or consider staying home. 266th Commencement Ceremony Celebrating the Class of 2022 Ken Burns, Honorary Doctor of Arts and 2022 Commencement Speaker American documentary filmmaker Recipient of 16 Emmy Awards and 2 Academy Award nominations Ken Burns has been making documentary films for more than 40 years.
