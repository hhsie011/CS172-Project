As a volunteer you will assist in evaluating candidates through assessment of their interviewing and communication skills, the quality of their work experience, and the match of the applicant with Columbia Business School. In light of ongoing health and safety precautions, alumni ambassadors are asked to conduct interviews virtually via Skype or another video-conferencing platform. This is a temporary accommodation for the 2020-21 application process, and we hope to resume in-person alumni ambassador interviews as soon as conditions allow.
