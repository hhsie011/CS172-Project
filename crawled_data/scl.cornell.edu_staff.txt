A message from Vice President Lombardi Our work in Student & Campus Life impacts every student on Cornell’s campus. We provide opportunities to learn outside the classroom, through programs and services that inspire transformation and development. Some of you see transformation occurring first hand in your daily work with students, and others of you find transformation in your work with each other. Whatever your role, I hope you see transformation as a part of it, and how your work contributes to the experiences our students have throughout their time at Cornell. This website serves as your hub of information on who we are and resources available to support your work. In a division as vast as ours, and with a team composed of individuals with varied knowledge and expertise, I encourage you, also, to utilize your colleagues—our greatest collective resource. I look forward to our continued work together, and appreciate all you do. Ryan T. Lombardi, Ed.D.
