Each speaker is invited to present a Friday colloquium and lunch with several graduate schools, during which she is encouraged to discuss her path to success. Speakers are both invited and hosted by graduate students. Funding for this program is generously provided by the Brown Chemistry Department and the Office of Institutional Equity and Diversity. The series piloted with Prof. Catherine Drennan (MIT) and Suzanne Walker (Harvard).
