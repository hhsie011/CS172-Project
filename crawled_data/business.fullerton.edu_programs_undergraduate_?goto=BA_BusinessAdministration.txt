Behavioral and quantitative sciences are studied in both theoretical and applied contexts. Mathematics is used as a key tool in the analysis of complex problems and in the interpretation of data. Emphasis is placed on effective oral and written communication. Students are made aware of the need for imaginative, innovative solutions to business problems that encompass human needs and ethical objectives. All students in the business administration major are required to complete common requirements in core courses, a capstone course, and Global Business course. In addition, students choose an area of specialization known as the concentration. Concentrations are offered in: Course Catalog Accounting Human Resources Management Business Analytics Information Systems Business Economics Legal Studies Management Decision Sciences Marketing Entertainment and Hospitality Management Operations & Supply Chain Management Entrepreneurship Risk Management and Insurance Finance Joint Emphasis in Accounting/Finance General Management Joint Emphasis in Accounting/Information Systems Joint Emphasis in Marketing/Information Systems Prerequisite Sheets 2016-2017 Accounting (PDF) Human Resources Management (PDF) Business Analytics (PDF) Information System (PDF) Business Economics (PDF) Legal Studies Management (PDF) Decision Sciences (PDF) Marketing (PDF) Entertainment and Tourism Management (PDF) Operations & Supply Chain Management (PDF) Entrepreneurship (PDF) Risk Management and Insurance (PDF) Finance (PDF) Accounting/Finance Emphasis (PDF) General Management (PDF) Accounting/Information System Emphasis (PDF) Marketing/Information System Emphasis (PDF) Four-Year Roadmaps 2016-2017 Accounting (PDF) Human Resources Management (PDF) Business Analytics (PDF) Information System (PDF) Business Economics (PDF) Legal Studies Management (PDF) Decision Sciences (PDF) Marketing (PDF) Entertainment and Tourism Management (PDF) Operations & Supply Chain Management (PDF) Entrepreneurship (PDF) Risk Management and Insurance (PDF) Finance (PDF) Accounting/Finance Emphasis (PDF) General Management (PDF) Accounting/Information System Emphasis (PDF) Marketing/Information System Emphasis (PDF) The Global Business course must be outside of your concentration area.

Study Abroad programs may be used to meet the Global Business course requirement, provided the program involves at least three units of upper-division credit that is accepted by CSUF. The college's internship courses and independent studies that involve an international study may be used to meet this requirement, but require prior approval of the college's associate dean.
