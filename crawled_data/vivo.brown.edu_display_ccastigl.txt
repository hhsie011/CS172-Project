She investigates how seemingly marginalized individuals have challenged systems of power through the strategies of adversarial literacy, a mastery of the skills necessary to advocate for oneself through legal and bureaucratic systems. Her first book, Patrons and Adversaries: Nobles and Villagers in Italian Politics, 1640-1760 (Oxford University Press, 2005) won the Helen and Howard R. Marraro Prize from the Society for Italian Historical Studies in 2006. Her book Accounting for Affection: Mothering and Politics in Rome, 1630-1730 (Palgrave Macmillan, 2015) examines the figure of the mater litigans or litigating mother, whose activities illustrate the symbiotic evolution of politics and mothering in early modern Rome. Castiglione earned her PhD in History from Harvard University. She has twice been a fellow of the American Council of Learned Societies. The Howard Foundation, the American Philosophical Society, and the Delmas Foundation have also supported her research. She teaches courses on microhistory, the history of women, gender and sexuality, popular culture, and law courts and legal culture in early modern Italy and Europe.

Full Text Research Research Overview Caroline Castiglione’s research has uncovered how seemingly marginalized individuals were able to challenge the systems of power that in theory left them without a voice. By focusing on rarely utilized village archives or the underestimated resistance of Roman women, she has furthered our understanding of the ways that marginalized groups used both written protests and non-violent judicial means to defy the limits placed on their lives. In both teaching and research, she emphasizes the gradual and collective elements of this process and the forgotten individuals who contributed to it. Her first book, Patrons and Adversaries: Nobles and Villagers in Italian Politics, 1640-1760 (Oxford University Press, 2005) won the Helen and Howard R. Marraro Prize from the Society for Italian Historical Studies in 2006. Her book, Accounting for Affection: Mothering and Politics in Rome, 1630-1730 (Palgrave Macmillan, 2015) examines the figure of the mater litigans or litigating mother, whose activities illustrate the symbiotic evolution of politics and mothering in early modern Rome. Current research interests include the political thought of the Venetian writer Moderata Fonte, about whom she has written an article for the forthcoming volume, Challenging Women’s Agency and Activism in Early Modernity, edited by Merry Wiesner-Hanks. Together with co-author Suzanne Scanlan, she received the 2017 Best Article Prize for Volume 11 (2016-17) of Early Modern Women: An Interdisciplinary Journal for article, for “Death Did Not Become Her: Unconventional Women and the Problem of Female Commemoration in Early Modern Rome,” Early Modern Women: An Interdisciplinary Journal 11.2 (2017): 59-92. Research Statement Caroline Castiglione’s research has uncovered how seemingly marginalized individuals were able to challenge the systems of power that in theory left them without a voice. By focusing on rarely utilized village archives or the underestimated resistance of Roman women, she has furthered our understanding of the ways that marginalized groups used both written protests and non-violent judicial means to defy the limits placed on their lives. In both teaching and research, she emphasizes the gradual and collective elements of this process and the forgotten individuals who contributed to it. Social, cultural, and political intersections shape her research – places, practices, and texts in which contradictions and transgressions in meaning among historical actors suggest the complexity of the past. In Patrons and Adversaries, this multifaceted approach revealed the diversity of actors who jostled for control of the Roman countryside. Villagers defended their rights through the strategies she called "adversarial literacy," practices that ranged from mastery of their constitutions to debates in the village assembly, from dragging their feet in the payment of dues to dragging their lords into papal courts. In its later manifestations, adversarial literacy involved villagers writing and interpreting sources for themselves in order to challenge the monopoly on text-making claimed by ruling elites in Rome. A lost world of increasingly savvy villagers, irate nobles, and exasperated bureaucrats is analyzed to illustrate how villagers challenged who controlled the rural world. A similarly eclectic approach in Accounting for Affection uncovered the symbiotic evolution of politics and mothering in early modern Rome. Through an examination of a range of maternal sources -- women's legal activities, their letters, and their daily routines of caring for children -- Castiglione mapped the intersection of maternal affection, female advocacy, and family conflict in the papal city. The figure of the litigating mother, or the mater litigans became a fixture in seventeenth-century Rome. She challenged the assumptions of dynastic politics; her practices included petition-writing and lawsuits; her assertions of the centrality of women’s contributions to the aristocratic family challenged the male authorities to whom she was supposed to pledge her deference and allegiance. Castiglione’s multifaceted approach to the sources uncovers a nuanced domestic sphere, infused by contemporary controversies including the debates over probabilism, a contested system of Jesuit ethics and quietism, later declared heretical. Even as physicians extended their reach into the nursery, women remained primarily responsible nonetheless for the survival of their offspring, a role that fueled their stature in the family. Accounting for Affection reveals that some men, increasingly ambivalent about the demands of the dynastic aristocratic family, became reluctant allies in a newer configuration of the family that acknowledged a greater sphere for women and a greater autonomy for children to decide upon their future. Subsequent research on women in Rome has expanded her interests to include the difficulties of commemorating women whose lives broke the boundaries of acceptability. Her article co-authored with Suzanne Scanlan, “Death Did Not Become Her: Unconventional Women and the Problem of Female Commemoration in Early Modern Rome,” won the Best Article Prize (2016-17) from Early Modern Women: An Interdisciplinary Journal. She has continued to mine issues of women and infant health in the early modern period in two articles, “What to Expect When You’re Always Expecting: Frequent Childbirth and Female Health in Early Modern Italy,” and “Peasants at the Palace: Wet Nurses and Aristocratic Mothers in Early Modern Rome.” Current research interests include the political thought of the Venetian writer Moderata Fonte, about whom she has written an article for the forthcoming volume, Challenging Women’s Agency and Activism in Early Modernity, edited by Merry Wiesner-Hanks.
