Issues associated with graduate education are often distinctly different from those that surround undergraduate education. To provide faculty and student input to policy decisions, the Graduate Council represents the Graduate Faculty, serves in an advisory capacity to the Dean of the Graduate College, approves new graduate programs, and establishes educational policies that govern graduate education throughout the College. The Council is elected and meets at least monthly during the academic year.
