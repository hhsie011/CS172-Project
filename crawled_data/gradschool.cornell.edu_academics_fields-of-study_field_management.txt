Finance focuses on the financial structures and requirements of corporations of various types, the problems of maintaining sound financial conditions, the organization and behavior of financial markets of different types, and the influence of public policies on those markets and on corporate finance. Knowledge of accounting is essential. Marketing adapts analytical and behavioral theories commonly used in such disciplines as economics, operations research, psychology, and sociology. Topics addressed include models for new products, pricing theories, theories about advertising effects, advertising and promotion response models, market research techniques, and theories about marketing decisions. Organizational behavior focuses on social and behavioral science approaches to the study of human activity in organizational settings. The major concern is with regularities, differences, and relationships in purposive behavior. A fundamental grounding in at least one of the basic behavioral disciplines is essential. Production and operations management emphasizes the study of quantitative methods of analysis, including the use of the computer, in the solution of major economic decision problems of production and operations management. Quantitative analysis stresses modern developments in the use of mathematical and statistical tools and computer technology for the solution of managerial problems. Note: Students enrolled in the MPS program can pursue either the general MPS in Management or the MPS in Management – Accounting Specialization. Other concentration areas are not available to MPS students.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
