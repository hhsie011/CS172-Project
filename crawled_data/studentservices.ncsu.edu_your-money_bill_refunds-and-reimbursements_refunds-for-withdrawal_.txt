Federal Regulations – Cash Management Refunds for Withdrawal Students who drop all coursework for which they are registered must properly withdraw from the University. Students who fail to properly withdraw may be held liable for the charges on their account, including tuition, fees, housing and/or dining. Withdrawals after the drop/revision deadline are approved by the university only under extenuating circumstances. Documentation is required to support these requests. The documentation must provide evidence that the extenuating circumstances were unforeseeable and unavoidable and caused a serious disruption in academic functioning. Submission of a withdrawal request after the drop/revision deadline is not guaranteed approval. Students should have contingency plans in place in case a withdrawal request is delayed or denied. Tuition and fee refunds for official withdrawals are prorated based on the Refund for Withdrawal Schedule. How to Withdraw Term withdrawal information including the withdrawal process and timeline is available for graduate students, undergraduate students, Agricultural Institute students and Non-Degree Studies students. Talk to a financial aid counselor if you are receiving funds awarded by the Office of Scholarships & Financial Aid to understand all policies regarding withdrawal from the University. Review the refund for withdrawal schedule to view the prorated rate for refunds. Refund for Withdrawal Schedule Tuition and fee refunds for official withdrawals are prorated based on the schedule below. No refunds are made for official withdrawals after 50 percent of the enrollment period. NOTE: An administrative fee of 5 percent of the total tuition and fee, and late registration fee charges not to exceed $100, will be charged for all withdrawals processed. This fee will post to your account after your withdrawal is processed.

File a Refund Application Students have the right to file an appeal in the form of a refund application. The appeal must be substantiated by medical reasons, unexpected employment changes, death in the immediate family, or University error and will be reviewed by the University Fee Appeals Committee. The appeal can not be processed if you have received academic credit for the course. Refunds will be processed after the Census Date and will be deposited to the student’s bank account or mailed to the student’s home/mailing address. Application for University Fee Appeal Return of Federal Student Aid Funds The Federal Higher Education Act requires the University to calculate a Return of Federal Student Aid Funds for students who withdraw (officially or unofficially) from all classes on or before the 60 percent attendance point in the semester. When a student officially withdraws, using a pro-rata schedule, the percentage of the semester attended is used to calculate the amount of the student’s earned versus unearned Federal student aid funds. When a student unofficially withdraws (abandons all classes without official notification) the midpoint of the term is used to calculate the percentage of the term completed and earned versus unearned funds. Unearned portions of Federal student aid funds are returned to the appropriate aid program(s) in the following order: Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan Federal Direct Subsidized Loan Federal Graduate PLUS Loan Federal Parent PLUS Loan Federal Pell Grant Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant Formulas for calculating the unearned portions of State and Institutional student aid funds may differ from the Federal refund calculation. Tuition and fees refunds may offset reductions in Federal, State, and Institutional aid. However, any final balance created by the return of student financial aid funds will be due from the student to the University. Students withdrawing from classes are responsible for payment of any balance due after the required return of Federal student aid funds. Students are encouraged to contact the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid to discuss the potential effects of withdrawing before taking the action.
