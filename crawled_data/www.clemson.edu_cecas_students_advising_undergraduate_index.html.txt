Magazine Outreach Ways to Give Clemson Home College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences Students Advising Current: Undergraduate Advising Undergraduate Advising Connect with Advisors Advising is a partnership between a student and an advisor. It takes effort by both parties to ensure a great experience. Your academic advisor is an advocate for you who can help develop a plan to help you meet any educational goals. Please contact your advisor when there are any questions about policies, procedures, resources, or monitoring your progress. During the semester, students have the option to request an appointment or visit during drop-in hours. Meet the Team Explore Majors Advising Forms Degree Planning Navigating Your Degree CU Navigate CU Navigate is a student-centered mobile app that provides individualized, student-centered information. The app allows students to access campus resources, schedule advising appointments easily, and receive proactive messages if there are any emerging problems. Resources are available to help you understand your homepage, access reports, and how to schedule appointments. CU NavigateCU Navigate Resources Degree Works Degree Works is a tool designed to help monitor progress towards an undergraduate degree. It uses the University Catalog and the student's transcript to produce a simplified audit to identify what courses and requirements are complete, almost complete, or still outstanding. Degree Works in iROAR IROAR Registration iROAR allows you to add and drop classes, register for next semester's classes, and check grades. For undergraduate registration, please have your PIN ready.

Bridge Student Advising Clemson Bridge students at Tri-County Technical College are required to earn at least 30 transferrable credit hours and a grade point average (GPA) of 2.5. Specific majors may have additional requirements. Advising opportunities for Bridge students are available throughout the semester at both Tri-County and Clemson. Academic Advising Advising by Areas of Study Academic advising is broken up by area of study. For all engineering students, you will begin in General Engineering Advising before declaring your major and moving into the specific program. By clicking below, you will view your academic advising team and how to set up an appointment, learn about degree-specific courses, and explore majors and careers. If you need to speak to an advisor at other times during the semester, you can request an appointment or visit drop-in hours. Advising Directory General Engineering Students interested in pursuing an engineering major begin in the General Engineering program. This provides students an opportunity to explore various engineering fields while getting academically prepared for engineering study. After exploring majors and completing introductory requirements, students can declare their intended major. GE Advising Computing The goal of an academic advising session is for students and their advisors to work together to develop an academic plan that helps students reach their academic goals. The School of Computing has dedicated undergraduate advising and student services staff who can assist you with who you should contact about forms, changing majors, or adding a minor. Computing Advising Geology Academic advising is required of all undergraduate degree majors prior to being cleared to register for classes.

Thrive: Get Involved While thriving may look different for all students, we identified two common themes: Relationships and Engagement. Students who thrive have developed networks with peers, faculty, staff, and others they can turn to for advice, help with classes, and FUN. Students who thrive are engaged inside and outside the classroom, which enables them to build relationships and explore and make connections between course content and real applications. Thrive Opportunities Trey Richardson is a mechanical engineering major who has served as an orientation ambassador and an intern with Makerspace in Watt Family Innovation Center. “ “I’ve had an amazing experience with CECAS advising. From registering classes freshman year to helping other students build their own schedules during my orientation ambassador role, I’ve had an incredible time getting to work with these advisors and observing the success they set up for incoming freshmen.” Trey Richardson Mechanical Engineering, '22 Tutoring Study Resources Counseling Accessibility College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences Copyright © Clemson University College of Engineering, Computing and Applied Sciences | Riggs Hall 864-656-3000 | Directory intro-arrow Engage With Us Through Facebook Twitter Instagram YouTube Clemson University Facebook Instagram Twitter Linkedin Youtube Tiktok Policy/Terms of Use Web Accessibility Ethics/Safety Hotline Privacy Policy Copyright © 2022 Clemson University • Clemson, South Carolina 29634 Clemson University Facebook Instagram Twitter Linkedin Youtube Tiktok Resources A-Z Index Campus Map CU Safety Directory Webcams Apply to Clemson
