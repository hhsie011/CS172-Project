Awards are based on the requested amount but are capped by category and in total to assist as many students as possible. High need students will be prioritized.

Examples of expenses eligible for grant consideration include, but are not limited to: tuition, fees, books & supplies, housing, meals, travel, technology required for your academic program, medical costs, childcare costs, and personal expenses related to attending your academic program.
