The Brown Building Security Initiative (BBSI) is a campus security program that seeks to promote voluntary efforts to enhance workplace security by developing and maintaining collaborative partnerships with various academic and non-academic department chairs. It is our hope that through these partnerships we can enhance our ability to assess the security of university buildings, and address possible factors that may compromise the safety of the Brown community and our facilities. The objectives we have identified for this initiative include: Promote the assessment of the security of academic departments and physical spaces. Offer a mechanism to efficiently address issues that may potentially compromise the security of university facilities. Develop and enhance partnerships within the community and further advance the department's community policing and crime prevention efforts into various academic and non-academic spaces across campus. Streamline communications with staff and faculty about safety awareness and security issues. DPS firmly believes that success in achieving greater safety and security on campus is dependent upon the involvement and active participation of many individuals and departments. We also offer general BBSI Information Sessions for staff and faculty, as well as for academic and administrative departments. General information sessions provide an overview of the programs objectives, introduce participants to the general concepts of hostile intruder awareness, and provide guidelines for how individuals can play an active role in enhancing building security at Brown. Department sessions are typically offered following the completion of a security assessment. If you would like to discuss a security assessment for your department/building, please submit your information via this form. You may also contact Officer Mark Perry at 863-1438 for additional information.
