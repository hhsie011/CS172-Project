Large volumes of Graduate Assistant and Faculty Reappointments must be completed each semester. The Mass Appointments process aids by allowing you to reappoint more than one employee at a time. Graduate Assistant Mass Appointments Fall 2022 appointments should have a minimum appointment period of at least five (5) business days before the first day of classes through the last day of finals, as outlined in the academic calendar. Appointments for teaching assignments that require grading duties must continue through the grade submission deadline. Where practicable, graduate assistants who are appointed in both the Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 semesters should have a continuous appointment between semesters, without a break in funding. Departments should prioritize issuing such continuous appointments before utilizing graduate assistants only for an individual semester. GA Mass Appointments are entered by Department Representatives in OMNI HR and then made available in batches to Department Managers for approval. Effective August 8, 2022, a minimum of $20.83 per hour is required. Please ensure your period amount is calculated at this new hourly rate.
