When reading or attending a lecture, maximize your learning by focusing on the visual elements available to you. Classroom Strategies When reading or in class, pay attention to: The professor’s gestures or facial expressions. You will be able to better remember ideas if you can associate them with a specific movement or look of the professor, so if you’re in a big lecture hall, move to the front to better see the speaker. Graphs and charts. Visual learners will be able to better remember concepts through spatial and colored representations, so if your lecturer presents ideas in a chart format, try to copy this rather than writing out all the information in sentences. How you format your notes. Using symbols, flow charts, diagrams or different colors will help you remember the connections between different ideas when you review them later. PowerPoints, pictures, videos, etc. Students can sometimes zone out when videos or PowerPoints are turned on, but remember that the visual stimuli in these media will allow you to better remember the information therein. Study Strategies When studying, try the following: Try redrawing your notes from memory. Don’t just focus on the content, but the layout of the page. This will help reinforce the spatial and content connections on the page. Rewrite your notes replacing words with as many symbols, pictures, or drawings as possible. Create visual study aids in multiple colors. Try making a Prezi. This will force you to retype your notes, and also allow you to incorporate helpful pictures and spatial relationships between words. Write out potential essay questions or test questions to help you see what your answers will look like. Memorize flow charts or diagrams of your information.
