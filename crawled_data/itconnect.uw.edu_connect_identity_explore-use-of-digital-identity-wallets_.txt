This page remains in place to maintain the instructions used for a limited availability proof-of-concept demonstration of digital identity wallets conducted during Spring quarter 2021. The demo was only available to limited audiences in the UW community. To participate in future activities , contact help@uw.edu with ‚Äúdigital identity wallet demo‚Äù in the email subject. Follow these steps to try the demo: StepsActions In your browser, go to identity.uw.edu. Sign in with your UW NetID, as usual. Select the ‚ÄúLabs‚Äù tab at the top. Select the ‚ÄúSelf Sovereign Identity Lab‚Äù. Note: if this lab or the tab isn‚Äôt displayed to you, it means you‚Äôre not (yet) participating in the limited availability proof-of-concept demo. A note about how to participate is included at the top of this page. Now pause‚Ä¶ and note that the demo is organized as four major steps, as follows. Step 1: download and install Connect.Me wallet to your mobile device. Connect.Me on the Apple Store Connect.Me on Google Play Critical ‚Äì during installation make sure that ‚ÄúUse Staging Net‚Äù is toggled ON. This setting is critical because the demo relies on the Sovrin Staging Net to find and resolve the decentralized identifiers (DIDs) involved in and underlying the demo (and the demo gods are rarely kind to those who miss critical instructions). Step 2: Make a connection between your wallet and the UW. In your browser, select the ‚ÄúGenerate QR Code‚Äù button. On your device, open the Connect.Me app. In Connect.Me, tap the ‚ÄúScan‚Äù button (bottom right). Use the app to scan the QR code. Wait a sec‚Ä¶ Accept the connection with UW. Optional ‚Äì tap the hamburger icon and select ‚ÄúMy Connections‚Äù to confirm that you now have your first ‚Äúconnection‚Äù registered in your wallet; it‚Äôs like connecting in the real world, kinda neat on its own but more likely to lead to the question ‚Äúnow what do we do?‚Äù Step 3: Now you can proceed to accept a credential issued by the UW. In your browser, select the ‚ÄúIssue Credentials‚Äù button. Wait a sec‚Ä¶ In Connect.Me, accept the credential offer from the UW. Optional ‚Äì tap the hamburger icon and select ‚ÄúMy Credentials‚Äù to view the credential stored in your wallet. The credential contains attributes based on this credential definition which in turn is based on this credential schema. Step 4: Provide proof of credentials. In your browser, select the ‚ÄúProvide proof‚Äù button. Note: for this step, you might use your imagination to pretend as if you had first browsed to some other website that requires proof of credentials. The demo is set up with Identity.UW playing the role of both issuer and verifier of the credential. Normally, the issuer, holder (you and your wallet), and verifier of the credential would be different parties. Wait a sec‚Ä¶ In Connect.Me, tap ‚ÄúShare Attributes‚Äù to respond to the proof request from the UW. In your browser, select the ‚ÄúClaim Prize‚Äù button. If you attended the 2019 Student TechExpo (yes, IRL, when campus was open) and you tapped your Husky Card at the table hosted by UW-IT Identity & Access Management, your credential will include an ‚Äúoffereditem‚Äù attribute that makes you eligible for a prize (üéä). For others the ‚Äúoffereditem‚Äù attribute is none, and you‚Äôll receive only our gratitude and congratulations. Congratulations! You‚Äôve completed the Self Sovereign Identity demo!
