Since its foundation it has performed in numerous concerts including prestigious Festivals in Italy and abroad. In 1998 the quartet won first prize at the International Chamber Music Competition “Gaetano Zinetti” at Sanguinetto (VR). They have performed at the “Encontre Internationale des Enseignements Artistiques,” with the Orchestra Giovanile Italiana ad Aosta; at the “Ater Festival” in Rimini; the “Elba Isola Musicale d’Europa” Festival, the “Lingotto Musica” in Turin, the “Festival di Ravello”, “Musica Insieme” in Bologna and at the Bologna Festival, “Amici della Musica” in Florence, “Amici della Musica” in Perugia, the “Accademia Filarmonica Romana” in Rome, the “Serate Musicali di Milano”, the “Festival Mozart” in Rovereto. The quartet has also played a leading part in numerous live television and radio performances for RAI (Radio Televisione Italiana). In these years of intense activity, the quartet has benefited from the advice and support of artists such as Carlo Maria Giulini, Natalia Gutman and Maurizio Pollini; the latter invited Quartetto Klimt to perform during the award ceremony of “Una vita nella Musica” in 1999 in Venice, and in 2001 gave them the scholarship “Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli”. In April 2001 the quartet inaugurated the first edition of “I Concerti del Quirinale” in Rome; in July 2001 the Klimt Quartet was invited to the prestigious “Oleg Kagan Musikfest di Kreuth” (Germany) and the “Festival of Santander” (Spain). In 2010 the prestigious magazine Amadeus published their recording of the two quartets for piano and strings by Robert Schumann performed by the Klimt Quartet and was later invited by RAI to perform these pieces live for Euroradio for the bicentenary of Schumann’s birth. In recognition of Klimt’s unfailing, passionate commitment to the promotion and diffusion of contemporary music, various composers, such as A.Solbiati, F.Antonioni, M.D’Amico and I. Vandor have dedicated compositions to the Quartet.
