The original peoples of New Mexico - Pueblo, Navajo, and Apache since time immemorial, have deep connections to the land and have made significant contributions to the broader community statewide. We honor the land itself and those who remain stewards of this land throughout the generations and also acknowledge our committed relationship to Indigenous peoples. We gratefully recognize our history. Developed by the Special Assistant for American Indian Affairs to the UNM President in consultation with the Native American Faculty Council.
