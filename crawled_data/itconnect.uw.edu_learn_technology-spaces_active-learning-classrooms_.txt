Contact UW-IT About UW-IT Active Learning Classrooms Note: Many on-campus study spaces are currently closed due to COVID-19. For information about the status of spaces, check with departmental websites or contact the building’s facilities staff. Academic Technologies operates and maintains five Active Learning Classrooms on the UW Seattle campus. These rooms are equipped with a range of technology options from a basic flexible learning space with relatively low technology offerings, to fully equipped rooms enabling students to share multimedia and collaborate in groups or the class as a whole. University Libraries has compiled a list of resources on active learning which can be explored at the links below. Active Learning Resources Research Guide: Using Active Learning Classrooms Rooms Odegaard Undergraduate Library (OUG) Odegaard features two active learning classrooms, located on the main floor of the library. Both rooms support student devices being displayed at every table, and all content from any source can be shared with any other destination in the room. Instructors also have a station from which they can display content of their own and can control the content being displayed at each student table. Additionally, each student table has access to a writable surface and dry-erase markers. The active learning classrooms in Odegaard feature the highest level of presentation and collaboration technology available out of all the active learning classrooms. University Libraries has additional information about these rooms here.
