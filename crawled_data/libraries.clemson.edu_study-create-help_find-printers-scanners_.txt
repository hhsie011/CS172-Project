Your print item will be available by the 4th floor Cooper exit for 24 hours after notification of print job completion. Scanning We offer large-format Zeta scanners that can digitize up to 19x14" materials on the 4th floor of Cooper and at the Gunnin Architecture Library. These machines offer a multilingual user menu that streamlines the scanning process. Scans can either be sent to e-mail or saved to USB as images or PDFs. All machines are marked on our floor maps by a black "S." Looking for a traditional flatbed scanner? Stop into the Education Media Center! They also have a copier that can quickly copy double-sided loose-leaf documents, pages of books, and more. Faxing is not available through the Libraries, but you can visit the on-campus post office to send off a signed document.
