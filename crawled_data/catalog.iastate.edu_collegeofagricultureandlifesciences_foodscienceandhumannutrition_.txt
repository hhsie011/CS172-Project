All curricula offered by the department are available to students in either college. These majors include: Culinary food science Dietetics Diet and exercise Food science Nutritional science Nursing Visit the department web site at: www.fshn.hs.iastate.edu. Undergraduate Study Culinary Food Science Culinary food science is an interdisciplinary degree combining a strong food science foundation with acquisition of culinary skills. The program includes chemistry, organic chemistry, biology, microbiology, and biochemistry as well as quantity food production, fine dining management, and food safety and sanitation. Internship experience in the food industry or culinary business is required. Culinary food science graduates are qualified to work as managers and specialists in food research, product development, culinary applications, and food marketing and sales. For more information: https://fshn.hs.iastate.edu/find-your-major/culinary-food-science/ Dietetics The Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics, the accrediting agency of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. The dietetics undergraduate curriculum meets the academic requirements as the DPD. Additionally, the curriculum for concurrent Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in diet and exercise meets the academic requirements of the DPD. Graduates of the program are eligible to apply for admission to accredited dietetics internships/supervised practice programs. Upon successful completion of the experience program, graduates are eligible to take the national examination administered by the Commission on Dietetic Registration to become a Registered Dietitian (RD) / Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN) and to practice in the field of dietetics. There is a $30 fee for a statement of verification of completion of the DPD. For information about verification statements policies, see the dietetics program website: https://fshn.hs.iastate.edu/find-your-major/dietetics/. The dietetics program includes study in basic sciences, nutrition, and food science with applications to medical dietetics, nutrition counseling and education, and community nutrition. Foodservice management is also an important aspect of the program. Graduates work in clinical settings, consulting, food companies, food services, sports or athletic programs, corporate wellness programs, care facilities for patients from neonatal to geriatric, and community or school health programs. Diet and Exercise A program for concurrent Bachelor of Science and Master of Science (BS/MS) degrees in diet and exercise is available. The program is jointly administered by the Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition (FS HN), within the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and College of Human Sciences, and the Department of Kinesiology within the College of Human Sciences. Students interested in this program enroll as pre-diet and exercise students. In the fall of the third year, students apply for admission to the BS/MS program. Students not accepted into the program can continue toward completion of the BS degree in dietetics or kinesiology and health. Coursework has been designed to facilitate a 4-year graduation date for those students not accepted into the program and electing to complete a single undergraduate degree. Students accepted into the program will progress toward completion of BS/MS degrees in diet and exercise. Food Science Food science is a discipline in which the principles of biological and physical sciences are used to study the nature of foods, the causes of their deterioration, and the principles underlying the processing and preparation of food. It is the application of science and technology to the provision of a safe, wholesome, and nutritious food supply. Biotechnology and toxicology interrelate with food science in the area of food safety. In the food industry, food scientists work in research and development of products or processes, production supervision, quality control, marketing and sales, test kitchens and recipe development, product promotion and communication. Food scientists also work in government regulatory agencies and academic institutions. The food science major is approved by the Institute of Food Technologists, the national professional organization of food science. Career options include quality control/assurance; production supervision; management and sales; research careers in the food industry, government, or academia; business; journalism; food product formulation and recipe development; food promotion and communication; and consumer services in government and industry. For more information: https://fshn.hs.iastate.edu/find-your-major/food-science/ Students in food science have the opportunity to pursue a Master of Business Administration (MBA) concurrently with the Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in food science. The program is designed so students can earn both the BS in food science and MBA in five years, to meet the needs of students who are interested in management careers in the food industry. Students apply for admission to the MBA program in the spring of the third year. The program for concurrent BS in food science/MBA degrees is a rigorous 5-year program, and admission is very selective. Nutritional Science Nutritional science looks at the connection between diet and health. Students learn how diet can play a crucial role in the cause, treatment, and prevention of many diseases. There are degree program options within nutritional science. The pre-health professional and research option coursework prepares students for work in research laboratories, graduate study in nutrition or biological sciences, or entrance into health professional programs, such as medical, dental, physician assistant, and pharmacy schools. Students gain a strong science education along with human nutrition expertise. Additional options in health coach and nutrition and wellness prepare students for work positions in program planning and evaluation for community, public health, non-profit, and corporate wellness programs addressing the growing public interest in nutrition, wellness, and preventative health. Students learn about the role of nutrition and healthy eating for disease prevention and wellness. For more information: https://fshn.hs.iastate.edu/find-your-major/nutritional-science/ Nursing The Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) program at Iowa State University is a RN-to-BSN program, designed for those who are already a Registered Nurse (RN), and desire to further their nursing career and education to the next level. Iowa State’s RN-to-BSN program provides interactive learning opportunities where students can apply their real-world experiences and education to inspire innovation in their places of care. RN-to-BSN students will be challenged to enhance health promotion and disease prevention, apply nursing science and evidenced-based patient-centered care, focus on the culture of health for nurses, individuals, and communities, and demonstrate the continuum of care, from a nurse’s self-care to patient care to community and population health.
