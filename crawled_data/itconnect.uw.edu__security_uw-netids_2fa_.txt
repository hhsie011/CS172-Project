Contact UW-IT About UW-IT Two-factor authentication (2FA) New required use of 2FA on the web — To better protect personal and institutional data, the UW has expanded two-factor authentication (2FA) to include all resources that rely on a web browser for single sign-on (SSO) with UW NetID. As of June 15 2022, all faculty will be required to use 2FA on the web. Students are encouraged to opt in to 2FA on the web now. What is 2FA? 2FA adds a layer of security when you sign in with your UW NetID. With 2FA, first you enter your password, then use a 2FA device to prove it’s really you. When do I sign in with 2FA? You must sign in with 2FA to access systems such as Workday or Hyak that require 2FA, or when you or an organization you belong to has opted in to 2FA on the web. Why do I need 2FA? 2FA prevents others from signing in as you, even if they know your password. It protects you and the UW from the risks of phishing scams and other forms of passwords theft. Getting started Manage your device(s) If you’re ready to enroll a device, use this button: Manage 2FA Devices & Settings Choose a device to use If you’re choosing a device to use, this information is for you: Set up a smartphone or tablet – recommended Set up a mobile phone or landline Set up a security key Request a hardware token We recommend using Duo Mobile on your smartphone because it’s free, secure, and simple to use. Duo Mobile creates no data on your device. The following table describes types of 2FA devices and their options for signing in. Device type Sign-in options Notes Smartphone or Tablet (Recommended) Supported platforms: iOS Android “Send Me a Push” – Duo Push notification “Enter a Passcode” – from Duo Mobile “Call Me” – Phone call Duo Mobile is free to download Duo Push notifications need an internet connection (Wi-Fi or cellular data) Passcodes can be generated by Duo Mobile without an internet connection “Call Me” option only works with phone numbers in the US and parts of Canada Mobile Phone or Landline Supported platforms: Any mobile phone Any landline phone “Call Me” – Phone call “Call Me” option only works with phone numbers in the US and parts of Canada Hardware Token Supported platforms: Hardware token provided by UW-IT Other compatible hardware token “Enter a Passcode” One-button device that generates a one-time passcode Learn more about hardware tokens Sign in with 2FA Once you set up a device, you’ll be ready to sign in with 2FA. Sign-in options depend on your choice of device (above). They include: “Send Me a Push” – Duo sends a notification to Duo Mobile on your smartphone or tablet. You then tap “Approve” to sign in. An internet connection (Wi-Fi or cellular data) is required to receive push notifications. “Enter a Passcode” – Open Duo Mobile on your smartphone or tablet to generate a passcode, with or without an internet connection. Or, if you have a hardware token, use the passcode from it. “Call Me” – Duo calls your smartphone, mobile phone, or landline. Answer the call and follow the instructions to approve. This option only works with phone numbers in the US and parts of Canada. To learn more about the steps, review how to sign in with 2FA.
