Our faculty and students embrace the ideology that we simply cannot solve the world's greatest sustainability crises without accepting people and the environment as two, intrinsically linked components of the same Earth system. To be effective in our efforts to protect biodiversity and enhance ecosystem sustainability, we foster and embody critical thinking across disciplinary boundaries, with technology and innovation at the forefront of every journey. We have a dynamic team of faculty, staff, and students dedicated to ensuring that "humans and nature exist in productive harmony" (NEPA, 1969), and this guiding principle is represented by a wide array of disciplines from archaeology, to mathematical ecology, to climate change, and fisheries science.
