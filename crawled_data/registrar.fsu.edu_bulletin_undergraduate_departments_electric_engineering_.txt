The active sponsored research activities of the faculty ensure the program curricula remain contemporary and motivate the need for life-long learning. Technical Electives Technical electives provide the student an opportunity to achieve a greater breadth of knowledge and some degree of specialization in selected areas of special interest. Electives are offered in both electrical engineering and computer engineering application areas. Electives are offered in the following electrical and computer engineering application areas: Microelectronics deals with all aspects of solid-state electronic devices, the analysis and design of analog and digital circuits, their implementation and fabrication using microelectronic techniques, and their application in a wide variety of systems Digital signal processing and control systems concentrate on the design and analysis of systems in which discrete and continuous signals are used for conveying information and controlling physical systems and processes. Included are the encoding, decoding, and representation of information in both the time and frequency domain. Communications is concerned with the preparation, transmission, and reception of encoded information via media ranging from wires to fiber optic cables and space. Included are topics such as AM, FM, and pulse modulation techniques; telecommunication systems; satellite telemetry; and wireless and computer networks. Electromagnetics in the broadest sense is the study of the relationship between electric current, electric and magnetic fields, and their interactions. It is the foundation of electrical and electronic technology. The practical applications of this theory include the design of antennas, transmission lines, RF, microwave and optical transmission facilities, and radar. Power systems engineering is concerned with the design and operation of electric power generation, transmission, and distribution for an increasing customer demand. It involves the modeling, analysis, and design of power system components including power transformers, electric motors, synchronous generators, and high voltage power transmission and distribution networks. Power system engineering also includes the investigation of alternative methods for generating electrical energy, the control and reliability of complex power networks, power quality, economic factors, and environmental effects. Electives are offered in following computer engineering application areas: Digital hardware design includes the design of specialized hardware that comprise digital systems, such as those required for facial recognition, microprocessor design, or digital communication. Embedded computer system design focuses on the design of resource-limited (e.g., price, power dissipation, memory or storage) microprocessor-based systems which do not have the typical components of a computer like keyboard, monitor, or mouse. Cybersecurity is concerned with the protection of information — stored and processed by computer-based systems — that is vulnerable to unintended exposure and misuse. Cyber-physical systems security concentrates on the secure design and analysis of systems in which independently interacting information, communication, and control components operate on different spatial and temporal scales. Examples include smart grid, autonomous automobile systems, medical monitoring, and industrial control systems. Computer Networks includes the design and implementation of networks that allow the communication between computers and other digital systems including topics such as Internet of Things (IoT), Ad Hoc networks, smart grid communications, security, wireless sensor networks (WSN), and cyber physical systems. Digital signal and image processing concerns the design and implementation of systems that are used to extract information found in noisy signals and measurements of many dimensions, and their use in enhancement (filtering), synthesis (computer generated audio and video) and analysis (computer recognition). Honors in the Major The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering offers a program of honors in electrical engineering to encourage talented students to extend their undergraduate experience by participating in directed or independent research on a topic relative to electrical engineering that is not included in the regular curriculum.
