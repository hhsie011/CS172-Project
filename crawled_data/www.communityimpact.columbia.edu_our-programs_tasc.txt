Achieving a TASC diploma carries the same weight as a High School Diploma, and makes you eligible to apply to and enroll in college as well as significantly expanding your career options and income. The TASC exam covers five core subjects: Reading, Writing, Math, Science and Social Studies. Morning classes run from 10:30-1:30 PM and evening classes from 6-8:30 PM, so they are easy to fit in your schedule. We run our program year-round in three terms: Fall, Spring and Summer. For more information about our TASC program please visit our JEEP Student Freeway website. Enrollment in TASC classes entitles students to the services offered by College Road and Job Road. 105 Earl Hall, 2980 Broadway, New York, NY 10027 212-854-1492 | [email protected] Our Services Adult Programs Current Adult Learners & Teachers ESOL High School Equivalency (TASC) CUNY Assessment Test Preparation College Road Job Road CAFE Prep Student Pre-Registration Form Volunteer Registration Form Youth Programs Emergency Services Health Student Executive Board Our Supporters Support Community Impact Giving Tuesday CI Endowment Campaign Community Impact Alumni Organization (CIAO) Sharing Our Stories Benefit About Us Mission History Leadership Our Impact News & Events Contact Our Opportunities Work Study Job Opportunities Van Amson Service Fellowship Volunteering Donate Follow us Facebook Twitter Copyright Â© Copyright Community Impact at Columbia University Site by Site by Bureau for Good
