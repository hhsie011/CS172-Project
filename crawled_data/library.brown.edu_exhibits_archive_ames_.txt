The Robert S. and Margaret A. Ames Collection of Illustrated Books The Robert S. and Margaret A. Ames Collection was assembled over a thirty year period and built around three distinct but related ideas; the history of illustration, particularly nineteenth century books illustrated with woodcuts, wood or steel engravings or by lithography; the literature of travel and exploration, with a preference given to the North American continent; and pictorial representations ofareas in which the Ames family lived before their arrival in Providence in 1970. This exhibit is confined to that portion of the Ames Collection pertaining to westward expansion across North America.
