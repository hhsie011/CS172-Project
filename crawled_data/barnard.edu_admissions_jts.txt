Barnard/JTS Double Degree Application Process Beginning August 1, 2018, all students applying to the Double Degree Program must submit ONLY the List College (JTS) Common Application and Writing Supplement. Applicants must select the Double Degree Program at Barnard College to be considered. All supplementary documents should be submitted to the List College Admissions Office. Students should not complete the Common Application for Barnard College. Once complete, all applications and supplementary documents will be shared with the Barnard Admissions Office and applicants will be reviewed jointly by both Barnard and List College. For more information, please visit the List College website. If you have questions, please contact Christina Lopez, Dean of Admissions, at clopez@barnard.edu. Students cannot apply separately to the Double Degree Program and Barnard. They must make the decision before the application deadline to apply to the Double Degree Program, or just to Barnard. If admitted to the Double Degree Program, it is the expectation that students will complete requirements for both the BA in liberal arts at Barnard College and the BA in Jewish Studies at JTS. Once enrolled, transfer out of the program will only be considered after two semesters of study at both institutions have been completed, and only for compelling, documentable reasons. Students would write an appeal to the Academic Deans from each institution. The Double Degree appeals committee, made up of Deans and administrative staff from both institutions, will meet to review the request and render a decision.
