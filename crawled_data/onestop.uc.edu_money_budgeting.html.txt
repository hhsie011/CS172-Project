"A budget is telling your money where to go instead of wondering where it went." (Dave Ramsey) > Budgeting Tips Build your budget on your take-home pay, not on what you make before taxes. Factor in all of your expenses, even the little ones, like that vanilla latte every morning. Prioritize to see where you can make cuts. Keep track of your expenses to make sure you are actually sticking to your budget. Live within your means. Don't forget to show your Bearcat Card wherever you go! Many retailers, restaurants, attractions and establishments offer student discounts. GradReady can help you create a budget and develop the skills to be in the financial driver's seat when you graduate. Don't graduate with a poor credit score and a mountain of debt.
