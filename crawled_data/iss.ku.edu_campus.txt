Positions include teaching assistantships, research assistantships, and student hourly employment (KU Dining Services, Library, etc). Note: International Students are not eligible for Student Work Study positions. Eligibility J-1 students may engage in employment if: Student is in good academic standing Student continues to engage in a full course of study while school is in session The ISS advisor or designated program sponsor has approved the specific employment in advance and in writing. Hours Allowed J-1 students are eligible to work on campus a maximum of 20 hours per week during the Fall and Spring academic semesters. During breaks and official school vacation periods, J-1 students are eligible to work more than 20 hours per week on campus. A student who has a valid DS-2019 and intends to enroll for the next regular term may work on-campus. Please note that on-campus employment is not permitted after completion of a degree or program unless the student has been issued a DS-2019 to begin a new academic program or has been granted Academic Training. Process Once an on campus job is obtained, the student (with a DS-2019 issued by KU) should go to iHawk and complete an On-Campus Work Permit Request (J-1), under J-1 Student Services. An email will be sent by the ISS office to the student once the employment authorization form is ready to be picked up. Students with a DS-2019 issued by a program sponsor other than KU (i.e. IIE, LASPAU, Department of State) need to contact their program sponsor for the work permit.
