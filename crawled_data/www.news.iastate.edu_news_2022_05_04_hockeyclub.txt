Based on the serious nature of the allegations, the university has issued an interim suspension of all men’s team activities, effective immediately. This includes team meetings, practice, competition, recruiting and other events. The university’s investigation will focus on team hazing as well as the club’s finances, organizational structure and oversight by Recreation Services. Cyclone Hockey is a club sport, not associated with ISU Athletics, with three men’s teams. Once the investigation is complete, the university will work with team members on a plan to restructure the club to align with other sport clubs under Recreation Services. The investigation of Cyclone Hockey is separate and unrelated to the university’s ongoing health and safety review of all sport clubs and proposed recommendations for a sport club policy.
