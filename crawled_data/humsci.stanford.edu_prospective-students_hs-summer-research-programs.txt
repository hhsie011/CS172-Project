These programs expose you to faculty and graduate students who can mentor and assist you in applying to graduate school. Program benefits: Undergraduates work for eight weeks under a faculty research mentor. Through this collaboration, students gain theoretical knowledge and practical training in academic research and scientific experimentation. Students receive assistance with navigating the graduate application process and have access to a comprehensive GRE preparation course. Students are required to prepare a written report, abstract, and presentation at the end of their summer research and complete a program evaluation. Participants receive round-trip travel, room and board, and a stipend.
