Introduction 1.1. Purpose 1.1.1 The purpose of this regulation is to provide a plan for East Carolina University to protect the health and safety of its laboratory users through compliance with applicable local, state and federal regulations. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) promulgated 29 CFR 1910.1450, Occupational Exposure to Hazardous Chemicals in Laboratories, on January 31, 1990 to provide guidelines for the safe use of chemicals in laboratories (OSHA 29 CFR 1910.1450, https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.1450) 1.2. Application 1.2.1 This standard* applies in locations where "laboratory use of hazardous chemicals occurs. Laboratory use of hazardous chemicals means handling or use of chemicals in which all of the following conditions are met: 1.2.1.1 Handling or use of chemicals occurs on a "laboratory scale" (work involves containers which can easily and safely be manipulated by one person); 1.2.1.2 Multiple chemicals or chemical procedures are used; 1.2.1.3 Procedures are not part of a production process or process simulation; 1.2.1.4 Protective laboratory practices and equipment are available and in common use to minimize the potential for employee exposures to hazardous chemicals. *Note: This standard does not apply where the use of hazardous chemicals provides no potential for employee exposure, such as in procedures using chemically impregnated test media and commercially prepared test kits 1.2.2. The Chemical Hygiene Plan (CHP) is intended to provide the necessary framework for compliance with the OSHA Lab Standard. 1.2.3. While non-paid laboratory users and students are not covered by this plan, University policy requires supervisors to share its content and promote compliance with the standard operating procedures. 2 Responsibilities 2.1.
