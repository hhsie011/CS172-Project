The fund will expand Tulane Athletics’ career development initiative to its 350-plus student-athletes by providing for a full-time staff member to support the postgraduate aspirations of Green Wave student-athletes. Michael (A&S ’73, B ’75) and Valerie McKeever have given a $1.4 million gift to Tulane Athletics. “The significance of this gift cannot be overstated. It empowers our commitment to career development into perpetuity, ensuring that our student-athletes are as prepared for success after graduation as they are during their playing careers,” Director of Athletics Troy Dannen said. In addition, a multipurpose classroom within the Don and Lora Peters Academic Center will carry the McKeever family name, to be used for instruction, committee meetings, presentations and career development programming. Michael McKeever (A&S ’73, B ’75) studied economics while competing on the men’s swimming and diving team. Since then, McKeever has had a successful career in finance including leadership roles at Lehman Brothers and Legacy Venture Partners, LLC. Valerie McKeever also specialized in finance during her 10-year investment banking career at Kidder, Peabody. The McKeevers and their three children live in Greenwich, Connecticut. The McKeever family’s seven-figure gift is the third contribution of its size to Tulane Athletics this year as part of the Only the Audacious campaign.
