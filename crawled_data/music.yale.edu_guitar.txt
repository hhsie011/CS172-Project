The weekly guitar seminar includes performances of newly learned solo and chamber music, as well as lectures on such topics as interpretation, arranging, technique, pedagogy, master-class teaching, programming, performing, sight reading, competitions, recording, and career development. Each semester, students work in a duo or chamber music group and perform their chamber music piece in concert. Repertoire is decided by the students and Prof. Benjamin Verdery. Each year, students are required to write an étude and an arrangement, and to present a lecture. Each semester features a master class with a guest artist. Before graduating, all guitar students must perform a 20-minute outreach concert in the New Haven Public Schools. faculty spotlight Associate Professor Adjunct of Guitar Benjamin Verdery Hailed for his innovative career, faculty guitarist Benjamin Verdery tours regularly and has released over 15 albums.
