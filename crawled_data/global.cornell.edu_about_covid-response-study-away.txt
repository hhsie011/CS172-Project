In October 2020, the Office of Global Learning hosted a virtual fall gathering for Study Away students and international students studying remotely. Local Cornell Learning Communities Abroad During the 2020–21 academic year, some international students could not return to campus due to ongoing travel restrictions and visa processing delays caused by the global pandemic. Cornell University rapidly worked with academic partners worldwide to support these students by creating onsite, in-residence Study Away options. These international students lived and studied at or near a local campus in their home country while remotely taking Cornell classes and one on-campus class. Students shared co-curricular activities with Cornell peers and had access to local facilities and services, providing a local Cornell community away from Ithaca. A total of 749 international students during two semesters learned at 10 Study Away locations around the world.
