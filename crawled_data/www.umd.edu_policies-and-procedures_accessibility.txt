Maryland is a wonderful and diverse community. Diversity is one of our core values and our campus is strengthened and enriched by people with disabilities. Accessibility is an approach to communication and engagement that recognizes the intersectional identities, experiences, and needs of our entire campus community. It goes beyond legal accommodations for students, staff and faculty with disabilities. We work towards making this a community where we each can bring our whole self to campus, where we each have the opportunity to thrive. We do this in three main ways: by working towards building a strong community of people with disabilities on our campus by interrupting structural, attitudinal and institutional barriers that hinder equal access to university-sponsored programs and activities by being a community that values all persons with disabilities as integral members of our campus community This website is designed to connect people with services and information related to all aspects of accessibility. If you are experiencing difficulty accessing a university website, or content located on a university website (video, document, etc.), please contact itaccessibility@umd.edu. The ADA/504 coordinator's office guides the university's efforts to move beyond compliance and toward seamless access. As the university's focal point for disability-related initiatives, the ADA/504 coordinator's office collaborates with university offices, government agencies and advocacy groups to inform decision-making and ensure university compliance with state and federal mandates. The office addresses accessibility issues and reports of disability-based discrimination on campus.
