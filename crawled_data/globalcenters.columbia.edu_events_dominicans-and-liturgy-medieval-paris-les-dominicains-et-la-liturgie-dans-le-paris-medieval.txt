5:30 PM 4, rue de Chevreuse, 75006 Paris Event cosponsored by the Institute for Ideas and Imagination After arriving in Paris in the early 13th century, Dominican friars became embedded in Parisian intellectual, cultural, and religious life. At the Priory of Saint-Jacques, in the midst of their study and prayer, the Dominicans were at the forefront of Parisian developments in theology, liturgy, and manuscript production. In this international conference, scholars from several disciplines will consider the development of Dominican liturgical practice in medieval Paris, exploring the Dominican liturgy, its manuscripts, and its connections to theology, architecture, book history, and related areas.
