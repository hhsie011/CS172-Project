Federal Regulations – Cash Management Enroll in a Payment Plan NC State University allows all students to pay education expenses monthly – interest-free – through our partner, Nelnet Campus Commerce. The monthly payment plan allows students to spread the cost for a fall or spring term for a fee of $50 per semester. Payment plans are not available for summer terms. Payment plans must be in place prior to the tuition due date. Enrollment Dates and How to Enroll Enrollment for the Fall 2022 semester will open on May 1. Initial payments for the Fall 2022 semester will be due June 1, 2022. Students may sign up as late as September 7, 2022 for the Fall 2022 semester. Students can only be enrolled in one payment plan each semester. If multiple plans are needed, please contact student_accounts@ncsu.edu. Follow these steps to enroll: If you have any existing balance due to the University, pay that balance in full before enrolling in a payment plan for a subsequent semester. If a parent/other person is signing up for the plan on behalf of the student, Parent & Guardian Access must first be set up by the student through the MyPack Portal – https://studentservices.ncsu.edu/your-resources/privacy/parent-access/. Only the parent who opens the payment plan will be able to make changes and payments to the plan. Determine your estimated cost of attendance for the school year using the Estimated Cost of Attendance website. Estimate the tuition, room and board based on the student residence classification and number of hours enrolled. Reduce that amount by any financial aid the student will receive, and/or the amount that will be paid by the student directly. Sign up for the plan through the MyPack Portal. On the Student Accounts tile, select View/Sign up for Payment Plan, then click the Sign Up/View button. This will open a new window (be sure your popup blocker is turned off). Select the payment plan and click the sign up button. Set your budgeted balance on the next page. This can be an estimate if needed. You will be able to adjust your plan amount after you sign up to align with actual costs. As you set up your plan, you can select to pay by eCHECK or credit card. Payments using a credit card will be assessed a 2.85% fee. Once your payment method has been entered, you will have a payment profile that will be used for all remaining payments. You can change this payment method if needed. Your payment plan details will post to your student account once your plan is successfully set up. If a payment is due upon signing up, it will also post immediately to your student account. Subsequent payments will be posted the night after they are paid. Your payment plan amount will not be automatically adjusted if your costs change – it is your responsibility to adjust your payment plan if your charges change due to adding or dropping hours, withdrawals, meal plan change, etc. For technical assistance with your payment plan, please call 888-470-6014.
