Sachs, Director of The Earth Institute, Quetelet Professor of Sustainable Development, and Professor of Health Policy and Management at Columbia University. The Istanbul Center helped to coordinate efforts to set up the Turkey chapter of the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network, which brings together universities, the private sector, civil society, and government to advance the sustainable development agenda in Turkey. The Center’s efforts have particularly been focused on the topic of sustainable urbanization, a core challenge that confronts Istanbul as well as cities across the country and the wider region.
