Welcome to the Film Program The Film Studies Program at Barnard was formally established in 2002 as a major designed for students interested in the history, theory and practice of film and filmmaking. The educational goal of the film major is to provide a solid grounding in the history and theory of film and as well as place the study of film in relation to other art forms. Students are introduced to visual storytelling, film technology, and the economic and sociopolitical context of the film industry. While the course of study is rooted in film history and theory, all majors take workshops in screenwriting and filmmaking and produce a script and a short film. Our place in a premier college for women invites our Program to pay special attention to questions of gender, and our home in New York City allows students to connect their study to the city’s vibrant film industry as well as a range of film in art houses and revival theaters. For updates on jobs, internships, and contest or festival submissions for film majors, please sign up for our newsletter by emailing Rio Santisteban or english@barnard.edu.
