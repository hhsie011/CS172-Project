If you or someone you know is experiencing distress, therapy with a Marriage and Family Therapist (MFT) can help. MFTs are trained in systemic, or relational, therapy and believe that throughout life we exist in a number of relationships that directly and indirectly impact our well-being. Our relationships with family, friends, co-workers and neighbors influence and create our individual experience. Research and theory have shown that mental illness and family problems are best treated in the context of relationships. If you have any trouble finding information, feel free to reach out to us.
