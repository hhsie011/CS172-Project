Close Search / Sean Latham Sean Latham Oklahoma Center for the Humanities awarded major grant April 19, 2022 The Oklahoma Center for the Humanities (OCH) has received a grant of $100,000 from the Social Science Research Council and the National Endowment for the Humanities through the Sustaining Humanities Infrastructure Program (SHIP). These awards support colleges, universities and nonprofit humanities research or educational organizations to restore, sustain and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing them to bolster under-supported humanities programming with a focus on diversity, equity and inclusion. Henry Zarrow Center for Art & Education One of 21 grantees from the across the country, the OCH will use the funds to support a project titled Pathways to Freedom: Re-energizing the Public Humanities in Tulsa. The main thrust of this endeavor will be the reactivation of The University of Tulsa’s Henry Zarrow Center for Art & Education as a key site for bringing the distinctive tools of the humanities to bear on urgent community challenges. “This generous funding provides the OCH an exciting opportunity to fully activate the Zarrow Center in Tulsa’s Arts District as an active cultural hub for both the university and the region as whole,” said OCH Director Sean Latham. “We’ll work with diverse community partners to fill the space with exhibitions, lectures and performances all designed to explore the complex idea of freedom as a fundamental part of our legacy, identity and future.” In concert with the OCH’s 2022-23 theme “Freedom,” the Zarrow’s SHIP-supported reactivation will focus on three topics: The history and future of tribal sovereignty in Oklahoma The state’s historic all-Black towns The musical legacy of the Dust Bowl SHIP funds will also enable the hiring of a post-doctoral assistant director, an emerging scholar who will gain mentoring and practical management experience in the public humanities. Craving a space for collaboration, research synthesis, deep thinking and community engagement? At the Oklahoma Center for the Humanities, we’re eager to welcome you to our vibrant community.

It is intended to honor achievements that have been validated in the scholar’s professional field. The 2020 recipients are: Joanne Davis, Professor of Psychology: Professor Davis’ research is broadly concerned with trauma and its consequences. Particular focus of this work is on the development of sleep disorders following traumatic events, and the exploration of the effects of interpersonal violence. Notably, Joanne translates her research to make the findings useable for the broad, nonacademic community, providing seminars for organizations such as the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and NGOs in Tulsa including Family and Children’s Services and Domestic Violence Intervention Services. Robert Spoo, Chapman Distinguished Professor of Law: Professor Spoo conducts his interdisciplinary work at the intersection of copyright law, theories of the public domain, informal norms, publishing, modern authorship and law and literature. Robert combines these distinct disciplines in scholarship that is grounded in literary and legal history and nourished by his diverse roles as literature professor, law professor, attorney and journal editor. Sean Latham, Professor of English: Professor Latham’s scholarly activities focus on modern literature and culture and have drawn inspiration from the likes of James Joyce and Bob Dylan. His work intertwines with a broad interest in the cultural context of modernist aesthetics and the meanings and uses of formal innovation in 20th century literature. Since 2001, Sean has been the editor of The James Joyce Quarterly, the pre-eminent journal of Joycean studies in the world, and he also serves as the director of the Oklahoma Center for the Humanities. Candidates for the Outstanding Researcher Awards were nominated by deans from Kendall College of Arts & Sciences, Collins College of Business, Oxley College of Health Sciences, the College of Engineering & Natural Sciences and the College of Law. Nominees were selected for their recognition of outstanding research and scholarly achievements. Other considerations included pedagogical awards, honors from scholarly societies, grants, publication citation counts or other forms of public recognition. External recognition of a faculty member’s work also factored into the selection process.
