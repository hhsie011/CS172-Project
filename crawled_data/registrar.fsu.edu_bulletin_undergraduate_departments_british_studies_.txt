Pitts (International Programs) The London Study Center Interdisciplinary minor is concerned with the culture of Great Britain from ancient times to the present. The minor is built around the student’s program of studies at the Florida State University London Study Center, allowing the student to study British culture from the perspective of various disciplines and to pursue the minor before, during, and after the student attends the London Center. The minor gives greater focus to and enhances the quality of the student’s program of studies in Britain. The sojourn in London is the essential element in the minor, providing direct involvement in contemporary British civilization as well as exposure to Britain’s historical and cultural artifacts. Requirements for a Minor in London Study Center Interdisciplinary Studies The interdisciplinary minor requires the completion of fifteen semester hours in courses approved by the London Study Center Minor Coordinating Committee. At least nine semester hours of approved courses must be taken while the student is in residence at the London Study Center. A maximum of nine semester hours may be counted in any single academic discipline. A minimum grade of “C–” must be earned for all courses taken for the minor. In addition, a minimum grade point average of 2.0 must be maintained in all courses counted toward the minor. Students who intend to minor in London Study Center Interdisciplinary Studies should declare this intention with International Programs at the end of the semester in London. Contact Sarah Lovins Bacani atslovins@fsu.edu for further information. Core Courses These courses will be counted in the minor whether they are taken on the Tallahassee campus or in London.
