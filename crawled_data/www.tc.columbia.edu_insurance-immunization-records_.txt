Our office is tasked with managing enrollment for the AETNA Student Health Insurance plan and ensuring students are in compliance with New York State laws and Teachers College policies regarding immunizations. Preserving our students' health and wellness is paramount. We are here to help you with your insurance and immunization needs. Student Health Insurance Having health insurance is key to helping ensure predictable health care costs and to support students in the achievement of their personal and academic goals. In an effort to reinforce this aim, Teachers College requires most students to have comprehensive health insurance as part of enrollment in the College. Teachers College offers the Columbia Student Health Insurance Plan, in partnership with Aetna Student Health, to all registered students enrolled in degree-granting programs. Immunization Records All incoming students must provide an official record of their Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) immunity, COVID-19 vaccinations, and meet the Meningitis requirements. These regulations are in accordance with New York State Public Health Law 2165 and Teachers College policy.
