A graduate student’s GPA is calculated entirely on the basis of numeric grades in 400- and 500-level courses. The grades of S, NS, CR, NC, and N are excluded, as are all grades in courses numbered 600, 601, 700, 750, and 800, and in courses at the 100, 200, and 300 levels. Failure to maintain a 3.00 GPA, either cumulative or for a given quarter, constitutes low scholarship and may lead to a change-in-status action by the Graduate School. Failure to maintain satisfactory performance and progress toward a degree may also result in a change-in-status action by the Graduate School. See Graduate School Memorandum 16 for additional information.
