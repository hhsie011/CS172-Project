OSU-OKC Concurrent Enrollment Update In alignment with guidance from the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education in response to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, OSU-OKC will be implementing the following interim guidelines for the remainder of the 2021-2022 Academic Year. Admission and Placement High school Juniors and Seniors, Home Schooled students (having completed coursework equivalent for Junior standing), or students attending an Unaccredited High School (having completed coursework equivalent to Junior standing), who have an unweighted GPA of 3.0 or higher, qualify for admission to concurrent enrollment and meet the Reading proficiency requirement. If a student has an ACT/SAT score that would require alternative testing for placement or if a student has been unable to test (ACT/SAT/ACCUPLACER placement test) due to the cancellation of all national testing opportunities, the following interim guidelines will be used: Reading placement equivalency: High school cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher. English placement equivalency: High school English GPA of 3.0 or higher Math placement equivalency: High school Math GPA of 3.0 or higher Science placement equivalency: High school Science or Math and English GPA of 3.0 or higher Students with ACT/SAT scores that both meet admission requirements and placement requirements, as described here, are not impacted by these interim guidelines. Required Documentation: Students are still responsible for submission of required documentation (Concurrent Approval Form, test scores, and high school transcript). The Concurrent Approval Form does not require original/electronic signatures during these interim guidelines. Please continue to sign where possible, but OSU-OKC can accept emails from students, parents/guardians, and counselors in lieu of signatures. Tuition Waivers: High school Seniors are eligible for up to a total of 18 credit hours beginning with the Summer after Junior year through Spring of Senior year. High school Juniors are eligible for up to a total of 12 credit hours, based on funding from Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education, beginning the Summer after their 10th grade year. Students are still responsible for tuition beyond any waived amount and all fees and textbook costs.
