Penn shines today as one of the top institutions of higher education in the United States, with a clear focus on innovative research that yields actionable knowledge. The Penn Libraries plays an essential role not onIy in producing research but also in making it accessible to the Penn community and beyond. As the information ecosystem becomes more complex and materials become available in a multitude of formats, we aim to increase and streamline access to many of the resources our users need in order to create, disseminate, and preserve knowledge. We will build and support new and innovative models for digital projects, collaborative scholarship, interdisciplinary research, and teaching and learning spaces. We will also invest in and expand on our open data foundation initiatives to expose Penn-created content to a broader audience.
