All current faculty and staff members of the Boston College community are welcome to join the Collaborative. We host monthly lunch meetings during the academic year. We discuss issues of importance to women in the BC community and bring informative and energizing speakers to the meeting for a broad range of topics from health and wellness, careers and retirement planning to women in wine making and notable authors.
