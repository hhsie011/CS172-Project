To be in authentic relationships with people and communities of Latin America, Baylor must broaden and deepen its study of art, language, history, and culture. The culture and arts area of inquiry will capitalize on current and future assets within the humanities, drawing on the expertise of our faculty in the College of Arts and Sciences, School of Music, and other departments, units, and institutes at Baylor. Areas of application within this content area include multicultural understanding, education and appreciation, language acquisition, and culturally competent partnership facilitation. These areas of emphasis are responsive to the current and projected population trends in Texas and the nation at-large that will shape the demographics of both faculty and students of the University in coming years.
