Exit Search Women's History Month — In their own words. Women from across Oregon State University reflect on their accomplishments, the progress they've made, and the work that remains to be done. March 15, 2022 Mary Chuinard | Director for Undergraduate Student Services College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences What does Women’s History Month mean for you? For me, Women’s History Month means a time to reflect on women throughout history who may not have had the opportunities and freedoms in life (and career) that I have. Despite progress, it motivates me to intentionally consider my own privileges and potential barriers I’ve faced from being a woman but didn’t consider at the time when I was merely focused on overcoming and achieving my goals. Why is recognizing Women’s History Month important within Oregon State University? It’s important to recognize and be cognizant of the inequities that sometimes seem to be in the past but are often still present in subtle or overt ways. It can become too easy to be desensitized to something that is constant or subtle. This month hopefully reminds us of these realities and biases so we can try to identify and dismantle them. Can you share the name of a woman — a public figure or a personal mentor — who has inspired you? How so? Honestly, Michelle Obama is a huge inspiration to me. The fact that she is an incredibly intelligent and strong woman who has faced adversity but still achieved her own desires and career, and willingly chose to step out of her career to be a supportive partner and mother while not sacrificing her own ideas, passions and initiatives. She shows me how a woman’s independent pursuits can look different, or take a different path, without sacrificing one’s own essence and goals. What evolution and/or progress have you seen for women in your field, within OSU and in the state of Oregon? What has that meant for your own life and career? I feel lucky that my field already has strong representation of women — equal to or more than men. The advising world is about supporting students and helping them navigate their higher education. Some might associate this with the stereotypical “nurturing” tendency assigned to women, but I see it as an excellent career field for analytical and complex process thinkers who also care about the human receiving the benefit of those skills from someone walking alongside them. Anne-Marie Deitering | Donald and Delpha Campbell Dean of Libraries OSU Libraries Why is recognizing Women’s History Month important within Oregon State University? I believe that it is always important to create space where we can reflect on our experiences — where we came from, how we got here and where we want to go. Women’s History Month provides us with a framework (and maybe a push) to do just that, to think about the amazing women who have made OSU what it is, to give them space to share their stories, to listen and learn from those stories and to think about where we need to go from here. This is especially important for libraries and archives. We are all about stories here — about collecting, preserving and sharing them. It is especially important that we take the time to think about how we do that work. To do this work in an inclusive, respectful and collaborative way requires ongoing attention and focus, and every year Women’s History Month provides that opportunity for reflection. Can you share the name of a woman — a public figure or a personal mentor – who has inspired you? How so? This is a bit of a cliché but I am going to go with my mother, MaryAnn Deitering. Like many of us, the pandemic has really put me in a place to think about my family and how they have affected me — both because of the time we have had to spend apart and because of the energy we now devote to making sure we can spend time together! In the late 70s and early 80s, my mom was doing freelance secretarial work and she ended up typing a scientific manuscript for a person who was really pretty sure that this personal computer thing was going to become something. He wanted to start a business selling computers, and he brought her on board because of her stellar business skills. He was probably a few years too early for his vision — there wasn’t really a big market yet for personal computers, although he was absolutely right that it was coming. There was, however, a big market for computer parts for people who wanted to build their own. And while my mom was setting up the business side of the business, she was also creating a mail-order side that could meet that need. Within a couple of years, she had bought out her partners, and she ran that business as a woman in what was very much a male-dominated field for many years. What I remember most about watching her and her work was not the specifics of the things they sold or the services they provided. Think about how much computers changed from 1981 to 2010. She rode out huge shifts in the market and in her customers’ expectations by always staying one step ahead of that change. It was extremely impressive. But what I remember most was that she never forgot that it was the people she worked with who made her company what it was. They depended on her to keep her company going through some pretty volatile times, and she trusted them to help her do that. What evolution and/or progress have you seen for women in your field, within OSU and in the state of Oregon? What has that meant for your own life and career? This is a particularly interesting question for me, because as I am sure you know, there are a lot of women in my field. Something like 88% of academic librarians are women, and the numbers are not hugely different in other types of libraries. In a lot of ways, I am the “typical” academic librarian. I am a white woman who came to librarianship in my early 30s from another career. In the 20 years I have been working in this field, I have seen a lot of important conversations develop about the practice and culture of librarianship. I think the most important of these, and the one that has the potential to change our field most significantly for the better, is the conversation that grapples with the fact that our field is overwhelmingly white, and most of our efforts to change that have not succeeded, largely because we need to deal much more honestly and deeply with the ways that some of our longstanding values and practices reflect that whiteness. This is a particularly important conversation for us to have here at OSU, a predominantly white institution in a predominantly white state. There’s a banner in the Valley Library on the Corvallis campus that proclaims “Everyone is welcome.” To make sure that we are living up to that goal, we need to be willing to take hard, critical looks at ourselves and our work. I feel really lucky to be working with a group of people willing to do that work. Lisa Flexner | Clinical Assistant Professor Physical Therapy College of Public Health and Human Sciences OSU-Cascades What does Women’s History Month mean for you? My high school history teacher, 30+ years ago, was the first person to teach me to recognize that history is written by those who have or are in power. History is women's history, and yet so little is common knowledge about the amazing women who have come before us, at least in the Western history tradition. And so Women's History Month becomes important in amplifying those voices and stories that were untold for so long. Can you share the name of a woman — a public figure or a personal mentor — who has inspired you? How so? I'm certainly not the first to say this, but my mom inspires me every day. In 1960, she left the South to attend Northwestern University. Her plan was to be a math major, but her first professor informed her that this was a man's degree, and she should seek out other options. While she didn't pursue math — mostly because who would want to work with that kind of professor? — she went on to work for the US State Department, then into the early years of data science. She was working with computers back when they were run by punch cards, set the university-wide curve in her calc class, earned an MBA, and spent a career leading Information Systems and Data Processing teams in Fortune 50 companies. She didn't let the words of a narrow-minded individual keep her from succeeding in the career she loved. What evolution and/or progress have you seen for women in your field, within OSU and in the state of Oregon? What has that meant for your own life and career? I started my career in the tech industry, which is known for being a male-dominated field — and was especially so during the early Internet years of the late 90s and early 2000s. When I changed careers and began my Doctor of Physical Therapy degree, I discovered how different it felt to be part of a profession founded by and led primarily by women. I learned how women can lift each other up and support each other to success in traditionally male spaces. I also learned how systemic biases in favor of male providers continue to set artificial barriers and hierarchies in health care - and that successful leaders of all genders work to break down these gendered hierarchies to improve patient outcomes and care delivery. Kathryn Higley | Distinguished Professor Nuclear Science and Engineering College of Engineering What does Women’s History Month mean for you? It’s an opportunity to reflect on the strengths and successes of women in moving our country forward. Why is recognizing Women’s History Month important within Oregon State University? Because for too long the contributions of women to the success of institutions like OSU haven’t really been acknowledged. Can you share the name of a woman — a public figure or a personal mentor — who has inspired you? How so? There are a number of women in my general field — Marie Curie, Lise Meitner and Elda Anderson — who have pioneered the way for women in science. They’ve made it just a little bit easier for the rest of us. What evolution and/or progress have you seen for women in your field, within OSU and in the state of Oregon? What has that meant for your own life and career? I was very used to being the only woman in a room full of guys. Now, thankfully, that is no longer the case. I was the first woman to receive tenure in my school at OSU. I think I was the fifth woman to be made full professor in the College of Engineering. That is wild — and sad — all at the same time. Rebecca Johnson | Interim President What does Women’s History Month mean for you? It’s a chance to learn about and recognize women who have made a difference in the world, but who mostly went unnoticed. What evolution and/or progress have you seen for women in your field, within OSU and in the state of Oregon? What has that meant for your own life and career? When I came to OSU, there were five women faculty members in the College of Forestry, no women administrators and not many women students. Today there are highly acclaimed women faculty and leaders in the college, and as many women as men students. Opportunities for women to succeed in the profession have grown enormously, and women have stepped up to the challenge. I feel like my career has always been at the front of change for women — one of the few women in forestry, the first woman associate dean in forestry and now the first woman president at OSU. Sometimes you have to buck the trend and just believe you’re as good as anyone else. Erika McCalpine | Executive Director of Strategic Diversity Initiatives OSU-Cascades OSU Faculty Senate President What does Women’s History Month mean for you? Women’s History Month is a time to celebrate the contributions of women (past and present) to this great nation, the state of Oregon and on the campuses and locations of Oregon State University. Women worked behind the scenes for centuries to ensure the success of many things — from supporting soldiers during wartime to supporting organizations through times of tumultuous change. I’m thankful to live in a time where we can lead openly and courageously, while being recognized for our efforts. Why is recognizing Women’s History Month important within Oregon State University? Women are a pivotal part of the success of Oregon State University. We have our first woman interim president in Becky Johnson, I am the first Black woman to lead the Faculty Senate, and many other women hold leadership roles that keep this campus moving forward in a positive direction. Taking the time to honor women encourages young women to pursue their goals and dreams, because representation does matter. Can you share the name of a woman — a public figure or a personal mentor — who has inspired you? How so? While there are many women who have inspired me or mentored me over the years, the one woman that has had the greatest impact is my grandmother, Hannah Cody. As a little girl, I watched her get up early and prepare breakfast for the family before walking to the bus stop in our neighborhood. She would ride the bus downtown to work as an elevator operator for a major department store. She would come home, cook dinner and then do it all over again the next day. She recently told me a story of meeting the wife and child of one of the men who worked in the department store. The child, a little boy, wanted to ride in the elevator, so she took him up to the top floor and brought him back down. She said the little boy hugged her and thanked her for the ride. She recalled that the next time the little boy came into the store to see his father, he stood back and looked at her with fear in his eyes. She said she knew then that the parents of the child had explained that she’s Black. She talked about how that hurt to see the child behave so differently toward her, only because of the color of her skin. Regardless, she showed up to work every day until that department store closed its doors. Today, she watches with pride as I live a life that was so different from the one she led at my age. I’m so thankful she’s here to see change and to know her work ethic then is what shaped the woman I am today. What evolution and/or progress have you seen for women in your field, within OSU and in the state of Oregon? What has that meant for your own life and career? Women in business is much more common, but there is still work to do because the percentage of women leading organizations is still small in the United States. We have our first woman interim president at OSU, and that just happened in 2021. I am hoping that Dr. Johnson isn’t the last woman president that OSU sees. We have a woman governor in the state of Oregon, and women hold many leadership roles. I remember arriving at OSU-Cascades, and I could look to the leadership team and see women in almost every role. Their representation inspired me, and now I am one of those women. As a woman of color, I’m very aware of the glass ceilings I’ve shattered at OSU-Cascades and Oregon State University. While I may be the first woman of color on the leadership team at OSU-Cascades and the first Black woman to lead the Faculty Senate, I hope and pray that other women and people who share my skin tone will understand that the path is clear for them now. It may not be free of the occasional bump in the road, but I want to see others follow and be better than me. I want my own children to look at me and understand that there is no limit to their success with hard work and perseverance. To make progress can be painful and hard, but it is necessary to leave every space I inhabit better than I found it. Ana Ramírez | Instructor Teaching B.S.-CBEE College of Education What does Women’s History Month mean for you? Women’s History Month for me is the opportunity to celebrate all the women who have come before us to pave the way for future generations. They are the women whose shoulders we stand on to be able to do the important equity work today. We celebrate and honor the sacrifices they made to change outcomes for the women of tomorrow. Why is recognizing Women’s History Month important within Oregon State University? Recognizing Women’s History Month is important within Oregon State University because we need to help provide role models for all women, not just those from the dominant culture. All women deserve to see themselves reflected in the role models we provide and share. Can you share the name of a woman — a public figure or a personal mentor — who has inspired you? How so? When I was pursuing my undergraduate degree, I met a woman named Anita Hernandez who hired me to work in her office. Watching her work with other students and supervise other student teachers was truly inspiring. She validated my decision to become an educator. More importantly though, she was the first Latina woman I encountered in higher education. She was an incredible role model for me. What evolution and/or progress have you seen for women in your field, within OSU and in the state of Oregon? What has that meant for your own life and career? I think all progress never happens as quickly as we would like, although we have seen progress in many fields. We currently have a female vice president and a female who is the dean of the College of Education. Both of these roles were traditionally held by men. This progression of finding women in leadership roles helps provide possibilities for more role models to be provided to the younger generation. Seeing women who are in a place where important decisions are made is very powerful, as is the representation of a variety of those role models. Young women need to see people in leadership roles who are from a variety of backgrounds. Sharon Sánchez-Aragón | Instructor ESOL-Dual Language College of Education What does Women’s History Month mean for you? As an older woman, I have seen the changes over the years with respect to women, especially women of color like myself. But the changes are slow, and there is still much work to do. Celebrating Women's History Month means that we celebrate that the struggle continues. We celebrate all the women who gave of their time and talent to get us to this point. We celebrate women like Elen Ochoa, the first Latina to go to space, and Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the first Latina Supreme Court Justice. We also celebrate all the women whose names we will never know. Why is recognizing Women’s History Month important within Oregon State University? Celebrating Women's History Month at Oregon State University is vital to the continued struggle we face. We must keep this at the forefront of every person's mind. Through this celebration, we recognize the women in our university who make a difference in our community every day. We also inspire our students to work hard and be a part of the change that is still needed. Can you share the name of a woman — a public figure or a personal mentor — who has inspired you? How so? I work with Soira Colomer. She is the chair of our Ph.D. program in the Dual Language and ESOL program. She inspires me every day. Her research around Latinx teachers helps us to recognize the work that is still needed in education to support our dual language teachers. We work with our pre-service teachers and provide them with tools we never had when we entered the profession. What evolution and/or progress have you seen for women in your field, within OSU and in the state of Oregon? What has that meant for your own life and career? Although teaching is seen as a profession of mostly women, positions of power in education are most often held by men. I have seen a slow change in this over the years. More women have become principals and superintendents, which gives women more choice and power over how money is spent and how decisions are made in education. And as I stated before, we have a woman chair in our department. We also have a woman dean, Susan Gardner. She is a strong and compassionate leader. I will never become chair of a department nor a dean. I was not able to start college until I was 30 years old, and I am close to retirement age, but I have been inspired to earn a Ph.D. My struggle as a Latina woman has been long, and the struggles have been many, but I have been able to offer many Latina students the support in their education to be able to enter college, and I continue to support Latina pre-service teachers in their quest to become excellent teachers. Who knows, maybe one of them will become dean or chair in a university someday. Susan Shaw | Professor Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies College of Liberal Arts What does Women’s History Month mean for you? Women’s History Month is an affirmation, a reclaiming of the contributions of women, across and in recognition of their differences of race/ethnicity, gender identity, sexuality, social class, ability, age, nationality and religion. Women’s History Month reminds us of how far we’ve come and how very far we still have to go to transform society into an inclusive, equitable, just and life-affirming place for all people. I appreciate the focused attention on women during this month, but I also recognize that simply honoring women doesn’t change the social structures, ideologies and relationships that subordinate and harm women. I guess I’m saying it’s a proverbial double-edged sword, both an important recognition and a performance of gender equality that falls short of making the deep social and personal changes needed. Why is recognizing Women’s History Month important within Oregon State University? Despite 60 years of the women’s movement, many students still don’t learn much about women and gender and their intersections with race/ethnicity, sexuality, ability, social class, age, nationality and religion from their classes, homes, media or religion. By recognizing Women’s History Month at OSU, we, as an educational institution, highlight women’s meaningful contributions in both the public and private spheres. We also are able to go beyond simply pointing out women in history. We are able to encourage students to think about gender, the ways we perform masculinity and femininity — or don’t, and how gender shapes personal and social relationships. We can talk about Critical Race Theory and how intersections of gender and race are key to understanding differences in experiences of oppression. We can facilitate the difficult dialogues that involve diverse perspectives and civil disagreement. We can help students learn how to advocate for social change, and we can support them in their growth as learners and engaged citizens of the world. Can you share the name of a woman — a public figure or a personal mentor — who has inspired you? How so? Can I name a group of them? When I first came to OSU in 1996, I met a group of amazing, powerful, successful feminist women, just a bit older than myself, who welcomed me, mentored me, and became my dear friends to this day — Janet Lee, Becky Warner, Vicki Tolar Burton, Anita Helle, Charlotte Headrick, Lani Roberts and Mina Carson. These women have been my cheerleaders, my confidants, my advisors and my role models. Every day of their careers, they gave their best to their students and to the institution, even as they criticized it and fought the patriarchy within it. They’ve all retired now, and they’ve left me with a legacy of loyalty and resistance that I strive to carry forward in my own work. They’re not the big names, the Gloria Steinems or Audre Lordes, but what inspires me is the very everydayness of their work, their ability to do their jobs so very well even as they struggled to make OSU a better place for diverse people. What evolution and/or progress have you seen for women in your field, within OSU and in the state of Oregon? What has that meant for your own life and career? Progress is a tricky word. We always have to ask, “Progress for whom?” We know that not everyone within a broad group like “women” experiences progress in the same ways or at the same rates. Within the discipline of Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies, we’ve seen a revolution in our understandings of intersectionality and of the category “women.” Intersectionality is a central feature of feminist analysis — it helps us offer a more complicated look at gender and its intersections with race/ethnicity, ability, age, sexuality, social class, nationality and religion. This recognition is closely related to the ways WGSS is coming to understand “women” itself as a complex category that includes the many ways people identify as women. I’ve been at OSU since 1996, and across that time span, I have certainly seen some changes, never enough, of course. We’ve embarked on our share of efforts to increase women’s representation on the faculty, particularly in STEM disciplines, and to improve women’s experiences as employees and students. We do finally have a woman as president of the university, albeit an interim one. We have made attempts to address the problems of sexual harassment and sexual assault with mixed success. Our (now) Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies program began in the 1972-73 academic year as the result of the settlement of a sex discrimination lawsuit against the university. At the time Women Studies, as it was called, offered a handful of courses taught by women faculty, usually on overload for free. Now we have 12 faculty members with all or some portion of their full-time equivalent in WGSS. We offer a B.A., B.S., M.A. and Ph.D. We house two academic journals — Feminist Formations, one of the leading journals in our discipline, edited by Patti Duncan — and ADVANCE Journal, an online open-access, peer-reviewed journal that grew out of OSU’s National Science Foundation ADVANCE Institutional Transformation Grant. I co-edit that journal with Becky Warner and Sarina Saturn. What all of this has meant for me is that I’ve been able to have an amazing career with amazing colleagues in a cutting-edge discipline that moves marginalized and minoritized people to the center of academic teaching and writing. I have been challenged by the many amazing feminists — especially those who have taught me across our differences — who have gone before me and helped create an opportunity for me to have this career and life, and I hope I have done my share of the work to bring about positive change within my sphere of influence so that those who come after me likewise have opportunities for an amazing career and life. Much remains to be done, but looking at my colleagues and students, I cannot help but feel hopeful for the future because of the passion for justice I see in them. Staci Simonich | Dean College of Agricultural Sciences What does Women’s History Month mean for you? To me, Women’s History Month means that we stop and take some time to reflect on how far women’s position in society has come. Breaking barriers for women and other underrepresented people in STEM motivates me to lead. And it's good to reflect on the progress we have made as a society, but still recognize how much further we have to go. Why is recognizing Women’s History Month important within Oregon State University? Like any 1862 land grant university, OSU has historically struggled to include women as students and faculty to the same level as men, especially in STEM fields. I think we are at a tipping point because women now make up the greatest percentage of students in several of OSU’s STEM colleges. We are also seeing more representation of women at the top levels of OSU, including the first women deans in some of OSU’s STEM colleges (including myself). Can you share the name of a woman — a public figure or a personal mentor — who has inspired you? How so? My female STEM colleagues at OSU inspire me every day. I especially enjoy talking with and watching the career development of my younger colleagues. I also have great respect for the women scientists that came before me and broke barriers that have allowed me to lead a fulfilling life in STEM. What evolution and/or progress have you seen for women in your field, within OSU and in the state of Oregon? What has that meant for your own life and career? I’ve been at OSU for 20 years, and it has been a great place to be a woman scientist, mother and administrator. No place is perfect, but my 20-year career at OSU has allowed me to contribute at my full potential, as well as to lead a (somewhat) balanced life. Kelsey Stoerzinger | Assistant Professor Chemical, Biological and Environmental Engineering College of Engineering What does Women’s History Month mean for you? Women’s History Month, to me, is a reminder of the amazing strides we’ve taken toward gender equality and improved representation, recognition that this took effort and advocacy from many players and acknowledgment that there is still a long way to go. Why is recognizing Women’s History Month important within Oregon State University? It is important to devote time to highlight historically underrepresented and marginalized groups to build a more equitable future. Can you share the name of a woman — a public figure or a personal mentor — who has inspired you? How so? Millie Dresselhaus. She paved the way for women in many branches of engineering and educated many as one of very few women faculty at the time. What evolution and/or progress have you seen for women in your field, within OSU and in the state of Oregon? What has that meant for your own life and career? There’s been an increased effort to increase the visibility of women in chemical engineering and materials science, which I hope will encourage more of the next generation to pursue these exciting fields addressing important societal problems. That being said, I hope someday it's unremarkable to be a woman in my field because there are so many! Tenisha Tevis | Assistant Professor College of Education What does Women’s History Month mean for you? This is a very interesting question. More often than not, this endeavor has felt like a celebration of white women more so than women across groups (Black, Hispanic, Asian, Trans). Though women of color have been a force to be reckoned with in the advancement of this country, I think recognition is often limited to our respective month of celebration rather than included here. I am reminded of Sojourner Truth and bell hooks’ “Ain’t I a Woman” and the dismissiveness of Black womanhood, in particular. I too am a woman, and while images and national conversations are beginning to recognize this, we are still a long way from parity. That being said, this month should celebrate and recognize all women, recognizing that while our plights are not the same, our successes do benefit us all. Why is recognizing Women’s History Month important within Oregon State University? Higher education is a microcosm of the greater. Thus, sometimes such institutions are complicit, wittingly and unwittingly, in being dismissive of women and women’s issues. Oregon State University is no exception. By recognizing Women’s History Month, our community is reminded of the pivotal contributions women have made and are making on this campus, and beyond. For example, my program’s home is all women (program chair, two assistant professors, a professor of practice and a program lead), and as a collective, on and off campus, we continue to grow a legacy. Can you share the name of a woman — a public figure or a personal mentor — who has inspired you? How so? The list is too long, and it is diverse. I will say the overlapping attributes of these women are their fortitude, unapologetic nature, ingenuity and dogged fight (not violent, just steadfast and resolute). We often reduce women to kind, gentle, sweet and supportive, which are wonderful attributes to embody, but this latter list limits our imagination of who women are and can be. The women I admire are all of these things! What evolution and/or progress have you seen for women in your field, within OSU and in the state of Oregon? What has that meant for your own life and career? While gender parity still seems like a lofty goal (I am being flippant…it is not lofty at all. It's reasonable and attainable), women are making great gains in leadership, nationally and at OSU. My program home is not the only program in my discipline that is women-ran. And at OSU, women are blazing trails across ranks and are being taken seriously. This is not a pat on the head. We have a lot of work to do here, nationally and globally. But the gift of women is that we are exposing blind spots, in order to create a more equitable work environment. The benefits are vast, and I do hope we don’t wait once a year to be recognized for our gifts and contributions to be celebrated. Shauna Tominey | Associate Professor of Practice and Parenting Education Specialist College of Public Health and Human Sciences What does Women’s History Month mean for you? To me, Women’s History Month is a reminder to reflect on the contributions of women (including trans women) in society from those who have come before us to those with us in the present day. Women’s History Month was started to recognize women who had the courage and strength to rise up against inequities and advocate for women’s rights. This time is also a reminder to honor the diversity in how women have supported society in visible and invisible ways — from courageous acts of protest, to quiet acts of resistance, to the grace and courage of simply being present. Why is recognizing Women’s History Month important within Oregon State University? Taking time to recognize the contributions women make in society for Women’s History Month and throughout the year is important not only for women, but for people of all genders. We have many wonderful examples of women leaders at Oregon State University across administration, faculty, staff and students. Each brings their own unique style, values and approaches to leadership. Seeing this diversity helps break down societal stereotypes around what it means to be a woman, in expression and in action. It is through diverse representation and recognition that we can truly honor all women and recognize their contributions across the university. Oregon State University has made significant strides toward the aim of representation and equitable opportunities across programs, schools and colleges, but there is still more work to do. Recognizing Women’s History Month is one small part of this much larger effort. Can you share the name of a woman — a public figure or a personal mentor – who has inspired you? How so? There are so many women in my life who I am grateful for and whose examples inspire me in my personal and professional life. This year, I have been especially reflecting on the intergenerational influence of the women in my family. Although we each carry our own stories and experiences, we also share the same histories and genes, while expressing them differently. These are a few of the women who inspire me on a daily basis: My grandmothers, my aunts and my cousins, for their strength, adaptability and dedication to family. My mother for her love, humility and insistence on never letting anyone leave hungry. My sister for her strength, tenacity and care. My niece for her creativity and her perseverance. My daughter for her courage and confidence. I carry each of these women with me and draw strength from their example. What evolution and/or progress have you seen for women in your field, within OSU and in the state of Oregon? What has that meant for your own life and career? I have worked in and support caregiving fields — parenting education, early childhood education and care, and education in general. Despite the important role of educators and caregivers in society, these fields have been largely under supported and undervalued. There is an underlying narrative that caregivers shouldn’t do this work for compensation — they should do it because they care. This narrative is detrimental to those in the field who have historically been women. Raising a voice for equitable pay is met with retaliation. They are told “this is what they signed up for,” and discontent is seen as a sign that they don’t actually care about the children and families they serve. This could not be further from the truth. Unless we make significant strides toward recognizing and elevating the importance of historically women-led fields, in support of people of all genders, we will burn out our caregiving professionals. At Oregon State University, we have a unique and special partnership with four philanthropic foundations (Oregon Community Foundation, The Ford Family Foundation, Meyer Memorial Trust and the Collins Foundation) called the Oregon Parenting Education Collaborative. OPEC supports a network of parenting education “hubs” as well as a statewide professional development system for parenting education professionals. Our team at OSU has the pleasure and honor of supporting OPEC with technical assistance, strategic planning, professional development and research/evaluation. Through this work, we give voice to caregivers who have been historically undervalued and under supported. Over the past few years, the state of Oregon (Early Learning Division, Oregon Department of Human Services) has also invested in significantly expanding this system, demonstrating the value our state and university are placing on the importance of children and families as well as the caregivers and educators who support them. Next steps in the field must include attention to compensation, workloads and recognition of the significant emotional labor and time spent on and off the clock. Progress is happening and there is much to celebrate — in thanks to women (and people of all genders) who dedicate their lives to caregiving — for those who bring loud voices and advocate for others and for those with the quiet courage and strength to show up with their presence every day. Seeing the growth in and investment in these fields over time has been inspiring and an honor to be a part of, but we still have a long way to go. Susan Tornquist | Lois Bates Acheson Dean Carlson College of Veterinary Medicine What does Women’s History Month mean for you? It’s an opportunity to recognize and celebrate the progress that has been made toward gender equality, but to recognize that gender equality hasn’t been achieved, and we still have work to do. Really making note of the amazing things that amazing women have done to advance science, technology, the arts, politics, human relationships and more is important to continuing that work. Why is recognizing Women’s History Month important within Oregon State University? At Oregon State University, we have excellent women leaders who are making a difference and continuing to work toward gender equality. That work should be recognized and serve as an inspiration for young people of all genders. Can you share the name of a woman — a public figure or a personal mentor — who has inspired you? How so? Of course, that has to be Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She was smart, effective, relentless and never gave up. What evolution and/or progress have you seen for women in your field, within OSU and in the state of Oregon? What has that meant for your own life and career? When I started veterinary school, the classes were less than 50% women. Now they are consistently greater than 80% women, not only here, but in most parts of the world. The gender shift in veterinary medicine has been remarkable. It has taken a while, but that increase in proportions of women vet students now means that those in the profession and especially in leadership roles in the profession are increasingly women. There are still fewer than 50% women as deans in veterinary colleges, but I have seen the number slowly but steadily increase. I think that demonstrates to younger veterinarians that they can play a variety of roles within the profession and that there is room for people with varied circumstances, responsibilities and interests in the top levels of veterinary leadership. Yanyun Zhao | Associate Dean of Faculty Affairs, Professor Food Science and Technology, College of Agricultural Sciences What does Women’s History Month mean for you? It’s a celebration and reminder of women's contributions to history, culture and society. We have come a long way in recognizing the contributions by women to past and current events, but we still have a way to go. Why is recognizing Women’s History Month important within Oregon State University? Recognizing Women’s History Month within Oregon State University is a chance to reflect on women’s contributions to OSU’s mission of teaching, research, and outreach and engagement, an inspiration to future generations of women at OSU and a reminder of continuous improvement in recognizing and promoting women’s accomplishments. Can you share the name of a woman — a public figure or a personal mentor — who has inspired you? How so? I have been inspired by the strength, courage and achievement of many women through my job and personal life. The first woman who truly inspired me and influenced my life is my middle school teacher. I admired her dedication to students and capability to make the classroom and learning so much fun, which led me to want to be a teacher like her. What evolution and/or progress have you seen for women in your field, within OSU and in the state of Oregon? What has that meant for your own life and career? I have seen more women in leadership roles in my professional field and within OSU. This progress has inspired and encouraged me to overcome personal barriers in pursuing what I used to be afraid of doing in my career.
