My work seeks out workings of power in obscure corners, in a quiet South African dorp, in scientific collaborations, in a mysterious and forgotten diplomatic initiative, in everyday lives of Africans living under European rule, and in interspecies relationships. In one sense, I am a traditional social historian: The workings of class, race, and gender have been central to all my research. In considering those categories, I have tried to find fresh insights by looking at the more-than-human and power/knowledge relationships. I've found microhistory and biography to provide an excellent way to frame these stories. Biography led me to an indepth study of the last-minutes negotations for an all-party election in South Africa in 1994. With my next project, a transnational history of African Grey Parrots, I will return to environmental history. With an emphasis on relations between companion species, I will add species to groups that know each other, negotiate with each other, and exercise power over each other.

Full Text Research Research Overview My book "Birders of Africa: History of a Network" was published with Yale University Press in 2016. Drawing on Actor Network Theory and employing the approach of micro-history, I examine intersections between African and European birders. I explore how local African, scientific, and colonial forces structured these relationships. Through close examination of individual lives, I identify the aspirations and affective ties that drew birders to seek expertise and status through their collaborations. My current research project is "The African Grey Parrot: A Global History." Research Statement I am current researching the transnational interspecies history of the two species of African Grey Parrots (Psittacus erithacus and P. timneh). The work will feature these birds and their communication and relations with other animals, including humans, in six temporally specific habitats: The species’ native forests in Africa, in evolutionary time; Breeding aviaries in South Africa, in recent decades; Urban households in Europe, America, South Africa over the past four centuries; University laboratories, in the United States in recent decades; The parrot sanctuary in Hope Valley, Rhode Island, in the past ten years; Non-native areas in East Africa very recently colonized by individuals released from intercepted illegal shipments or escaped from household cages. My 2016 book, "Birders of Africa: History of a Network," examines the interplay between local knowledge and science at the micro and macro levels. At the macro-level I consider the nature of agrarian bird knowledge and the history of ornithology in colonial Africa. I have found Actor Network Theory useful for reframing some debates about imperial science and its relation with local expertise. At the micro-level I work with the biographies of birders engaged in collaboration. These show that the structuring forces of race and empire left room for individual variation. Birders from all traditions sought status as experts, but the rewards of expertise differed greatly. In addition to this monograph project, I have completed the first of two planned volumes of a sourcebook developed through my own teaching. African History through Sources: Colonial Contexts and Everyday Experiences appeared in 2014 with Cambridge University Press. The second volume, on Africa from 1945 through 2015, is under contract. Jennifer Johnson of the Brown University History Department will serve as co-author. Entries in both volumes include government documents, memoirs by "ordinary" people and politicians, interviews with illiterate people whose perspectives might otherwise be forgotten, commentary by intellectuals, song lyrics, and photographs.

Brown students have prodded me into new directions and in nine years of teaching here I have become a different and more creative historian through their influences. At Brown, I have taught courses on Southern African History, West African History, Eastern African History, African Environmental History, African Women's History, South African Life Histories, Twentieth-Century Africa, and Africa Since 1950. My plans for future teaching and research are to continue to seek out intersections between environmental and social history in Africa and globally and to deepen considerations of the more recent past in sub-Saharan Africa.
