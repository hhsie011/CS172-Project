I hold a Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Geneva (2018) and a Master in Comparative and International Studies from the ETH Zürich (2012). In my research, I study the causes and consequences of migration and displacement with a focus on sub-Saharan Africa. Specifically, my research investigates how environmental change affect migration pattern, as well as under what condition does in-migration result in intergroup conflict. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral researcher in the department of political science at the University of Geneva (2018–2020) and a visiting scholar with the Arnold A. Saltzman Institute of War and Peace studies at Columbia University (2019–2020). My research has been appeared in Global Environmental Change, Journal of Conflict Resolution, Civil Wars and Nature Food.
