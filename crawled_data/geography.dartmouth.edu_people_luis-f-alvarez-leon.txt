ALVAREZ LEÓN |Assistant Professor Academic Appointments Department of Geography Assistant Professor Connect with Us Twitter I am a political economic geographer with substantive interests in geospatial data, media, and technologies. My research integrates the geographic, political, and regulatory dimensions of the informational and digital economy. At a high level, this research agenda is motivated by three core questions: 1) How are digital economies geographically configured and integrated into capitalism? 2) What are the economic dimensions of geospatial data, media, and technologies? 3) How are social and political relations changing in the (geospatial) digital economy? I am currently exploring answers to these questions through research projects addressing (among others) the geographies of autonomous vehicles, and the changing political economy of remote sensing in the context of the small satellite revolution. + View more Personal Website Contact Luis.F.Alvarez.Leon@Dartmouth.edu Fairchild 020 HB 6017 Department(s) Geography Education Ph.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Geography Undergraduate Major, Minor and Modifications Courses Culminating Experience Senior Honors Thesis Awards Careers Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Research Overview Faculty Research Student Research Postdoctoral Fellowships Facilities Off-Campus Study News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
