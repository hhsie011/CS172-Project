Truett Seminary>Programs & Centers>Kyle Lake Center for Effective Preaching Kyle Lake Center for Effective Preaching The Kyle Lake Center for Effective Preaching aims at providing the best possible preparation for our seminary students as well as continuing education in preaching to pastors and others in ministry. Furthermore, all programs are made available at a minimal charge to students in order to provide the greatest access to these exceptional services. Purposes To demonstrate the clear commitment of Truett Seminary to the centrality of preaching. To provide the most thorough preparation for the practice of preaching possible for seminarians. To provide the kind of opportunities for ongoing preparation that will enable preachers to be as effective as possible in the preaching task. The Centrality of Preaching The centrality of preaching to the Christian faith is undeniable. According to the Gospels, "Jesus came preaching" (Mark 1:14-15). After His crucifixion and resurrection, He charged His disciples to continue His work of preaching, "As the Father has sent me, so send I you" (John 20:21; Matthew 28:16-20; Acts 1:8). Since the beginnings of Baptist life, preaching has been central to our understanding of the work and worship of the church. This demands that George W. Truett Theological Seminary be a place which is committed to preparing people to preach effectively. Furthermore, as a servant of the churches, the seminary must be committed to offering ongoing opportunities for those who preach to continue to develop their preaching skills. National Preaching Conference African American Preaching Conference Boomers & Beyond Conference Additional Resources 12 Most Effective Preachers Survey The Center is named for Kyle Lake, a 1997 Truett Seminary graduate who died while pastoring Waco's University Baptist Church. His dynamic, creative and effective ministry as a preacher continues to impact many people. Through the generosity of his parents, David and Shirley Lake, in helping to establish the Center, Kyle's influence will be felt for generations to come.
