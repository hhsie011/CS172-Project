Your UC college provides academic advising by assigning you a designated college advisor. Your advisor is there to guide you through your academic program by helping you clarify your academic, professional, and personal goals; explaining program and university policies; advising on classes and how they fit your academic, professional, and personal goals; helping you with academic or personal matters; making sure you stay on track to graduation. In addition to a college-specific advisor, you may also have a specialized advisor assigned to you. A specialized advisor works in a centralized office and advises in other academic areas. Examples of specialized advising includes Honors advising, Pre-Professional advising, transfer advising, and student athletes advising. Although advisors are housed under different colleges and units, they all share a commitment to assist you in reaching your academic goals, all the way to graduation and beyond. We call this commitment the Bearcat Promise. The Bearcat Promise is a central part of advising at UC and vice-versa. The goal of the Bearcat Promise is for you, as a UC undergraduate student, to graduate with not just a degree, but with a plan for your future career. To further assist you with your career planning, UC has a designated Bearcat Promise Career Studio. Staffed with full-time, dedicated career coaches, the Career Studio can help you with anything from clarifying your career goals to prepare your for job interviews or grad school.
