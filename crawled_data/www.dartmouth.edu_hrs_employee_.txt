Please log in to review and acknowledge this employment information when you are prompted to do so via email. If you have not received an email prompting you to log in to Employment Notifications, there is no notice for you in the system and you will receive an error message.

New Hires: All benefits begin on your date of hire, or date of benefits eligibility. To determine if you are benefits eligible, please refer to the Benefits Eligibility - Health & Welfare Policy (pdf). Benefit-eligible employees have 30 days from their date of hire or date of benefits eligibility to log in to the FlexOnline benefits enrollment system to make their benefit elections. If you do not make your elections within these30 days, you will be defaulted into the Cigna Choice Fund medical plan option and other benefits as defined by your employment category. You will be responsible for any costs associated with the benefits you are defaulted into. Once the 30 days has expired, you will not have another opportunity to change your benefits coverage selection, unless you have a qualifying life event or until the open enrollment period held each fall. Current Employees: Once you have made your annual enrollment elections, whether as a new hire, or during Open Enrollment, you may not make changes to most of your benefits until the following plan year due to IRS regulations. Unless you have a qualifying life event, you will not have another opportunity to change your benefits coverage selection until the Open Enrollment period held each fall. A qualifying life event can be a marriage, divorce, birth or adoption of a child, or any time you or a dependent loses or gains coverage. A spouse's open enrollment period is also considered a qualifying event. It is important to know that you must submit a qualifying life event through the FlexOnline system no more than 31 days after the date of the event. Information about retirement plans available to employees is available on our Saving for Retirement webpage. Employees can make changes to their retirement plan elections or beneficiaries at any time.

Two employee HB addresses must be updated by the employees themselves, and one employee HB must be updated by the Finance Center. The HB address most frequently used to generate labels on campus is the address that must be updated by the Finance Center. The three HB locations and how to update them are noted below. You'll see that #3 is something that is probably best handled by one central person in situations when an entire department changes it's physical location. Locations and steps to changing your Hinman Mailbox information: Dartmouth Name Directory (DND) Lookup: This must be updated by the employee. Please log in to dartdm.dartmouth.edu and update any personal information, including Hinman Mail Box number. Employee Self-Service: Log in to Employee Self-Service to update your Personal Information, including your Hinman Box and your Payroll Mailing Address (the mailing address to which you want your paycheck to be sent). Office Location: If an entire department has moved, the department should gather a full list of employees who have moved, including these details: Employee's full name New physical office location (Building Name and Room/Suite Number) Hinman Box Number for mail delivery Send the compiled list to the Finance Center. The finance center will then enter the new HBs and assignment Office Locations in the HR/Payroll System. Note: this HB address is the one that is typically used when departments request a 'campus mailing list'. back to top Contact Us Top of page | Privacy | Copyright Â© 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College Last Updated: 5/13/22
