Students who are selected as (SP)2 Scholars will benefit from an exceptional set of opportunities and resources. Barnard thanks the Sherman Fairchild Foundation for its generous support of the Science Pathways Scholars Program.

(SP)2 Networking Activities A regular series of seminars, discussion sessions, and social events with other (SP)2 participants and Barnard alumnae working in the sciences. Scheduled throughout all four undergraduate years at Barnard, these events will help build a collaborative and engaging environment. Paid Summer Research Positions During the three summers of a Scholar’s years at Barnard, hands-on lab research experiences with Barnard faculty will be available. Scholars will receive compensation and summer housing through Barnard’s Summer Research Institute. Academic Year Opportunities Opportunities to conduct research in faculty labs during academic year, plus funding available to help Scholars complete their Senior Projects.
