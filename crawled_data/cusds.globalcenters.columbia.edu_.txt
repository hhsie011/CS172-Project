Next cycle of deadlines are forthcoming. Columbia University Scholarship for Displaced Students Thank you for your interest in the Columbia University Scholarship for Displaced Students (CUSDS). For information on the scholarship, please visit the scholarship information homepage. For information on applying to your chosen degree program (including questions regarding degree program application documentation or visas), please directly contact that participating school's admissions team. Eligibility This scholarship program is for foreign nationals who: have refugee status living anywhere in the world; have received US asylum or submitted a US asylum application; are in the US under Temporary Protected Status; are Internally Displaced Persons. Displaced Afghan students on Humanitarian Parole or with Special Immigrant Visas are also now eligible for the Scholarship. US permanent residents (green card holders, citizens, etc.) are not eligible for the scholarship. There are no age restrictions on the scholarship. Submission Instructions Note: The email address that prospective students use when submitting their applications for a degree program and a scholarship MUST be the same. Applicants must first apply directly to a Columbia degree program listed on the scholarship information homepage. After submitting their degree application, applicants must then complete the below scholarship application form. Each school and program maintains their own acceptance requirements and application deadlines. Acceptance to an academic program DOES NOT guarantee funding through the scholarship (students may be accepted to an academic program but not receive funding through the scholarship). Applicants must complete and submit their online Columbia degree application BEFORE submitting the scholarship form. Once the applicant creates their online Columbia degree application, they will receive an application ID / reference number through their Columbia school's respective application system. This Columbia application ID / reference number must be entered in the scholarship application form below. To be considered for the scholarship, applicants must submit the below form in its entirety no later than the date indicated in the form (which in most - but not all - cases is their degree program's application deadline). A full list of eligible Columbia degree programs and their respective scholarship application deadlines are listed on the scholarship information homepage. Expand all Collapse all Frequently Asked Questions What types of displacement are eligible for the Columbia University Scholarship for Displaced Students? The following types of displacement are eligible for the scholarship: Refugees from and living anywhere in the world that have official documented status through a recognized government or governmental agency Asylees granted asylum in the United States but without permanent resident status Applicants who have filed for asylum in the United States and are under process Applicants who maintain Temporary Protected Status within the United States Applicants who are Internally Displaced Persons (someone who has been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights or human-made disasters, and who have not crossed an internationally recognized State border.) Displaced Afghan students on Humanitarian Parole or with Special Immigrant Visas Only these categories of displacement are eligible for the scholarship. US permanent residents (green card holders, citizens, etc.) are not eligible for the scholarship. All scholarship applicants must submit documentation supporting their eligible status under the “Upload documentation corroborating status” section of the scholarship application below. Suggested documentation is listed in the application form. All documentation must be submitted with the application through the online form – documents submitted by email will NOT be considered. What schools and degree programs are eligible for the Columbia University Scholarship for Displaced Students? What is the application deadline for my degree program? A full list, with links and deadlines, of participating schools and eligible degree programs can be found on the scholarship information homepage under the “Participating Schools” section. Degree program application deadlines vary by school and specific program, so applicants must check the deadlines for their respective degree program. Applicants should reach out to their prospective school’s admissions team for any admissions-related questions. NOTE: Only the programs listed are eligible for the scholarship – programs not listed are NOT eligible for the scholarship. Students admitted to a degree program not listed are not eligible for the scholarship. When is the deadline to apply to the Columbia University Scholarship for Displaced Students? All applicants must submit their degree program application BEFORE submitting their scholarship application form. In many cases the scholarship application deadline is the same as the degree program application deadline, but this is not the case for all degree programs. You must review the scholarship deadlines listed in the form below. NOTE: Scholarship applications are reviewed all together for each degree program only after the degree application deadline. The review is not “rolling”, so there is no benefit to applying “first” or earlier than the degree application deadline. Scholarship applications must be made during the degree application cycle for which you are applying (ie you cannot apply for the scholarship a year in advance of when you will apply for a degree program). What if the application deadline for my degree program has passed? If the application deadline for your degree program has passed, then you are no longer able to apply for admission for the upcoming academic year. Any scholarship applications submitted after the program's degree application deadline will not be considered. How can I submit my degree application? Degree programs can be found by locating your specific school and program on the Participating Schools section on the main scholarship information page. You must submit your degree application before you can apply for the scholarship. Can I be provided with a fee waiver for my degree program’s application? Degree program application fees can be considered for a waiver in extraordinary cases by emailing [email protected] at least two weeks before the student plans to submit their degree application. Students must begin their online degree application BEFORE being eligible for a fee waiver. Fee waiver requests must include the applicant’s full name, the Columbia school and degree program to which they are applying, and their Columbia degree application ID / reference number. Where can I find my "Columbia degree application ID / reference number"? Applicants must begin their online Columbia degree application BEFORE applying to the scholarship. Once the degree application is begun, the application will have an application ID / reference number, which is created through the Columbia school's application system. This Columbia application ID / reference number must be entered in the scholarship application form. (If your school's application system does not generate a Columbia application ID / reference number, please enter "My school's degree application does not have an ID / reference number" in the form below. Applicants for the School of General Studies may submit either their Application Reference Number, found at the top of their Application Status Page, or their Personal ID Number, which is sent via email after their application is received.) Are transfer applications or dual degrees eligible for the Columbia University Scholarship for Displaced Students? Transfer applications (those currently enrolled at another university and wishing to transfer to Columbia mid-degree) are only eligible for the School of General Studies, Columbia College, and the School of Engineering and Applied Science - Undergraduate. Transfer applications are not eligible for any other school or degree program. Dual degrees (degree programs with more than one Columbia school or with another university) are not eligible for the scholarship. Can I be accepted to Columbia but not receive funding through the scholarship? Scholarships are limited and competitive. As such, admittance to a degree program DOES NOT guarantee funding through the scholarship. I have submitted my applications to both an eligible Columbia degree program and to the Columbia University Scholarship for Displaced Students. What’s next? No further action is needed. You will not receive a confirmation email following your scholarship application submission. Applicants will receive admissions decisions from their respective school once schools release those decisions. If applicants are admitted to their degree program and if they are selected for the scholarship, they may receive notice of their scholarship award with their admissions decision, or they may receive notification separately (this will depend on the specific school). Scholarship applicants that are either not admitted to Columbia or did not receive the scholarship will not hear back regarding the scholarship. Please note that the scholarship is limited and competitive. It is possible to be admitted to a degree program and not be selected for the scholarship – admittance to your program of choice DOES NOT guarantee scholarship funding.

For IDP, the Scholarship understand that IDPs are unable to replace personal documentation that was left behind, lost, destroyed, or confiscated during conflict, disaster, or during fleeing home. As such, the Scholarship is flexible with accepting various forms of civil documentation to verify displacement, such as state or local documents, recognition by non-governmental organizations or international education agencies, and other supplemental documentation from recognized entities. The above list is not exhaustive. Applicants are encouraged to submit any and all documentation that enables the Scholarship to assess that the applicant meets the eligibility requirements.
