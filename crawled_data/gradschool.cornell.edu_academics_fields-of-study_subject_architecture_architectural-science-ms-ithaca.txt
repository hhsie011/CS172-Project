(Ithaca) Field of Study Architecture Program Description Architectural science (M.S.). Students with an undergraduate degree in architecture, architectural engineering, engineering, or computer science are likely candidates for the graduate program in architectural science. Program objectives are (1) to afford an opportunity for students of architecture to expand their creative design potential by increasing their knowledge and understanding of environmental science and building technologies and (2) to provide a framework within which students who have graduated from other technical disciplines may explore computer science, computer graphics, and computer-aided design methods. Students enrolling for studies in computer graphics use the facilities of the interdisciplinary Program of Computer Graphics. Ordinarily four terms of residence are required to complete the program of study, depending on the student's background and experience.

International students whose undergraduate training has been completed outside the United States are admitted as provisional candidates. They should plan to spend at least four terms in residence for the master's degree. TOEFL minimum score of 600 (paper-based) or 250 (computer-based) . all Graduate School Requirements, including the TOEFL Exam or IELTS Academic Exam for non-native English applicants Two recommendations Transcripts: Submit completed and official transcripts from each college or university previously attended to the field to which you are applying. If it is against an institution's policy to send transcripts to the applicant, the transcripts can be mailed by the school directly to the field to which you are applying. GRE general test scores are optional GRE subject test in computer science for computer graphics applicants is optional Statement of purpose (A one- or two-page statement, preferably printed on white paper, outlining your research interests and intents for graduate study at Cornell. Please relate these intents to your previous design and academic experience, and to your future goals. Include your full name and your proposed field of study at the top of each page.) Learning Outcomes There are five primary learning outcomes, or goals, for students completing the Architectural Science M.S. with a concentration in computer graphics. Demonstrate understanding of basic scientific and technical knowledge in the domain of computer graphics (disciplinary knowledge, information literacy). Identify and articulate a specific topic within the domain of computer graphics appropriate for the development of an original master's level thesis (critical thinking, communication skills and self-directed learning). Develop specific skills and understanding having direct bearing on the identified thesis topic (critical thinking, communication skills and self-directed learning). Identify and evaluate relevant previous published work relevant to a specific topic in the domain of computer graphics (literature search, resulting in disciplinary knowledge and information literacy). Demonstrate the ability to produce research of sufficient quality to be presentable at peer-reviewed conferences, or publishable in appropriate peer-reviewed publications (engagement in the process of discovery or creation; communication skills, self-directed learning). To assess the first three goals, evidence is collected through graduate level elective coursework and thesis preparation. The third goal, having to do with developing skills for the thesis topic, is also developed and evaluated through the thesis itself. The fourth goal—primarily a literature search -- is accomplished during the thesis preparation phases; and the fifth goal—the production of research -- is accomplished and evaluated on the basis of the thesis itself.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
