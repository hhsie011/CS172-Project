A New Way to Request Materials Beginning April 13, 2022, Schlesinger Library's materials will be requested using your HOLLIS Special Request account, which allows you to place and manage your requests for access to Schlesinger Library’s materials. HOLLIS Special Request is available to Harvard and non-Harvard researchers and can be used at any participating Harvard library or archives. All researchers will need to have a HOLLIS Special Request account to request Schlesinger Library materials. (Note: If you have an existing HOLLIS Special Request account you use to request from Harvard’s other special collections libraries, that account also works with Schlesinger Library’s materials!) With your HOLLIS Special Request account you can: Request material to view in a Reading Room Track the status and history of your requests Order copies of materials Save lists of material to be requested later Nearly all collection materials, including books, periodicals, and manuscript collections, can be requested through HOLLIS, Harvard library's online catalog. Requests for manuscript and archival material can also be made directly from finding aids (guides describing the contents of archival collections) in HOLLIS for Archival Discovery. Researchers are encouraged to place requests for materials in advance of your visit so we can confirm access to items with restrictions or arrange for delivery if stored offsite. Please share your questions with us using the Ask a Schlesinger Librarian webform.
