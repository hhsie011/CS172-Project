Admission requirements Inside the Program History Department helps create the Original Pizza Hut Museum History students have the opportunity to help perserve local history. Two Wichita State students, brothers Dan and Frank Carney, started the Pizza Hut business in 1958. The restaurant has since become one of the biggest pizza chains in the world. The original building resides at Wichita State as a museum. History Department Chair Jay Price put the Pizza Hut's story into a local context and think about ways the Carney story helps explain the spirit of entrepreneurship in Wichita. The museum is now open to the public, and many current Wichita State students serve as docents.
