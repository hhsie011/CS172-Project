Geisel Logo Information & Downloads In 2012, the Geisel School of Medicine introduced a new logo to serve as the symbol of the medical school. The new shield was created with the help and input of our students, faculty, staff, and alumni, based on elements and symbols they felt best described the medical school and its mission, Dartmouth, and the region. Elements of the Shield: 1797 is the year the medical school was founded, the book represents students and the pursuit of knowledge, the Rod of Asclepius, an ancient Greek symbol of healing and medicine, the Lone Pine is an important symbol and speaks to the heritage of Dartmouth, the water represents healing and the environment, as well as the Connecticut River which runs through the heart of the region. Together, these symbols represent the education, research and patient care missions of the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, as well as our foundation as one of the nation’s oldest and most innovative medical schools.
