Advising holds to control student enrollment in a future term are added by the Office of the Registrar by approximately the sixth week of a fall or spring semester (spring advising holds are added during the fall term, and fall/summer advising holds are added during the spring term). Advising holds for the current semester are also added to special student populations after the main term’s nonrestrictive drop/add deadline. Advisors can release advising holds is from the Advisor Student Profile in Self-Service. Find detailed instructions on releasing holds from the Student Profile here. Contact the Office of the Registrar to add an advisor registration hold. Note: OSU has developed a custom process that uses a combination of registration holds and term-based registration time tickets to mimic the behavior of actual term-based holds. The process runs on a regular basis throughout the day and looks for term-based holds. If an advising hold is present, the process will remove the student’s registration time ticket for the given term, effectively preventing registration for that term. Upon releasing an advising hold, the process will replace the student’s time ticket. While adding and releasing advising holds is not instantaneous, they should take effect within 30 minutes.
