By recognizing, reporting and preventing bias-related or hate incidents, we can foster an even more inclusive campus community where all members feel welcomed and supported. If you have experienced or witnessed a bias-related incident, we urge you to report it to the University. The STOP Bias portal may be used by all members of the Syracuse University community including students, faculty, staff, visitors, and alumni. Report an Act of Bias In addition to coordinating the STOP Bias and Hate initiative, the Bias Response and Education team within Community Standards supports the University’s efforts to educate the campus community and respond to issues related to bias.
