WSU’s ShockerAlert System is a network of various emergency communication assets which can be activated within minutes. They include: Email and text blasts. ShockerAlert will send emergency notification to individual faculty, staff and students though mass e-mail and cell phone text messaging. E-mail blasts are automatically sent to all wichita.edu accounts. To receive ShockerAlerts via cell phone, university community members must elect to opt-in. See www.wichita.edu/alert in order to complete the steps necessary to receive emergency notification by text message. Wireless Emergency Mass Notification System. The WSU Wireless Emergency Mass Notification System is a network of scrolling message boards that are strategically located in campus classrooms, department offices, and in many building lobbies. The message boards normally perform as digital clocks. When emergency notification is activated, however, these digital displays immediately transition into message boards and provide a scrolling emergency text message. Web alerts. In the event of an emergency, the WSU Web site (www.wichita.edu) will disseminate time-stamped news updates and contact information about the crisis. The myWSU site, which is a portal for students and staff, also has emergency notification features. Campus Information Channel. WSU’s campuses feature strategically-placed video monitors that normally display information about upcoming events. If a ShockerAlert is issued, emergency information will be displayed on these monitors. Facebook. ShockerAlerts will be carried on facebook.com/shockeralert. Any Facebook user who friends this page will receive ShockerAlert messages on their Facebook wall. In addition to ShockerAlert, KMUW, the WSU’s public radio station, subscribes to the federal Emergency Alert System and is capable of broadcasting an emergency alert notification as initiated by its network. 1845 Fairmount St.Wichita, Kansas 67260 USA (316) 978-3456 Request InfoVisitApply Contact Us Virtual Tour Campus Map and Directions Facebook Twitter Instagram YouTube TikTok Wichita State has helped me put marketing strategy in a real-world perspective.
