It’s how we improve the way we teach, the way we learn, and the very community we’re part of. About Butler Menu Maps & Directions At a Glance Graduate Outcomes Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion Community & Engagement Office of the President Strategic Direction Give to Butler Mascot Blue IV Careers Our University stands for a lot—but never business as usual. It’s not about change for change’s sake; it’s about making sure we’re always meeting the needs of our students and community—and ensuring we give our faculty the tools they need to turn a new generation of learners into a new generation of leaders. Read How We’re Paving the Way At Butler, we’re game-changers. And we’ve been so since our very beginning. That forward-thinking philosophy continues today. From our continual development of new academic programs, to strategic community partnerships, to major investments in state-of-the-art educational facilities, The Butler Way is rooted in innovation. These actions—both present and future—give Butler educators the tools and techniques they need to inspire and inform the next generation of thinkers and doers. Innovation in Teaching and Learning We’ve cultivated a campus culture at Butler that blends the best classroom techniques, no matter where they come from—music or mathematics, education or entrepreneurship. Whether it’s peer-to-peer mentoring or our annual Celebration of Innovations in Teaching and Learning, our overriding goal is that all our students get the best of Butler, every day. Innovation Beyond the Classroom A good idea can be transformative. But an idea is just the start. Our new Innovation Lab helps students get from dreaming to doing. Using our Think It-Build It-Test It-Scale It approach, students will work with mentors, coaches, and investors to take a concept formed in class and use a step-by-step approach to turn it into a real business—or, if necessary, go back to the drawing board. Campus: Everywhere Since our earliest days, Butler has been dedicated to providing education for as many as possible: Our founder, Ovid Butler, made clear that gender or race wouldn’t be a barrier to getting a college degree here. Through our new affiliation with Noodle, we’re ensuring location isn’t a barrier, either. We have new online graduate and certificate programs in four of our six colleges—a number we expect to grow. Transformation Lab The Transformation Lab is where we identify, explore, design, and pilot new ideas and initiatives. In addition to providing a collaborative space to nurture ideas, the Lab also offers the resources and partnership opportunities to bring those ideas to life. With a focus on advancing our Butler Beyond strategic priorities, the Transformation Lab allows us to adapt to changes in higher education and deliver the kind of innovative, life-changing education that has been our hallmark for generations. Pause/Play Sciences Complex Innovative Spaces We’re in the midst of a three-phase, $100 million expansion and renovation of our Sciences Complex. When complete, the building will feature high-tech classrooms that promote learning by doing; labs that mimic ones found in top research companies; and work spaces that encourage cross-disciplinary collaboration. Dugan Hall High-Tech Learning The new, 110,000-square-foot home of the Lacy School of Business is built to encourage creative, hands-on learning and intensive networking. Dugan features state-of-the-art, flexible classrooms; a trading room featuring live market data; and a central Innovation Commons that will bring students, faculty and Central Indiana business leaders together. Butler Esports Park Game On Get your game on in this 7,500-square-foot center designed by Populous, an architectural firm known for sports and esports facilities alike. In addition to providing a home for local, regional and even global competitions, the new home of our rapidly growing esports program will also provide office space for our industry partners.
