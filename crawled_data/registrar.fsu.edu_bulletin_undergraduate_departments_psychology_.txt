The undergraduate major includes a rigorous course of study that covers the methodology and content needed to understand the causes of behavior in humans and animals. It is the intent of the program that the level of knowledge attained by the successful major will be such that the student is well prepared for graduate-level studies in any of the specialty areas in psychology. Likewise, the undergraduate program will provide excellent preparation for those interested in advanced training in a professional school (e.g., law or medical school), although additional coursework outside psychology may be required. Although some students may not wish to pursue graduate studies, this program assures that the successful major will attain a strong science-based liberal arts education, which can prepare students for a variety of careers, although additional training (e.g., internships) may be required. Majors are required to take two laboratory courses, and qualified students are strongly encouraged to work in the department’s research laboratories or to participate in research in educational and clinical settings. Students also are strongly encouraged to consult early and regularly with the departmental Advising Office to be sure they are meeting program requirements and to ask about opportunities for intensive study in a specialty area while pursuing the major, as well as how to better prepare oneself for graduate school or employment. Advisors are available M-F from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon and 1:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. Please call (850) 644-4260 or e-mail advising@psy.fsu.edu. The optional areas of emphasis include clinical psychology, cognitive psychology, developmental psychology, neuroscience, and social psychology. Students on the Panama City campus may specialize in applied behavior analysis and performance management. For the student wishing to study abroad, the department offers a summer program to study psychology in London. The Psychology London Program includes two 4000 level elective courses that are not offered at other FSU campuses and that emphasize cultural determinants of behavior. There also may be opportunities to study for a semester in one of FSU’s many study centers and programs abroad (including, but not limited to, Florence, Valencia, London, Panama, and Prague) while completing Liberal Studies requirements, one’s minor, and/or one’s world language requirement. For detailed information about the psychology major and the department, please refer to https://psy.fsu.edu/. The department also offers an interdisciplinary major, behavioral neuroscience, in conjunction with the Program in Neuroscience and the Department of Biological Science. The behavioral neuroscience major offers students the opportunity to build knowledge across the natural and social sciences – exploring the elaborate chains of causality that lead from molecules to behavior, as well as the dramatic impact exerted by social, personal, and environmental influences on dynamic patterns of human thought and emotion. Students will experience a synthesis of coursework offered by the Departments of Biological Science, Psychology, Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, and Statistics. The unique multidisciplinary breadth of the behavioral neuroscience major prepares students for a variety of STEM-related careers as technicians, researchers, educators, or health professionals. While understanding human brain function (in health and disease) has long been of central importance to physicians, psychologists, researchers, and educators, the knowledge accruing from this effort is also beginning to impact traditionally non-STEM professions such as law, business, or economics. Students are strongly encouraged to consult early and regularly with the Neuroscience Advising Office to be sure they are meeting program requirements and to ask about opportunities for intensive study in a specialty area while pursuing the major, as well as how to better prepare oneself for graduate or professional school, or employment. For an appointment, please call (850) 645-9565 or e-mail advising@neuro.fsu.edu. For detailed information about the behavioral neuroscience major, please refer to https://www.neuro.fsu.edu/. Computer Skills Competency All undergraduates at Florida State University must demonstrate basic computer skills competency prior to graduation. As necessary computer competency skills vary from discipline to discipline, each major determines the courses needed to satisfy this requirement. Undergraduate majors in psychology and behavioral neuroscience satisfy this requirement by earning a grade of “C–” or higher in PSY 3213C. State of Florida Common Program Prerequisites The state of Florida has identified common program prerequisites for this University degree program. Specific prerequisites are required for admission into the upper-division program and must be completed by the student at either a community college or a state university prior to being admitted to this program. Students may be admitted into the University without completing the prerequisites, but may not be admitted into the program. At the time this document was published, some common program prerequisites were being reviewed by the state of Florida and may have been revised. Please visit https://dlss.flvc.org/admin-tools/common-prerequisites-manuals for a current list of state-approved prerequisites. The following lists the common program prerequisites or their substitutions, necessary for admission into this upper-division degree program: Psychology BSC X0XX or BSC X20X or ZOO X010 PSY X012 PSY XXXX or any other lower level Psychology class within the Psychology Inventory (e.g., CLP, DEP, EAB, EXP, INP, PCO, PPE, and PSB prefixes) STA XXXX Behavioral Neuroscience BSC X010/X010L or BSC X010C BSC X011/X011L or BSC X011C CHM X045/X045L or CHM X045C CHM X046/X046L or CHM X046C CHM X210/X210L and CHM X211/X211L PHY X053/X053L PHY X054/X054L MAC X311 STA XXXX Admission Requirements for a Major in Psychology Admission to the undergraduate program in psychology is based on a minimum GPA and the successful completion of prerequisite course requirements. A Psychology major who applies for readmission to the college must meet the degree requirements of the catalog in force on the date of readmission. Students whose psychology credits are ten years old or older will need to have their existing credits evaluated by the Department of Psychology to determine if any requirements need to be repeated to ensure that their knowledge of Psychology is current. Note: While some of these requirements overlap with the state of Florida Common Program Prerequisites (listed above), there are additional requirements for formal admission to the psychology major. Please note that students who qualify for upper-division status and who wish to enter FSU as a Psychology major must complete all of the following prerequisites prior to being accepted at FSU: A minimum GPA of 2.8 in all college-level courses attempted Meet requirements for progression to upper division status Completion of the three courses listed below (each with a “C–” or better); these three courses should be taken as part of the liberal studies requirements or the AA degree. PSY 2012, General Psychology One biology course, with one of the following strongly preferred: BSC 1005, 2010, 2085, 2086, PCB 2099, PSB 2000, ZOO X010, or equivalent Any statistics course, with STA 2122 or STA 2171 strongly preferred. The Research Methods course (PSY 3213C), which is required of all majors, requires that STA 2122 or STA 2171 or equivalent be taken as a course prerequisite (or corequisite, if necessary). It is important that students see a psychology advisor for guidance as to when it is best to schedule these courses. Requirements for a Major in Psychology Note: Please see the undergraduate link on the department’s Website at https://psy.fsu.edu/ or contact the Psychology Advising Office at (850) 644-4260 for requirements. Please review all college-wide degree requirements summarized in the “College of Arts and Sciences” chapter of this General Bulletin. Please also see the section in this General Bulletin on University-wide undergraduate degree requirements regarding the following: diversity, oral communication competency, and computer skills competency. For the Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in psychology, the requirements listed below, along with the requirements of the College of Arts and Sciences, must be fulfilled. For the Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree, nine additional semester hours in the humanities and history are required above and beyond the requirements for the BS degree. The Department of Psychology offers a broad selection of courses in order for each student to select a curriculum appropriate for his/her needs. All students must fulfill the major requirements listed below, which ensure a balanced program of study. Any of the courses listed below, if presented by the student toward fulfillment of the major, must be completed with a minimum grade of “C–”. A student who has accumulated more than four unsatisfactory grades (U, F, D–, D, D+) in courses required for the psychology major, excluding State Common Program Prerequisites listed as Term 1–4 milestones, taken after enrolling at FSU, will not be permitted to graduate with a degree in this major. In an effort to maintain quality and to give students a direct way to affect the program, the Department of Psychology asks all of its graduating seniors to complete a survey to provide information about their experiences in and impressions of the department. Required Upper-Level Courses for a Psychology Major Note: EXP 3202C, 3422C, 3604C; PSY 3213C; and PSB 3004C are each four hour courses with both lecture and laboratory components. These courses previously were three hour lecture courses and separate one hour laboratory courses. Thirty-six semester hours of psychology courses (not including General Psychology) are required for the major. At least eighteen of these thirty-six hours must be taken in residence at FSU. Courses taken outside the Department of Psychology will not count toward the Psychology thirty-six hour requirement. Courses with a WST prefix will not count toward the Psychology major, even though they may be listed on the Psychology course search. Students pursuing a double major may use up to six hours of Psychology coursework toward another major, provided that major accepts those courses. Students should check with advisors in both majors on these course requirements. Students can use only one psychology course (either IDS 2651 or PSB 2000) to count toward both psychology major and liberal studies requirements. The thirty-six hours must include: Group 1: Research Methods. STA 2122 or 2171 or equivalent is a prerequisite (or corequisite, for students with prior statistics credit). Group 1 totals four hours of credit. PSY 3213C must be completed by the end of Term 5 (first semester, junior year). PSY 3213C Research Methods in Psychology with Laboratory (4) Group 2: Neuroscience. Students must take PSB 2000. If PSB 2000 is used for the biology requirement for entrance into the major, students will need to take one biology course while in the major (e.g., BSC 1005, BSC 2010, BSC 2085, BSC 2086; PCB 2099; PSB 2000; ZOO X010, or equivalent). PSB 2000 must be completed by the end of Term 5 (first semester, junior year). Group 3: Social, Cognitive, Clinical, and Developmental Psychology. Students must take one course in at least three of these four areas of psychology. The following list is a guide to the courses that qualify under each area; students can consult the advising office about whether other courses are eligible to count toward a particular area. Clinical Psychology: CLP 3305 (Clinical and Counseling Psychology), CLP 4134 (Abnormal Child Psychology), CLP 4110 (Eating Disorders), CLP 4143 (Abnormal Psychology), CLP 4392 (Psychology of Criminal Behavior), Cognitive Psychology: EXP 3604C (Cognitive Psychology with Laboratory), EXP 4404 (Human Memory and Learning), EXP 4640 (Psychology of Language) Developmental Psychology: DEP 3103 (Child Psychology), DEP 4404 (Psychology of Adult Development and Aging) Social Psychology: SOP 3004 (Social Psychology), SOP 4722 (Prejudice and Stereotyping), PPE 3003 (Psychology of Personality) Group 4: Lecture/Laboratory Courses. Students must take one course from the list below. Each course contains a lecture and laboratory component. EXP 3202C Sensation and Perception with Laboratory (4) EXP 3422C Conditioning and Learning with Laboratory (4) EXP 3604C Cognitive Psychology with Laboratory (4) Note: If EXP 3604C is used to fulfill a Group 3 requirement, it may also be used to fulfill the Group 4 laboratory requirement. By double-counting, students will not be able to graduate with fewer hours in the major; rather, they will take more psychology electives (Group 6) to total thirty-six semester hours. Group 4 adds between zero and four hours of credit, depending on if EXP 3604C is double counted. Group 5: Careers in Psychology. Students must complete Careers in Psychology (PSY 2023) by the end of Term 5 (first semester, junior year). Group 6: Psychology Electives. Students must take enough psychology elective courses to total thirty-six hours of psychology courses (not including General Psychology). Group 6 adds fifteen to eighteen hours of credit. Up to nine total hours of applied learning experiences can count toward psychology electives. Courses in this category include Directed Individual Study (DIS: PSY 4911–4914) and Research Topics (PSY 4910, 4915, 4920) and Psychology Internship (PSY 4944). These are taken by instructor permission only. Students can take a total of up to fifteen hours of these applied courses for university credit, but only nine hours total will count toward the psychology major. Honors thesis work (PSY 4039r). Students can use honors thesis work to bring the total number of hours of applied courses that count toward the major to twelve hours maximum. For example, if a student took nine combined hours of PSY 4920 and PSY 4911, he/she can count an additional three hours of honors thesis work toward the major. Psychology electives are courses listed under the department’s code of “ASPSY”, excluding courses used to meet Groups 1 through 5 requirements. If courses in Groups 3 or 4 are taken beyond the minimum requirements, they may count as electives. For students who have not taken any 4000-level psychology courses at Florida State University to fulfill Psychology requirements, at least three hours of psychology electives must be taken at the 4000-level at Florida State University. This cannot include PSY 4910–4915, PSY 4920, PSY 4039, PSY 4944, or PSY 4970. ISC 4244C (Computer Applications in Psychology with Lab) counts as a 4000-level psychology elective. Admission Requirements for a Major in Behavioral Neuroscience Neuroscience is the study of brain and nervous system function. The elective coursework in the behavioral neuroscience major offers an emphasis that includes the effects of sensory and social experience on brain and behavior, the mechanisms of learning and memory, cognitive processes and emotion, human brain disorders and disease, and the neural and behavioral effects of drugs and hormones. Due to the limitations in the number of faculty and physical resources, admission to the behavioral neuroscience major will be based on the following admission requirements: A minimum GPA of 2.80 in all college-level courses attempted. Completion of the following courses with a grade of “C minus” or higher: BSC X010, X010L (3, 1) Biological Science I and Lab BSC X011, X011L (3, 1) Biological Science II and Lab CHM X045, X045L (3, 1) General Chemistry I and Lab CHM X046, X046L (3, 1) General Chemistry II and Lab MAC X311 (4) Calculus I STA X0XX (3) Statistics: STA 2122 (3) preferred Completion of at least 52 academic credits or an A.A.
