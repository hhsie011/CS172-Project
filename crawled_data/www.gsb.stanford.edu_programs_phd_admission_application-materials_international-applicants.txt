TOEFL Scores from the TOEFL exam are required of all applicants whose first language is not English. Being a U.S. citizen does not automatically exempt an applicant from taking the TOEFL; if the applicant’s first language is not English, the applicant must meet the requirements for an exemption or waiver below or submit TOEFL scores. Stanford does not accept scores from the IELTS exam. Exemptions Exemptions to the TOEFL requirement are granted to applicants who have earned a U.S. bachelor’s, master’s, or doctoral degree from a college or university accredited by a regional accrediting association in the United States, or the international equivalent degree from a university of recognized standing in a country in which all instruction is provided in English. Therefore, applicants with degrees from the U.S., Australia, Canada (except Quebec), New Zealand, Singapore, and the United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales) are exempt from taking the TOEFL and do not need to request a TOEFL waiver through the application portal. Waivers Applicants with degrees from institutions in countries other than those listed above and in which English was the only language of instruction must submit a request a waiver to the TOEFL requirement through our online application. This exception does not apply if the courses were completed in a country where English is spoken but not all courses were provided in English. Score Validation Scores must be submitted from a test taken within the last two years prior to the application deadline. Class Deadline Date for Valid Test Scores Fall 2022 01 Dec 2021 01 Dec 2019 – 01 Dec 2021 Minimum Score Requirements Applicants for doctoral programs in all fields must obtain a minimum score as follows: TOEFL Minimum Score Paper-based 600 Internet-based 100 Submitting Your TOEFL Score Official scores must be reported directly to Stanford by Educational Testing Service (ETS) using school code 4704. You may upload an unofficial copy of your scores through the online application. Due to the volume of applications we receive we cannot confirm receipt of official test scores. If we need any additional information we will reach out to you directly.

All supporting material must be in English. The university reserves the right to require additional academic documents.
