Allworth Memorial Lectures Edward A. Allworth (1920-2016), a distinguished pioneer in Central Asian Studies, alumnus of the Russian Institute, and longtime faculty member at Columbia University was founding director of both the Program on Soviet Nationality Problems (1970) and the Center for Central Asian Studies (1984). His many publications include eight books, among them his seminal Central Asia: A Century of Russian Rule (1967; third edition published as Central Asia: 120 Years of Russian Rule, 1994), and The Tatars of Crimea: Return to the Homeland (2d ed. 1989). He mentored dozens of accomplished scholars from around the world and introduced the rich culture and history of the region to countless more. The Central Eurasian Studies Society honored Allworth posthumously with its 2016 Lifetime Service to the Field Award. The Institute has established the Annual Edward A. Allworth Memorial Lecture to honor this legacy.
