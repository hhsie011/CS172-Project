Center-Affiliated Faculty Scheller College faculty members represent an impressive depth of expertise and activity in sustainability. Within their fields of study—from operations and finance to business ethics and marketing—faculty members investigate numerous aspects of sustainability, including socially responsible investing, environmental economics, brand value, and sustainable operations, in their research and teaching. This expertise, combined with Georgia Tech's strong science and technology capabilities, creates an ecosystem with enormous potential for long-term educational, economic, and social impact. Meet our Center-affiliated faculty Sustainable Business Insights: Research Briefs for Practitioners Our Center’s publication series, Sustainable Business Insights, helps academics influence the way business is conducted today. Written with the needs of busy practitioners in mind, the briefs distill high-level research into an easy-to-read format. By highlighting key takeaways, these briefs provide practitioners with an opportunity to understand an academic article’s primary findings and assess how information may relate to their business interests. We highlight research across the Center’s four core themes. Carbon-Conscious Business Series Circular Economy Series How Does Car Sharing Interact With Sustainable Product Design? Although car-sharing has the potential to cannibalize car sales, it can boost auto manufacturers’ profitability. Discover the findings What Are the Environmental Implications of Technology on Recycling? This study can guide the development of more effective recycling programs for producers of consumer products.

Ensure you're in compliance How Can Nonprofit Organizations Maximize Social Impact for Distressed Individuals? Allocating funds to reduce social issues such as domestic abuse or homelessness can have significant economic impacts. Maximizing social impact Discover Our Research Briefs Areas of Sustainability-Related Expertise A sustainable future requires innovations and solutions driven by rigorous, fact-based research. Our Center-affiliated faculty address relevant questions in their research, teaching, and industry engagement. They generate high-impact research that informs the complex challenges and business decisions facing managers, entrepreneurs, and leaders. Our faculty work with businesses to understand these challenges, explore opportunities, and test ideas. We encourage you to connect with the Center to discuss such opportunities. Our areas of sustainability-related expertise include: Business Value, Innovation, & Competitive Advantage Strategies and innovations that promote long-term economic, environmental, and social value Find out more Operations, Supply Chain Management, & the Circular Economy Operations strategies that reduce risk and create value by capitalizing across entire value chains and creating new models Find out more Law, Ethics, & Transparency Strategies and approaches for responsible decision making, reporting, and addressing regulations locally and globally Find out more Business Value, Innovation, & Competitive Advantage Companies increasingly realize sustainability can be a source of advantage in the global market. Those that incorporate sustainability risks and opportunities into their strategic planning and innovations will likely see advantages through a variety of sources, including reduced waste, improved resource efficiency, new markets, and enhanced reputation. The first two sources are quantifiable, but the second two are more difficult to measure. Our faculty are tackling this challenge by studying the question from a variety of perspectives. Operations, Supply Chain Management, & the Circular Economy Over the past decade, the risks and rewards of sustainability have been most apparent in a company's operations. When examining risks, companies should consider sustainability within their operations as well as within their supply chain. Those that don't may face regulatory fines and public relations problems and will likely see competitors who have adopted sustainable operations outpace them on cost and waste reductions. On the reward side, sustainable practices can lead companies to increased efficiencies and new revenue streams via secondary markets for recycled/repurposed products. Our faculty are exploring key questions affecting operations, from basic supply chain issues to developing closed-loop supply chains. Law, Ethics, & Transparency Companies are increasingly considering the role of ethics and human rights in their business models. Beyond the voluntary decisions to make changes, companies also face numerous regulatory requirements that affect the way they do business, in particular new accounting and reporting practices. Our faculty are exploring these and other issues that exist at the intersection of law, ethics, and transparency.
