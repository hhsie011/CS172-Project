U Drive: Central File Storage for Users Shared File Systems Alternatives to traditional file storage UW Google Drive UW Office 365 File Service Comparison Storage Quotas Considerations U Drive: Central File Storage for Users U Drive is a central file storage that provides students, faculty and staff with a place to store files that can be accessed from anywhere, on- and off-campus. U Drive files are available via the network in real time, from any computer on campus, both personal and institutionally owned. Files are automatically backed up and accessible from off campus with a virtual private network like Husky OnNet. Note: This service is not appropriate for storing regulatory-protected data, or sensitive information that may be subject to compliance regulations, such as HIPAA and FERPA. More about U Drive Shared File Systems The following shared file services are provided by or in cooperation with UW-IT. Your department may have its own shared file service. Standard Windows File Service Windows File Service (WFS) provides IT departments scalable and secure file-based storage targeted towards Windows clients. Managed Workstation File Services Managed Workstation Services provides three file service options: Managed Workstation Home Directory, Managed Workstation Shared File Services, and Managed Workstation Windows File Services. Shared File System for Research Archives (lolo) The lolo Archive is a file-based repository for researchers. It is appropriate for data that you rarely access, but for which you want to ensure long-term safekeeping and fast, convenient retrieval. Alternatives to traditional file storage UW Google Drive UW Google Drive is included in UW Google and is designed as a collaborative service for document creation and sharing. Content can be accessed from any device with an internet connection using a web browser or mobile apps.

Storage Quotas A storage quota is the maximum amount of storage space allocated to each computing account on an online storage system. Each system may have different storage quotas and policies, and some systems may allow users to purchase additional storage at an additional charge. More about storage quotas Considerations Be sure to check with your local IT department for their online storage recommendations, policies and guidelines. Some departments may have specific requirements or systems for you to use, or other considerations when choosing an online storage option. You should be certain the online storage system you choose meets the regulatory compliance standards of HIPAA and/or FERPA, if either of those laws apply to the information you are storing. Many collaborative applications like UW SharePoint Online, Microsoft Teams, and Office 365 Groups also include a form of online storage for files.
