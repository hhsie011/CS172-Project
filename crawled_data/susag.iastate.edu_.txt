The program provides advanced training for students and facilitates interdisciplinary research focused on food security, environmental quality, and community development. By emphasizing scientific principles and analytical thinking, the program seeks to prepare students to address challenges to agricultural sustainability in Iowa and other regions of the world. By bringing together faculty from diverse disciplines, the program seeks to promote innovative research that reflects the university's commitment to public service and excellence in scholarship. Message from the chair: The GPSA program is a vibrant community of students, faculty, and staff who share a commitment to maintaining and improving agricultural productivity while working toward an agriculture that is more just and environmentally sound. With 79 faculty from more than 20 departments spanning the Colleges of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Design, Engineering, Human Sciences, and Liberal Arts and Sciences, our students have access to faculty mentors from a vast range of disciplines and perspectives. Our graduates are doing great work in an incredibly diverse array of jobs in academia, government agencies, the private sector, and non-governmental organizations. We hope you’ll join our GPSA community for your graduate studies! — Ajay Nair, Program Chair Recent News Lisa Schulte-Moore named 2021 MacArthur Fellow Sep 30, 2021 Congratulations to Spring 2021 GPSA Graduates!
