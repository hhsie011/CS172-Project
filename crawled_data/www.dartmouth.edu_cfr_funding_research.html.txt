The Foundation Center lists recently posted RFPs in 12 subject areas by funder and submission deadline. Office of Sponsored Projects (https://www.dartmouth.edu/~osp/) Dartmouth's Office of Sponsored Projects is the College's central administrative office for institutional policies, and for communication with faculty, deans, administrators, and governmental and private (corporate and foundation) officials on a variety of sponsored research matters. The Office maintains links to several popular funding identification services - such as ARIS (Academic Research Information System), COS (Community of Science), IRIS (Illinois Researcher Information Service), and SPIN (Sponsored Program Information Service) - each of which includes thousands of funding opportunities in the arts, humanities, medicine, sciences, and social sciences. Community of Science The Community of Science has compiled a database of a Community of Scholars™ who are directly involved in basic or applied research, and associated with universities, federal or private laboratories, or professional societies. Dartmouth is a member institution, so all online COS databases may be accessed free from computers with a Dartmouth College IP address. The COS website permits searchers to: Look for Funding Opportunities (http://fundingopps2.cos.com) by searching more than 15,000 sources of funding from public and private sector sources around the world by keyword, sponsor, and deadlines; updated daily. Identify prospective collaborators and peer reviewers and keep up-to-date with basic science and academic research through COS Expertise (http://expertise.cos.com/), profiling 60,000 researchers at 200 international member universities; updated daily. Identify all active research projects for which funding has been awarded by NIH, NSF, SBIR, USDA, and MRC-UK through the COS Funded Research database (http://fundedresearch.cos.com/ ).
