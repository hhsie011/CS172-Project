The Texas Application for State Financial Aid (TASFA) is a financial aid application for students who are classified as Texas Residents but who cannot apply for federal financial aid using the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) but may qualify for state financial aid through HB 1403 or SB 1528. Students who submit a TASFA and supporting documentation by the state priority submission date of January 15 will receive priority consideration for state and institutional resources at Texas Tech. Important: Eligibility for assistance is contingent upon the availability of state/institutional funds and may be cancelled or reduced in the event funds are no longer available.
