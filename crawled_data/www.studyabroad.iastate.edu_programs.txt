A full listing of Iowa State study abroad programs can be found on ISUAbroad. On your website, you can view programs by location, duration, or international internships.

With study abroad programs in over 50 countries, it can be difficult to decide on just one or two programs. Therefore, we have put together some tips that can help you decide which program to choose. 1. Prioritize Your Wish List What are your most important reasons for studying abroad? For example, do you wish to study in a specific country or city? Or to take courses toward your major and graduation requirements? In many cases, you can find a program that checks all the boxes on your wish list, however, sometimes you will need to focus on your top priorities and miss out on one of the lower ones. 2. Speak with your Academic Advisor If you would like to take courses abroad that will apply to your major, discuss studying abroad with your academic advisor. They may be able to recommend a few programs that have been a good academic fit for previous students. In addition, they might help you identify the best time to study abroad. 3. Program Length Depending on your previous international experience, you may be comfortable with spending a semester or year abroad, however, if you haven’t been abroad previously, you may wish to start with a shorter commitment such as a spring break or summer program. If you enjoy a short-term program, you may be able to study abroad again! 4. Program Type Choosing the right type of program can help you get what you want out of your time abroad. For example, if you really want to immerse yourself in the local culture, you should avoid programs where you take courses and live with only other Americans. Need help choosing a program?
