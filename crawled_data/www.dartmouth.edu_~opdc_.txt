Their work is described below. Campus Planning remains a stand-alone department with responsibilities described in the Planning & Space Management tab. Project Management (PM) Services manages Dartmouth’s construction projects through the full life cycle of project delivery, from conceptual design through construction and building occupancy. Our professionals use a world-class methodology that delivers facilities that enhance the campus and environment in a manner that is consistent with Dartmouth’s mission. The PM Services team works collaboratively with other Campus Services departments—Campus Planning, Facilities Operations & Management, Environmental Health & Safety and Transportation Services—and many other college stakeholders, such as Safety & Security, Information Technology & Consulting, and the Office of Communications. In addition, we partner with neighboring towns and the community to provide project leadership through outreach, permitting and project approvals.
