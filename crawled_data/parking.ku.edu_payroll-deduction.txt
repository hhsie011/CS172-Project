Employees of affiliated corporations with eligibility questions should contact their payroll office. If you check your account and do not see a new parking permit, please contact KU Parking by email. KU Parking sends renewal notices in June. KU employees may be able to cancel or make changes at other times by completing the online form (log in required). Changes to payroll deduction will not be accepted after Stop Day. If you have questions about payroll deduction after this date, please email. If you don’t want to pay for your parking permit through payroll deductions, you can pay online by credit card. To purchase a permit through payroll deduction: Go to the KU Parking portal and click the “University of Kansas” button. Log in using your KU Online ID and password. (Note that the payroll deduction options are in two separate but consecutive pages.) Please note: If you have unpaid tickets, you must pay those first by clicking on “Pay Citation” in the Quick Links box in the KU Parking portal. You will need to know your vehicle(s) license plate number. Check your mail and email addresses carefully during the purchase process. If you aren’t offered the permit for which you believe you qualify, please contact KU Parking. If you are purchasing both car and motorcycle permits, you will have to do this in two separate transactions.
