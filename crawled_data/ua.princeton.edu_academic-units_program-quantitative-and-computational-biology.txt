Program Information The Program in Quantitative and Computational Biology is offered by the Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics and its affiliated departments. It is designed for students with a strong interest in big data and other quantitative approaches to biology. The curriculum introduces students to experimental techniques for acquisition of large-scale quantitative observations of biological systems, and the interpretation of such data in the context of appropriate models. Examples of ongoing research include organizational principles of metabolic networks, quantitative modeling of cell biological processes, the genetic basis of complex behavior, comparative genomics of regulatory networks, quantitative analysis of gene-environment interactions, evolution of gene regulation, and circuitry driving aging. At the core of the curriculum is independent research initiated in the fall of sophomore or junior year, in which students participate in the design, execution, and analysis of experiments in a host laboratory of their choice. The required courses provide a strong background in modern methodologies in data analysis, interpretation, and modeling. A certificate in quantitative and computational biology is awarded to students who successfully complete the program requirements. Admission to the Program Students are admitted to the program after they have chosen a concentration and consulted with the program committee, or the director of the program, in May of their sophomore year. Although students are encouraged to find a lab on their own, the program committee will, if necessary, assist students in selecting a laboratory for their junior independent and senior thesis work. Students must have identified a lab and research project by the first day of their junior year fall semester. Admission requires the completion of prerequisites listed below. Electives are chosen in consultation with the adviser.

Program courses cannot be taken Pass/D/Fail. Applications for program admission must be submitted by June 1st of your sophomore year and should include the following information: prerequisite courses, plans for courses in the junior and senior years, and independent work plans. See QCB Certificate website to apply. Admission decisions are made by June 30. Certificate of Proficiency Students who fulfill the requirements of the program receive a certificate of proficiency in quantitative and computational biology upon graduation. Students who pursue a certificate in quantitative and computational biology may not also receive a certificate in biophysics.

Topics may include data wrangling, exploration and visualization, statistical programming, likelihood based inference, Bayesian inference, bootstrap, EM algorithm, regularization, statistical modeling, principal components analysis, multiple hypothesis testing, and causality. The statistical programming language R will be extensively used to explore methods and analyze data. Instructed by: J. Storey QCB 455 Introduction to Genomics and Computational Molecular Biology (also MOL 455 / COS 455 ) Fall QCR This interdisciplinary course provides a broad overview of computational and experimental approaches to decipher genomes and characterize molecular systems. We focus on methods for analyzing "omics" data, such as genome and protein sequences, gene expression, proteomics and molecular interaction networks. We cover algorithms used in computational biology, key statistical concepts (e.g., basic probability distributions, significance testing, multiple testing correction, performance evaluation), and machine learning methods which have been applied to biological problems (e.g., classification techniques, hidden Markov models, clustering). Instructed by: J. Akey, M. Singh QCB 490 Molecular Mechanisms of Longevity: The Genetics, Genomics, and Cell Biology of Aging (also MOL 490 ) Spring Aging is a fascinating biological phenomenon because it seems inevitable, yet recent research suggests that longevity can be manipulated through genetics and environment. Moreover, aging is the major risk factor for a host of chronic and neurological diseases; thus, understanding the molecular regulation of aging will be critical in addressing these health issues in the future. We will explore the current state of the field, including genetic discoveries of longevity mutants, cell biological and metabolic characterization of aging animals, and genomic and computational analyses used to uncover molecular mechanisms that control longevity.
