Your goBAYLOR account will show you what is needed to complete your application file. You must complete your file by the Admission File deadline to be considered for the Getterman Scholars Program. Submit a completed application for one or more Baylor Honors College programs or majors (Baylor Interdisciplinary Core, Honors Program, Great Texts major, or University Scholars major). Click here to learn more about the Honors College. Note: The Getterman Scholars application requires the email contact information for two references. If the selection committee reaches a point at which it would like additional information about an applicant, the committee will reach out to references for responses to focused questions. Submit the Getterman Scholars Program application through your goBAYLOR account. The application requires completing a written application, and uploading a three-minute video-recorded essay that responds to one of the following prompts: C.S. Lewis invites Christians to ask “how it is right…for creatures who are every moment advancing either to heaven or to hell, to spend any fraction of the little time allowed them in this world on such comparative trivialities as literature or art, mathematics or biology.” Why is this a reasonable, even urgent, question to ask? What Christian reasons are there for a university education? How would Baylor’s Honors College prepare you to address Lewis’s question favorably and confidently, and with what results for your life beyond college? OR Dorothy Sayers said, “Theology is the mistress-science, without which the whole educational structure will necessarily lack its final synthesis.” What does she mean? Why is her view important? Giving concrete examples, how might theology complete and fulfill learning in other disciplines? Why does Sayers’ vision of education matter for the kind of study and preparation that you hope to pursue in Baylor’s Honors College? If selected as a Getterman finalist, you will be required to attend the January Invitation to Excellence program with the Honors College.
