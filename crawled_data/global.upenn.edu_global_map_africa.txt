In 1942, the distinguished linguist Zellig Harris commented that Penn was "the only place in the country where serious teaching of African studies [was] available." In the 1980s, Penn entered into a comprehensive partnership with Nigeria’s Ibadan University, becoming one of the only American universities of the era to establish a student exchange program in Africa. In 1983, Penn’s Wharton School brought together US and African academic, business, and government figures to discuss private sector development in Africa, the first known conference on this issue. Today, Penn offers 12 African languages and a broad selection of study and internship placements across the region, and Penn faculty are involved in research projects that span several disciplines. The numbers of Penn students studying in Africa and African students studying at Penn have steadily increased over the last several years, and these trends show no sign of slowing down.

Indlela, which means “the way” or “the path” in Zulu, is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to the University of Pennsylvania’s Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics (CHIBE), and is based at the University of Witwatersrand’s Health Economics and Epidemiology Research Office (HE2RO). Launched in January 2020, the focus of Indlela is to expand the use of behavioral economics within HIV prevention and treatment programs in South Africa. Specifically, Indlela seeks to strengthen the ability of health service delivery providers and key research institutions to develop and test contextually appropriate interventions that are informed by behavioral science principles. In future years, the unit’s scope will expand beyond HIV to include other pressing public health issues in South Africa. Updated November 2020 Harsha Thirumurthy Bio Research Measuring Effectiveness of Early Childhood Education Sharon Wolf Education Engagement Type Research Country in Focus Uganda Penn School Graduate School of Education Professor Wolf, who previously studied community health and education in Uganda following her undergraduate degree, is currently bringing her expertise to bear on measuring the effectiveness of early childhood educational programs in the country.

Professor Decherney, an award-winning filmmaker whose previous works include a virtual reality documentary about a Kenyan refugee settlement, has recently completed a documentary called Dreaming of Jerusalem on the Jewish community in Gondar, Ethiopia. Updated November 2020 Peter Decherney Bio Documentary Teaser Research The Effects of Refugee Settlements on Local Development and Voting Guy Grossman Political Science Engagement Type Research Country in Focus Uganda Penn School Arts and Sciences Professor Grossman of the Penn School of Arts & Sciences is leading a project that examines whether exposure to refugee communities in Uganda, Africa’s leading country in refugee-hosting rates, increases access to aid and improves public service delivery for nearby host communities; and if so, whether this increased access to aid and public service delivery affect voting behaviors/electoral outcomes in refugees’ hosting communities. His project’s findings will contribute to the ongoing international debate regarding the political implications of refugee policies. Updated November 2020 Guy Grossman Bio Partnership Partnership with Princess Marina Hospital on Autopsy Techniques Alexander Macnow Pathology Engagement Type Partnership Country in Focus Botswana Penn School Perelman School of Medicine The Botswana-UPenn Partnership works with the Government of Botswana Ministry of Health and the University of Botswana to build healthcare and research capacity in Botswana. As part of Penn’s ongoing Botswana-University of Pennsylvania partnership, in a collaboration led by Penn Medicine's Dr. Kumarasen Cooper, Alexander Macnow taught autopsy techniques to residents in pathology in Princess Marina Hospital. Through this training, Botswana’s residents in pathology will be better equipped to perform post-mortem examination, identify and analyze causes of death, and become certified as practicing pathologists, which in turn may help prevent future deaths by similar causes through public health outreach.
