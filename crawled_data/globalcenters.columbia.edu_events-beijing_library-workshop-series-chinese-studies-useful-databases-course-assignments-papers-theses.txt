Starr East Asian Library and Columbia Global Centers | Beijing are pleased to invite Columbia students in the Greater China Area and other parts of Asia to attend a series of workshops that provides you with the basic and advanced library resources, tools, and methods to help fulfill your remote learning and research. Join us on Friday, March 5 for our second event of the series, titled "Chinese Studies: Useful Databases for Course Assignments, Papers, and Theses". This event opens to Columbia students only. Please sign up with your Columbia email. Introduction Given that most Chinese/Asian students cannot come to the Morningside Heights campus due to the COVID-19 pandemic and they have increasing needs for various types of library support, this series of workshops is expected to enhance the library’s engagement with the off-campus students and help strengthen the Chinese/Asian students’ affinity with the University. Students will also learn about the University's partner libraries of Chinese academic organizations, including Peking University, Tsinghua University, Fudan University, Zhejiang University, and China Academy of Social Science, where they may find further assistance and resources. Lasting approximately one hour with a 15-minute Q&A, each workshop will unlock essential library skills and resources students need to succeed in their courses. Stay tuned for what's coming up!
