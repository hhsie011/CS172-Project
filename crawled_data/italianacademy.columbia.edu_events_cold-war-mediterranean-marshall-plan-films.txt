The Marshall Plan films were a unique facet of U.S. propaganda efforts in post-war Europe. These two evenings of programming - a selection of Marshall Plan films plus major fiction films from the late 1940s - show the contrast between two visions of postwar reconstruction: the picture presented by one aspect of U.S. propaganda, and the vision of Hollywood (and of Anti-Hollywood).
