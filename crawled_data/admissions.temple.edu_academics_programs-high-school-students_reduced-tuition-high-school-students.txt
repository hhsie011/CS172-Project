We’re committed to offering flexible academic offerings so all students have the opportunity to get ahead in the classroom or try university-level courses as part of the college search process. Current high school students, students who are taking a gap year between high school and college, and recent high school graduates who have been admitted to Temple may be permitted to take online courses at a reduced cost. When you register for a fall, spring or summer course, you’ll pay half the tuition. For example, a three-credit course typically costs $1,950, so you would pay $975. Students who are currently in high school or taking a gap year may take one course per term at the reduced tuition rate. Admitted students may take one Summer I and Summer II course at the reduced tuition rate. Why enroll in a course at Temple? As a high school student, you can take a course to help you prepare for the transition to university-level coursework, save time by getting a head start on earning academic credits, explore fields of study that interest you before you start your first semester, have the flexibility to take courses online and save on tuition.
