Graduate Programs Current: Entomology (MS, PhD) Entomology (MS, PhD) The Entomology (ENT) Program offers M.S. and Ph.D. programs. Either option requires the completion of a research thesis (M.S.) or dissertation (Ph.D.) Students earning a graduate degree in Entomology will be prepared for careers in academia, industry, and extension. A successful graduate will demonstrate expertise in arthropod identification, ecology, physiology, and biodiversity, as well as modern methods of pest management. Specialization & Research Emphasis Areas of specialization within entomology are aligned with those of the major advisor (advisory committee chair). The most common areas of specialization include research topics in: integrated pest management arthropod biodiversity urban entomology insect physiology Admission Requirements (in addition to Graduate School requirements) A Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is required. There is no minimum score requirement, but scores exceeding 150 for verbal and quantitative components, and 4.0 on the analytical writing portion, are typical for successful applicants. For students from countries where English is not the official language, TOEFL or IELTS scores must be reported; TOEFL scores should generally exceed 90 (combined) IELTS scores should generally exceed 7.0. Ordinarily, a Master's Degree with a thesis requirement is expected of students applying to the Ph.D. program. Students who wish to transit directly to a Ph.D. degree Program from a B.S. or B.A. must demonstrate competence in independent research and exceptional academic ability. Strong letters of recommendation from at least two referees familiar with the applicant's academic history. Other expectations: A Grade Point Average (GPA) of at least 3.00 (on a 4.00 scale) or its equivalent in undergraduate coursework during the last two (2) years of continuous enrollment or the last 60 credit hours of discontinuous enrollment (M.S. degree candidates), or a GPA of at least 3.00 or its equivalent in graduate coursework. In nearly all cases, an applicant should have identified and contacted a prospective major advisor from among the Entomology faculty, whose areas of specialization closely correspond to the applicant’s goals, and who should have established some plan for funding the student’s tuition and research work. Some of the above expectations may be offset by other evidence of accomplishments, such as high-quality publications or other evidence of involvement in entomological research; or by strong recommendations by one or more Entomology Graduate Program faculty with whom the student would work. All applicants are strongly urged to visit Clemson University and meet the Entomology Graduate Program's faculty, staff, and students. Requirements for Degree MS – A minimum of twenty-three (23) semester hours of graduate credit (exclusive of thesis research) and seven (7) semester hours of thesis research (ENT 8910) are required. At least one-half of the total graduate credit hours (exclusive of research credits) required by the advisory committee must be selected from courses numbered at the 8000 level or above. Ph.D. – The Graduate School requires that Ph.D. students receive ≥30 hours of coursework beyond the M.S. degree (if previously awarded), or ≥ 60 hours beyond that of the B.S./B.A., if the student has not previously obtained an M.S. Doctoral degree advisory committees are encouraged to require courses other than those that directly support the dissertation research. Twenty-six (26) or more hours of doctoral research (ENT 9910) are required, along with Entomology Graduate Program Core Courses and any other requirements established by the student's Advisory Committee. Please reference the complete Entomology Graduate Student Handbook for the full degree requirements. Financial Information No Program-specific Fees apply to the Entomology Graduate Program. The most common mechanism of support is a Graduate Research Assistantship (GRA). Interested students are encouraged to contact prospective advisors regarding GRA availability and eligibility. These assistantships are awarded on a competitive basis directly by the Principal Investigator of each research project. Graduate Teaching Assistantships (GTA) are sometimes available but are much less common than GRAs. Some students may have the opportunity to combine GRA and GTA support. A few recruitment fellowships and other merit-based scholarships are also available to be awarded on a competitive basis. Prospective advisors should inform interested students of these opportunities as appropriate.
