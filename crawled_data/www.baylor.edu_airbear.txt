Baylor ITS is committed to providing AirBear coverage in classrooms and multi-use rooms (i.e., conference rooms, labs), as well as many common areas like lounges and foyers (i.e. the BSB Atrium) on the Waco and Dallas Nursing campus locations. AirBear extends to some outdoor locations and it is expected that expansion will continue. Traditionally, the AirBear wireless network was not intended for office use although it could often be detected in offices due to the close proximity of a classroom or common area with coverage. In recent years, through new construction and major renovations, AirBear has been added to many office areas. However, the office wired connections continue to provide better reliability and security. AirBear Basic Setup To connect to the AirBear wireless network on your device, simply select the AIRBEAR WPA2 network from among the available wireless options, and log in using your Bear ID and password. If this is your first time connecting your device to AirBear, you must accept the certificate for the server that manages authentication to the AirBear network.
