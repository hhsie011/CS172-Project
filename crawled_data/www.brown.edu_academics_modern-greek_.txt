Its aim is to present modern Greek civilization in the context of European history and culture, and more generally that of the modern world. The program aims to integrate Greek culture into several subject areas and make it accessible to students of diverse backgrounds and interests. This goal is furthered by a comparative perspective, that characterizes many of the program's courses, and by interdisciplinary lectures and symposia, which promote a more profound understanding of Greek culture. Courses in modern Greek language were first offered in the early 1970s at Brown. In its present form, the program was launched in 1995 through a generous bequest from the estate of Mrs. Ethel Goltsos, a prominent Greek-American from Rhode Island. This bequest, with the additional support of a number of Brown donors, led to the establishment of an endowment for instruction in Modern Greek subject areas. In 2002, the Goltsos Lectureship in Modern Greek language was officially created. Instruction in anthropology, history, and literature is offered in the relevant departments. In 2016, the Modern Greek Studies program at Brown received generous support from the Stavros S Niarchos Foundation USA, for a position in Modern Greek literature.
