We create and promote positive interactions to contribute to the multicultural education of all students and to the social/cultural development of leaders. A3Câ€™s efforts are guided by our four pillars: advocacy, education, identity and community-building. We strive to be an affirming and responsive space that enhances sense of belonging. All are welcome and encouraged to get involved and engage in our programs. Advocacy Serve as an advocate for students. Advise on matters that impact the community and offer guidance on specific issues as they arise. Community Connect and collaborate with students, staff, faculty, and members of the Ithaca community to create a space that serves as a second home for Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA) students. Education Provide resources and conduct educational workshops and trainings for the campus. Identity Foster space for students to explore their multiple and intersecting identities.
