Transfer guidelines for special admission & appeal The transfer GPA In calculating the transfer GPA, the Office of Admission uses: All transferable academic courses from all regionally accredited colleges a student has attended in which the student has received grades between 0.0 and 4.0 on a 4.0 grading scale. Although the UW uses a decimal scale for grading students in its own courses, transfer grades are not converted to a uniform decimal scale. Instead, Admissions uses the grade assignments of the home institution, whether 3.3 or 3.5 for “B+,” for example Repeated courses: The transfer GPA is calculated using the repeat policy of the home institution. All transferable academic credit from regionally accredited colleges, even if the student has earned more than 90 transferable credits from two-year colleges. Admissions does not include in the transfer GPA: Courses considered by the UW to be below college level Math courses equivalent to MATH 098 (formerly 101, Intermediate Algebra) Certain religion courses that teach from a particular doctrinal perspective or that teach preparation for ministry Developmental or remedial courses Courses in study skills Lower-division military science courses English as a Second Language Vocational/technical courses Courses recorded with a grade of “incomplete” (unless changed to “F” at the home institution) Courses recorded with a grade of “pass” or “satisfactory” PE activity credits in excess of three quarter credits The transfer GPA and admission to majors The transfer GPA is used only for determining admissibility to the UW. Some undergraduate programs at the UW, such as business administration or engineering, have selective admission policies. When they review transcripts, they may calculate the GPA differently; for example, some departments use only courses in the major field or the GPA earned in the last 45 credits.
