Current faculty, staff, and students are able to ride any RIPTA bus or trolley anytime, anywhere in the state at no charge. Brown’s investment in the UPASS program is the latest effort in one of many transportation initiatives benefiting its employees, students, and the broader community. Individuals with a Brown Visitor ID are not eligible for the RIPTA UPASS program. How it Works Swipe your Brown ID through RIPTA's new fareboxes and take a seat – it's that easy! Rides will be electronically counted and RIPTA will bill the University monthly. The University will review monthly statistics to ensure that only current, valid IDs are in use. IDs that are cancelled, lost, stolen, or obsolete will be reported to RIPTA and will not work with the new fareboxes. IDs are for use on RIPTA only by the person pictured on the ID. Sharing your ID for RIPTA use is strictly prohibited and may result in your card being confiscated by the RIPTA driver. RIPTA Contact Information The RIPTA information number is 401-781-9400. Additional RIPTA information can be found on the RIPTA website or by contacting RIPTA's Commuter Resource RI “Commute Advisors” at 1-888-887-4782. Ask Your Auto Insurer!
