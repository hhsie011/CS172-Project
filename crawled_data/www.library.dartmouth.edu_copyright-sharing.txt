As you do your teaching and research remotely, it might be helpful to keep in mind: According to Dartmouth’s intellectual property (IP) policy, rights in works of authorship (including teaching materials) are generally retained by the faculty members or other academic staff members who create them; Dartmouth does not claim rights of ownership in teaching materials, including when faculty are teaching remotely, except in very narrow circumstances as outlined in the IP policy. The current situation is also an opportunity to share knowledge more widely and to use openly available resources. Faculty members and other academic staff can use open educational resources already created by others, and they can indicate how they would like others to use their materials by employing licensing tools such as Creative Commons. Because the materials made available for Remote Learning can be copied and distributed more easily, it may be necessary for privacy-related or other reasons for faculty members to consider how they make materials available or how to discuss sensitive topics. More information is available on good practices for designing remote teaching sites and discussions. The Scholarly Communication, Copyright and Publishing program at Dartmouth Library is always here to help faculty, students, and staff to share their scholarship with the wider community and to use the work of others in their teaching and research. For further help or consultation on your individual situation, please contact: dartmouthdigitalcommons@groups.dartmouth.edu Copyright Copyright is the legal system that regulates how creative work can be shared. As you consider what materials to use in your courses, there are several resources that can help you to navigate how you can legally utilize the work of others in your teaching and how you can protect your teaching materials: Harvard Copyright and Fair Use guide Fair Use and COVID-19 Dartmouth copyright policy Sharing Your Work With Others If you would like to make your own research more available for use by others, there are several tools that can help you to share your work and to help others understand how you would like your work to be used. Dartmouth Digital Commons (DDC) a platform for sharing scholarly, research, and educational outputs created by the faculty, staff, and students of Dartmouth. Conference cancelled? Put your paper, poster, or slides in DDC to make them publicly available. Dartmouth Author Rights Guide: Information on your rights and how to use them. Creative Commons: An easy to use tool that helps others to understand how they can use your work. Using the Work of Others in Your Teaching and Research These tools can help you quickly and easily find scholarly articles for use in your courses and teaching. These materials are freely licensed or available through the Dartmouth libraries. Open educational resources (OERs) Online materials that are licensed so that anyone can use them for free, with no institutional login required. Often, you can change and adapt them to suit your needs. For more information and for search tools, see the library’s guide to open educational resources. National Emergency Library: The Internet Archive has provided temporary access to over one million books during the COVID-19 pandemic Unpaywall: A database of openly available scholarly articles Open Access Button: Free, legal research articles delivered instantly or automatically requested from authors.
