The Pulitzer Prize-winning author of more than a dozen books, including the novels The Trace and As a Friend, now translated into half a dozen languages, Gander writes across the genres. His collection Be With won the 2019 Pulitzer Prize; Core Samples from the World (a National Book Critics Circle and 2012 Pulitzer Prize finalist), is concerned with the way identity is translated by encounters with the foreign. The editor of several anthologies of poetry from Spain and Latin America, Gander is also a well known translator: Spectacle & Pigsty by Kiwao Nomura won the 2012 Best Translated Book Award. In a collection of essays, A Faithful Existence, Gander explores evolution, literary hoaxes, snapping turtles, and border crossings. He is a United States Artists Rockefeller Fellow and recipient of fellowships from the Library of Congress, the Guggenheim, Howard, and Whiting Foundations.

Full Text Research Research Overview I write fiction, poetry, essays and other works not readily characterized within genre boundaries, and I translate (mostly Hispanic) literature. In all these activities, I am concerned with ethical questions: what kind of experience and relationship does language articulate, what account of the suffering and joy of others does imagination avail, what qualities of expression, thought, and feeling can be translated from one culture and language to another? Research Statement I have a background in geology and am alarmed enough by the current state of the world to be focused on environmental politics. I'm interested in an ecological literature in which events are structured as collaborations between the world and the self and related not only at the level of reference, but through syntax, diction, and rhythms. Core Samples from the World is a book length meditation on what it means to be a foreigner, what it means to be "at home." In my book of poems, Eye Against Eye, intimacy and intervention are prevailing themes. What is involved in the construction of a circumscribed world at the personal or national level and what forces impinge upon it? The social pull to be a part of something and the individual need to be apart force us to make decisions, including ones concerned with the way language is used, that have profound ethical implications.
