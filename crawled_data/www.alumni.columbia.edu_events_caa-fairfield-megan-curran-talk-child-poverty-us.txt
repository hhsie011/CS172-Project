Key areas of insight from Megan's talk will include: Understanding what child poverty in the US looks like, historically and today How the pandemic—and pandemic-era economic relief efforts—have impacted children and families Learn about the new Child Tax Credit expansion, how it has helped families, and the future of this policy change Compare how other countries support children, who gives the most generous cash payments, and how the new US Child Tax Credit compares The talk will conclude with a Q&A session.
