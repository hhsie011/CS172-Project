Physics serves as the underpinning of many different disciplines including the other natural sciences and technological areas. Graduates are proficient in the methods of rigorous scientific analysis, relevant mathematical techniques, and modern computational and laboratory methods. They have a broad knowledge of physics, including mechanics, electricity and magnetism, thermodynamics, and modern physics. They are able to communicate clearly and effectively at general and technical levels. They are prepared to pursue a wide range of careers as a professional physicist, astronomer, or science educator. They are also prepared to pursue advanced studies and careers in areas as diverse as engineering, medicine, law, and business administration. Many opportunities exist for students who terminate their studies with a bachelor’s degree, especially when combined with technology studies in other areas. Students who meet the necessary scholastic standards often continue their studies in a graduate college, exploring and contributing to new developments in the field. Faculty have approved a variety of completion pathways for the physics major for students who wish to establish a clear strength in a field of application of physics, such as computer science, science education, mechanical engineering, or even science writing. These pathways make double majors more feasible and are appropriate for students planning to enter the job market with their Bachelor’s degree. Student Learning Outcomes The expected outcomes for students in the program are: a broad knowledge of physics, including mechanics, electricity and magnetism, thermodynamics, wave motion and modern physics proficiency in laboratory methods proficiency in modern scientific computational methods a sound foundation in the liberal arts including proficiency in communication skills.

These pathways make double majors more feasible and are appropriate for students planning to enter the job market with their Bachelor’s degree. Further information concerning programs of study, including sample degree programs, is available from the department. All physics majors are encouraged to take LAS 203 Professional Career Preparation and STAT 341 Introduction to the Theory of Probability and Statistics I. Students intending to pursue graduate study in physics or astronomy/astrophysics should complete the advanced coursework listed and should choose the option PHYS 481 Quantum Mechanics II from the list above. Physics majors often supplement their program by completing a minor in astronomy. In addition to meeting the requirements of the major, students in Physics meet the university-wide Communication Proficiency Grade Requirement, by earning credit for ENGL 150, a grade of C or better in ENGL 250 (or ENGL 250H) and a grade of C- or better in ENGL 302, ENGL 305, ENGL 309 or ENGL 314. Students are also encouraged to study at least one world language. As majors in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Physics students must meet College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and University-wide requirements for graduation in addition to those stated above for the major. Students in all ISU majors must complete a three-credit course in U.S. diversity and a three-credit course in international perspectives. Check (http://www.registrar.iastate.edu/courses/div-ip-guide.html) for a list of approved courses. Discuss with your advisor how the two courses that you select can be applied to your graduation plan. LAS majors require a minimum of 120 credits, including a minimum of 45 credits at the 300/400 level. You must also complete the LAS world language requirement.

Graduate Study The department offers studies for the degrees master of science and doctor of philosophy with majors at both levels in astrophysics, condensed matter physics, high energy physics, nuclear physics, and physics; and minor credit courses for students majoring in other departments. Facilities of various research groups of the department and the Ames Laboratory are available for research. Students with bachelor’s degrees in physics or astronomy from other institutions ordinarily will qualify for graduate study at Iowa State University provided they have satisfactorily completed course work similar to that suggested for undergraduate majors here intending to go on to graduate school. In some cases, additional instruction at the intermediate level may be required. Graduates have a broad understanding of physical science, as well as mastery of state-of-the-art methods in their area of specialization. They are able to communicate effectively to a wide range of audiences, from the general public to research colleagues. Their skills in rigorous scientific thinking prepare them for leadership in the broader community. They are skilled in carrying out research, communicating research results, and soliciting research support. They have considerable teaching experience. They have developed problem solving skills that prepare them for careers in either industry or academia. All candidates for an advanced degree in physics are expected to complete: PHYS 531 Statistical Mechanics 3 PHYS 564 Advanced Classical Mechanics 3 PHYS 571 Electricity and Magnetism I 3 PHYS 572 Electricity and Magnetism II 3 PHYS 591 Quantum Physics I 4 PHYS 592 Quantum Physics II 4 Candidates for an advanced degree in astrophysics should complete: PHYS 531 Statistical Mechanics 3 or PHYS 564 Advanced Classical Mechanics PHYS 571 Electricity and Magnetism I 3 PHYS 591 Quantum Physics I 4 ASTRO 505 Astrophysical Cosmology 3 ASTRO 510 Observational Astrophysics 3 Astrophysics Ph.D. candidates must take at least three of the 580 level Astro courses, while candidates for the Research Masters must take at least two 580 level Astro courses. A thesis is always required for all Ph.D. majors. The degree master of science is offered both with and without thesis.

Students choosing a M.S. degree with thesis may apply up to 8 credits of 699 but no credits of 599 toward the minimum 30 credits. Students choosing a degree without thesis should apply 2 credits of 599, but may not apply any credits of 699, toward the minimum 30 credits. In addition to course work in the major area of study, all candidates for the Ph.D. degree must complete 9 credits of graduate course work outside this area including at least one 500 or 600 level introductory course in another area of physics. Each candidate for the Ph.D. degree is required to teach one year of elementary physics or astronomy. Graduate students interested in a physics minor should contact the department for requirements.
