The undergraduate programs include courses ranging from elementary language to advanced seminars in French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese culture for majors and other interested students. The graduate programs (French, Italian, and Hispanic Studies) address the cultural production of France, Italy, Spain, and Latin America and of other areas in which these countries have had an impact historically. In small seminars, graduate students study these cultural manifestations from a variety of critical perspectives and disciplines, such as cultural studies, postcolonial theory and philosophy. The Department's excellent placement record attests to its commitment to the professional as well as to the intellectual formation of its graduate students.
