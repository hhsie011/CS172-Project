As a result of these priorities, the university has developed an Emergency Management Plan which addresses the key objectives of responding to emergency conditions and managing the processes of restoring academic and research programs and services. In order to implement the plan to its fullest, the university is committed to training its employees to effectively respond to an emergency and developing that training with exercises and drills designed to assess response capabilities and adequacy of policies, plans, procedures and protocols. The Emergency Management Plan is available in KU's Policy Library. Continuity of Operations Planning The University of Kansas participates in a state-wide comprehensive project for the purpose of developing Continuity of Operations Plans (COOP). A web-based continuity planning system is used to assist government organizations in the COOP development process. The system guides users through each step of the continuity planning process and helps develop a plan that outlines the roles and responsibilities required to ensure an organizations ability to transition and continue its operations during times of disruption. The system has been customized to meet the specific COOP planning needs of the State of Kansas, and access is provided to individuals and units by request. Special Event Planning Not every planned event runs as scheduled. To ensure the safety of our students, employees and visitors, all members of the community have the responsibility to protect and minimize the effects of an emergency incident at a planned special event. Event organizers are encouraged to review the Special Event Emergency Planning Guide form (pdf) during their planning process. When Planning an Event Develop an emergency plan for the event. Download the Special Event Planning Guide form (pdf). Designate a point of contact for first responders or public safety officials. Notify the Office of Public Safety of your event by sending your Special Event Plan to pso_em@ku.edu. At least one person on the event-management team should be able to receive KU text notification alerts. If an alert is issued, tell attendees exactly what the message says and follow the directions provided. Conduct a pre-event briefing with managers, ushers, volunteers and other event staff. Review details of the venue, including entrances and exits, number of people attending and specific information about the audience/attendees. Review policies and procedures on unacceptable behavior. Monitor the weather. If inclement weather is expected, designate someone to monitor it. Know how to communicate with each other and attendees if a severe weather warning is issued. For assistance with weather monitoring, contact KU Emergency Management at 785-864-5900 or the National Weather Service-Topeka Office at 785-234-2592. Determine who may need assistance evacuating or sheltering in place. Review details on evacuation, shelter-in-place and emergency communication plans. Review details on medical procedures.
