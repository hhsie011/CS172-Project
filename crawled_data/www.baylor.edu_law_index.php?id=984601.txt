I chose Baylor Law because I always loved the Baylor spirit and was excited for the chance to be a part of it. Baylor Law has a reputation for creating great, professional, and honest lawyers, and I wanted to be in this community What is your favorite thing about Baylor Law? My favorite thing about Baylor Law is the people. The people in my class are so down to earth, helpful, and supportive. It makes school so much better when you are learning with people willing to encourage you and relate to you in difficult times. Additionally, all of the professors and staff are so genuine in wanting you to succeed, and you can see their hearts are invested in the students. What advice would you give to someone thinking about law school? In law school, the work is hard and it's a lot. But the material you're learning and its capacity to help people, along with the people you meet, is so rewarding. Time management is your friend. Making a schedule that allows sufficient time for all your schoolwork and time to relax and do something else you enjoy is possible and one of the keys to success. Additionally, if you're feeling stressed and discouraged, don't be afraid to lean on your classmates and professors, because everyone is going through the same thing and doing it together makes it more fun and gives you different perspectives.
