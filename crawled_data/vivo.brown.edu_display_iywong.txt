Physically, he explores how materials and mechanical aspects of the tumor microenvironment regulate malignant behavior. Biologically, he seeks new insights into single cell heterogeneity and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This approach will have translational applications, enabling personalized medicine and high-throughput screening of new therapeutic compounds.
