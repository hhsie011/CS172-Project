Brown’s newest program in environmental engineering also applied for and received accreditation. The ABET visit team, made up of leading academics from across the country, engaged with faculty and school leadership to thoroughly examine and evaluate these undergraduate degree programs. The ABET review culminated in virtual visits last fall and subsequently a final report issued this summer. “The review provided us with useful feedback on our undergraduate programs, which we are continually seeking to improve,” said Sorensen Family Dean Larry Larson, “and the renewed accreditation is an acknowledgement of the high standards and quality of our programs.” The external ABET evaluation team examined all aspects of the curricula, student outcomes and feedback from alumni and students. Planning for the review was led by Professor Alexander Zaslavsky and Associate Dean Jennifer Casasanto with assistance from several faculty, including Rod Beresford, Allan Bower, Clyde Briant, Pedro Felzenszwalb, Pradeep Guduru, Bob Hurt, Kurt Pennell, and Anita Shukla. Several staff members and students also worked on the preparation of the materials for the review.
