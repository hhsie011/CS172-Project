The Institute of Classical Archaeology (ICA) carries out multi-disciplinary archaeological research projects in the agricultural hinterlands of ancient Greek colonies in southern Italy and on the Black Sea coast of Ukraine. ICA was established as a research unit in the College of Liberal Arts at the University of Texas, Austin, in 1978. Since its first excavation project in 1974, with support from public and private sources, ICA has developed long-term projects to explore the rural populations of Metaponto and Croton in Italy and of Chersonesos in Crimea, Ukraine. Principal collaborators include the Archaeological Superintendencies of Calabria and Basilicata and the National Preserve of Tauric Chersonesos at Sevastopol. ICA's research and publications have brought it international recognition as a leader in the study of the ancient countryside in the Greek and Roman world.
