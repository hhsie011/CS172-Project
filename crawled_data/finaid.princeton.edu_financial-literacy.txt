More than ever, a basic understanding of finances is an important part of life. As our financial environments shift and you are presented with many spending, banking, and credit options, it will be important to make informed decisions. We encourage you to visit the Financial Literacy Initiative website for the most up-to-date programming and financial resources, including including links to various resources, tips, and recordings of previous workshops. Budgeting A budget is how you plan to use your money. By tracking your income and expenses, you can create a simple spending and savings plan. Credit Credit is your standing as a borrower and is typically represented by a numerical credit score. Good borrowing habits can increase this measure and improve your ability to borrow under favorable terms. Taxes Are you required to file a tax return? Do you know how much income you had this year? A basic understanding of the tax code will help you in your financial planning.
