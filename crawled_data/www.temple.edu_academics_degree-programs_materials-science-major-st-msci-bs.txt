You'll develop an understanding of the far-reaching capabilities of material science in this 123-credit undergraduate degree program. It allows you to bridge the divide to applied sciences through innovation and technology applications as well as explore both laboratory work and theoretical and computational research. The Materials Science Major curriculum focuses on the underlying scientific principles behind materials science and the ways in which it is distinct from an engineering focus on materials. The frontiers of the subject now require understanding of artificial intelligence and/or machine learning methodologies as well as quantum information science and quantum materials. The expansion of the material science field and the need for innovative materials drive many markets, creating a significant demand for well-trained graduates in materials sciences at all levels. Materials science is an important driver of advanced research and new knowledge, reaching across discipline within science and technology. As a graduate of the Bachelor of Science in Materials Science program, you will be well-prepared for employment or graduate studies. Graduates of the Materials Science BS program will also be prepared to apply knowledge of contemporary issues in materials science, applications and society; apply knowledge of mathematics and science to materials issues; communicate effectively; contribute to team efforts to design materials for specific applications; design and conduct experiments to critically analyze and interpret data; identify, formulate and solve challenges in materials design; integrate understanding of the structure, properties and performance of materials systems; use modern techniques, skills and experimental tools appropriate for materials research; and work effectively in multidisciplinary teams and provide leadership to such teams. Classes & Curriculum The Materials Science BS curriculum includes 123 credit hours of foundational courses in chemistry, computer science, mathematics and physics; significant laboratory courses; and theoretical, computational or laboratory research. Students may take up to eight semesters to complete this bachelor's program. Classes you are likely to take as part of the Bachelor of Science in Materials Science curriculum include the following.
