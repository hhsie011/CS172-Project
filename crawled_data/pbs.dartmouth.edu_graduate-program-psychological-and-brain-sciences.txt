Research within the department is focused on several areas, including systems and behavioral neuroscience, cognitive and computational neuroscience, and social and affective neuroscience. Students conduct research in a state-of-the-art facility that includes extensive laboratory space and a research-dedicated MRI machine. Students benefit from the strength of our faculty's research programs as well as their close ties with several other departments and programs, including the Dartmouth Medical School. The size of the department helps to foster a personable community with plenty of opportunities for communication and collaboration between different lab groups, facilitating innovative and interdisciplinary work. Annual stipends are provided to all PhD students in good standing and students are not charged tuition or fees. The annual stipend for the 2021-2022 year is $31,560. Graduates of the program have been very successful in obtaining academic positions, and the most recent National Research Council survey (2010) found our program ranked 2nd in the country in placing students in academic programs. We recognize that BIPOC and other underserved groups continue to face particular barriers in accessing graduate training in psychology and neuroscience. We believe that our disciplines benefit from, and have a responsibility to enable, the inclusion of the full spectrum of backgrounds and perspectives, including, but not limited to, representation of gender, race and ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, academic background and experience, and socioeconomic status. To facilitate this, the program does not charge an application fee, does not require the GRE, and has a number of mentoring and community initiatives in place to promote individual well-being and mutual support. For more information, please see the mentoring, diversity and inclusion, and admissions FAQs page, as well as the Innovators in Cognitive Neuroscience seminar series, which bridges scientific and social justice objectives.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences Undergraduate Overview Psychology Major Minor Major & Minor FAQs Honors Honors FAQs Neuroscience Major Minor Major & Minor FAQs Honors Honors FAQs Curriculum Transfer and AP Credit Courses and Syllabi Introductory Intermediate Topics Labs Independent Research Course Syllabi (ID login required) Permission Courses Request Form Fall 2022 Winter 2023 Spring 2023 Resources Graduate Graduate Program in Psychological and Brain Sciences Research Areas Coursework and Curriculum Mentoring Toolkit Resources Current Graduate Students Graduate Admissions Admissions FAQs Our Graduates Recent Dissertations Research Overview Recent Research Findings Facilities Undergraduate Research Post-Doctoral Fellows Post-Doctoral Opportunities Participate in Experiments 2021 Honors Student Thesis Presentations (ID Login Required) 2022 Honors Student Thesis Presentations (ID Login Required) Community Diversity Suggestions For Current PBS Community (ID Login Required) News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
