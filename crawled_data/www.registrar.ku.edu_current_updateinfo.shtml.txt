The preferred name will be sent to Blackboard* and will be listed on class and grade rosters, among other processes. Log onto Enroll and Pay and select the Personal Details Tile.

If you are a student and an employee you will also need to update your employee preferred name by contacting Human Resources.

Students must provide identification using a state issued identification card, Social Security card, Drivers License, Military ID, Marriage License, Divorce Decree or Passport.
