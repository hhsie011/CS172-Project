Service-Learning Co-ops are available year-round and can be full-time, part-time or project-based. Positions are funded by the University of Cincinnati at no cost to the nonprofit organization. Eligibility Service-Learning Co-op is open to University of Cincinnati undergraduate students in any major outside formal co-op majors. Service-Learning Co-ops are a great opportunity for students who are: Interested in social change and addressing pressing social issues Seeking a flexible job: work full-time (35+ hours a week), part-time (5-20 hours a week), or project specific (up to 80 hours per term) Interested in a variety of roles: Because nonprofits tend to work with a lean staff, you may find yourself wearing lots of hats, from marketing, fundraising, social media, event planning and communications to IT and operations management. Learning While Earning You are required to complete an online professional development course during your Service-Learning Co-op. By taking the course, you'll develop a professional understanding of Servant Leadership and civic engagement while refining your career goals. Benefits Make a difference: Service-Learning is your chance to connect with a nonprofit and make a personal impact on our world. Develop life-long skills: You'll develop skills related to your major and transferable skills that apply to any field or industry. Try something new: The flexibility of Service-Learning Co-op allows you to test a variety of career options. Earn income to help pay for college tuition, books, meals or transportation. Note: Student wages are subsidized through grants coordinated through the University of Cincinnati, and some restrictions may apply.
