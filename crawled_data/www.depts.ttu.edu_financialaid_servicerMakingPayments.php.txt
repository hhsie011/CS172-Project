A servicer is the agency or organization responsible for billing, collection and management of loan repayment, and deferment/forbearance processing. You will send loan payments directly to your servicer(s). Your servicer(s) will contact you to provide important information about your repayment terms. It is your responsibility to notify your servicer(s) directly any time your phone number, email address, or mailing address information changes. Your servicer(s) will send you information about your loans by mail and/or email - Be sure to open and read it! Once you identify your loan servicer, you can set up online account access, select your chosen repayment plan, set up automatic payments, and more. Federal Loan Servicer for Direct & PLUS Loans There are several agencies that service federal direct loans. The Department of Education determines which agency will service your loans. If you do not know which agency services your loans, visit the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) to view your loan details and obtain your loan servicer contact information.
