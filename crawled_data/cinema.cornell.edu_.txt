Support Cornell Cinema Cornell Cinema has been in existence since 1970 and for five decades has broadened the horizons of tens of thousands of students and community members. We rely on annual assistance from individual donors to present a high-caliber program year after year, and to remain nimble and responsive to rapidly evolving technologies & circumstances that change the ways films are released and experienced. A donation from you, large or small, will help us continue to offer the wide variety and quality of films patrons have come to expect from Cornell Cinema, as well as present the increasingly important live events (visiting filmmakers, live music/film performances) that bring people into the theatre at a time when there are so many alternative ways to view a film on its own.
