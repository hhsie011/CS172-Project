Posted by: Jonathan Virdell Environmental Reconstruction in Holocene Estuaries on the Modern Texas Continental Shelf (Undergraduate) Sea level rise is one of the most pressing impacts of climate change facing coastal communities. A variety of mitigation efforts on the local and regional level (beach nourishment, marsh restoration, coastal barriers, etc.) can provide some measure of protection for coastal communities. These large engineering projects require huge quantities of sand to complete, and sand is not as common on the seafloor as you might expect. On northern Texas shelf, offshore Galveston Bay, a few sand banks exist, but much more material is buried in drowned river valleys, which were carved by rivers when sea level was ~120 meters lower and dry land extended all the way to the edge of the continental shelf. These rivers deposited sand in point bars, which were then buried in estuarine mud as sea level rose and the river valley became a bay. Sand was also deposited in this estuary as bay head deltas, flood tide deltas, and over wash fans. UT is currently involved in an extensive project to find and map (using seismic surveying and sediment cores) the extent of Holocene sand deposits in the Trinity and Sabine river valleys offshore modern Galveston Bay. For this project, the REU student will conduct grain size analysis on sediment cores collected offshore Galveston Bay to determine the overall sedimentology and stratigraphy of these environments. This student will also use marine microfossils (benthic foraminifera) to determine the depositional environment of the muds deposited in between the sand deposits to determine the overall environmental evolution of the Holocene estuary system. This work will help identify sand resources for future coastal protection projects in the Galveston area. This work will also help reconstruct the history of the Holocene estuary and barrier island system; understanding how ancient barrier island systems responded to different rates of sea level rise during the Holocene can help constrain how barrier islands will respond to similar rates of sea level rise today. This project will involve work on a Malvern Mastersizer laser grain size analyzer, managing grain size datasets, and microfossil picking on a microscope. Prior experience with any of these things is not required.

The project will focus on the White Family Outdoor Learning Center, a "living classroom" for geoscience education and site for long term scientific observation located on 266 acres of pasture and oak and cedar covered hillsides outside of Austin, Texas. This design research project will (1) inform the ongoing design of learning and student research activities at the White Family Outdoor Learning Center, and (2) deepen our conceptual understanding of what makes inclusive field- and place-based learning work well for a diversity of students. Working as part of the Jackson School's new Learning Science CoLab, the student-researcher collaborate with Dr. Papendieck and other faculty to design and carry out their own projects over a year-long period from Summer 2022 to Summer 2023. Possible lines of investigation and design include but are not limited to: 1. Systematically investigating the scientific, cultural, historical and social context of the White Family Outdoor Learning Center, and integrating these contextual understandings to inform learning and research. This work might result in the development of a resource library, website, toolkit or case study. 2. Researching and developing curricular activities and toolkits that better leverage integrated, place-based connections and contribute to strong, rich and diverse geoscientific identities. 3. Examining issues of belongingness and inclusivity in place- and field-based learning, and developing principles for more inclusive field-based experiences. 4. Investigating how learning and student research activities can better engage, respond and work in solidarity with broader stakeholders, including indigenous communities.

Posted by: Rowan Martindale Graduate and Post-Doctoral opportunities in GeoFluids Research Group (Graduate) The GeoFluids Research Group has immediate opportunities for graduate and post-doctoral study. Dr. Flemings is most enthused by students who have a commitment to a doctoral program because that allows time to delve deeply into research. However, he also regularly accepts exceptional M.S. students into our research group. If you are interested, please e-mail, Peter Flemings (pflemings@jsg.utexas.edu). Current Research Opportunities: 1. Hydrate Melting: Examine the melting of methane hydrates in Arctic systems. DOE funded effort will examine the impact of warming over human time scales and longer.

We will use airborne ice penetrating radar, gravity, magnetics and laser altimetry to map out the structure of the ice sheet, and map out the underlying geology, to find regions where ice from the mid-Pleistocene (a critical transition point in recent climate history) remains undisturbed. Two field expeditions to Antarctica of eight weeks in duration are expected as part of COLDEX's aerogeophysical program, which will be conducted by Polar and Planetary Geophysics at the University of Texas institute for Geophysics, part of the Jackson School of Geosciences. We expect this work to be at Ph. D. level. We are looking for students with an interest in complementing instrumental, operational and management experiences with research coupling geophysical observations to better understanding of ice sheet behavior in the hidden deep interior of Antarctica. COLDEX is committed to enhancing participation of under-represented groups in the Earth Sciences, and we strongly encourage individuals from these groups to apply.

Posted by: Jung-Fu Lin Innovative Detrital Provenance Studies - Double Dating PLUS (Graduate) A major thrust of my current research the development and application of more comprehensive isotopic detrital provenance tools. U-Pb on zircon is clearly the big work horse, but only goes so far and sometimes yields "no" useful info, e.g., if the source of the sediment is mostly recycled sediment. We have extensively pursued double dating of zircons by U-Pb and He, as zircon He ages yield very interesting insights into the thermal and tectonic history of the source terrane; often yielding very different insights than crystallization ages. The combination is powerful, but I think we can take things so much farther by combining double dating with other constrains. People have tried fission track (not precise enough), Hf/Hf (to get mantle separation model ages), etc., but what we want to do and are working on is really Double Dating ++, combining zircon U-Pb-He dating with a variety of other geochemical aspects to more comprehensive understand detrital provenance and improve paleo-tectonic reconstructions. For example, trace-element thermometry (Ti in zirc), REE on zircon (met vs mag origin), Hf/Hf (see above), oxygen isotopes, etc. and also to develop rutile in an analogous manner (e.g., Zr in rut thermometry, Cr/Nb ratio (mafic vs granulitic), REE, etc.). The sky is the limit and what can learn so much. The issue in part it, how much can a single grain tell us before it's gone? The project sounds very laboratory oriented, but it's really a combination of field and lab work. We have identified a few possible case study areas, e.g., Morocco; great exposures, long-lived and preserved record of basin deposition since the Precambrian. My group is already working on some case studies in NW Himalayas, the N & S Pyrenees, the Sevier FTB, Permian Basin and other foreland basin. New projects include provenance studies along rifted and passive continental margins such the Gulf of Mexico, the central Atlantic Margins in Canada, USA, Portugal, and Morocco.
