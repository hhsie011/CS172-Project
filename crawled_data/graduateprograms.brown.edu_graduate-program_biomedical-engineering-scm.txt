The Biomedical Engineering program at Brown provides cutting–edge, interdisciplinary, graduate–level education at the interface of engineering, biology, and medicine. The program features an interdisciplinary approach in four complementary research areas: Tissue Engineering/Regenerative Medicine Neuroengineering/Imaging Biomaterials/Nanotechnology Biomechanics Research in these areas is advancing the understanding of fundamental problems in biology and medicine, while developing new therapies to improve the quality of life for people with medical problems. The program is distinguished by its strong and collaborative connections between academic science, clinical medicine, and industry. Graduate students take engineering, biology and medical school courses, gain valuable clinical experience at nearby teaching hospitals associated with the Brown Medical School, and engage in stimulating internships at companies commercializing biomedical technologies. These opportunities, coupled with dissertation research, give graduate students both the intellectual and the practical skills required for developing today's emerging science into useful biomedical technology and therapies. Students are able to customize their curriculum and can choose between 3 tracks: Master of Science Research Track Master of Science Design Track Master of Science Non–Thesis Track Admission Information Inquire Apply Admission Requirements GRE Subject: Not required GRE General: Not required Additional Requirements: Application Deadline Spring 2022: November 15 Fall 2022: April 15 Dates/Deadlines Admission Deadline November 15, 2021 5th Year Deadline May 15, 2022 Completion Requirements An approved program of study consists of eight semester courses.
