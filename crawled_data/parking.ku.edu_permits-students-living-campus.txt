All other lots on campus are restricted during the day for vehicles with the appropriate permit for those lots. On-campus housing residents should expect to walk or ride the bus from their residence to class and back. Due to the limited number of parking stalls available for residents of campus housing, not every resident will be able to purchase a permit for the closest parking lot to their residence hall. University Housing permits for Daisy Hill, Central District, Jayhawker Tower, and GSP/Corbin can park in all green zones, except scholarship hall parking lots. Scholarship Hall permits can park in all housing zones. Important Note: There are staff red parking zones spread throughout KU housing parking lots. An appropriate staff permit is required for these spaces 24 hours a day, and vehicles with housing or other permits will be ticketed and may be towed if found parked in the red stalls. Be aware and check signs when parking. All Housing Permits cost $331 Daisy Hill Residents of Ellsworth, Hashinger, Lewis, Oswald, Self, or Templin halls can purchase a Daisy Hill (DH) permit valid in lots 101, 103, 104, 105 and 300E-G. Parking is available daily on a first-come, first-served basis. If there are no open regular (not red) spaces in lots 101, 103, 104, or 105, you will be able to park in lot 300E-G across Iowa Street (via the overpass) east of the Lied Center.

Be aware that all parking in this garage is preempted during home football game days. Signs will be posted 48 hours in advance of each home football game.
