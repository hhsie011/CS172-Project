Instagram Student Handbook Student Handbook: Preface This Handbook contains policies and procedures of the Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE). Students should become familiar with the material pertaining to their degree program and, together with their advisors, make certain that their chosen program of study complies with all policies. Although we have attempted to include most of the regulations governing graduate academic programs, some programs have additional requirements and regulations of their own. Students also should become familiar with the academic policies relevant to their individual program. At times, a mid-year review of academic, financial, and other considerations may lead to changes in the policies, rules, and regulations applicable to students; HGSE therefore reserves the right to make changes to the Student Handbook at any time. These changes may affect such matters as tuition and other fees, courses, degrees, and programs offered (including the modification or possible elimination of degrees and programs), degree and other academic requirements, academic policies, rules pertaining to student conduct and discipline, fields or areas of concentration, and other rules and regulations applicable to students. Delivery of Educational Programs During the COVID-19 Pandemic The public health crisis occasioned by COVID-19 has caused unprecedented social and economic disruption worldwide, in the United States, and in the Boston/Cambridge area. Anticipating that continued in-person, on-campus instruction would increase the risk of infections in our community, the University acted promptly in March 2020 to “de-densify” its campus and transition to online instruction. Harvard reached this decision after careful (but time-pressed) deliberation, drawing on insights and expertise from public health experts worldwide — including on the Harvard faculty. In recent years HGSE has had to act quickly to implement contingency scenarios in order to protect the health and safety of our community, while ensuring the continuity of our teaching and research mission. HGSE continues to retain the discretion to adjust its mode of teaching as it deems necessary in extraordinary circumstances, including by making recourse to online instruction and implementing compulsory testing and tracing programs as required conditions for accessing the Harvard campus or Harvard facilities. It is every student’s responsibility to be aware of, and to comply with all regulations, policies, procedures, and deadlines. 2022-2023 Edition Updated May 2022 In this section Student Handbook Introduction Welcome to HGSE Preface Commitment to Diversity Part 1: Enrollment Policies Academic Programs and Affiliations Registration and Enrollment Policies Tuition and Fees Financial Aid Student Health Insurance Grading Part 2: Student Supports Advising HGSE Supports University Supports Campus Safety and Security Part 3: Program Policies Academic Governance Doctor of Education (Ed.D.)
