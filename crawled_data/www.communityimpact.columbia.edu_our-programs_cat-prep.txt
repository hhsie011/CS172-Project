Students planning to start their college careers at one of the many City University of New York (CUNY) campuses will be required to take an assessment test. The CUNY Assessment Test (CAT) is made up of three sections: Reading, Writing, and Math. Students must pass each section in order to take university-level classes and begin earning credit towards their college degrees. CAT Prep classes at Community Impact are open to all adult learners who hold a High School Degree or TASC Diploma. The 8-week curriculum is carefully tailored to help students brush up on the academic skills they will need to matriculate at CUNY right away, skipping the remedial classes. Enrollment in TASC classes entitles students to the services offered by College Road and Job Road. 105 Earl Hall, 2980 Broadway, New York, NY 10027 212-854-1492 | [email protected] Our Services Adult Programs Current Adult Learners & Teachers ESOL High School Equivalency (TASC) CUNY Assessment Test Preparation College Road Job Road CAFE Prep Student Pre-Registration Form Volunteer Registration Form Youth Programs Emergency Services Health Student Executive Board Our Supporters Support Community Impact Giving Tuesday CI Endowment Campaign Community Impact Alumni Organization (CIAO) Sharing Our Stories Benefit About Us Mission History Leadership Our Impact News & Events Contact Our Opportunities Work Study Job Opportunities Van Amson Service Fellowship Volunteering Donate Follow us Facebook Twitter Copyright Â© Copyright Community Impact at Columbia University Site by Site by Bureau for Good
