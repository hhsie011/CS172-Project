Achieving the Dream explores ambition, perseverance, challenge and achievement of goals. It's a journey into student life at Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar (WCMC-Q). WCMC-Q was established by Cornell University in partnership with Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development. WCMC-Q is part of Weill Cornell Medical College, which was founded in New York City more than 100 years ago, and shares the same tripartite mission: a dedication to excellence in education, top-quality clinical care, and research at the frontiers of biomedical science.
