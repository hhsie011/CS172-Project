Successful transfer students come from wide a range of backgrounds, including community colleges, first-generation families, and the military. Yale will admit a small number of transfer students from accredited two-year or four-year institutions every year. No simple profile of grades, scores, and interests can assure a transfer applicant admission to Yale. Before exploring Yale’s transfer application process, here are a few things you should know: Transfer students will begin in either their sophomore (second) year or junior (third) year and must enroll at Yale for a minimum of two years (four terms) to qualify for a bachelor’s degree. Transfer students enroll beginning in the fall term only. Class standing is determined by the Yale College Dean’s Office after an evaluation of transfer credit. Admitted students will be informed of their class standing after admission. Transfer students are eligible for the same generous need-based financial aid as students who begin as first-years. Prospective students can estimate their cost in three minutes using Yale’s Quick Cost Estimator. Yale evaluates applications for admission and financial aid without regard to a student’s citizenship or immigration status. These policies include undocumented students living in the US, whether they hold DACA status or not. Students whose college experience has been delayed or interrupted for five or more years, may apply to the Eli Whitney Students Program, a program designed specifically for nontraditional students. Unlike transfer students, Eli Whitney students have the flexibility to attend on a part-time or full-time basis and their tuition costs vary depending on the number of course credits per semester.
