Analytical skills are as essential in an epidemic as they are in everyday wellness care, as vital for patients as they are for providers. These data skills are critical for analysts anywhere on the healthcare spectrum – on the clinical, pharmaceutical, risk, or management side. Data Science in Healthcare is an 8-week, online course designed for technical professionals who have at least a moderate level of comfort with some type of analysis coding tools (such as SaS, SPSS, or R), college-level mathematics, and statistics. In this program, you will learn to: Use RStudio and Python analytics tools to address specific healthcare applications Use predictive analytics for public health issues Use data science to increase efficiency on the operations side Understand how to design precision solutions for patient care using AI Use predictive analytics to prevent fraud and other undesired outcomes Learn more about the topics covered and how to apply for the next session News The Dartmouth QBS community is at the forefront of creating solutions to previously unsolved problems. They exhibit academic excellence and tenacity, innovating across disciplines to develop the most effective outcomes. Read more below about events and people in the QBS community.
