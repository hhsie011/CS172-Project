Events Past Event Pricing Beauty: Is it Risky to Invest in Art? Share Add to Calendar: Google Yahoo September 26, 2019 6:00 PM - 8:00 PM Galería Patricia Ready, Espoz 3125, Vitacura, Santiago The art market has grown in size, geographical diversity, and importance. On the other hand, artistic objects, notwithstanding their aesthetic merits, can also be valuable financial assets. Arturo Cifuentes, professor atColumbia Business School and research associate at CLAPES-UC will look at the art market from a financial viewpoint and show how simple calculations can reveal surprising facts about this fascinating asset class. Cifuentes, who brings more than twenty years of experience as an investment banker, hedge fund manager, scientist, university professor, consultant, and newspaper columnist, currently divides his time between New York and Chile. Previously, he served three years as a member and President of the Chilean Sovereign Fund investment committee (US$ 25 billion); and four years as a member of the Advisory Board of the Division of Humanities and Social Sciences of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). He has written numerous academic articles (refereed papers) on topics related to finance, portfolio management, applied mathematics, and engineering. He has also lectured extensively about the art market from a financial viewpoint and published several studies on this topic. As a result of the subprime financial crisis, he was invited twice to testify, as expert witness, by the US Senate. Cifuentes holds a Ph.D. in Applied Mechanics and a M.S. in Civil Engineering from Caltech; an MBA in Finance from New York University (Stern scholar award); and a Civil Engineering degree from Universidad de Chile.
