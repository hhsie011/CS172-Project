The artists represented in this selection have worked primarily in painting and drawing or sculpture and photography yet came to the Neiman Center with the desire to rethink their images in printed form. Their results were wide and varied but stand together in their common interest in the body as an enduring emblem capable of expressing diverse ideas and conveying myriad stories. David Altmejd AW from Ringers, 2014 From a portfolio of 21 etchings with pigmented inkjet, collage and hand-additions Sheet: 26 x 19 inches, each Image: 7 ½ x 5 ½ inches, each Edition: 30 David Altmejd GS from Ringers, 2014 From a portfolio of 21 etchings with pigmented inkjet, collage and hand-additions Sheet: 26 x 19 inches, each Image: 7 ½ x 5 ½ inches, each Edition: 30 David Altmejd LG from Ringers, 2014 From portfolio of 21 etchings with pigmented inkjet, collage and hand-additions Sheet: 26 x 19 inches, each Image: 7 ½ x 5 ½ inches, each Edition: 30 David Altmejd MT from Ringers, 2014 From a portfolio of 21 etchings with pigmented inkjet, collage and hand-additions Sheet: 26 x 19 inches, each Image: 7 ½ x 5 ½ inches, each Edition: 30 Known primarily as a sculptor, Altmejd made this series of prints using a variety of print and collage techniques to create texture and dimensionality to an otherwise two-dimensional medium. The images are based on a series of photographic portraits Altmejd took of studio assistants as well as the staff and students working at the Neiman Center. For each print, he painstakingly altered the heads of his subjects often melding them with others or inverting and embellishing them to obscure and transform their identities. Ghada Amer/Reza Farkhondeh The Wall of Pleasure, 2010 Monoprint Sheet: 38 ½ x 29 inches Edition: Unique “I believe that all women should like their bodies and use them as tools of seduction.” - Ghada Amer Ernesto Caivano Arbor Axis (Snow Leaves) 6, 2015 Offset lithography Sheet: 45 1/8 x 35 1/8 inches Image: 35 x 31 inches Edition: 22 Eric Fischl Move, 2001 Offset lithography Sheet and image: 42 7/8 x 30 7/8 Edition: 32 Tim Gardner Blackout II, 2002 Photo-lithography Sheet: 18 ¼ x 16 ½ inches Image: 3 1/3 x 4 ¾ inches Edition: 15 In the series, Blackout, Gardner depicts drunken young men either joking together, alone in an alcoholic haze or sneering at the viewer with obvious disregard and disdain. Much like a snapshot, his drawings freeze the fleeting, often awkward, gestures of his disillusioned subjects. Here, Gardner crops the heads of his subjects revealing their grotesque expressions close-up in the spirit of Frans Hals’s (Dutch, 1582/3-1666) paintings of drunken revealers. Dana Hoey Pregnant Smoker (Destroyed) from Profane Waste, 2006 A portfolio of seven offset photo-lithographs and screenprints with hand-additions Sheet: 30 x 41 inches, each Image: 26 x 39 inches, each Edition: 24 Hoey’s work examines contemporary female identity through staged and directed photographs and videos. Here, she constructed an uneasy and darkly humorous image of a pregnant woman that upends traditional depictions of expectant mothers and confronts head on social taboos during pregnancy. Leigh Ledare An Invitation, 2012 Portfolio of seven offset lithographs with screenprint and hand-additions; each print includes an archival inkjet contract Sheet and image: 74 x 41 inches, each Contract: 5 ¼ x 32 inches, each Edition: 16 This image, taken from Ledare’s ambitious print project An Invitation, documents the artist’s commission by a respected writer to take a series of erotic photographs of her over the course of a week. She kept a set of the photographs and Ledare kept another. For the resulting series, he redacted any evidence of the woman’s identity and superimposed the photograph onto an enlarged copy of the front page of The New York Times corresponding to the day the photograph was taken. He added handwritten text to the bottom of the print – a personal journal entry of sorts – commenting on the project and the fuzzy line between privacy and publicity. Shirin Neshat Number 5 from Offerings, 2019 A portfolio of nine photogravures with black foiling Sheet: 26 5/8 x 22 inches Image: 20 x 15 ¾ inches Edition: 14 This image is taken from Neshat’s cinematic series of nine photogravures which use the simple gesture of a woman’s hands opening and closing in prayer to create a sense of universal solemnity and grace. The hands are overlaid with text from a poem on the sacredness of wine by Omar Khayyam (1048-1131), a Persian poet and mystic. Born in Iran, Neshat often employs the female body as a site for exploring the relationship between women and the religious and cultural values of Islam. Dana Schutz Self Eater, 2005 Woodcut and chine collé Sheet: 38 x 33 inches Image: 27 ¾ x 23 ¾ inches Edition: 48 Schutz created a macabre series of paintings in the early 2000s that were based on the premise “What if people could eat themselves.” Their brightly colored palette and wildly distorted forms – much like those in this woodcut – bely the seemingly disturbing nature of Schutz’s narrative, making them appear strangely lighthearted and humorous.
