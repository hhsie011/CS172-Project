Our faculty and students are versatile thinkers who can define a problem, place it within the broad social and economic contexts, and articulate a clear vision for a human-centered approach toward a solution. Most research projects are collaborations that integrate one or more engineering disciplines with other sciences. Students working in these labs learn important lessons about the interconnectedness of the world and develop both depth and breadth that make them innovators and leaders in emerging technologies. Research by Discipline Biological / Chemical Learn More Biomedical Learn More Electrical / Computer Learn More Energy Learn More Materials Science Learn More Mechanical / Operations / Systems Learn More Research by Activity Laboratories Active Research Projects Collaborations Undergraduate Research Culture of Collaboration Dartmouth Engineering is a close-knit community of scholars with a broad range of expertise. The culture of collaboration extends across the hall, across campus, and beyond. Many research projects engage colleagues from other institutions such as Dartmouth-Hitchcock, Geisel School of Medicine, Tuck School of Business, Guarini School of Graduate and Advanced Studies, and CRREL, as well as industry—and offer numerous research opportunities for undergraduates. Learn More Dartmouth Engineering faculty and staff take pride in the many ways students put their education to work, understanding engineering research and projects in the context of human need.
