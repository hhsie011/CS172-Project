It is important to remember that your future occupation may relate more to your personal career interests, work values, and skills than any specific academic major. The options for each of the majors listed are designed to get you thinking about occupations related to a particular field of study. Remember -- these options are certainly not all of the occupations you might consider. Also note that some of these occupations require education beyond a bachelor's degree. We encourage you to research these and other options further by visiting The Career Center Library, Room 1200 in the Dunlap Success Center, or by contacting the professional associations for specific career fields. You can also research specific FSU undergraduate majors and related career information by reviewing the Undergraduate Academic Program Guide. To learn more about different occupations explore these career videos. title-inside title-centered 2 College of Applied Studies Crime Scene Investigation Financial Planning Law Enforcement Intelligence Law Enforcement Operations Professional Communication College of Arts and Sciences Actuarial Science Anthropology Applied Computational Mathematics Arabic Astrophysics BioChemistry Biological Sciences BioMathematics Chemical Science Chemistry Chinese Classical Archaeology Classical Civilization Classics and Liberal Studies Classics and Religion Computational Biology Computational Science Computer Programming and Applications Computer Science Computer Science/Math FSU Teach Creative Writing Cyber Criminology East Asian Languages and Culture Editing, Writing and Media Environmental Chemistry Environmental Science French Geology German Greek Hebrew Hispanic Languages History Humanities Italian Japanese Latin Linguistics Literature, Media and Culture Mathematics Mathematics FSU Teach Meteorology Middle Eastern Studies Neuroscience Philosophy Physical Science Physics Physics and Materials Portuguese Psychology Religion Slavic Spanish Statistics College of Business Accounting Finance Human Resources Management Management Management Information Systems Marketing Professional Sales Real Estate Risk Management/ Insurance College of Communication and Information Advertising Communication Science and Disorders Digital Media Production Information Technology Information, Communication, and Technology Media/Communication Studies Public Relations College of Criminology and Criminal Justice Criminology Cyber Criminology Dedman College of Hospitality Global Club Management Hospitality College of Education Elementary Education English Education Social Science Education Special Education Sport Management Visual Disability Education & Studies College of Engineering Biomedical Engineering Chemical Engineering Chemical-Materials Engineering Civil Engineering Computer Engineering Electrical Engineering Environmental Engineering Industrial Engineering Mechanical Engineering College of Fine Arts Art History Dance Interior Design Musical Theatre Studio Art Theatre Theatre: Acting College of Health and Human Sciences Athletic Training Dietetics Exercise Physiology Food and Nutrition Science Human Development and Family Science Jim Moran College of Entrepreneurship Commercial Entrepreneurship Retail Entrepreneurship Social And Sustainable Enterprises Social Entrepreneurship STEM Entrepreneurship College of Medicine IMS: Clinical Professions IMS: Community Patient Care IMS: Health Management, Policy and Information College of Motion Picture Arts Animation and Digital Arts Motion Picture Arts - Production Motion Picture Arts - Writing College of Music Music Education Music Liberal Arts Music Performance Music Theory and Composition Music Therapy College of Nursing Nursing College of Social Sciences and Public Policy African American Studies Asian Studies Economics Environment and Society Geography Interdisciplinary Social Science International Affairs Latin American Caribbean Studies Political Science Public Health Russian and East European Studies Sociology College of Social Work Social Work The Career Center The Dunlap Success Center 100 South Woodward Avenue Florida State University Tallahassee, FL 32306-4162 Phone: 850–644–6431 Fax: 850-644-3273 Website Questions/Broken Links Diversity and Accessibility Report Bias and Discrimination The Career Center: Facebook Instagram Twitter Pinterest LinkedIn YouTube Select languageSelect LanguageEnglishAfrikaansAlbanianArabicArmenianAzerbaijaniBasqueBelarusianBengaliBosnianBulgarianCatalanCebuanoChinese (Simplified)Chinese (Traditional)CroatianCzechDanishDutchEsperantoEstonianFilipinoFinnishFrenchGalicianGeorgianGermanGreekGujaratiHaitian CreoleHausaHebrewHindiHmongHungarianIcelandicIgboIndonesianIrishItalianJapaneseJavaneseKannadaKhmerKoreanLaoLatinLatvianLithuanianMacedonianMalayMalteseMaoriMarathiMongolianNepaliNorwegianPersianPolishPortuguesePunjabiRomanianRussianSerbianSlovakSlovenianSomaliSpanishSwahiliSwedishTamilTeluguThaiTurkishUkrainianUrduVietnameseWelshYiddishYorubaZulu © Florida State University Tallahassee, FL 32306 FSU Directory Assistance Questions or Comments Privacy Policy Copyright Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube LinkedIn More FSU Social Media
