The event will be held in English and is translated simultaneously into Arabic. This webinar will discuss how innovation is essential for individuals, organizations, societies, and civilization itself. Overcoming this blasted pandemic along with the existential challenges of climate change and social upheaval all demand innovation. As Abraham Lincoln said, "We must think anew, and act anew." Yet despite all that has been written, there hasn’t really been an integrative, predictive theory of innovation and how it works. This presentation will review some historical examples of innovation from ancient Rome to Silicon Valley, dissect that greatest fount of innovation—biology—and consider the outlines of a theory of innovation based on evolution with practical implications for individuals, businesses, and policy.
