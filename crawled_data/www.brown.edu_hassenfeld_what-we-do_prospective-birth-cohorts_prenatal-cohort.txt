The data collected from this cohort will assist researchers investigating predictors of childhood asthma, autism and obesity. Specific Aims Identify the influence of pregnancy factors on maternal and child health and health services use We will examine a broad range of factors including maternal health status, family history, neighborhood, pregnancy complications, and feeding and exercise patterns with a particular focus on how they are associated with childhood asthma, obesity and neurologic development. Create a bio-bank of blood, urine, saliva, cord blood and placenta specimens. Specimens will be collected during pregnancy and at delivery. The specimens will be available for future multi-disciplinary research aimed at examining toxins, immunologic factors, and metabolic determinants of childhood disease.
