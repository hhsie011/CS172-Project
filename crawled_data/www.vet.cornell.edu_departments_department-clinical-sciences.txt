The department endeavors to balance its threefold missions of teaching, service and research. Faculty are dedicated to excellence in teaching and contribute to classroom and laboratory teaching throughout the curriculum. Substantial effort is provided towards clinical training of DVM professional students, interns and residents through faculty's professional service in the Cornell University Hospital for Animals (CUHA). Both clinical and basic research are highly valued and faculty strive to enhance the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of animal disease, promote animal health and productivity, and take advantage of our unique access to naturally-occurring clinical disease in order to explore mechanisms of fundamental importance to biomedical science.
