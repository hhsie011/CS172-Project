Giving to CSUF Titan Fund Colleges Programs Scholarships Special Opportunities Search for a Fund Tribute Gifts Matching Gifts Titan Fund Give online to the Titan Fund Other ways to give Your annual gift to the Titan Fund is essential to the university in providing support each year to programs across campus. While you are welcome to support a specific college, program, or scholarship, of particular value are unrestricted gifts that allow resources to be directed to areas having the greatest need. The Titan Fund focuses on unrestricted gifts - gifts that are not earmarked for specific programs or purposes. Gifts to the Titan Fund are used to support each of our eight colleges, Student Affairs, academic programs, scholarships, athletics, and the library. Matching Many companies will match the donations of their employees and retirees. Please check with your human resources department to see if your gift qualifies, or visit our matching gift page for more information. This site is maintained by University Advancement.
