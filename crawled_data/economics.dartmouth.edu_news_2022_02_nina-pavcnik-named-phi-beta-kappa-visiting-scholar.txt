(Photo by Eli Burakian ’00) Body The Phi Beta Kappa Society named economics professor Nina Pavcnik a 2022-2023 Visiting Scholar. The program selects top scholars in the liberal arts and sciences to share their expertise in visits to universities and colleges that host Phi Beta Kappa chapters. Visiting scholars spend two days on up to eight campuses that request a visit, meeting informally with undergraduates, participating in classroom lectures and seminars, and giving one major lecture open to the academic community and general public. “This provides a great opportunity for me to interact with undergraduates at various institutions and discuss with them issues related to international trade and development and the opportunities and challenges that globalization provides,” says Pavcnik, the Niehaus Family Professor in International Studies. She says she is particularly excited to meet with students during informal lunches and through classroom discussions. “What this program enables me to do is, on a very small scale, bring the Dartmouth model of teacher-scholar to some other universities or colleges.” Phi Beta Kappa chapters at more than 100 colleges and universities have until mid-April to submit their choices from the 13 new visiting scholars to request a visit to their school. The scholars, who will accept up to eight requests each, will begin visits in mid-August at the earliest. The Phi Beta Kappa Visiting Scholar Program has been offering undergraduates the opportunity to spend time with some of America’s most distinguished scholars since 1956. Since 1776, Phi Beta Kappa has championed education in the arts and sciences, fostered freedom of thought, and recognized academic excellence.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Economics About Why Econ?
