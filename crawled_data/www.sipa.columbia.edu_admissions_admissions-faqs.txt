You are here Home Admissions ADMISSIONS POLICIES MAY I APPLY TO MORE THAN ONE OF YOUR MPA PROGRAMS AT ONCE? Yes, you may apply simultaneously to more than one SIPA MPA degree program at SIPA. However, you should apply to the program(s) that most closely reflects your professional, personal, and geographic interests and experience. Admission decisions are determined by each individual program. SIPA will not accept simultaneous applications to its 21-month MIA and 21-month MPA programs. IF I HAVE BEEN DENIED ADMISSION, MAY I APPEAL MY ADMISSIONS DECISION? The Admissions Committee reviews each application thoroughly and with great care. All decisions are final. There is no appeal process. IF I WAS NOT ADMITTED, CAN I GET FEEDBACK ON MY APPLICATION? The Admissions Committee appreciates the commitment of time and energy put into each application. However, we are unable to offer individual feedback on why they did not gain admission into the program. Requesting Feedback Details APPLICATION PROCESS HOW DO I APPLY? The application processes for all SIPA programs are handled online. All documents required to be considered for admission can be submitted through the online application. We do not require documents be mailed to our office. Feel free to contact the Office of Admissions at 212-854-6216 or send an e-mail to [email protected] if you have any further questions. WHAT IS THE DEADLINE TO APPLY? Deadlines vary on based on program and term. Please see this website for more information. WHAT DO YOU LOOK FOR IN AN APPLICANT? The admissions committee seeks to admit candidates with a combination of proven academic ability and most successful applicants possess two to three years of relevant professional-level work experience. Please refer to the What We Look For page for details. MAY I REQUEST AN APPLICATION FEE WAIVER? The $95 USD non-refundable application fee can be paid by credit card or check. Unfortunately, we do not grant fee waivers for financial hardship. We may grant application fee waivers to applicants who meet the following criteria: Active duty U.S. military personnel AmeriCorps Charles B. Rangel International Affairs Fellows Columbia University (Barnard, CC, GS, SEAS) 5-year dual-degree applicants Columbia Displaced Persons' Scholarship applicants Graduates from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) Institute for International Public Policy (IIPP) Joint Japan/World Bank Scholarship Program (MPA-EPM applicants only) McNair Scholars Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellowship (MMUF) Payne Fellows Peace Corps volunteers (MIA, MPA, MPA-DP applicants only) Public Policy & International Affairs (PPIA) Fellows Teach for All network partners (currently in service) Thomas R. Pickering Foreign Affairs Fellows Truman Scholar Questbridge Applicants requesting a fee waiver should email [email protected]. Applicants must be prepared to submit an official document confirming participation in the appropriate program. AFTER SUBMITTING MY APPLICATION, WHEN WILL I RECEIVE A DECISION? Decision notifications are posted to the application portal. You will receive an email when a decision is available. MIA/ MPA: Fall Early Action applicants will receive decisions by January 1, and remaining fall decisions are communicated in mid-March. Decisions for spring applications are released by late November. DO WE SPECIFY OUR CONCENTRATION DURING THE APPLICATION? Yes, you must select your program and concentration of choice on your admissions application. For information on concentrations and specializations, please visit this website. Is there a separate application for fellowship consideration? There is no separate application for SIPA fellowship consideration. In order to be considered for funding, you must select “yes” on the application and apply by the fellowship consideration deadline. SIPA has a need-blind admission policy, meaning an applicant’s financial need is not a factor in the admission decision. How can I check the status of my application? To monitor the status of your application materials, you may log into your application portal. You will receive a notification email once a decision has been made. Can I submit additional materials once my application is under review or evaluation? If the Admissions Committee determines additional materials are required, you will be contacted. No additional materials may be uploaded after your application is submitted. TRANSCRIPTS/RECOMMENDATION LETTERS WHICH TRANSCRIPTS AM I REQUIRED TO SUBMIT? A bachelor's degree or its equivalent from an accredited institution is required to enroll at Columbia SIPA. Applicants must submit transcripts for any college or university attended, even if the coursework was not part of a degree program. We need the credits, grades, and grading scale to be submitted. Unofficial copies of transcripts may be uploaded to the admission site for admission consideration. Only if an offer of admission is made and the applicant accepts will we require the submission of official transcripts; these documents must be on file one month prior to orientation. In addition, official documentation of the degree conferred is required. Classes that have notes such as T, TR, or CR will not be accepted. These notes generally refer to transfer classes. If an applicant attended one school and transferred to another and the new school only notes codes for transfer credit, the applicant must submit the transcript from the first school with the grade achieved. If an applicant is currently in an academic program and will not finish the program by the time of the application deadline we ask that the applicant submit the most up-to-date transcript information. We do not require that a program be completed at the time of application. In other words, we can make an admission decision with incomplete transcripts if an applicant is still finishing a program. However, the academic degree must be completed prior to enrollment at SIPA. MY TRANSCRIPT(S) AND/OR LETTER(S) OF RECOMMENDATION ARE NOT IN ENGLISH. DO I NEED TO HAVE THE DOCUMENT(S) TRANSLATED? Materials that are not in English must be translated by an official translation agency and notarized. SIPA does not endorse or recommend any individual provider of translation services. Please submit both the original documents and the translations to the Admissions Office. WHO SHOULD SUBMIT MY RECOMMENDATION LETTERS? References are integral to the application evaluation, and we encourage applicants to ask individuals who are equipped to attest to your academic abilities, leadership skills, and/or character. The Admissions Committee requires two recommendation letters, and your references may be either academic or professional. STANDARDIZED TESTS DO I HAVE TO SUBMIT TOEFL/IELTS SCORES? International students who did not earn a four year bachelor's degree (or international equivalent) from an institution in which English is the primary language of instruction, must submit proof of competency in English by submitting TOEFL, IELTS, or Cambridge English scores in order for the application to be reviewed. In order for the application to be considered for admission, applicants must successfully achieve a minimum score on the English proficiency exam. By achieving a preferred score, admitted applicants will not be required to enroll in SIPA's mandatory American Language Program (admitted students required to take this course are notified in their admission letter). TOEFL ibt minimum score: 100, preferred score: 110 or above IELTS minimum score: 7.0, preferred score: 7.5 or above Cambridge English C1 Advanced/ C2 Proficiency: minimum score: 185 C1 Advanced, preferred score: 191 or above Email us at [email protected] to request an English Proficiency Exam waiver at least four weeks prior to your application deadline. A completed waiver must be received in order to process your request. The waiver request should include details on how you think you have met the English proficiency aready like work experience and studies done. Each waiver is reviewed on an individual basis; submission of the waiver does not guarantee approval. CAN YOU TELL ME MORE ABOUT THE GRE/GMAT REQUIREMENT? GRE (or GMAT) scores are optional for applicants to the MIA, MPA, MPA-DP, MPA-ESP, and EMPA program. However, we have found them to be useful indicators of academic ability. You may review this blog post here for additional information. However, the summer MPA-EPM program does require GRE or GMAT scores or a GRE/GMAT waiver to be submitted and approved. Please email [email protected] after creating your application to receive the waiver form link. Applicants (who are reporting scores) must submit a self-reported (manually input) GRE or GMAT score. If admitted, applicants must arrange for the official test report(s) to be sent to the Office of Admissions prior to enrolling. Please note the Admissions Committee reserves the right to reverse an admission decision if the self-reported scores do not match official scores sent by the testing agencies. Columbia SIPA GRE school code is 2161 (there is no department code). Our GMAT codes: Master of International Affairs: QF8-64-56 and Master of Public Administration: QF8-64-99 DO you ACCEPT THE LSAT? We do NOT accept LSAT scores. MAY I SUBMIT MY APPLICATION IF I HAVE NOT YET TAKEN THE GRE/GMAT AND/OR TOEFL/IELTS? Self-reported test scores should be submitted with the application by the deadline. Scores must be verified after admission to the program, but before your scores expire. WHAT IS THE MINIMUM OR AVERAGE GRE/GMAT SCORES OF ADMITTED STUDENTS? SIPA has no minimum GRE or GMAT scores. The Admissions Committee carefully reviews every application in its entirety, including test scores, grades (particularly those in relevant coursework), letters of reference, and the applicant's personal statement and work experience. APPLICANT PROFILE WHAT IS THE AVERAGE AGE OF A SIPA STUDENT? The average age of an incoming MIA/MPA student is 26. However, we have received applications from students who are as young as 21 and as old as 61. The vast majority of MIA/MPA students are between 25 and 35 years old. Most admitted students have a minimum of 3 years of full-time work experience. I HAVE A LIBERAL ARTS BACKGROUND AND DIDN’T TAKE MATH CLASSES AT A COLLEGE LEVEL. AM I ELIGIBLE TO APPLY? We encourage all applicants to carefully review the curriculum set forth for the MIA and MPA programs, along with the various concentrations and specializations. The Admissions Committee will look for evidence of quantitative abilities, which can be reflected within the undergraduate transcript, resume, or standardized test scores. If you determine that you would like to supplement your application with additional coursework, you may consider courses in Economics and/or Statistics at an accredited institution. I DON’T HAVE FULL TIME WORK EXPERIENCE, BUT I COMPLETED RELEVANT INTERNSHIPS. AM I ELIGIBLE TO APPLY? Each year, 5 to 10 percent of accepted students come directly from undergraduate institutions. These are individuals with extraordinary academic records who have also had significant internship or study abroad experience. In some cases, recent undergraduates with very strong academic credentials are not offered admission, but are encouraged to reapply after they have gained at least one year or more of relevant work experience. I AM A CHANGING MY CAREER AND DO NOT HAVE RELATED FIELD WORK OR PUBLIC SERVICE EXPERIENCE. HOW CAN I STRENGTHEN MY APPLICATION? We do see a lot of candidates that are career-changers, and SIPA has students that come from many different academic backgrounds. What you will need to do is draw the connections clearly from your background and experience, to what you want to study at SIPA. Highlight your transferrable skills for the Admissions Committee. There are many areas to do this within your application, including your resume and essays, and if applicable, the optional essay.
