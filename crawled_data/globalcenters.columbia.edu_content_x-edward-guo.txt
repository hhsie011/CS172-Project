Edward Guo X. Edward Guo X. Edward Guo Chair, Department of Biomedical engineering; Stanley Dicker Professor of Biomedical Engineering and Professor of Medical Sciences (in Medicine) My Contact Info [email protected] https://engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/edward-guo X. Edward Guo Research Interest µCT, µMRI, and HR-pQCT Image Analysis of Bone Microstructure; Novel Image Based Microstructural and FE Analyses of Osteoporosis Patients; Mechanobiology of 3D In Vitro Trabecular Bone Explants; Mechanotransduction in Osteocyte Network X. Edward Guo is an expert in bone biomechanics and bioengineering research. As director of Columbia’s Bone Bioengineering Laboratory, he and his team have two major research thrusts. The first focus of their research is developing innovative three-dimensional imaging and modeling techniques for bone microstructure, such as individual trabecula segmentation and plate-rod finite element modeling methods. These novel techniques have been widely used by engineers and clinicians in studying osteoporosis and other metabolic bone diseases. In addition, these techniques have revealed genetic traits in bone microstructure among various racial groups such as Chinese, Caucasians, and African Americans. They are currently assembling teams to study genetic variations in various ethnic groups across China and Asia. More recently, the individual trabecula segmentation technique has discovered early changes in bone microstructure in osteoarthritis, a major disease without therapeutic interventions. The second line of research of Guo’s group is mechanobiology of the skeleton. Using innovative single cell, in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo approaches, they have developed innovative technologies to study cell responses to mechanical Loading and began to reveal the mystery of century old Wolff’s law. Guo joined Columbia in 1996. He holds a BS in applied mechanics/biomechanics from Peking University, 1984, and received his MS in engineering science from Harvard University in 1990. He earned his PhD in medical physics and medical engineering from Harvard-Massachusetts Institute of Technology Division of Health Sciences and Technology in 1994, and did post-doctoral training at the University of Michigan.
