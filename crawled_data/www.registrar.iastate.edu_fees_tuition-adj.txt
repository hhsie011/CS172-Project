Enrollment in multiple terms (e.g. summer sessions, first-half or second-half semester courses) may impact tuition adjustments. Adjustments for courses with different session dates are calculated based upon individual session deadlines. Contact the Scheduling and Fees Office at 515-294-2331 or by emailing schedfees@iastate.edu for more information. Contact the Scheduling and Fees Office at 515-294-2331 or by emailing schedfees@iastate.edu for more information about tuition adjustment information for course dates that differ from those listed below. Withdrawing during a term may affect your financial aid. See Financial Aid for more information. For students receiving Veteran benefits, if any portion of tuition and fees are paid directly to the university by the Veterans Administration, any refund due to changes in enrollment will not be released to the student until the Veterans Administration has completed a debt collection process. Questions regarding this policy can be directed to Iowa State Universities Certification Officials. Definitions Cancellation - When a student drops ALL courses before the first day of the term.
