The disruption spiraled around the world, from Wall Street to financial markets of the U.K. and Europe and factories and dockyards in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. Tooze explores the hap- hazard nature of economic develop- ment and the path of debt around the world; the way countries and regions are linked through financial interdependence, investment, politics and force; and how the financial crisis interacted with the rise of social me- dia, the crisis of middle-class America, the rise of China, and global struggles over fossil fuels. 212-854-5573 [email protected] Genre Nonfiction Topic Economics Contact Us [email protected] Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University Â©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
