Register SPANISH: LEVEL I Thu., Jun. 16-Jul. 28, 6:30-8:30 pm / $199 / Seven Classes Instructor: Sandra Bazzani In-person at VPC Campus Classes will include some online sessions via Zoom and field trips. This course is designed to help students who would like to learn the basics of Spanish in just a few months. Students will learn common Spanish words and expressions they will likely come across in everyday life. In addition to classroom learning, we will visit Hispanic stores, locations, and events around Cincinnati for a chance to learn about the culture and to practice our Spanish skills. Some of the topics that will be covered are words and phrases needed while on vacation, when ordering food, while in a business meeting, and if you have an emergency in a Spanish-speaking city. This class is a lot of fun and students have ample opportunity to gain confidence in speaking the language. Sandra Bazzani Language Instructor Sandra has a Master's degree in Teaching Spanish as a Foreign Language, and a certificate in Adult Learning. She has a unique ability to teach to all different levels so every student achieves success in learning the language.
