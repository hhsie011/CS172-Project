Nebraska has people who will work 1-to-1 with you to help you get the most out of your experience. You‚Äôll do more than just learn technical skills‚Äîyou‚Äôll grow more flexible and nimble, ready to change the world and adapt with it. Check out the interview below with Kadina Koonce, Exploratory and Pre-Professional Academic Advisor, who works with students to make the most of their time in college as they prepare for a career or grad school. What does an academic advisor do? Academic advisors provide students with guidance and support in identifying their life/career goals. We assist not only with course selection, study skills and campus resources/policies, but also hope to serve as a sounding board, and cheerleader. How do you see your role in helping students achieve success in college? In my role, I encourage students to make and accomplish goals within and beyond their comfort zone, support them through the victories and learning experiences, provide them with information about opportunities, and push them to be self-advocates. How do students work with each other? Through clubs and organizations, our students work with one another to build a community. They work toward the common goal of building personal/professional skills to be competitive for professional school, give back to the community, and have fun. What kinds of experiences do you offer for students outside the classroom? We offer workshops, help students find shadowing opportunities, take a trip to University of Nebraska Medical Center every spring, provide mock interviews and schedule meetings with professional school reps. A little something for everyone! What academic resources do you recommend to students? Academic resources I recommend most to students include going to Success Coaching with the Center for Academic Success and Transition (CAST). They have resources around tutoring, study skills, time management, note-taking, test prep and motivation! How do you help prepare students for a career after college? We help prepare students for a career by assisting them with essays and finding experiences to make them competitive applicants. We encourage students to job shadow, do informational interviews and go to career advising. What advice do you give to help students get the most out of their academic experience? Never be afraid to reach out for help and connect with at least two faculty/staff people on campus. That support/relationship building is so important, especially when feeling lost or unmotivated, it's powerful to know you have someone on your side!
