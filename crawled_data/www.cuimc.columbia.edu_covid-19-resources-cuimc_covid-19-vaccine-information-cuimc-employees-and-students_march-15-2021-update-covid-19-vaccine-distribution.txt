Expansion of eligible groups which now include persons age 60 and over and certain public-facing staff. Faculty, staff and students should check their eligibility by going to https://covid19vaccine.health.ny.gov/ Expansion of place of residence. The place of residence that is used as a criteria for administration of the vaccine has been changed to allow any location in New York State to vaccinate any eligible resident of New York State. Previously, most locations in New York City could only vaccinate residents of New York City. Students who meet other criteria in #2 who are temporary NYS residents due to attending school will be able to get the vaccine. However, faculty and staff who are residents of other states must get the vaccine in their states, unless they are in category 1a (patient facing). Governor Andrew M. Cuomo announced that domestic travelers will no longer be required to quarantine after entering New York from another U.S. State or U.S. Territory starting April 1st. Columbia is reviewing its travel protocols and more information will be forthcoming. Important Reminders Please remember to continue to wear face coverings (preferably surgical masks or other two-ply face coverings), practice physical distancing, and wash hands frequently, even after you have been vaccinated. These measures, in addition to vaccinations, minimize the opportunity for the virus and the disease to spread. While updated CDC guidance states that fully vaccinated individuals in the community do not need to quarantine after exposure to COVID-19, CDC continues to suggest that fully vaccinated health care workers should quarantine after exposure to COVID-19 or travel. Moreover, NYS has not updated their quarantine requirements. Until NYS quarantine requirements are updated, vaccinated individuals must continue to quarantine after exposure to COVID-19. The Armory vaccination site is open Tuesdays through Saturdays, 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. More information is available on CUIMCâ€™s COVID Vaccine Information page. Starting Tuesday 3/16, a new vaccination site will open in the Black Building, at 630 W 168th Street, for eligible individuals. Hours of operation and information about appointment scheduling is forthcoming, including outreach to eligible faculty, staff, and students. In the meantime, schedule your appointment at the Armory on 168th Street by going to VaccineTogetherNY.org or by scheduling at any city site. CUIMC Employees First and second doses: Employees of Columbia, Weill Cornell and NYP who are in category 1a (patient facing) can receive their first and second dose of the vaccine at the Armory. No appointment is necessary for first doses. Appointments are scheduled for second doses, but you can go to the Armory anytime on the day that you are scheduled. All faculty and staff age 65 or older, and those 18 and over with certain underlying chronic medical conditions, can receive a vaccine at any of the NYC or NYS public vaccination sites, or at the Armory if they are NYC residents. Appointments are required, and scheduling information is available at the VaccineTogetherNY website.
