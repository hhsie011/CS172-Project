From humanistic studies of ancient cultures to population studies of timely policy issues, the research and scholarship of our faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates garners major awards, attracts millions of dollars in external funding, influences court cases and social policies, and changes how people think about themselves and the world around them, past, present, and future. The Office of Research and Graduate Studies offers concrete scaffolding to COLA faculty and students as they seek to develop ambitious programs of research and scholarship, successfully complete projects in impactful ways, and translate the knowledge gained from these projects into public use. This scaffolding includes but is not limited to providing support for the pursuit of external funding and the administration of external awards, managing a range of internal fellowship mechanisms, identifying and developing opportunities for research and scholarship, and acting as a liaison to the Office of the Vice President for Research and the Office of Sponsored Projects. No matter the field, subject matter, or approach, the Office of Research and Graduate Studies is here to help COLA faculty and students fully realize their research and career goals.
