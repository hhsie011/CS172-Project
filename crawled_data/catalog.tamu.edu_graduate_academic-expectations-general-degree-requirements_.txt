Faculty and graduate students have a shared obligation to work together to foster these goals through relationships that advance freedom of inquiry, demonstrate individual and professional integrity, and encourage common respect. Graduate student progress is guided and evaluated by an advisor and a graduate committee. These individuals give direction and support for the appropriate developmental and learning goals of a graduate student. The advisor and the graduate committee also have the obligation of evaluating a graduate student’s academic performance. The graduate student, the advisor and the graduate committee constitute the basic core of graduate education. The quality, scope and extent of interaction in this group determines the significance of the graduate experience. High quality graduate education requires the professional and ethical conduct of the participants. Faculty and graduate students have mutual responsibilities in ensuring academic standards and quality graduate programs. Excellence in graduate education is achieved when faculty and students are inspired, have the academic and professional backgrounds essential to function at the highest level, and are genuine in their mutual desire to see one another succeed. Any action that negatively affects this interaction—from either faculty member or student—destroys the whole relationship. Mutual respect is critical to the successful process. The requirements set forth in this catalog are defined as minimum University requirements. Departments, Colleges, and Interdisciplinary Degree Programs may opt to establish higher standards and/or additional requirements. Student Responsibility Each student has a responsibility to: 1. Know specific degree requirements as established by the University and the student’s department, college, or interdisciplinary degree program. 2. Enroll in the appropriate coursework to complete the degree plan. 3. Maintain the appropriate standards to continue in graduate studies. 4. Know steps and deadlines related to graduation. 5. Be acquainted with the Texas A&M University Student Rules. Information about general degree requirements is available in this catalog. Specific degree requirements and procedural guidelines are available from the departmental graduate advisor(s). General Graduate Degree Information Doctor of Philosophy Work leading to the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) is designed to give the candidate a thorough and comprehensive knowledge of the professional field and training in methods of research. Students who graduate with a doctoral degree will: master degree-program requirements; develop a coherent understanding of the subject matter; apply subject matter knowledge to solve problems and make decisions; analyze and integrate information to make critical, reasoned arguments; communicate effectively; develop clear research plans; use appropriate technologies to communicate; teach and explain the subject matter in their discipline; and choose ethical courses of action in research and practice. The degree is not granted solely for the completion of coursework, residence and program requirements, although these must be met. For a student who has completed a master’s degree, a DDS/DMD, DVM, JD, or MD at a U.S. institution, a minimum of 60 hours may be required on the degree plan for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. For a student who has completed a baccalaureate degree but not a master’s degree or a U.S. DDS/DMD, DVM, JD, or MD, a minimum of 90 hours may be required on the degree plan for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. In all cases, program faculty determine the number of hours required upon admission. Professional Doctorate Professional doctorates (EdD, DEng, DrPH) are designed to prepare a candidate for a position of leadership in the full range of settings, including public and private schools, colleges, business, government, industry, and the military establishment. The programs are designed for the practitioner, with emphasis on solving problems to benefit society at large. Students who graduate with a Professional doctoral degree will: master degree-program requirements; develop a coherent understanding of the subject matter; apply subject matter knowledge to solve problems and make decisions; analyze and integrate information to make critical, reasoned arguments; communicate effectively; develop clear research plans; use appropriate technologies to communicate; teach and explain the subject matter in their discipline; and choose ethical courses of action in research and practice. Because graduates of the program are expected to demonstrate a high level of professional skill and educational statesmanship, only those candidates who show a consistently high level of professional performance in their academic studies, in their role-related studies, in their internship experience, and in the completion of their records of study will be recommended for the degree. For a student who has completed a master’s degree, a DDS/DMD, DVM, JD, or MD at a U.S. institution, a minimum of 60 hours may be required on the degree plan for a professional doctorate. For a student who has completed a baccalaureate degree but not a master’s degree or a U.S. DDS/DMD, DVM, JD, or MD, a minimum of 90 hours may be required on the degree plan. In all cases, program faculty determine the number of hours required upon admission. First Professional Doctorate First Professional Degrees include a Doctor of Medicine (MD), Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS), Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM), Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) and Juris Doctor (JD). The programs are designed to develop broadly competent practitioners. They typically combine intensive coursework with clinical/practical rotations in the field. Students who graduate with a first professional doctoral degree will: master degree-program requirements; develop a coherent understanding of the subject matter; apply subject matter knowledge to solve problems and make decisions; analyze and integrate information to make critical, reasoned arguments; communicate effectively; develop clear research plans; use appropriate technologies to communicate; teach and explain the subject matter in their discipline; and choose ethical courses of action in research and practice. Master’s Work leading to the master’s degree is designed to give the candidate a thorough and comprehensive knowledge of the field beyond that of the undergraduate degree. Students who graduate with a master’s degree will: demonstrate proficiency of degree-program requirements; apply subject matter knowledge in a range of contexts to solve problems and make decisions; use a variety of sources and evaluate multiple points of view to analyze and integrate information; communicate effectively; use appropriate technologies; develop clear research plans and conduct appropriate research; and choose ethical courses of action in research and practice. A minimum of 30 hours may be required for completion of the master’s degree. Scholastic Requirements Unless otherwise stated, students in graduate degree programs and post-baccalaureate non-degree students (G6 classification) must maintain a 3.000 cumulative GPA (computed as specified in Student Rule 10.4.3). Degree-seeking students also must maintain a GPA of at least 3.000 on all courses listed on a degree plan. Departments and colleges may establish higher GPA requirements for their students in graduate degree programs and for post-baccalaureate non-degree students (G6 classification). A graduate student will not receive graduate degree credit for undergraduate courses taken on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis. A graduate student may not receive grades other than S (satisfactory) or U (unsatisfactory) in graduate courses bearing the numbers 681, 684, 690, 691, 692, 693, 695, 697, and 791 (except for ALEC 695, BUAD 693, AGEC 695, GEOG 695, and IBUS 692). These officially designated S/U courses may be listed on a degree plan, along with other courses approved and noted as S/U in the graduate catalog. *Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Faculty Senate in March 2020 recommended: All academic programs that normally require a course for a letter grade must accept S/U grades for all courses the Spring 2020 semester. Additional information is available on the COVID-19 Guidance website. Graduate courses not listed on a degree plan may be taken on an S/U basis. Only grades of A, B, C, and S are acceptable for graduate credit. For graduate students, grades of D, F or U (unsatisfactory) for courses on the degree plan must be absolved by repeating the courses and achieving grades of C or above or S (satisfactory). If a course has been taken more than once, and a grade of D or F was earned and then repeated for a grade of C or higher, the original grades of D or F will be excluded from the GPA calculation for the degree plan (if applicable) and cumulative GPA, but remain on the student’s permanent record. A course in which the final grade is C may be repeated for a higher grade. If the second grade is higher, the original grade will be excluded from the GPA calculation for the degree plan (if applicable) and cumulative GPA, but remain on the student’s permanent record. Repeat grades and cumulative GPA for financial aid programs may differ from those listed above, based on the type of aid. Rules related to F* grades and repeat courses may be found under Student Rule 20 and on the Aggie Honor System Office website under Sanctions. If a minimum GPA is not attained in a reasonable length of time, a student may be dismissed from graduate studies. A degree-seeking graduate student may also be considered scholastically deficient if they fail to show acceptable proficiency in such other requisites for their degree as may be assigned by the graduate committee, department, or the Graduate and Professional School (e.g., qualifying and preliminary examinations, research, writing or a thesis or dissertation, etc.). A post-baccalaureate non-degree student (G6 classification) who has completed 12 hours of course work is considered to be scholastically deficient when the student’s grade point ratio falls below 3.00 or below a higher standard set by the department or college of affiliation; or the student fails to show proficiency in such other areas as may be specified by the program’s department or the Graduate and Professional School. For a scholastically deficient post-baccalaureate non-degree student (G6 classification), the student’s home department shall determine eligibility, and the department is responsible for notifying the Graduate and Professional School if a registration block is to be placed on the student. The details of scholastic deficiency and procedures for dismissal are explained in Texas A&M University Student Rule 12. Departments or colleges may adopt specific guidelines pertaining to scholastic deficiency or dismissal. New Graduate Student Orientation https://grad.tamu.edu/current-students/new-graduate-student-orientation Coordinated by the Graduate and Professional School, the New Graduate Student Orientation provides an overview of graduate and professional education and services at Texas A&M University – including information on financial aid, procedures and processes, campus safety, writing services and additional campus services. New graduate and professional students will have the opportunity to meet campus leaders, administrators, and fellow graduate students. Experienced graduate students will be present to answer questions and provide insight about thriving in graduate school, balancing school, work, and personal life, and making the most of living in the local communities. Designed to get new graduate and professional students off to a good start, students will also have the opportunity to mingle and explore resources and meet representatives of campus services and organizations who serve the graduate and professional community. For additional information about New Graduate Student Orientation, please contact the Graduate and Professional School at grad@tamu.edu. On This Page Requirements for a Certificate Graduation Application, Certificate and Commencement Certificate/Graduation Fee Requirements for a Certificate A student must receive permission from the department offering the certificate and their primary academic advisor in order to pursue a certificate. All requirements outlined in the catalog and degree evaluation for the specific certificate program must be met in order for a certificate to be awarded. Certificate types: Major-dependent - A student is admitted to the program through the offering department. Admission to the program requires the student to pursue a specific degree/major at Texas A&M University. This type of certificate program typically serves as a track within a degree program. The certificate and degree are awarded simultaneously. Degree-dependent - A student is admitted to the program through the offering department. Admission to the program simply requires that the student pursue a degree at Texas A&M University. The certificate may or may not be related to their specific degree/major. The certificate is awarded upon completion of the requirements independent of a degree. Stand-alone - A student is admitted to the program through the Office of Admissions. The student may pursue the certificate without being enrolled in a degree program. The certificate may be awarded upon completion of requirements. Graduation Application, Certificate and Commencement Beginning fall 2017, formal application for certificates to be awarded must be submitted online in Howdy by the deadline stated in the academic calendar. Certificates are granted to students who make formal application for the certificate to be awarded, have all grades on record in the Office of the Registrar, and have satisfied all certificate requirements. With the exception of major dependent certificates, which are awarded at the end of each term along with the student's associated degree, certificates are awarded on the last calendar day of the month in which they are completed. In months where a commencement ceremony is held, degree-dependent and stand-alone certificates will be awarded with the conferral date for that term's commencement. Students that have made a formal application for a certificate in a given semester/term must have all requirements satisfied no later than 5 p.m., Friday, the first week of classes of the succeeding semester or summer term for the certificate to be formally awarded. Students must have settled all financial obligations to the university prior to receiving a certificate. University certificates will either be mailed directly to the student or issued to the college for formal presentation. Certificate/Graduation Fee At this time, there is not a fee associated with the awarding of a certificate from Texas A&M University. For additional information regarding certificate tracking and awarding, please visit the Office of the Registrar website. On This Page Residence Requirement Degree Plan Petitions Limitations on the Use of Transfer, Extension, and Certain Other Courses for Master's Degrees Transfer of Credit for Doctoral Degrees Preliminary Examination for Doctoral Students Research Proposal Admission to Candidacy Final Examination for Doctoral Students Final Examination for Master's Students Thesis, Dissertation and Record of Study Graduation Letter of Completion Letter of Intent Professional Internship 99-Hour Cap on Doctoral Degrees Residence Requirement A major purpose of the residence requirements for graduate degrees is to ensure that students have an opportunity to benefit from the advantages of a university environment. These advantages include accessibility to libraries, laboratories, and other physical facilities, as well as opportunities to participate in seminars and a variety of cultural activities. Equally important to graduate students are the advantages of becoming acquainted with the faculty and other students on personal and professional bases. Students “in residence” are expected to devote sufficient time and energy to graduate studies under the direction of an advisory committee chair and the advisory committee members. Another major purpose of the residence requirements for graduate degrees is to ensure that faculty have the opportunity to properly evaluate students’ development, to guide and direct their studies, and to determine competency. For specific minimum residence requirements, students should check the additional requirements section in the graduate catalog for the degree they are pursuing. Degree Plan Graduate students must file a degree plan which includes those courses to be applied toward a particular degree and formally establishes an advisory committee. Courses previously used for another degree are not acceptable for degree plan credit. Lower division undergraduate coursework (100- and 200-level) may not be used for credit toward a graduate degree. Coursework applied to a previous degree may not count toward a graduate degree. Coursework may not satisfy requirements for more than one degree except for approved combined degree programs. A student’s advisory committee may add additional coursework to an approved degree plan. Specific details and requirements for each degree program may be obtained from a student’s academic department or the specific degree program requirements provided in the Texas A&M University Catalog. No changes can be made to the degree plan once the student’s Request for Final Examination or Request for Final Examination Exemption is approved by the Graduate and Professional School. Changes in the approved degree plan may be made by petition to the Graduate and Professional School. A student should submit a degree plan and petitions online using the Document Processing Submission System (DPSS). Degree program time limits apply to courses listed on a degree plan. Details are available on the Time Limits section in each degree program page. For doctoral non-distance degree programs, no more than four courses may be taken by distance education without approval of the Graduate and Professional School and no more than 50 percent of the non-research credit hours required for the program may be completed through distance education courses. To receive a graduate degree from Texas A&M University, students must earn one-third or more of their credits through the institution’s own direct instruction. This limitation also applies to joint, dual, combined, or combination degree programs. Petitions Graduate students may use petitions to request a change of major, department, or degree program; request changes to the coursework or committee membership as established by a degree plan; request a leave of absence; request extensions to time limits; or request exceptions to published rules. The Graduate and Professional School considers each petition on its own merit. A student should make such requests online by submitting either a Change of Major, Department, or Degree Program (MDD) Petition or a Long Form Petition through the Document Processing Submission System (DPSS). The petition will be routed for the required approval by the members of a student’s advisory committee (if appointed), and the department head, designee, or chair of the intercollegiate faculty (if appropriate). Limitations on the Use of Transfer, Extension, and Certain Other Courses for Master's Degrees If otherwise acceptable, certain courses may be used toward meeting credit-hour requirements for the master’s degree under the following limitations. Some departments may have more restrictive requirements for transfer work. The transfer of credits must be approved by the student’s advisory committee and the Associate Provost and Dean of the Graduate and Professional School. 1. The maximum number of credit hours which may be considered for transfer credit is the greater of 12 hours or one-third (1/3) of the total hours of a degree plan. The following restrictions apply. Graduate and/or upper-level undergraduate courses with a final grade of B or greater taken in residence at an accredited United States institution or approved international institution will be considered for transfer credit if, at the time the courses were completed, the student was in degree-seeking status at Texas A&M University, or the student was in degree-seeking status at the institution at which the courses were taken, and if the courses would be accepted for credit toward a similar degree for a student in degree-seeking status at the host institution. Courses previously used for another degree are not acceptable for degree plan credit. 2. The maximum number of credit hours taken in post-baccalaureate non-degree (G6) classification at Texas A&M University which may be considered for application to the degree plan is 12. 3. A zero-credit 684 or 685 course is only allowed for non-thesis option master's students. A zero-credit 681 course can be used for either thesis or non-thesis option master’s students. Other courses, including 691 research hours, are not eligible for zero credit. 4. No more than 12 hours may be used in any combination of the following categories: no more than 8 hours in the combination of 691 (Research), 684 (Professional Internship) or SOPH 680 may be used; no more than 8 hours of 685 (Directed Studies) may be used; no more than 3 hours of 690 (Theory of Research) may be used; or no more than 3 hours of 695 (Frontiers in Research) may be used. 5. A maximum of 2 hours of 681 (Seminar). 6. A maximum of 9 hours of advanced undergraduate courses (300- or 400-level). 7. For graduate courses of three weeks’ duration or less, taken at other institutions, up to 1 hour of credit may be obtained for each five-day week of coursework. Each week of coursework must include at least 15 contact hours. 8. Continuing education courses may not be used for graduate credit. 9. Extension courses are not acceptable for credit. 10. For non-distance degree programs, no more than 50 percent of the credit hours required for the program may be completed through distance education courses. 11. To receive a graduate degree from Texas A&M University, students must earn one-third or more of the credits through the institution’s own direct instruction. This limitation also applies to joint, dual, combined, and combination degree programs. Exceptions will be permitted only in special cases when petitioned by a student’s advisory committee and approved by the Graduate and Professional School. Transfer of Credit for Doctoral Degrees Courses for which transfer credits are sought must have been completed with a grade of B or greater and must be approved by a student’s advisory committee and the Associate Provost and Dean of the Graduate and Professional School. Certain conditions apply to transfer credits: 1. these courses must not have been used previously for another degree; 2. credit for thesis or dissertation research, or the equivalent is not, transferable except for officially approved cooperative doctoral programs; 3. credit for “internship” coursework in any form is not transferable; 4. courses taken in residence at an accredited United States institution or approved international institution with a final grade of B or greater will be considered for transfer credit if, at the time the courses were completed, the courses would be accepted for credit toward a similar degree for a student in degree-seeking status at the host institution; 5. credit for coursework taken by extension is not transferable; 6. coursework in which no formal grades are given, or in which grades other than letter grades (A or B) are earned (for example, CR, P, S, U, H, etc.), is not accepted for transfer credit; and 7. credit for coursework submitted for transfer from any college or university must be shown in semester credit hours, or equated to semester credit hours. Courses used toward a degree at another institution may not be applied for graduate credit. If the course to be transferred was taken prior to the conferral of a degree at the transfer institution, a letter from the registrar at that institution stating that the course was not applied for credit toward the degree must be submitted to the Graduate and Professional School. Grades for courses completed at other institutions are not included in computing the GPA. An official transcript from the university at which transfer courses were taken must be sent directly to the Office of Admissions. Preliminary Examination for Doctoral Students A student’s major department or chair of the interdisciplinary degree program faculty (if applicable) and the student advisory committee may require qualifying, cumulative, or other types of examinations at any time deemed desirable. These examinations are entirely at the discretion of the department and the student’s advisory committee. Preliminary Examination Requirement A preliminary examination for doctoral students shall be given no earlier than a date at which a student is within 6 credit hours of completing formal coursework on a degree plan (i.e., all coursework on a degree plan except 681, 684, 690, 691, 692, 693, 695, 697, 791, or other graduate courses specifically designated as S/U in the course Catalog). A student should complete a preliminary exam no later than the end of the semester following the completion of formal coursework on a degree plan. Preliminary Examination Format The objective of preliminary examinations is to evaluate whether a student has demonstrated the following qualifications: mastery of the subject matter of all fields in the program; adequate knowledge of the literature in these fields and an ability to carry out bibliographical research; and understanding of the research problem and appropriate methodological approaches. The format of a preliminary examination shall be determined by a student’s department or interdisciplinary degree program (if applicable) and advisory committee, and communicated to the student in advance of the examination. The exam may consist of a written component, oral component, or combination of written and oral components. A preliminary exam may be administered by an advisory committee or a departmental committee (herein referred to as an “examination committee”). Regardless of exam format, a student will receive an overall preliminary exam result of pass or fail. The department, or interdisciplinary degree program (if applicable), will determine how the overall pass or fail result is determined based on the examination structure and internal department procedures. If the exam is administered by an advisory committee, each advisory committee member will provide a pass or fail evaluation decision. Only one advisory committee substitution is allowed to provide an evaluation decision for a student’s preliminary exam, and it cannot be the committee chair. If a student is required to take, as a part of a preliminary examination, a written component administered by a department or interdisciplinary degree program, the department or interdisciplinary degree program faculty must offer the examination at least once every six months, and the departmental or interdisciplinary degree program examination should be announced at least 30 days prior to the scheduled examination date; assume responsibility for marking the examination satisfactory or unsatisfactory – or otherwise graded – and in the case of unsatisfactory, stating specifically the reasons for such a mark; and forward the marked examination to the student’s advisory committee chair within one week after the examination. Preliminary Examination Scheduling Prior to commencing any component of the preliminary examination, a departmental representative or an advisory committee chair will review the eligibility criteria with the student, using the Preliminary Examination Checklist to ensure the student is eligible for the preliminary examination. The following list of eligibility requirements applies. Student is registered at Texas A&M University for a minimum of one semester credit hour in the long semester or summer term during which any component of a preliminary examination is held. If the entire examination is held between semesters, then the student must have been registered for the term immediately preceding the examination. An approved degree plan is on file with the Graduate and Professional School prior to commencing the first component of the examination. A cumulative GPA of at least 3.000. A degree plan GPA of at least 3.000. At the end of the semester in which at least the first component of the exam is given, there are no more than 6 hours of coursework remaining on the degree plan (except 681, 684, 690, 691, 692, 693, 695, 697, 791, or other graduate courses specifically designated as S/U in the course catalog). The head of the student’s department, or Chair of the Interdisciplinary Degree Program (if applicable), has the authority to approve a waiver of this requirement. Report of Preliminary Examination Credit for the preliminary examination is not transferable in cases where a student changes degree programs after passing a preliminary exam. If a written component precedes an oral component of the preliminary exam, the chair of the student’s examination committee is responsible for making all written examinations available to all members of the committee. A positive evaluation of the preliminary exam by all members of a student’s examination committee, with at most one dissension, is required to pass a student on his or her preliminary exam. Only one committee member substitution is allowed with prior approval of the Graduate and Professional School. A student’s department will promptly report the results of the Preliminary Examination to the Graduate and Professional School via the Report of Doctoral Preliminary Examination Form. The Preliminary Examination Checklist Form must also be submitted. These forms should be submitted to the Graduate and Professional School within 10 working days of completion of a preliminary examination with the decision of all approved committee members and with the approval of a department head or approved authorized designee. After passing the required preliminary examination for the doctoral degree, a student must complete the final examination for the degree within four calendar years; otherwise, the student will be required to repeat the preliminary examination. Retake of Failed Preliminary Examination Upon approval of a student’s examination committee (with no more than one member dissenting), and approval of the Graduate and Professional School, a student who has failed a preliminary examination may be given one re-examination. Adequate time must be given to permit a student to address inadequacies emerging from the first preliminary examination. The examination committee must agree upon and communicate to the student, in writing, an adequate time-frame from the first examination (normally six months) to retest, as well as a detailed explanation of the inadequacies emerging from the examination. The student and committee should jointly negotiate a mutually acceptable date for this retest. When providing feedback on inadequacies, the committee should clearly document expected improvements that the student must be able to exhibit in order to retake the exam. The examination committee will document and communicate the time-frame and feedback within 10 working days of the exam that was not passed. Research Proposal Thesis-option master’s degrees and all doctoral degrees require a Research Proposal. The proposal must be approved by an advisory committee and the head of the major department or chair of the intercollegiate faculty (if applicable). Compliance issues must be addressed if a graduate student is performing research involving human subjects, animals, infectious biohazards, or recombinant DNA. A student involved in these types of research should check with the Office of Research Compliance and Biosafety to address questions about all research compliance responsibilities before the proposal is submitted to the Graduate and Professional School. Master’s Students For master’s thesis option students, a proposal and proposal approval form must be submitted to the Graduate and Professional School at least 20 working days prior to the submission of a request for final examination. Doctoral Students For doctoral students, a proposal and proposal approval form should be submitted to the Graduate and Professional School according to guidelines and deadlines set by individual department or program and as soon as possible following the completion of formal coursework on a degree plan. Admission to Candidacy To be admitted to candidacy for a doctoral degree, a student must complete all formal coursework on the degree plan (with the exception of any remaining 681, 684, 690, 691, 692, 791, or other graduate courses specifically designated as S/U in the course catalog); achieve a 3.0 cumulative GPA and a Degree Plan GPA of at least 3.0, with no grade lower than C in any course on the degree plan; pass the preliminary examination; submit an approved dissertation research proposal; and meet the residence requirements. The final examination will not be authorized for any doctoral student who has not been admitted to candidacy. Final Examination for Doctoral Students Candidates for doctoral degrees must pass a final examination by deadline dates announced through the Graduate and Professional School Calendar each semester. A doctoral student is allowed only one opportunity to take the final examination. No unabsolved grades of D, F, or U for any course may be listed on a degree plan. A student must register for any remaining hours of 681, 684, 690, 691, 692, 791, or other graduate courses specifically designated as S/U in the course catalog during the semester of the final exam. No student may undergo a final examination until they have been admitted to candidacy and their current cumulative and degree plan GPAs are 3.00 or better. Refer to the Admission to Candidacy section of the graduate catalog for candidacy requirements. A request to hold and announce the final examination must be submitted to the Graduate and Professional School a minimum of 10 working days in advance of the scheduled date. Any changes to the degree plan must be approved by the Graduate and Professional School prior to the submission of the Request for Final Examination. A student’s advisory committee will conduct this examination. Only one committee member substitution is allowed with the approval of the Graduate and Professional School. The final examination is not to be administered until the dissertation or record of study is available in substantially final form to a student’s advisory committee, and all concerned have had adequate time to review the document. Whereas the final examination may cover the broad field of the candidate’s training, it is presumed that the major portion of the time will be devoted to the dissertation and closely allied topics. Persons other than members of the graduate faculty may, with mutual consent of the candidate and the chair of the advisory committee, attend final examinations for advanced degrees. A positive vote by all members of a graduate committee – with, at most, one dissension – is required for a student to pass their final exam. Upon completion of a candidate’s questioning, all visitors must excuse themselves from the proceedings. Report of Final Examination A student’s department will promptly report the results of a Final Examination to the Graduate and Professional School via the Report of Doctoral Final Examination form. These forms should be submitted to the Graduate and Professional School within 10 working days of completion of the final examination with decisions from all approved committee members. The Graduate and Professional School must receive, in writing, notification of any cancellations. Final Examination for Master's Students A positive evaluation by all members of a graduate committee – with at most one dissension – is required for students to pass their final examination. Persons other than members of the graduate faculty may, with mutual consent of the candidate and the major professor, attend final examinations for advanced degrees. Upon completion of the questioning of the candidate, all visitors must excuse themselves from the proceedings. A student shall be given only one opportunity to repeat a final examination for the master’s degree, and that must be within a time period that does not extend beyond the end of the next regular semester (summer terms excluded). A department may have stricter requirements provided there is consistency among all degree programs within a department. A student’s department will promptly report results of a final exam to the Graduate and Professional School via the Report of Final Examination Form through DocuSign. These forms should be submitted to the Graduate and Professional School within 10 working days of completion of a final examination with decisions from all approved committee members. The Graduate and Professional School must receive notification, in writing, of any cancellations. Thesis Option For a thesis option student, a final examination may cover the thesis and all work taken on a degree plan. At the option of the committee, it may be written or oral or both. A final exam may not be administered before a thesis is available to all members of a student’s advisory committee in substantially final form and all members have had adequate time to review the document. Examination is conducted by a student’s advisory committee. A thesis option student must be registered at the university in the semester or summer term in which the final examination is taken. A thesis option candidate may petition to be exempt from a final examination provided the degree plan GPA is 3.500 or greater and have the approval of the advisory committee, the head of the student’s department, and the Graduate and Professional School. It is recommended that the petition for exemption be submitted the same semester the student intends to submit the thesis. Non-Thesis Option For non-thesis option students, a final comprehensive examination may be required. A final exam cannot be held prior to the mid-point of the semester if questions on the exam are based on courses in which the student is currently enrolled. If a student has completed all required degree plan coursework, the student is not required to be registered for classes in the semester a final examination is administered (unless they hold an assistantship). For specific final examination requirements, students should check the program requirements for the degree they are pursuing. Thesis, Dissertation and Record of Study Manuscript Requirements The Graduate and Professional School is responsible for reviewing each thesis, dissertation, and record of study to ensure that the format requirements of the University are met. Guidelines and electronic templates for the preparation of the manuscript are available in the Guidelines for Theses, Dissertations, and Records of Study and online at https://grad.tamu.edu/academics/academic-success-resources/thesis-dissertation-services. All manuscripts must be submitted electronically. Texas A&M offers free Overleaf Professional accounts for all students, faculty and staff who would like to use a collaborative, online Overleaf (LaTeX) editor for their projects. Overleaf is designed to make the process of writing, editing and producing your research papers, project reports, and ETD much quicker for both you and your collaborators. Students can use Overleaf to receive real-time feedback from their graduate advisors on their final thesis, dissertation or record of study. Pre-Defense Publication of Thesis, Dissertation, or Record of Study Material A graduate student may publish material that subsequently will be used as part of the thesis, dissertation, or record of study. A student should be aware of the copyright agreement that is signed when a journal (hard copy or electronic) accepts an article for publication. At that time, the student generally assigns rights to the journal as publisher. If the student has not retained the right to use the material in the thesis, dissertation, or record of study, the student must obtain written permission from the copyright holder to include the material in the manuscript. If such permission is not obtained, or rights have not been retained, the copyrighted material cannot be included in the thesis, dissertation, or record of study. Use of Classified and Proprietary Information in Thesis, Dissertation, or Record of Study Committee chairs are cautioned against allowing a student to use classified or proprietary information in electronic theses, dissertations, and records of study (ETDs), because these documents will become available to the public. The research conducted at Texas A&M, as a Texas public institution, is ultimately for the benefit of the public. All ETDs are available on the Internet via the Texas A&M digital repository. In addition, dissertations are published electronically by ProQuest (UMI) and are available from that source. A temporary embargo, or delay in public release, is possible. Graduation A graduate degree is conferred at the close of each regular semester and 10-week summer semester. A candidate for an advanced degree who expects to complete their work at the end of a given semester must apply for graduation by submitting the electronic application for degree to the Office of the Registrar and by paying the required graduation fee to Student Business Services no later than the Friday of the fifth week of the fall or spring semester or the Friday of the first week of the second summer term. The electronic application can be accessed via the Howdy portal. A cancellation made after the application deadline will not result in a refund of the graduation fee. Graduate degree candidates who have completed all degree requirements will not be allowed to cancel their graduation application without approval from the Graduate and Professional School. Graduation ceremony dates and times are listed online at http://graduation.tamu.edu . Qatar Students Formal application for a degree at Texas A&M University at Qatar is done via the Howdy Portal. Students should navigate to the My Record tab and use the link in the Degree Evaluation channel to submit an Application for Graduation. Students must also pay the required diploma fee and the optional regalia fee (if planning to attend the commencement ceremony) using the Online Payment Portal. Applications for graduation should be submitted by the deadline stated in the Texas A&M University at Qatar academic calendar. Under unusual circumstances, an application for a degree may be accepted after the stated deadline. Students must have settled all financial obligations to the university and Qatar Foundation prior to receiving a diploma. Texas A&M University at Qatar graduate and undergraduate students completing their degree in July or December will have the opportunity to participate in the commencement ceremony in May, following the completion of their degree. Students must participate in the commencement ceremony at their home campus. Letter of Completion The Graduate and Professional School may issue, if necessary, a Letter of Completion for an individual student upon written request from the student. The letter certifies that the student has completed all academic requirements for a degree and states the date a degree will be awarded. International students should contact International Student Services prior to requesting a letter of completion to determine how receipt could affect the student’s visa status. A Letter of Completion may be requested anytime from the point a student has completed all requirements for the awarding of a degree and until five days prior to commencement. A student in a master’s thesis option or a doctoral program must have completed all degree requirements – including final clearance of a thesis or dissertation by the Graduate and Professional School – for eligibility to request a letter. For students in a master’s non-thesis option programs, requests for a Letter of Completion will be accepted only if the student has completed all degree plan coursework and the Graduate and Professional School has approved the final examination results (if applicable). Letter of Intent Students completing a graduate degree who wish to enroll in pursuit of another graduate degree at Texas A&M University should initiate the process of filing a Letter of Intent with the admitting department for the subsequent graduate degree. Letters of Intent are common when students apply to pursue a subsequent degree within the same department and college, but may not be acceptable for students applying for a subsequent degree in a different discipline from their current degree. A Letter of Intent, when approved by the head of the department or chair of the intercollegiate faculty (if applicable) in which the student intends to study, will be viewed by the Graduate and Professional School as an admission to the program specified in the letter. A student must use the Letter of Intent Form available through the Graduate and Professional School website. If a student wishes to enroll in a department where a Letter of Intent is not the accepted practice, the admitting department should consult with the Office of Admissions and the Graduate and Professional School to pursue an alternate process for admission. If a break in enrollment occurs for one academic year or longer following graduation, the student must apply for admission to another graduate degree program through the Office of Admissions before enrolling in another graduate degree program. Professional Internship For programs which include a professional internship (see individual program requirements), a student will spend an appropriate period of time under the supervision of a practicing professional in business, an educational institution, government agency, or industry. The objectives of the internship are two-fold, to enable students to demonstrate the ability to apply training and knowledge by making an identifiable contribution in an area of practical concern to the industry or organization in which the internship is served; and to enable students to function in a non-academic environment, and in a position in which they will become aware of organizational approaches to problems in addition to those traditional approaches with which students are familiar. These may include – but are in no way limited to – economics, environmental protection, labor relations, problems of management, public relations, etc. Internship agreements should be negotiated between an appropriate organization or industry and the appropriate academic department. The organization of an internship, an internship supervisor, and the nature of an internship will be determined by mutual consent of the student, the head of the student’s major department, the student’s advisory committee, and the supervising organization prior to commencement of an internship period. An internship experience should be at a level commensurate with the particular degree objectives. An internship report should be prepared by a student in accordance with guidelines established by a student’s major department, a student’s advisory committee, or other appropriate body. The report should be submitted to the advisory committee and to any other organization which may be specified for specific programs. The internship report must be the original work of a student. An internship, if utilized as part of a student’s degree requirements, should be undertaken near the end of the student’s educational program, after the student has had the opportunity to establish a solid theoretical base for an internship experience. 99-Hour Cap on Doctoral Degrees In Texas, public colleges and universities are funded by the state according to the number of students enrolled. In accordance with legislation passed by the Texas Legislature, the number of hours for which state universities may receive subvention funding at the doctoral rate for any individual is limited to 99 hours. Texas A&M and other universities will not receive subvention for hours in excess of the limit. Institutions of higher education are allowed to charge the equivalent of non-resident tuition to a resident doctoral student who has enrolled in 100 or more semester credit hours of doctoral coursework. Doctoral students at Texas A&M have seven years to complete their degree before being charged out-of-state tuition. A doctoral student who, after seven years of study, has accumulated 100 or more doctoral hours will be charged tuition at a rate equivalent to out-of-state tuition. Please note that the tuition increases will apply to Texas residents as well as students from other states and countries who are currently charged tuition at the resident rate. This includes those doctoral students who hold GAT, GANT, and GAR appointments or recipients of competitive fellowships who receive more than $1,000 per semester. Doctoral students who have not accumulated 100 hours after seven years of study are eligible to pay in-state tuition if otherwise eligible. For counting purposes, a year is counted as three semesters – normally fall, spring, and summer. Using this system, a student is allowed 21 semesters as a G8 student to complete the doctoral degree before being penalized with the higher tuition rate. Any semester in which a G8 student is enrolled for a doctoral-level course is counted. Doctoral students who exceed the credit limit will receive notification from the Graduate and Professional School during the semester in which they are enrolled and exceeding the limit in their current degree program. The notification will explain that the State of Texas does not provide funding for any additional hours in which a student is enrolled in excess of 99 hours. Texas A&M University will recover the lost funds by requiring students in excess of 99 hours to pay tuition at the non-funded, non-resident rate. This non-funded, non-resident tuition rate status will be updated for the following semester and in all subsequent semesters until receipt of a doctoral degree. Please see the Tuition Calculator at the non-resident rate for an example of potential charges. The following majors are exempt from the 99-Hou Camp on Doctoral Degrees and have a limit of 130 doctoral hours: Biochemistry Biomedical Sciences Clinical Psychology Counseling Psychology Epidemiology and Environmental Health Genetics and Genomics Health Services Research Medical Sciences Microbiology Neurosciences (College of Medicine) Nutrition Oral and Craniofacial Biomedical Sciences Pharmaceutical Sciences Public Health Sciences School Psychology Toxicology On This Page General Information Full-Time Status Maximum Schedule Continuous Registration Requirements In Absentia Leave of Absence Limitations for Texas A&M Faculty and Staff on Graduate Committee Faculty Undergraduates Registering for Graduate Courses VA Benefits Course Load Requirements for International Students with F-1 or J-1 Status Classification Semester Credit Hour General Information Registration requirements for a graduate student holding an assistantship and/or fellowship are discussed in the section on Financial Assistance. Full-Time Status Graduate students (domestic or international) are considered full-time if they are registered for a minimum of: 9 semester credit hours during a fall or spring semester 6 semester credit hours during a summer semester A Q grade or W grade does not count toward the certification of enrollment status. Colleges and departments may impose additional semester credit hour requirements for a student holding an assistantship or fellowship which exceeds the minimum stated above. Special considerations relate to “full time status” for an international student. Please refer to the information on this subject in the “Course Load Requirements for International (Non-Immigrant) Students with F1 or J1 Status” section. A student who has financial assistance should consult the Scholarships & Financial Aid section of the catalog, call (979) 845-3236, or visit http://financialaid.tamu.edu, for enrollment requirements. Maximum Schedule Fall/Spring: A graduate student may register for a maximum of 15 hours. The college dean’s office can approve/register a student for up to 18 hours. A request to register for more than 18 hours should be submitted to the Graduate and Professional School via the Petition for Waivers or Exceptions to University Requirements and must include the course/section number and the semester of registration. If approved, maximum allowable hours will be updated accordingly by the Graduate and Professional School, and the academic department will register the student for the additional hours. 5-week summer session: A graduate student may register for a maximum of 6 hours. The college dean’s office can approve/register a student for up to 9 hours. A request to register for more than 9 hours should be submitted to the Graduate and Professional School via the Petition for Waivers or Exceptions to University Requirements and must include the course/section number and the semester of registration. If approved, maximum allowable hours will be updated accordingly by the Graduate and Professional School, and the academic department will register the student for the additional hours. 10-week summer session: A graduate student may register for a maximum of 10 hours. The college dean’s office can approve/register a student for up to 15 hours. A request to register for more than 15 hours should be submitted to the Graduate and Professional School on the Petition for Waivers or Exceptions to University Requirements and must include the course/section number and the semester of registration. If approved, maximum allowable hours will be updated accordingly by the Graduate and Professional School, and the academic department will register the student for the additional hours. Continuous Registration Requirements Students in graduate degree programs requiring a thesis, dissertation, internship, or record of study who have completed all coursework on a degree plan, other than 691 (Research), 684 (Internship), or 692 (Professional Study); are required to maintain continuous registration until the completion of all requirements for a degree. Registration for zero-credit 681, 684 or 685 courses only does not satisfy the continuous registration requirement for students in graduate degree programs requiring a thesis, dissertation, internship, or record of study. Other courses, including 691 (Research) hours, are not eligible for zero credit. The continuous registration requirement may be satisfied by registering either In Absentia or In Residence. Unless a student plans to take examinations or use university resources, which includes any interaction with their graduate committee, registration during the summer is not required to fulfill the continuous registration requirement; however, colleges, departments, or intercollegiate faculty may have additional or higher requirements. Students who do not comply with the continuous registration requirement will be blocked from registration. A student may register again after receiving favorable recommendation from a departmental review committee (not the student’s advisory committee), endorsement of the department head or chair of the intercollegiate faculty, and approval of the Graduate and Professional School. If a break in enrollment occurs for one academic year or longer, the student must apply for readmission to the graduate degree program through Graduate Admissions. In Absentia Registration To qualify for In Absentia registration, a student must not have access to or use of facilities or properties belonging to or under the jurisdiction of the Texas A&M University System at any time during the semester or summer term for which the student is enrolled. A student who qualifies for In Absentia registration must register in each subsequent fall and spring semester for a minimum of one and maximum of four credit hours of 691, 684, 685, or 692. Departments and colleges may have additional or higher requirements. In Residence Registration A student subject to In Residence registration (i.e., on campus) must register in each subsequent fall and spring semester, and each 10-week summer semester, for at least one credit hour. University departments and colleges may have additional or higher requirements. International Student Registration Requirements An international student may have additional registration requirements depending on their visa status. The student should consult with the International Student Services website or an International Student Services advisor to obtain current information on these requirements. In Absentia A student may register In Absentia if enrolled in a course which is offered on an individual basis and conducted away from the College Station campus, System campuses, or facilities such as Agricultural Research and Extension Centers, Research Stations, or other properties under the jurisdiction of the Texas A&M University System. Such courses may include – but are not limited to – internships, directed studies, practicums, etc. To qualify for In Absentia registration, a student must not have access to or use of facilities of the Texas A&M University System at any time during the semester or summer term for which he or she is enrolled. The definition of “facilities” includes human resources and services such as those provided by graduate advisory committee members responding to drafts of theses, dissertations, or records of study material, etc. A student holding a fellowship or assistantship may not register In Absentia. An international student may require work authorization or other authorizations when registered In Absentia, and should complete an “In Absentia Letter” to start this process. (Sample letters are available online or at International Student Services.) A student going outside the United States and registering In Absentia should complete online emergency notification information so university assistance is available during crisis situations. More details about this are available on the Education Abroad Programs website https://abroad.tamu.edu. Leave of Absence Under special circumstances, a student may petition for a leave of absence of up to one year. A Petition for Leave of Absence must be initiated by the student through the Document Processing Submission System (DPSS).The entire advisory committee (if formed) and head of the department or chair of the intercollegiate faculty (if applicable) must approve the petition and route it to the Graduate and Professional School. Approval of the petition by the Associate Provost and Dean of the Graduate and Professional School will set aside the registration requirement during the period of leave. Leave will be granted only under conditions that require the suspension of all activities associated with pursuing the degree. For certain types of approved leave—such as medical or active-duty military—the time period for the completion of the degree will pause with the start of leave and resume when the student returns to the program. Personal leave may not pause the time limit for the degree. A student should refer to the sections on Time Limits for master’s and doctoral programs. In cases with extenuating circumstances, a leave of absence can be extended by the student’s committee and the Associate Provost and Dean of the Graduate and Professional School. A student who returns to the University after an approved leave of absence will not be required to submit an application for readmission to the Office of Admissions. An international student should visit with an International Student Services advisor to find out how a leave of absence may impact the student’s stay in or re-entry into the United States. Limitations for Texas A&M Faculty and Staff on Graduate Committee Faculty The following limitations were set by the Graduate and Professional Council of Texas A&M University concerning advanced degrees for members of the faculty and staff of the university. A member of the faculty above the rank of Assistant Professor will not normally be granted a doctoral degree at this institution. They may, however, enroll for graduate work. A member of the Graduate Committee Faculty may not serve in the Graduate Committee Faculty of an academic program in which the member is currently pursuing a graduate degree or certificate. Any exceptions, individual or program, to the above regulations must receive the written approval of the appropriate department head, college dean, the Associate Provost and Dean of the Graduate and Professional School, and the Provost and Executive Vice President before the person applies for admission to graduate studies. Undergraduates Registering for Graduate Courses A senior undergraduate student with a grade point average of at least 3.000 is eligible to enroll in a graduate course and reserve it for graduate credit by filing a Petition for Undergraduate Student to Enroll in Graduate Courses or Reserve Undergraduate Courses for Graduate Credit with the Registrar. The petition must be approved by the course instructor, the student’s major department head, the dean of the college offering the course, and the dean of the student’s undergraduate college. Undergraduate credit hours used to meet the requirements for a baccalaureate degree may not be used to meet the requirements for a graduate degree. Academically superior undergraduate students with a grade point average of at least 3.250 are eligible to apply graduate credit hours toward their undergraduate degree program by filing a Petition for Undergraduate Student to Enroll in Graduate Courses or Reserve Undergraduate Courses for Graduate Credit with the Registrar. The petition must be approved by the course instructor, the student’s major department head, the dean of the college offering the course, and the dean of the student’s undergraduate college. Graduate credit hours used to meet the requirements for a baccalaureate degree may not be used to meet the requirements for a graduate degree. VA Benefits In order to receive full Veterans Administration (VA) benefits, students must be enrolled in the minimum amount of courses counting toward their program of study to be considered full-time by the Department of Veterans Affairs. This number may differ between degrees and during the summer term. For hour requirements for your degree, please review your degree requirements for your degree plan as determined by your department or visit your academic advisor. Course Load Requirements for International Students with F-1 or J-1 Status A student with F-1 or J-1 visa status is required to be enrolled full-time in fall and spring semesters. Summer semester is traditionally a vacation period unless it is the student’s first or graduating semester and the student is then required to enroll full-time. In order for the student to be enrolled less than full-time, the student must receive written authorization from International Student Services. If the student does not receive the written authorization prior to being enrolled less than full-time, then the student may be out of legal status with the Department of Homeland Security or the Department of State. Loss of legal immigration status is very serious and will result in a student being ineligible to be employed and may result in a student having to leave the United States. The student is responsible to uphold U.S. federal government and University regulations. The U.S. government allows a student to register less than full time in certain circumstances. These reasons may be found in the “Reduced Course Load” section available on the International Student Services website. Also, in certain situations, the Registrar may be able to authorize that a student has full-time enrollment status, even though the student is enrolled for fewer than the normally required number of hours. For immigration purposes a student with F-1 status may request authorization from ISS to co-enroll at another institution for full-time enrollment. Please visit the ISS website for more information. Federal regulations only allow F-1 students to count three hours of distance learning credits toward their full-time enrollment status. J-1 students may not count co-enrollment or distance learning credits to be considered full-time enrolled for immigration purposes. Classification Classification indicates the type of degree program in which each student is enrolled and reflects the student’s progress within that program at the professional level. Classification Code Classification Definition G6 Post-baccalaureate Non-degree Post-baccalaureate non-degree classification denotes a student with a baccalaureate degree from an institution of higher education. Limitations may be placed on coursework taken while in G6 status if, at a later date, a post-baccalaureate non-degree student decides to pursue a graduate degree. Specifically, a college or a department may or may not decide whether to accept any G6 work toward a student’s graduate degree; however, with the approval of the student’s graduate advisory committee, the department head or chair of the interdisciplinary program, and the Graduate and Professional School, a maximum of 12 credit hours taken in post-baccalaureate non-degree status may be used on a student’s degree plan. Admission to post-baccalaureate non-degree status does not establish eligibility for admission to degree-seeking status. A post-baccalaureate non-degree student is not eligible to register for 691 Research hours. An application for post-baccalaureate non-degree classification is handled on a first-come, first-served basis. An application submitted within one month of registration may not be processed in time to begin that semester or term. Enrollment of a G6 student in courses may be limited by college and departmental policies. Each post-baccalaureate non-degree student must be reviewed by his or her department of affiliation for continuation at the end of each semester. A post-baccalaureate non-degree student must maintain at least a 3.000 GPA on all coursework attempted to remain eligible for registration. University departments and colleges may have additional and higher requirements. For the scholastically-deficient post-baccalaureate non-degree student (G6 classification), the student’s home department shall determine eligibility. It is the department’s responsibility to place a registration block on these students. Post-baccalaureate non-degree status is not normally available to an international student. G7 Graduate (Master's) G7 classification denotes admission of a student to a master’s-level program of study or to a doctoral program who has not yet completed a master’s degree or 30 hours of eligible coursework taken at Texas A&M University. G8 Graduate (Doctoral) G8 classification denotes admission to a doctoral-level program of study. G9 Graduate (Master's/Doctoral Admitted) G9 classification denotes admission to graduate study, but that documents must still be completed before a student is allowed to file a degree plan. Upon receipt of the required documents, the student’s classification will change. Approval of the Associate Provost and Dean of the Graduate and Professional School is required to change a student from G9 classification to the appropriate classification (i.e., G7 or G8). D1 Dentistry, First Year D2 Dentistry, Second Year D3 Dentistry, Third Year D4 Dentistry, Fourth Year D6 Dentistry, Post-professional Certificate L0 Law, Non-degree L1 Law, First Year L2 Law, Second Year L3 Law, Third Year M1 Medical, First Year M2 Medical, Second Year M3 Medical, Third Year M4 Medical, Fourth Year P1 Pharmacy, First Year P2 Pharmacy, Second Year P3 Pharmacy, Third Year P4 Pharmacy, Fourth Year V1 Veterinary, First Year V2 Veterinary, Second Year V3 Veterinary, Third Year V4 Veterinary, Fourth Year Semester Credit Hour A lecture course which meets one hour per week for 15 weeks is worth 1 semester credit hour. Thus, a course worth 3 semester credit hours, meets three hours per week. Credit hours for laboratory courses are determined to be some fraction of the number of hours spent in class. For further information, visit Texas A&M University Rule — Definition of a Credit Hour — 11.03.99.M1, which complies with The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board definition of minimum course lengths as part of the Texas Administrative Code, “Minimum Length of Courses and Limitation on the Amount of Credit that a Student May Earn in a Given Time Period". For more information, please see the Texas Administrative Code online. The Master’s degree curriculum is designed to develop new understanding through research and creativity. Students have the option to pursue a thesis or non-thesis master’s degree. Steps to Fulfill Master's Degree Requirements Master's Degree Requirements Step Instruction Details 1.
