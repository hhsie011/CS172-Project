If you have already taken an advanced course in Hispanic Studies (600-level or higher), we encourage you to write directly to the professor you took the course with. If the professor or instructor is no longer at Brown, we will assign one of our faculty to perform your assessment; in which case, we ask that you select a writing sample from that course in lieu of the essay (see below). Please choose one of the topics and write an essay of approximately 1.5 pages. The essay should be double-spaced and between 400-500 words. Please either email the essay to your faculty evaluator or bring it to the interview. TOPICS FOR FULBRIGHT ESSAY You should also email the link for the on-line evaluation or bring a copy of the Fulbright language form to the interview.
