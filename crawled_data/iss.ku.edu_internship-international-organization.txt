(See a list of qualifying organizations below). As long as the student is in valid F-1 status there is no waiting period prior to becoming eligible to apply for this type of employment. Employment may be full time and can be authorized in increments of up to one year. The position does not have to be related to the student’s field of study, but the authorization cannot extend beyond the end of the student’s academic program. There must first be an official offer of employment from the sponsoring organization in order to apply for the authorization. This type of employment authorization does not impact the student’s eligibility for participation in other types of employment related to F-1 status. However, during the period of employment the student must otherwise continue to maintain status, including continuing to pursue a full course of study.
