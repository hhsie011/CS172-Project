Full Text Research Research Overview Professor Paine's research interests are in thin film characterization and processing with a focus on interfaces and interface stability in electronic thin film systems. The evolution of microstructure as a function of processing conditions is being studied in a wide range of materials synthesized by physical vapor deposition techniques. Key characterization techniques include x-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, semiconductor device measurements. Research Statement Amorphous metal oxides with the (n-1)d10ns0 (n≥4) electronic configuration are being used for the fabrication of thin film transistors (TFT's) with superior performance when compared to current amorphous Si-based devices. These new materials are optically transparent and have important application to organic light emitting-based displays which, as current-driven devices, require a higher on/off current ratio than field-driven LCD-based displays. Amorphous oxides such as ZnO-rich ZnO : In2O3 (a−ZIO, molar ratio of 2:1), ZnO : SnO2 (a-ZSO, molar ratios of 1:1 and 1:2) and In2O3 : Ga2O3 : ZnO ternary oxide (a-IGZO, In1.1:Ga1.1:Zn0.9) all have field effect mobilities of ~650 cm2 / V s which is very attractive relative to amorphous Si . Amorphous In2O3-10wt%ZnO (a-IZO) is a particularly attractive candidate material due to its high electron mobility, room temperature processing, high surface planarity, and isotropic etch characteristics. We are investigating a-IZO channel / a-IZO metallization structured TFT's since, with IZO's carrier concentration tunable between ~ 1E15 / cm3 to ~ 5E20 / cm3, the same IZO target can be used to deposit both the semiconducting channel and source/drain metallization layers by simply adjusting the process oxygen during deposition. Also, compositionally homogeneous IZO/IZO channel metallization has favorable band alignment which may contribute to a low specific contact resistance. For TFT applications, amorphous IZO channel material must be deposited with low carrier density, high carrier mobility, and good ohmic source-drain channel contact must be achieved by finding source/drain metals with a minimum specific contact resistance to the IZO channel. One challenge that limits the implementation of a-IZO channel devices is the difficulty in achieving low enough carrier concentrations to limit enhancement mode TFT off-state current. One approach has been to utilize very thin channel layers, while another is to add Ga as a third cation species to IZO (IGZO) to suppress native defect-based carrier formation. The addition of cation species increases scattering and significantly decreases channel carrier mobility. On the other hand, the use of very thin (10  30 nm) IZO channel layers poses processing and device design challenges. Scholarly Work S. Lee, K. Park, and D. C.
