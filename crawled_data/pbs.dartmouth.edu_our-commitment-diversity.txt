Diversity within our community is integral to advancing scientific knowledge. All facets of a vibrant intellectual community – rigorous inquiry, open discourse, and diversity of ideas – demand and benefit from a welcoming, respectful, and inclusive environment. We are therefore committed to fostering a community of diverse perspectives (including, but not limited to, representation of gender, race and ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, and socioeconomic status). "Diversity and inclusivity are necessary partners. Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual's identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." - Dartmouth President Phil Hanlon's Letter to the Dartmouth Community Inclusivity, Diversity, and Culture Committee The IDCC is comprised of representatives from the staff, graduate students, and faculty within PBS and advises the Chair of the department on ways we can continually move the department forward in creating a respectful, diverse, inclusive, and resilient community. The current members of the IDCC are: Brad Duchaine, (Department Chair) Katherine Nautiyal, Assistant Professor Shawn Winter, Lab Instructor & Lecturer Yong Hoon Chung, Graduate Student At the College level, the Dartmouth Inclusive Excellence action plan has identified six initiatives that affirm our commitment to fostering a culture of inclusion across Dartmouth.They are: 1) increasing faculty diversity, 2) increasing staff diversity, 3) building a more inclusive community, 4) increasing transparency, 5) confronting and learning from the past, 6) being accountable.
