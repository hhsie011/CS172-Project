Saman will discuss how the conversations around visual narratives and representations are changing in the industry. We will look at the evolution of Saman’s own voice in documentary photography and discuss the possibilities and the limits that arise from visual narratives. The conversation will also address the ethical considerations involved in working in settings of conflict and human rights. What do we learn about the people we document and what can they teach us? Speakers: Moises Saman is a freelance photographer currently based in Amman, Jordan, and a regular contributor to National Geographic magazine, TIME, The New Yorker, and NGOs such as Doctors Without Borders (Médecins Sans Frontières), Human Rights Watch, and UNICEF, amongst others. In 2015, he was a recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship in Photography, culminating in the publication of Discodia, a multi-layered visual representation of the Arab Spring.
