Students learn how diet can play a crucial role in the cause, treatment, and prevention of many diseases. There are degree program options within nutritional science. The pre-health professional and research option coursework prepares students for work in research laboratories, graduate study in nutrition or biological sciences, or entrance into health professional programs, such as medical, dental, physician assistant, and pharmacy schools. Students gain a strong science education along with human nutrition expertise. Additional options in health coach and nutrition and wellness prepare students for work positions in program planning and evaluation for community, public health, non-profit, and corporate wellness programs addressing the growing public interest in nutrition, wellness, and preventative health. Students learn about the role of nutrition and healthy eating for disease prevention and wellness. The department also offers a nutrition minor. Student Learning Outcomes Upon graduation, students should be able to: Communicate effectively in their field of study using written, oral, visual and/or electronic forms. Demonstrate proficiency in ethical data collection and interpretation, literature review and citation, critical thinking and problem solving. Facilitate and participate effectively in a group, team, or organization. Plan life-long learning activities with the aim of improving professional skills. Integrate creativity, innovation, or entrepreneurship in ways that produce value. Describe sociocultural competence relative to diversity, equity and/or inclusion. Explain how human activities impact the natural environment and how societies are affected. Meet program specific learning outcomes for the Nutritional Science major.
