Detailed search Faculty of Engineering Yale University Dunham Lab 222 10 Hillhouse Avenue P.O. Box 208267 New Haven, CT 06512 The Yale Center for Combustion Studies, an interdisciplinary research center, uses experimental, computational, and mathematical techniques to deal with the fundamentals of chemically reacting and multiphase combustion systems. Research support comes from government sources, such as AFOSR, NSF, DOE, ARO, and ONR, and from industrial sponsors such as the United Technologies Research Center and SCM. Research Areas Convective Energy and Mass Transfer Catalytically Stabilized Combustion Deposition of Vapors and Particles from Combustion Products Energetic Materials Gas and Particle Sampling Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Kinetics Laser Diagnostics for Temperature, Species, Droplet, and Velocity Distributions in Flames Microscale Combustion Numerical Simulation of Combustion Dynamics Organic and Inorganic 'Soot' Formation, Coagulation and Transport Spray Combustion Turbulent Flames Research Facilities Center laboratories occupy 9,000 sq. ft. in the Departments of Applied Physics, Chemical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. Research equipment includes state-of-the-art instrumentation for planar laser-induced fluorescence, Raman spectroscopy, absorption and emission spectroscopy, nonlinear optical spectroscopy, photo ionization spectroscopy, Fourier transform spectroscopy, laser Doppler anemometry, phase Doppler anemometry, elastic and inelastic light scattering, gas chromatography, and mass spectrometry. The labs are also equipped with an assortment of laminar and turbulent burners. Computational facilities include an 8-cpu AMD Opteron cluster equipped with 32GB of RAM, a 24-cpu Intel Xeon cluster with 24GB of RAM, two four-way IBM 44P-270 systems, and a variety of PC-based multiprocessor workstations running Linux. All computational systems are connected to a high-speed 1.2 TB RAID array via gigabit Ethernet links. The laboratory also has access to larger-scale parallel systems through Yale's High-Performance Computing Group, including a 160-cpu Xeon cluster with gigabit links and a 132-cpu Opteron cluster connected via a dedicated Myrinet network for message-passing. All systems run the latest development tools and come with vendor-tuned libraries for maximum performance. In addition, there is an extensive collection of smaller workstations. Research Faculty Alessandro Gomez, Mechanical Engineering Marshall B. Long, Mechanical Engineering Lisa D. Pfefferle, Chemical Engineering Daniel E. Rosner, Chemical Engineering Mitchell D. Smooke, Mechanical Engineering Associated and Adjunct Faculty Richard K. Chang, Applied Physics Juan Fern�ndez de la Mora, Mechanical Engineering Gary L. Haller, Chemical Engineering Amable Li�an, Adjunct Forman A. Williams, Adjunct Educational Activities Center faculty offer graduate level courses in combustion and also short courses. Combustion is also a significant component of courses on chemical kinetics, chemical reactor design, environmental engineering, transport phenomena, propulsion and energy conversion, air pollution, and thermodynamics. Seminars and research group meetings are held weekly or biweekly.
