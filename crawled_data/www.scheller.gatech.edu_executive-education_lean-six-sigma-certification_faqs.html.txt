Yes, beginning in 2021, our Lean Six Sigma program will be offered online with synchronous video sessions, individual and group exercises, and one-on-one faculty guidance. Do I have to complete a project to get certified? Yes, a satisfactory project must be completed before you will receive either your Lean Six Sigma Green Belt or Lean Six Sigma Black Belt certificate. Is there a deadline to complete my project? All certificate requirements (courses and project work) must be completed within a one-year timeframe. Once your project is complete, it will be evaluated for your certification. Do I qualify for the Lean Six Sigma Black Belt program if I earned my Green Belt certification at another institution? Your previously earned Green Belt certification may qualify you for the Black Belt program. Please contact Malisa Gipson at 404-385-0548 or malisa.gipson@scheller.gatech.edu to get approval. If I intend to earn my Lean Six Sigma Black Belt certificate, do I have to complete a project and get certified at the Lean Six Sigma Green Belt level before I can move on to the Lean Six Sigma Black Belt program? No, you do not have to complete a project at the Lean Six Sigma Green Belt level if you intend to earn your Lean Six Sigma Black Belt certificate. You will not become “certified” for Lean Six Sigma Green Belt or Lean Six Sigma Black Belt until you satisfactorily complete a project for that level. What do I need for class? You will need a laptop with a reliable internet connection and Excel access. Do you offer student loans/financing? Information on how to obtain a private student loan is available on the Georgia Tech Financial Aid web site. Do you accept VA benefits? We do not accept VA benefits at this time.
