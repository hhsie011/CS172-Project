Bachelor of Arts Concentration Options Declaring a Concentration Environmental Engineering Environmental engineers use the principles of engineering, mathematics, biology and chemistry to develop and implement engineering solutions to protect human health and the environment from the adverse impacts of environmental pollution. Their work includes water and wastewater treatment, air pollution control, soil and groundwater remediation, site characterization and risk assessment, life cycle assessment, and climate change mitigation. The curriculum consists of an interdisciplinary engineering core (13 courses) that includes courses in engineering, mathematics, biology and chemistry, followed by advanced courses in geology and biology and environmental engineering. As part of the environmental concentration, students select four upper-level environmental engineering electives based on their specific interests in concentration. The environmental engineering concentration has the following general structure (21 total courses): An interdisiciplinary core, primarily taken during the first two years (13 courses) Advanced biology and geology courses (2 courses) Upper level environmental engineering, including capstone design (6 courses) In addition, students take four humanities and social sciences courses and seven elective courses Program Educational Objectives Within a few years of graduation, graduates of the Brown Environmental Engineering (EnvE) Program will: 1. Engage in continued learning through professional development, professional licensure and service to the profession and society; 2. Achieve leadership positions or roles that advance environmental engineering practice; 3. Pursue and successfully obtain an advanced graduate or professional degree in environmental engineering or a related discipline.
