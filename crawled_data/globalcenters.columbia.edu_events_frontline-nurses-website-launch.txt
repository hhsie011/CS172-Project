Frontline Nurses, a working group of the Columbia Center for Social Difference , recognizes the critical contribution of nurses and midwives and advocates for their role in policymaking-- a project that has become more urgent during the international battle against COVID- 19. This event will launch frontlinenurses.columbia.edu, a new site that presents first- person accounts of nurses and midwives from Liberia and Sierra Leone who successfully led their communities through the 2014 Ebola outbreak. We invite you to meet and listen to these nurses and midwives. OPENING REMARKS BY: Elizabeth Iro- Chief Nursing Officer, World Health Organization.
