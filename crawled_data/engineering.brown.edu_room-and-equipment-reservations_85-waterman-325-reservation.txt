Capacity: 14 people Equipment: 85 Waterman 325 contains a 65" LED screen, two phones, and a whiteboard. Procedures: To request a reservation for a single event, please fill out the information requested on the Reservation Form. If you have any questions, please email soe-reservations@brown.edu. Confirmation is subject to change based on the scheduling guidelines outlined below. Scheduling Guidelines: As a first step in minimizing scheduling conflicts, users are asked to book only for those times for which there is a very high likelihood that the planned activity will take place and to release the scheduled time as soon as it is known that a scheduled activity will not take place. Secondly, users reserving Room 325 should also understand that there may be times when they will be asked to reschedule or relocate their activity because the room is needed for another activity that is regarded as having higher priority. If scheduling conflicts arise that cannot readily be resolved to the satisfaction of the users involved, then these conflicts will be referred to the Dean of Engineering who, in consultation with the chairs of the departments with competing claims, will make the final decision.
