Some applications do not have the ability to inform you ahead of time when your password is going to expire and you only find out when it asks you to select a new one. It is sometimes inconvenient and difficult to come up with a new password on the spur of the moment like that. Therefore IT@UC has created a system to notify you in advance that your password is about to expire. These notifications will be sent to you via email. Unfortunately, once we begin sending these messages, we can guarantee that some phishing scheme will try to take advantage of it. So, how will you be able to tell that a message is from UC and is not just another phishing attempt? By knowing and being able to recognize the real thing. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with how the real password expiration emails will look and their security features. You should know what to look for, so you can protect yourself. How can I know that the message is from UC and is not a phishing attempt? Legitimate emails from UC about your passwords... ...will address you by your name, not anything generic like "user" If you ever see an email about passwords that begins with, "Dear User," asks you to send a password, gives you a clickable link, or tries to send you to a site not inside of www.uc.edu, just delete the email. It is a phishing attempt and isn't worth your time.
