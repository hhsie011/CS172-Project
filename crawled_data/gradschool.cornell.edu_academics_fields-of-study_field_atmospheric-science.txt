Applications relate to the analysis and prediction of weather and climate. For more information, please see our information page.

Mahowald Campus: Ithaca Concentrations: Atmospheric Science: atmospheric science Research Interests: atmospheric dust; climate modeling Angeline Greene Pendergrass Campus: Ithaca Concentrations: Atmospheric Science: atmospheric science Research Interests: I study precipitation and the flow of water and energy through the climate system with which it is associated. My interests include extreme precipitation events that impact people and our environment; the atmospheric processes, circulation, and phenomena that lead to precipitation; and broader variability and changes of Earth’s climate. My research is grounded in a top-down approach that considers fundamental questions about precipitation and its change. I develop compact but powerful and useful metrics to describe the characteristics of precipitation to address questions including What role does precipitation play in the flow of energy through the climate system, and what can we learn about precipitation and its change from this? How have extreme precipitation events changed in the past, how will they change in the future, and what processes drive these changes? How accurately do models simulate the hydrologic cycle, and how can we improve their accuracy? What are the causes and consequences of changes in the hydrologic cycle for circulation of the atmosphere and ocean, climate sensitivity, and society? Sara C. Pryor Campus: Ithaca Concentrations: Atmospheric Science: atmospheric science Research Interests: global climate change/variability and forcing at regional scales, atmosphere-surface exchange, formation and removal processes for atmospheric aerosols.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
