There is no employee contribution required. An exempt employee will be eligible for the following semimonthly payments from Syracuse University, which are taxable: Period of Salary Continuation Weeks 0 - 16 100% of current salary* Weeks 17 - 26 60% of current salary* Weeks 27 - 52 50% of current salary* Weeks 53+ 50% of current salary* if Social Security disability award has been granted before Week 53, and if the eligible employee has completed at least 12 months of active employment. *Current salary as defined in the Salary Continuation Plan The Salary Continuation Plan benefits will be reduced by Social Security disability benefits, Workers’ Compensation benefits and certain other payments specified in the Salary Continuation Plan document. The Salary Continuation Plan has several other requirements that must be satisfied in order to receive benefits.
