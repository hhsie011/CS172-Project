View programs » Print Home  ›  Student Success  ›  Tuition & Financial Aid  ›  Billing & Payment Billing & Payment Information Billing All billing for currently enrolled students is processed electronically through eBill. eBill statements are processed on the fifth day of each month for students who have current activity resulting in an account balance or credit. Students are sent an email to their ONID email account when their statement is ready to view and can then view their eBill statement online at mybill.oregonstate.edu. Accounts are "due upon receipt" of the email notification, and any unpaid balance remaining after the 1st of each month is subject to an interest charge of 1% per month (12% APR). You are responsible for paying tuition and fees by the deadline even if you do not view the billing statement. Refer to the drop/withdraw refunds schedule to determine financial repercussions of withdrawing or dropping courses. Click to enlarge the calendar. Calendar of important billing dates The student accounts calendar is a must-have resource that will keep you aware of when bills are due, when you'll receive new billing statements, when financial aid and scholarship funds are released each term, and other key dates. Acceptable payment methods OSU currently accepts eCheck, paper checks, money orders and cash as acceptable payment methods. Students can use Online Services as a convenience option for making credit card payments. Payment plans are also available for current students. Please see the Cashier's Office student billing webpage for more details regarding all acceptable payment methods or payment plans. Questions If you have questions about these payment options, contact the Student Accounts department directly at 541-737-3775 or Ecampus Student Services at 800-667-1465 (select option 1).
