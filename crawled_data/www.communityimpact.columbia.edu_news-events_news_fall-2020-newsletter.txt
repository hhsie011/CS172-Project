Your support allows us to bring high-quality services to the Morningside Heights and Washington Heights communities. Learn More News & Events News Fall 2020 Newsletter Year-End Message from the Executive Director Dear Friends and Supporters: While the past few months have been challenging because of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are pleased that Community Impact (CI) has continued to make a difference and advance its mission in Upper Manhattan communities. We greatly appreciate your continued support. At CI, we believe that our motto, “Together We Can Make A Difference” could not be more true today. Importantly, our Emergency Food Programs have continued operations during a time when so many are in need. Our Ford Hall Food Pantry has increased services to community residents from two to three days a week, and Columbia students continue to lead our Friday Community Lunch Program in conjunction with Broadway Presbyterian Church. Our student volunteers and workers have worked valiantly to keep our youth programs operational on virtual platforms, providing sorely needed tutoring and mentoring to community youth, as well as support to local public school teachers. Additionally, five George Van Amson Fellows completed 8-week summer internships with non-profit organizations. All of our TASC and ESOL classes for adults have transitioned to online operations, and we now offer classes, which allow our adult students totake advantage of the New York State Department of Education Waiver program that allows TASC students who need to pass one or two subtests to be awarded their diplomas without retesting. Finally, during our virtual benefit in October 2020, we were pleased to honor Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer and Professor Robert Hanning, two champions whose commitment and service to CI and the community are truly impressive. Congratulations again. Happy holidays and stay safe. Thank you for your continued support! Sincerely yours, Olger C.
