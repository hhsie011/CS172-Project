Such is its plurality that we may speak more accurately of Caribbean intellectual traditions. This special issue of BIM, a leading Caribbean literary journal, is an attempt to engage some elements of these intellectual traditions. It is an interdisciplinary attempt and will seek to foreground essays on the historiographical questions of the region; the remarkable cultural forms of the region in music, art, literature and dance. The issue will pay attention to the current literature (plays, poetry, short stories and novels) of the region as well as some political ideas that have been produced within the region. Essays on Caribbean intellectuals from any part of the region are welcome. The issue welcomes as well articles on the various Afro Caribbean religious practices. Articles should not be more than 5000 words long with an abstract. ALL written work should be submitted in WORD format and double-spaced. Short stories should be 3,500 words maximum. Poems should be 3-5 submissions. Art works are welcome. Original musical compositions of not more than 3 minutes are welcome. Final date for submission of any work is May 30, 2022. The special issue is slated for November 2022 deadline. Please send enquires about this issue to : Anthony.
