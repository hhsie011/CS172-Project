I want to be at the center of one of the most critical areas in today's litigation. I'm ready to apply. Learn More THE LEADING EDGE OF LITIGATION MANAGEMENT. Welcome to the first LL.M. in Litigation Management program in the nation — designed exclusively for lawyers who aspire to direct effective litigation strategy, control electronic discovery, leverage technology, manage a team, and lead their company or firm’s efforts to manage a challenging litigation docket. The viability of our American justice and jury system is diminishing because individual litigants increasingly believe they cannot access or afford our court system, and corporate clients are looking for alternatives. Preserving our vital 7th Amendment right requires that litigation be managed effectively and efficiently to achieve both access and excellence. How to provide effective and efficient representation, however, can be challenging. Baylor Law’s Executive LL.M. in Litigation Management innovatively combines flexible online and in-person learning allowing working attorneys to continue practice while earning their advanced degree — enabling them to simultaneously expand their skillset, increase their value, grow their network, and accelerate their careers. The curriculum develops and hones the very legal-specific strategic, analytical, business, and cost management skills in demand by today’s attorneys and clients on both sides of the docket. Importantly, these skills make all litigation counsel more cost-effective and translate across a range of case sizes and portfolios. The program is taught by the top litigation management experts in the country — trailblazing attorneys, renowned judges, and national thought leaders — whose insights and experiences deliver tangible, real-world solutions to litigation’s most critical and costly issues. Join in-house counsel, outside counsel, plaintiff counsel, and litigation consultants in this innovative, comprehensive program. Baylor Law is now accepting applications for the cohorts starting in Spring 2022 or Fall 2022. Our admissions team is available to answer questions, call (254) 710-4230.
