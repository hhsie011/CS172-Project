At least one member of the Special Committee must be a member of the faculty in a department other than that of the chairperson. Students in an M.S. or a Ph.D. program are required to assist with the teaching program of the department. The Master of Professional Studies (Agriculture) degree is intended primarily for applicants who want to further their academic training in animal science but whose interests may not be oriented toward research. It's a special non-thesis degree program requiring a minimum of two residence units and the satisfactory completion of 30 hours of coursework related to the professional interests of the candidate. Approval of the report of a problem-solving project is also required. In addition, the M.P.S. (Agriculture and Life Sciences) program has a Peace Corp option in which the student undertakes two semesters of academic work at Cornell and a Peace Corp assignment. For information and instructions on how to apply, visit the M.P.S. (Agriculture and Life Sciences)/Peace Corps Web site, or contact International Programs, 33 Warren Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853; phone 607-255-3037; email mpsag_peacecorps@cornell.edu. Depending on specific objectives, students interested in this field may also want to examine opportunities in the Fields of Food Science and Technology; Nutrition; and Biomedical and Biological Sciences. The field offers three degrees: M.P.S. M.S. Ph.D. Contact Information Website: https://ansci.cals.cornell.edu/ Email: dlb8@cornell.edu Phone: 607 255-2862 149 Morrison Hall Cornell University Ithaca, NY 14853-4801 Data and Statistics Doctoral Program Statistics Research Master's Program Statistics Professional Master's Program Statistics Subject and Degrees Agriculture and Life Sciences (Animal Science) Agriculture and Life Sciences (Animal Science) (M.P.S.)

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
