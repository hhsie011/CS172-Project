The University of Utah Admissions Visit In-Person CAMPUS TOURS Campus tours are a great opportunity for you to see our spectacular campus in-person. During a tour, you will be paired with a student tour guide and other guests in small groups to walk across campus on a specific tour route. What to Expect Campus tours are roughly two hours long. All guests will be outdoors for the majority of the campus tour. Dress in clothing that is suitable for the weather for that day and wear shoes that are comfortable for a lot of outdoor walking. Please note that tours will be offered in all weather conditions with the rare exception of severe or dangerous weather. The University of Utah is located in the beautiful foothills of the Wasatch Mountains, which includes a lot of up and downhill walking. Each day, over 30,000 students traverse over our scenic campus. If anyone in your group needs Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) accommodations, please do not hesitate to call and/or email the Office of Admissions in order to request a service. A request for accommodation can be made by calling 801-581-8761, option 1, or email CampusVisits@utah.edu. Reasonable prior notice is required. Getting to campus and parking: Your campus tour will begin and end at the Carolyn and Kem Gardner Commons building which houses the Welcome Center and Office of Admissions. The address to the Gardner Commons building is: 260 Central Campus Drive Salt Lake City, Utah 84112 A large visitor parking lot is located in front of the Gardner Commons building.

COVID-19 Precautions The University of Utah has implemented measures to ensure the safety of all guests, students, staff, and faculty in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, based on recommendations from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and the State of Utah. The Office of Admissions adheres to these measures and guidelines to maintain safety as its highest priority for all. Please do not attend a tour if you are currently experiencing COVID-19 symptoms or have experienced COVID-19 symptoms in the past seven days. Symptoms include fever, shortness of breath, cough, sore throat, congestion, and loss of taste or smell. Though not required, we do request each guest wear a face mask while indoors. If a guest prefers to wear a face mask and does not have one, the Office of Admissions will provide one during check-in. During the check-in process, you will be asked to acknowledge the COVID-19 safety guidelines and attest to the absence of any COVID-19 symptoms you or your guests may be experiencing prior to the beginning of the tour. POST-TOUR COVID-19 NOTIFICATION: If you, or your guests, test positive for COVID-19 within 48 hours of your campus tour, we ask you immediately notify us by emailing CVC-19Notification@utah.edu or call, 801-585-1995.
