Implicit Bias (Two Part) While we know some harmful actions are conscious, there are many ways even well-intentioned people cause harm daily. During this interactive session, participants will explore the concept of Implicit Bias. In addition to defining this concept, participants will experience a journey designed to also demonstrate how implicit biases show up, develop, are reinforced, perpetuated and challenged. Participants will learn ways to identify and interrupt harmful effects of implicit biases. While implicit biases often develop without our knowledge, we are responsible for learning what baggage we carry and commit to countering negative and harmful messages.

Better yet, how do we know we aren’t racist? During this engaging session, we will define and explore critical terms in order to develop a common understanding. Participants will also learn how various concepts show up in and around us daily. Finally, participants will explore strategies designed to dismantle racism in the workplace and beyond.

Have you ever made a statement, intended as a compliment, that was taken the wrong way? Do you often bite your tongue or avoid uncomfortable conversations out of fear of offending others? It is actually very common for well-intentioned people to say things that are harmful. During this interactive session, participants will explore a host of microaggressions that regularly show up in our everyday language. This session is not intended to stifle free speech, but instead to inform us of potentially harmful language that causes a disconnect with those around us. Sign up for Microaggressions Training here. September 17, 2021 12:00-1:30 PM February 25, 2022* 12:00-1:30 PM Engaging in Difficult Conversations “OMG!!! Did I really just hear that?” “No, you misunderstood me, that’s not what I meant!” “Everyone is just too sensitive these days!” This engaging session is designed to increase the effectiveness of everyday conversations as we strive to foster learning environments that are more inclusive and equitable for all. Participants will explore basic tools that are effective in the workplace and beyond. The goal of this session is not to ensure perfection, but to equip us with effective strategies as we continue to learn and grow in our increasingly diverse world.
