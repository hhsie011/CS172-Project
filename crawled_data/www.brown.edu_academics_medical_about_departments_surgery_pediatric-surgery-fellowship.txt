A combination of conferences, teaching rounds and a demanding clinical schedule creates a well-rounded, structured and complete educational environment. All trainees who finish the program will have a broad and full understanding of pediatric and neonatal physiology and disease with the technical expertise to provide the highest level of pediatric surgical care. Consistent with the requirements of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, the design of the program is structured to allow the resident to develop advanced knowledge and skills for the fundamental areas of surgery related to infants and children. Throughout the two-year residency, board-eligible general surgeons will progress through training that will allow them to be qualified for sub-board certification in pediatric surgery. The major educational elements of the training program are designed to establish a fund of knowledge and foster clinical competence in the areas of fetal medicine, congenital and acquired conditions of the newborn, pediatric surgical oncology, trauma and pediatric surgical critical care, non-cardiac thoracic surgery, renal transplantation, burns, head and neck surgery, endoscopy and minimally invasive surgery, with a thorough understanding of the pre-operative evaluation and peri-operative management needs of newborn pediatric patients and adolescents. We aim to provide residents with a breadth of experience and a fund of knowledge that will enable them to enter the practice of pediatric surgery and present themselves as leaders for their institution, community and profession.
