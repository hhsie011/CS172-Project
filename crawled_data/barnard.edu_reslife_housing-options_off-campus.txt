Students may choose to commute from home or find an apartment off-campus. Students considering moving off-campus should check out the information below for how it could impact their financial aid and/or guarantee of campus housing for the future. Note: while College is always hopeful to be able to provide campus housing to as many students as possible, housing unfortunately may not be available for all non-guaranteed applicants (Transfers, students returning from a leave of absence, continuing students who were not eligible to participate in Room Selection process, etc.), resulting in some students needing to commute as non-residential students. Housing options like The Bayit and International House are not considered part of campus housing nor part of the Barnard/Columbia Housing Exchange. Students who live in those locations are considered to be living off-campus. The NYPD has noted a recent increase in fraud reports for rental listing scams. For more information, check out the links below: -- https://streeteasy.com/blog/nyc-rental-scams -- https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0079-rental-listing-scams Looking for Off-Campus Housing Barnard Off-Campus Housing Facebook Group -- connect with other Barnard students who may be looking for apartment shares off-campus. Columbia's Off-Campus Housing Assistance (OCHA) office provides resources to aid university students (including Barnard students) in their search for rental housing in the metro area. OCHA manages a database (the Housing Registry) which includes available rooms and apartments in non-Columbia-owned buildings and sublets of units in Columbia-managed housing. Prospective roommates can also post and search profiles to connect with other students looking for off-campus housing. In addition, OCHA offers housing search counseling and is supported in these efforts by their cooperative relationships with two New York City real estate/relocation agencies. OCHA is located at 401 West 119th Street (between Amsterdam Avenue and Morningside Drive) and can be called at 212-854-2773. More info is available at https://ocha.facilities.columbia.edu. Note: Barnard students are not able to directly apply for Columbia undergraduate campus housing. A limited number of continuing students only may live at Columbia each year as part of the BC/CU Housing Exchange (available only as part of the Room Selection process). Additional information about how to start a search for off-campus housing in NYC can be found at nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/housing-and-dining/off-campus-living.html. Other options for off-campus housing may include:* Educational Housing Services Webster Apartments StudentHousingWorks.com The Towers at CCNY StudentHousingAssociates.com NYCintern.org 92 Street Y New York Foundation for Senior Citizens Home Sharing Program Monarch Heights Hyatus Harlem Summit Residences NY * Barnard College assumes no responsibility or liability in connection with any rental agreement or services provided by the listed resources. The listing of any resource does not constitute an endorsement of the service or guarantee of availability. Sustainable Options for Off-Campus Furniture Students who will be living off-campus are encouraged to check options for sustainable furniture purchases or swaps. Rheaply.com -- online platform designed to facilitate the exchange of items among the Barnard Community LivDao.com -- online marketplace for pre-owned furniture in the metro-area Campus Resources for Non-Residential Students For information about the Commuter Lounge, renting a locker in Barnard Hall, etc. please visit https://barnard.edu/studentlife/commuterresources. Meal Plan Requirements Non-residential students are enrolled by default in the Convenience Points Only Meal Plan. If they wish to change their enrolled meal plan, they would need to complete the Meal Plan Change Form before the deadline prior to each semester. For more information about available meal plans, prices, and the Meal Plan Change deadline, please visit the Bursar's website. Impact on Financial Aid Students who live off-campus are packaged as a "commuter" instead of as a "residential" student by the Financial Aid office, which means they may qualify for less grant aid. Students who are planning to move off-campus are strongly encouraged to discuss with the Financial Aid Office how it may affect their financial aid package before finalizing their plans. Impact on Housing Guarantee Only students who started at the College as First Years and who are currently living in campus housing (or who lived in campus housing immediately prior to going to an approved study abroad program) are eligible to register for the Room Selection process in the Spring to have a guarantee of housing for the following academic year. Students who choose to live off-campus would lose their guarantee of housing for the future and would no longer be eligible for the Room Selection process. They are not able to take part in the Lottery or be pulled into groups, etc. Students who are not eligible to register for the Room Selection process may apply for housing to be on the non-Guaranteed Wait List. Please note that while College is always hopeful to be able to provide housing to as many applicants as possible, space in campus housing is finite and assignment unfortunately cannot be guaranteed.
