Include your full name and GT ID# in your switch campus request. We will then work with the Registrar to switch your campus code to GT-Shenzhen so you will be able to register for courses offered at the GT-Shenzhen campus. Courses offered at GT-Shenzhen are regular GT classes that appear in the registration system just like all other courses offered at GT. Because they are regular GT classes, grades earned in these courses are shown on a participant’s GT transcript and are calculated as part of the GT GPA. If you are an international student at GT-Atlanta, it is your responsibility to check with OIE in order to determine whether you can keep the same visa when returning to the US or you will need a different visa. It is also the student’s responsibility to work with GT Housing and Residence Life to initiate a cancellation, due to study abroad reasons. To apply for this cancellation (penalty free) for an upcoming term, please complete the request form to submit with your housing cancellation.
