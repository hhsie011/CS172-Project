Watson Jr. University Professor of Technology and Education, Professor of Computer Science Overview Andries van Dam is the Thomas J. Watson Jr., University Professor of Technology and Education and Professor of Computer Science. He has been a member of Brown's faculty since 1965, is a founder of Brown's Computer Science Department, and was its first Chairman from 1979 to 1985. From 2002 to 2006 he was Brown's first Vice President for Research. His research includes work on computer graphics, hypermedia systems, post-WIMP user interfaces (including pen-centric computing), and educational software. Over the last four decades he has worked on systems for creating and reading electronic books with interactive illustrations for use in education and research. He is the co-author of nearly a dozen books, including "Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice", with James D. Foley, Steven K. Feiner, and John F. Hughes (Addison-Wesley 1990). He received a B.S. degree (with Honors) in Engineering Sciences from Swarthmore College in 1960 and a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania in 1966. He is a Fellow of ACM, IEEE, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the American Academy of Arts & Sciences, and is a member of National Academy of Engineering. His awards include the ACM Steven A. Coons Award for Outstanding Creative Contributions to Computer Graphics and the IEEE James H. Mulligan, Jr. Education Medal. He holds honorary doctorates from Swarthmore College and Darmstadt Technical University. Brown Affiliations Computer Science Research Areas computer | electronic books | graphics | hypermedia | visualization Research Research Overview Andy van Dam's research has concerned computer graphics, hypermedia systems, post-WIMP user interfaces, including pen-centric computing, and educational software. He has been working for nearly four decades on systems for creating and reading electronic books with interactive illustrations for use in teaching and research. Research Statement His computer graphics research interests have included the development and advocacy of graphics standards, such as the SIGGRAPH Core graphics library, PHIGS+, and others, that helped to bring together researchers from different manufacturers and research organizations. These standards facilitated the development of graphics tools that significantly advanced graphics research. Another outcome of his graphics research has been the co-authorship of two field-defining textbooks in Computer Graphics and over a hundred scientific articles. His research group's post-WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointing-device) user interface research has included both IVR (Immersive Virtual Reality) interaction research on the one hand and gesture-based user interfaces for both desktop computers and the Tablet PC on the other. The IVR research uses the Cave facility (an 8' cube with three walls and floor that are stereo projection surfaces) and includes projects such as scientific visualization of Mars exploration and human artery blood flow. Gesture-based user interface research has included Sketch, a two-handed gestural constraint-based sketching system for the desktop and more recently, work with the Tablet PC that has culminated in the March 20th founding of the Microsoft Center for PenCentric Computing. His pioneering work in hypertext and text processing, dating back to HES in 1967, helped created the field through hypermedia systems such as HES, FRESS, EDS, and IRIS Intermedia, all of which pre-date, foreshadow, and functionally provide features still unavailable on the Web. In 1990 he was a co-founder and chief scientist of Electronic Book Technologies, the first company to use the then still new SGML (the precursor of XML) to build hypertext-based electronic books, primarily for technical documentation. The hypertext research stimulated his interests in systems development so that in parallel with the ongoing work on FRESS, EDS, and Intermedia, he and his team conducted research in software systems, compilers, microprogramming, and distributed computing. As part of the efforts in distributed programming in 1976 and 1977 he co-founded the distributed computing workshops at Brown that later evolved to become the IEEE ICDCS conferences, which celebrated their 25th anniversary last year. Undergirding all the computer graphics, hypermedia, systems, and user interface research has been a lifelong interest in the use of software for education, starting with the use of FRESS to teach courses in environment science and poetry and continuing with Intermedia used for courses in Biology and Literature. In more recent years he and his team have continued to develop educational software tools that combine interaction within hypermedia information structures, starting with Exploratories, which are Java applets designed to teach concepts in computer graphics either as stand-alone units or embedded within hypermedia frameworks. Their most recent education research includes GTT (Graphics Teaching Tool), a Java-based interactive application; Tablet PC-based projects such as MathPad, a mathematical sketching application for mathematical problem solving, and ChemPad, an organic chemistry 3D molecule visualization tool; and Immune Attack, a educational software biology simulation game being deployed in the Spring of 2006; Looking towards the next generation of educational software, he is developing a theoretical framework called Clip Models, which are simulation-based families of components that represent multiple levels of explanatory power and simulation fidelity designed to interoperate and to be assembled into systems. Unlike clip art, clip models emphasize behavior, interaction and exploration, and interoperability.

Affiliations Visualize it Affiliations ACM, Fellow IEEE, Fellow AAAS, Fellow NAE American Academy of Arts & Sciences Teaching Teaching Overview CS015: Emphasizes object-oriented design and programming in Java, an effective modern technique for producing modular, reusable, internet-aware programs. Also introduces interactive computer graphics, user interface design, and some fundamental data structures and algorithms. A sequence of successively more complex graphics programs, including Tetris, helps provide a serious introduction to the field intended for both potential concentrators and those who may take only a single course. No prerequisites. CS123: This course offers an in-depth exploration of fundamental concepts in 2D and 3D computer graphics. It introduces 2D raster graphics techniques, including scan conversion, simple image processing, interaction techniques and user interface design. The bulk of the course is devoted to 3D modeling, geometric transformations, and 3D viewing and rendering. A sequence of assignments in C++ culminates in a simple geometric modeler and ray tracer. Prerequisite: CS16 or 18; either 32 or 36 is strongly recommended. Students who do not know C++ should take a minicourse on it offered during the first week of the semester. Math 52 is strongly recommendended.
