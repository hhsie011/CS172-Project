If you are a proxy whose student has authorized you to discuss student education records with University officials, please read the important information below: First contact your student or login to Proxy Access to obtain the desired information, This additional authorization permits you to discuss your student’s educational records with University officials. This authorization does NOT permit you to request official documents, make changes to records, or otherwise conduct business on your student’s behalf (ex: order transcripts, add/drop classes). University officials may discuss details of all educational records with authorized individuals, including grades, class schedule, academic standing (probation, etc.), disciplinary records, and billing information. It excludes sharing information from police or University medical records. Authorized proxies must first confirm their identity to University officials according to the federal Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) guidelines before education records can be disclosed. Proxies will be required to identify themselves with their proxy Passphrase before University officials may discuss education records over the phone. If you don’t know your Passphrase, your student can confirm it for you and sent it to you via email from within the student Proxy Management area of Self Service.
