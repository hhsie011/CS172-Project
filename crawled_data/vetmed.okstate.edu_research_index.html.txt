Brock Memorial Library Animal Use in Research & Teaching Research Mission Our mission is the development of a nationally renowned program of animal health and biomedical research. The quality of the instructional and professional service program in a college of veterinary medicine tends to be closely identified with the quantity and quality of the faculty's research productivity. The publication and presentation of research results give the college visibility within the veterinary profession and the biomedical community. Visibility and good reputation greatly enhance the college's ability to recruit and retain highly motivated and productive faculty and to recruit candidates for the college's veterinary, graduate and internship and residency training programs. A highly productive and renowned research faculty generates outside funds for equipment, graduate trainees and indirect costs that directly benefit the instructional and service missions. Laboratories The College of Veterinary Medicine (CVM) has invested in state of the art laboratory facilities to accomplish our mission of service to companion animal, livestock, and human health and well-being.
