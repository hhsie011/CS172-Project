The Dean is accountable for the quality of the College’s academic programs and faculty, and for aligning the priorities of the College and the University. The Dean is an advocate for the full array of disciplines and programs, employees, and students in RCHHS, and for the development of an overarching vision that will pull these components into an integrated whole. The Dean is expected to provide visionary leadership to align with the Four Pillars and Five Academic Strategic Initiatives articulated in Illuminate, the university’s academic strategic plan (see illuminate.web.baylor.edu). The Dean is expected to recruit and retain strong, research active, teaching, and clinical faculty and excellent staff, enhance undergraduates’ educational experience, strengthen graduate programs – with particular emphasis on doctoral programs – and elevate research activity in pursuit of Baylor’s stated goal to join the ranks of elite research universities nationwide. The Dean has general administrative responsibility for RCHHS including its compliance with accreditation standards, research standards, and Baylor policies and procedures; community outreach; fundraising; marketing and enrollment; interdisciplinary initiatives; global outreach; and the effective management of its administrative and financial affairs. The Dean consults with faculty in designing the College’s strategic plan and sets the tone for the College in encouraging excellence, recognizing achievement, and supporting appointments and promotions based on merit. The Dean is responsible for increasing research and creative scholarship, growing entrepreneurial activity, establishing external partnerships to support faculty and student needs, creating opportunities for students, fostering a collaborative spirit within the College, defining the College’s strategic priorities, and securing resources to fulfill those priorities. The Dean oversees an office staff consisting of three associate deans – for research, for graduate programs and Army-Baylor Affiliate Programs, and for undergraduate and international studies; an assistant dean for finance and operations; a director of marketing and communications; and an assistant to the dean. The Dean oversees the department chairs and leads the School’s Leadership Council, consisting of the chairs and other senior leadership. The Dean also works closely with the Director of Development assigned to RCHHS by the central University Advancement office, who works in collaboration with a national team of eight development officers. The Dean works closely with the 13-member Board of Advocates (Advisory Board), comprised of alumni and key business and community leaders, who provide support in strategic planning, fundraising and special projects, opportunities for students, and enhancing the profile of the College. Opportunities Ahead The new Dean will inherit a healthy College that is well-positioned for continued progress. RCHHS offers an array of assets upon which to build: A committed, loyal, and caring faculty working to balance efforts in the areas of teaching, research, creative scholarship, clinical care, and service to best serve the interests of all stakeholders; A track record of financially successful programs, driven by highly successful online and hybrid offerings; A strong clinical foundation; High demand for programs and graduates; A student body that is well-grounded in values and demonstrates a strong work ethic; A close-knit community characterized by collegiality and camaraderie; The benefit of Baylor’s association with health excellence as part of its brand; A loyal and diverse base of Baylor alumni and friends who are interested in the success of the College; A supportive central administration and collaborative academic leadership environment with a cadre of collegial dean colleagues; and Baylor University’s strong institutional ethos and commitment to a heritage of servant leadership, health care, and the integration of Christian values and high academic standards.
