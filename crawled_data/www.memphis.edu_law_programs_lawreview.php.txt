Student editors make all editorial decisions and, together with a faculty advisory, carry out the vision of the publication. The Law Review is an important academic forum for legal scholarship, publishing articles by professors, judges, and practitioners from around the country. Additionally, the journal is designed to be an effective research tool for practicing lawyers and students of the law.
