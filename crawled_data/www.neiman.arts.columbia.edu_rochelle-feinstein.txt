(2011) is a portfolio of 14 screenprints with hand-coloring that is based on a series of drawings with the same title. Feinstein began the ambitious drawing project during the economic downturn of 2009. She surveyed her studio's assets which included older stretchers, unfinished paintings, unused art supplies and an assortment of other resources. Feinstein ventured to optimize these assets' value by recombining all available materials into a new body of work. Articles on the project: Art in America, November / 11/04/11 website, Bomb Magazine, Winter 2011 Feinstein's works weave together her own subjectivity with historical and vernacular associations, an expansive painting lexicon, and the mythologies and matter of popular culture. The result is an a-stylistic yet deeply personal body of work, each gesture deliberate and vacillating between earnestness and irreverence. Feinstein's interests are even more pronounced in such a pre-posthumous assignment, in which revisionism and resourcefulness permit a particularly focused and substantive view of Feinstein's quick-witted and often capricious work. Rochelle Feinstein (b. 1947) lives and works in New York. Her work was the subject of a solo survey at the Bronx Museum of the Arts, NY in 2018-2019. She has had other solo exhibitions at Kunsthaus Baselland in 2018 and Centre d’Art Contemporain, Geneva in 2016. Feinstein’s work was included in the 2014 Whitney Biennial. She has received numerous awards and grants including a John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship, a Joan Mitchell Foundation Grant and a Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Fellowship. She is Professor Emerita of Painting and Printmaking at Yale University.
