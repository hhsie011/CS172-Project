F-2 dependents remain in status only as long as the F-1 from whom the status is derived remains in valid F-1 status (and only until attaining age 21 if a dependent child).

F-2 and Employment F-2 dependents are not eligible for any employment in the US. F-2 and Travel Can enter the US with or after the F-1 nonimmigrant, but never before Once in the US, must have a properly signed F-2 Form I-20 (request a travel signature at ISS) along with a valid passport and F-2 visa to travel abroad and re-enter the US May not remain in the US after the F-1 student is absent from the US unless the absence is temporary Inviting an F-2 Dependent Request a Dependent F-2 I-20 Log into iHawk and select "F-1 Student Services"--> “I-20 Requests”. Click on "Start a New Request" and select "I-20 Add Dependent(s)" to complete and submit the request. What you will need: Dependent’s passport ID page(s) Verification of financial ability: KU Funding: If you have a GA/GRA/GTA, Lecturer position, fellowship or departmental scholarship, you must provide the name and email address of the departmental staff person who can verify the salary and benefit information. Other Funding (ex. personal, family, home government): Upload current evidence of financial support for yourself and your dependent(s), for at least one year of attendance (or until the anticipated completion of degree, whichever is shorter). For the minimum amount, refer to your specific major/program’s estimated cost of attendance. Don’t forget to add the cost for dependents (= amount listed under ‘Dependent Expenses’ at the bottom of the cost information for your program, multiplied by the number of dependents). When can I come to ISS to process the Dependent I-20 request? Monitor the status of your request in iHawk. When the e-Form shows "Pending Review" status, your request is ready for review. Come to the ISS office and meet with an immigration advisor during walk-in advising hours to process the Add Dependent request. An ISS advisor will prepare the necessary SEVIS dependent I-20(s). The student's dependent(s) will then use the I-20(s), marked "for use by dependents", to apply for an F-2 dependent visa at a US embassy or consulate abroad (or apply for a change of status within the U.S.)..
