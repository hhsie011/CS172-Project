In addition to university-wide civil rights compliance, the Office of Institutional Equity and Title IX (OIETIX) is responsible for collecting and tracking all reported bias activity that occurs at Cornell University that could potentially impact our commitment to diversity and inclusion, including all reports made by faculty, staff, students, and visitors to the Ithaca, Weill Cornell Medicine, and Cornell Tech campuses. If you have seen, heard, or experienced bias, you can make a report in the following ways: Bias Incident Form Office of Institutional Equity and Title IX (OIETIX) at equity@cornell.edu Reporting is confidential and open to all Anyone who directly witnesses or experiences bias activity (or finds evidence of or hears about past bias activity) on the Cornell campus or in an area that impacts the Cornell community should intervene in the moment as appropriate (e.g., contact Campus Police at 911, if a crime is in progress, or interrupt the behavior in as much as the observer feels skilled and safe). A report of the incident should be made as soon as possible. Annual Reports Each year, a report is issued that includes aggregate data of all reported bias activity from July 1 - June 30.

What is a Discrimination Complaint?
