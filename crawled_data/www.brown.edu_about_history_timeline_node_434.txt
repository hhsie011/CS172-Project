The intention was to eventually mirror that stand to the north. However, the capacity today stands at 20,000, short of the planned 32,000. The football stadium joined the adjacent Aldrich Baseball Field. The Brown Gymnasium (later named Marvel Gymnasium) was completed across Elmgrove Avenue two years later.
