The EMF is designed to house a suite of electron microscopes, and each room has the power, cooling water supply, and HVAC necessary to run a modern microscope. This facility has also been mapped for stray fields and is well isolated from vibration. The EMF is organized as a self-use laboratory, which allows users the opportunity to develop critical skills to perform advanced research. The EMF technical staff will provide new users with practical training, including the facility standard operating practice, safety training requirements and instrument operation. In addition to supporting authorized users, the EMF technical staff is also available to perform instrument operations for researchers. The EMF is administered by IMNI and is operated as a cost center where the annual cost of supplies, service contracts, and personnel is recovered through an hourly charge to users for their instrument beam time. The EMF serves the research and teaching needs of faculty, researchers, and students in the physical and biological sciences at Brown University and is also available to outside academic and industry researchers.
