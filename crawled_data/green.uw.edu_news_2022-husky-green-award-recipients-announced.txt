This year's winners include students, faculty and staff who have demonstrated leadership, initiative and dedication to campus sustainability. This is the 13th year the Husky Green Awards have been presented by the UW Environment Stewardship Committee to recognize the individuals and groups who lead the way in sustainability at the UW. Students, faculty, staff and groups from all UW campuses are eligible for the Husky Green Awards, and all winners are selected from nominations made by the UW community. The Husky Green Legacy Awards are given by the selection committee to recognize individuals and groups who have made sustained, long-standing contributions to sustainability at the UW. This year's Legacy Award winners are Nancy Rottle, a faculty member of the College of Built Environments, and Warren Gold, faculty emeritus at UW Bothell. Nancy Rottle has taught at the UW since 2001. She founded and since 2006 has directed the UW’s Green Futures Research and Design Lab, which addresses questions and projects related to urban green infrastructure. She has been an advisor and champion for student projects funded by the Campus Sustainability Fund, including the Gould Hall Green Wall and Floating Wetlands projects. Through the Green Futures Lab as well as design studios, she has empowered countless UW students to imagine what ecological integrity and livability may look like in urban spaces. Warren Gold has been a member of the UW Bothell faculty since 1998, and was instrumental in creating UWB’s Environmental Science degree and the revision of that degree into Conservation and Restoration Science. He also helped found the UW Restoration Ecology Network (UW-REN), which was an outreach of the wetlands restoration on the UW Bothell campus that he helped guide through its successful early development. UW-REN brought together people from all three UW campuses in many different disciplines interested in ecological restoration. Gold retired from UW Bothell last summer and is now emeritus faculty.
