In concert with the University's Ignatian heritage, the OID is committed to advancing and sustaining a living, learning, and working environment supporting cultural diversity and inclusion at its broadest level. Our focus at OID centers on building and sustaining individual and organizational cultural capacity in advancing and sustaining a working, learning, and living environment where everyone feels welcomed, respected, and diverse perspectives are fostered and valued. Please visit the OID website to learn more about opportunities to build and advance your knowledge and awareness of diversity and inclusion topics. Over the course of the past sixteen months, we have stood in solidarity with one another supporting and working to address the concerns of members of the Boston College community. During a time when the health and safety of our community have called for physical distancing. Recognizing this we have not veered away from opportunities to build and strengthen relationships, physical distancing never social distancing. Now more than ever we must remain steadfast in our commitment to deepen our sense of conviction promoting opportunities building individual and organizational knowledge, skills, and attitudes for continued advancement toward inclusive excellence. We are all on a journey of discovery and learning together!
