Most research focuses on curing diseases by ridding hosts of a particular environmental insult, cancerous cell, or clearing a pathogen. Another way to survive an infection is to tolerate the alterations to homeostasis that occur during a disease state; a process called host resilience or tolerance. We are focused on what mechanisms are necessary to increase resilience, and hence survival, to disease. https://vivo.brown.edu/display/ajamieso I am a trainer in the Molecular Cell Biochemistry (MCB), Pathobiology and Biomedical Engineering (BME) graduate programs.
