MATH 303A is highly recommended. Interdisciplinary Thematic Emphasis (21 units) The Interdisciplinary Thematic Emphasis (ITE) is designed for students who have broad interests that expand beyond the confines of a single department. For these students, the ability to construct their own area of interdisciplinary study by taking advanced coursework in several disciplines may be more beneficial than restricting their study to one of the various majors offered by the university. The Interdisciplinary Thematic Emphasis does not duplicate any existing major. It is a well-thought-out, highly individualized group of courses that, even though they come from various departments, have a common subject, focus or interest. ITE students may center their coursework on an academic interest or may select courses that prepare them for later professional training or for specific careers. Personalized Coordinated Program (18 units) In consultation with a Liberal Studies adviser, ITE students select 18 units of upper-division coursework from various departments for the purpose of pursuing an interdisciplinary problem, theme or issue. To ensure breadth of knowledge, ITE students are allowed to take: (a) no more than nine units from a single department; and (b) no more than 15 units from a single area of knowledge (humanities and arts, science, social sciences). ITE students must have their study plan approved by a Liberal Studies adviser prior to taking coursework. Senior Project (3 units) To integrate and synthesize knowledge acquired through their Personalized Coordinated Program, ITE students must complete a senior project (such as a thesis or a creative work relevant to the theme of their Personalized Coordinated Program) by enrolling in LBST 482 or three units of LBST 499 with a professor of their choice. ITE students should schedule an appointment with a LBST adviser immediately after deciding upon the thematic Emphasis in order to organize a project and enroll in the required units of LBST 482 or LBST 499 .
