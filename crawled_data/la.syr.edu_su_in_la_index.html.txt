In addition, it is the base of operation for academic programming and special alumni events. To build and maintain connections with the growing number of alumni on the West Coast, the University established an alumni center in Los Angeles in 2005. With a remarkable growth in academic programs and alumni events, the center was soon outgrown. In 2011, the University established a new satellite campus, moving into larger facilities at 4312 Woodman Avenue in Sherman Oaks. The 7,500-square-foot space includes offices and classrooms, as well as conference rooms for workshops and meeting with prospective students.
