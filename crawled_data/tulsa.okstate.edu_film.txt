State-of-the-art, hands-on learning at OSU-Tulsa contributes to creating an experienced workforce in Tulsa to support film productions in the state, as well as gives students the necessary skills to start their own film projects. Non-Credit Workshops OSU-Tulsa has offered public, non-credit workshops for aspiring filmmakers, screenwriters and producers through the Center for Poets and Writers at OSU-Tulsa since 2019. Taught by industry professionals, these workshops give participants an inside look into the film industry. In 2021, OSU-Tulsa hired filmmaker-in-residence Zach Litwack and expanded its film workshop offerings in response to requests from productions filming in Oklahoma. Future film workshops include Powerful Movie Moments and Motion Picture Storytelling. Film Set Etiquette Workshop OSU-Tulsa’s first intensive, hands-on two-day film set etiquette or “Film Setiquette” workshop sold out weeks in advance. The experience will explore how a professional film set is run and offer students a grasp of best practices that will allow them to find work on other film sets as a production assistant or apprentice in one of six departments. Workshop participants shadow and assist working professionals including a cinematographer, hair and make-up artist, sound mixer, production designer, gaffer and assistant director. Cherokee Nation Film Office Partnership The Cherokee Nation Film Office has helped fund film equipment, including cameras, lenses, sound gear, lighting and other film essentials, as well as post-production necessities such as computers and software to help expand OSU-Tulsa’s film program. The Cherokee Nation and its film office have also partnered with the university to offer scholarships to the non-credit film workshops for any citizen of a federally recognized tribe.
