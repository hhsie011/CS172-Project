Harvard Review is a semi-annual literary journal published out of Houghton Library. Founded in 1992 by the curator of the Woodbery Poetry Room, the journal features poetry, essays, and short fiction. It showcases the work of both emerging and established writers. Past contributors to Harvard Review include such literary legends as Andrea Barrett, Yusef Komunyakaa, Sharon Olds, David Foster Wallace, John Updike, Seamus Heaney, and Gore Vidal. Two Pulitzer Prize-winners—Jhumpa Lahiri and Paul Harding—made their literary debut in the pages of the journal.
