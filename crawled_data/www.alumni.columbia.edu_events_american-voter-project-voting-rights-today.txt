Integral to that conversation, of course, is the historical context and current state of voting rights in the United States. For this installment of the American Voter Project series, the Eric H. Holder Jr. Initiative for Civil and Political Rights invites you to join us for a panel discussion on the past, present, and future of voting rights in the US. Panelists Eric H. Holder Jr. CC'73, LAW'76, 82nd Attorney General of the United States Heather Gerken, Dean and Sol & Lillian Goldman Professor of Law, Yale Law School Neil Volz, Deputy Director, Florida Rights Restoration Coalition (FRRC) Michael Waldman CC'82, President, Brennan Center for Justice Moderated by Jelani Cobb, Ira A. Lipman Professor of Journalism at Columbia University and staff writer at The New Yorker *Panelists subject to change.
