After all, conflict is a necessary - and healthy - element of all human relationships. The key is to make sure that bottled up emotions and/or uncontrolled outbursts don't lead to toxicity in the workplace and between family members. Resolving a conflict on a timely basis is the key management responsibility. On September 25th, Professor of Professional Practice and Co-Executive Director of the Advanced Consortium on Cooperation, Conflict and Complexity (AC4) and Director of the Youth, Peace and Security (YPS), Beth Fisher-Yoshida, will be at the Columbia Global Centers | Rio de Janeiro for an open class about Negotiation and Conflict Resolution. Professor Fisher-Yoshida will also present the Master of Science in Negotiation and Conflict Resolution program at the Columbia School of Professional Studies. The class will cover some scenarios of what people experience in life and how the NECR program can address it. For example, a scenario of a workplace conflict, family conflict, partner/spouse conflict, and state level conflict and what that person can learn in the program to enhance their situations. Professor Fisher-Yoshida will also present the Master of Science in Negotiation and Conflict Resolution program at the Columbia School of Professional Studies. REGISTER HERE!
