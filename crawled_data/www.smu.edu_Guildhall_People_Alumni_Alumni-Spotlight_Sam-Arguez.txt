I get to make what I think is the coolest section of art in the game. Why did you choose to get your education from SMU Guildhall? The guildhall looked like it had industry backing and had the solid name of SMU behind it. It seemed almost too good to be true. How did SMU Guildhall prepare you for your career in gaming, and what impact has it had on your life? The major thing it taught me was how to work in teams to make a game. The secondary thing it taught me was how to build art for a game. The impact is immeasurable. I wouldn't be in the industry today had it not been for the guildhall. I wouldn't live in the city I live in. Everything would be different. It was a huge turning point in my life. What is your favorite Guildhall memory? Getting an email from an engineer at Valve, telling me how impressed he was with what we were able to do with the Source Engine on our final project, in such little time after it was released. What advice would you offer for students looking to get into gaming? Start making something. Learn a game engine like Unreal.
