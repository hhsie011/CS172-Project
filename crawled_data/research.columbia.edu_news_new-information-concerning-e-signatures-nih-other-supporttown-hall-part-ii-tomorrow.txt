A typed name is not an electronic signature and is not acceptable. Certification cannot be delegated to administrators or other staff. NIH will not accept wet signatures, or pictures of wet signatures. The University recommends using DocuSign to electronically sign the Other Support forms. DocuSign is cloud-based and automatically retains the originally signed documents. Both faculty and administrators can use DocuSign. CUIT is in the process of creating DocuSign accounts for PIs who have current active or pending NIH grants. Administrators who support faculty in creating and organizing Other Support forms and wish to have access to DocuSign will need to request an account. Please complete this Qualtrics form as soon as possible in order for CUIT to create an account. We only need the person’s name and UNI, and one person can complete forms for multiple individuals. DocuSign training will be offered next week by CUIT and SPA, and will be recorded if you are unable to attend. A quick desktop reference guide and instructional video resources will also be forthcoming. Please register for the trainings by using a Columbia-affiliated email address here: Wednesday, January 19th, 3 – 4pm Friday, January 21st, 2 - 3pm In addition, we’d like to remind you about tomorrow’s NIH Town Hall – Part II. During the town hall, we will cover the latest changes to the NIH application forms (FORMS-G), the new eRA Commons ID requirements, and leave time for open Q&A on anything concerning the biosketches and Other Support forms. To register: Friday, January 14th, 2pm – 3:30pm (use a Columbia-affiliated email address) Please feel free to send me any questions at [email protected] By Stephanie F.
