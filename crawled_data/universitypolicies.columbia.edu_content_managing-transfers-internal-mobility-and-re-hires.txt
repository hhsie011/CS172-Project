Employees covered by collective bargaining agreements are governed by the provisions of their respective contract. Collective bargaining agreements may be found in the CUHR website Policy Text University employees who have completed one year of service in their current position may apply and be considered for a posted job opportunity at the University. In special circumstances and with CUHR approval, an employee may seek a transfer prior to completing one year of service in his or her current position. In addition to experience, skills and qualifications, future career moves and opportunities for re-hire will depend upon successful performance and demonstrated success, including the current or most recent position. All employees are subject to the standard background checking process for any University position for which they apply. Any open position must be reviewed and approved by the department or school before posting in TalentLink. Please consult with your Senior Human Resources Business Partner for any questions regarding the hiring process and filling vacancies within your department. The guidelines described below establish a University-wide process for effectively managing the movement of internal staffing both between and within schools and departments for approved positions and hiring employees who have previously worked at the University. Positions that are waived from posting in TalentLink are also subject to this policy. Guidelines 1. Position is approved by department or school, funding is confirmed and job description is posted in the TalentLink system. 2. Any qualified and eligible employees may apply for the position as appropriate. 3. After the employee applies for the open position, the Hiring Manager may initiate a confidential informal meeting with the internal candidate to determine mutual interest. This step is optional and at the discretion of the Hiring Manager. 4. After meeting with the internal candidate and reviewing his or her qualifications, the Hiring Manager determines if the candidate should proceed with his or her application and engage in the interview process. 5. If a Hiring Manager determines that an internal candidate is the finalist, he or she should inform the candidate. At this point, the candidate must inform his or her supervisor that he or she is the finalist prior to a formal offer being made. The candidate must confirm completion of this step with the Hiring Manager within a reasonable and mutually agreed upon time frame. 6. After confirmation of step 5, the Hiring Manager should follow-up with and obtain feedback on work performance from the finalist's supervisor or designated reference(s) prior to a formal offer being made. NOTE: It is required that a review of work performance and/or performance appraisals is fairly and consistently applied to all internal and re-hire candidates and completed before any verbal or written offer is made. The Senior Human Resources Business Partner for both departments will ensure that a review of the candidate's work performance has been conducted before any offer is made. Any questions or concerns about this step should be reviewed with the Senior Human Resources Business Partner. 7. After completion of step 6, the Hiring Manager can formally offer the position to the finalist. After the offer has been accepted, the Hiring Manager and supervisor should jointly determine the finalist's start date. The release date for transferring employees may be extended beyond the standard thirty (30) day notice period because of critical operational needs and with necessary approvals. NOTE: If the supervisor considers extending the release date beyond the standard notice period for transferring employees, the supervisor must provide a business rationale that requires review and approval by CUHR or CUIMC-HR prior to any discussion with the hiring manager and finalist. In addition to CUHR or CUIMC-HR approval, the hiring manager, the supervisor and the finalist must mutually consent to the agreement. It is expected that the release date will not exceed a total of two months. Any questions or concerns about this step should be reviewed with the Senior Human Resources Business Partner. 8. Hiring Manager confirms offer in writing to finalist including salary, title and start date. Definitions TalentLink: Online job posting and application system.
