The interdisciplinary major draws largely on courses from sociology, political science and economics. Its goal is to prepare students to become leaders in addressing complex issues related to the social and human dimensions of agriculture at both the local and global level. Students will learn social science concepts and skills to understand, analyze and communicate complex ideas, information and data related to agricultural systems. Internships are an important part of the Agricultural & Rural Policy Studies major. The curriculum offers the flexibility needed to accommodate the special interests and needs of each student. Student Learning Outcomes The curriculum is designed to provide students with the following skills and competencies: Recognize, analyze and evaluate the critical human and social factors (e.g. practices, policies, laws, institutions) impacting agriculture. Understand the social dimensions of agriculture and its connections with food and environmental systems. Develop problem solving, critical thinking, and leadership skills to positively influence human impacts on agriculture. Understand the perspectives of diverse stakeholders and develop strategies to communicate clearly and effectively to a range of audiences. Students will develop the necessary skills to become effective leaders with companies, local, national and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and government agencies that work on agricultural, food and environmental related issues. Graduates can work as public policy analysts, government relations, public relations, program analyst, program specialists, marketing, sales, agriculture, educators, and executive directors.

For M.S. and Ph.D. departmental requirements, see Program of Graduate Study for Degrees in Sociology and Rural Sociology, available from the department office. The department offers concentrations in a number of areas, e.g., community studies and development; sociology of families, inequality, food systems, agriculture and environment; methodology; social change and development; criminology; the economy, organizations and work; and social psychology. The Department of Sociology does not offer a nonthesis master’s program. Graduates have a broad understanding of sociology, address complex societal problems, and communicate effectively with scientific colleagues and the general public in both formal and informal settings. They understand sociological theory, conduct research, and are prepared to educate college students and contribute to public policy. Although the department stipulates no language requirement for either the degree master of science or the degree doctor of philosophy, specifying competence in one or more languages may be desirable in some instances. The department also participates in the interdepartmental program in interdepartmental majors in sustainable agriculture, transportation and water resources, and interdepartmental minors in gerontology (see Index).
