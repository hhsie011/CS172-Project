Speech and Hearing Sciences encompasses the study of human communication and its disorders, providing a research-based, academic foundation in the concepts and principles of speech, hearing, language, swallowing, and their associated disorders across the life span. The program provides a foundation in the clinical processes used to identify, prevent, and treat individuals with communication and swallowing disorders, allowing students to develop critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and a broad understanding of the field. This program of study leads to the following credentials: Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Speech and Hearing Sciences Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Speech and Hearing Sciences (Fee-based) Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Speech and Hearing Sciences: Communication Disorders (not admitting) Continuation Policy All students must make satisfactory academic progress in the degree program. Failure to do so results in probation, which can lead to dismissal. For the complete continuation policy, contact the department adviser or refer to the department website. Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Speech and Hearing Sciences Credential Overview The Bachelor of Science (B.S.) is for students interested in the scientific and theoretical frameworks for understanding human communication and its disorders, including the roles of biology, cognition, environment and culture. The B.S. degree provides an overview of the discipline, including the neurological, behavioral, physical, and anatomic-physiological bases of speech, language, hearing, and swallowing as well as evaluation and treatment considerations for individuals with communication disorders across the lifespan. The B.S. program prepares students for paraprofessional employment, graduate study in speech, language or hearing science research, or a clinical career in speech-language pathology or audiology. Because it offers more flexibility than the Communication Disorders degree option, this program is appropriate for students with interests in other related fields such as education, linguistics, psychology, nursing, rehabilitation science, medicine, neuroscience, etc. Recommended Preparation Suggested First and Second-Year College Courses: Social/behavioral science: anthropology, public health, psychology, or sociology.

This structured and intensive program provides students from outside disciplines with the necessary academic foundation in normal hearing, speech, language, and swallowing development, speech acoustics, physiology and perception, and hearing. It also provides instruction as the nature of language, speech, hearing, and swallowing disorders in children and adults and the clinical processes involved in the identification, prevention and remediation of these disorders. The B.S. provides excellent preparation for graduate level study in a clinically oriented degree leading to professional certification in speech-language pathology.
