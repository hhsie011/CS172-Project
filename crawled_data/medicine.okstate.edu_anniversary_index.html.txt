Support COM Purchase a Brick Oath of CommitmentCollege of Osteopathic MedicineShare a Memory In March 1972, with dwindling numbers of primary care physicians in rural Oklahoma, the Oklahoma College of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery was established to educate and train osteopathic medicine physicians. 50 years later, we are still fulfilling that mission. Today, OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine educates tomorrow’s physicians in a wide range of specialties to serve both rural and urban areas of our state. Now with our College of Osteopathic Medicine at the Cherokee Nation in Tahlequah, our impact is even greater. - Johnny Stephens, Pharm.D.
