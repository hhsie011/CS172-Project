Once credit - a letter grade of "D" or better - has been earned in a course, a student may receive financial aid for only one additional (second) attempt of the same course, regardless of the earned grade for the second attempt. A third or subsequent attempt of that same course will not be factored into the student's enrollment and federal aid may be reduced or canceled. Adding courses may mitigate any reduction. At census, we will modify aid based on your adjusted enrollment status. Repeated classes may also count against satisfactory academic progress , which must be taken into consideration when determining aid eligibility. Examples of who is eligible to receive financial aid for repeat coursework Sample Course 1st Take 2nd Take 3rd Take 4th Take ACCT 201A F (eligible) D (eligible) F (eligible) Not eligible for aid ENG 101 D (eligible) F (eligible) Not eligible for aid - COM 100 D (eligible) D (eligible) Not eligible for aid - SAMPLE W D (eligible) D (eligible) Not eligible for aid SAMPLE D (eligible) W D (eligible) Not eligible for aid You will be notified via campus email if you are not eligible for aid due to repeated coursework. If you add new courses prior to the fourth week of the semester we will automatically review your eligibility.
