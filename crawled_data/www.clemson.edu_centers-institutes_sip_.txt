Brags & Rankings “ “I can easily say SIP has been one of the most beneficial programs I've been involved in since coming to Clemson. From partaking in specialized courses to sales competitions to networking nights, I feel more prepared and ready to pursue a career in sales than I ever could have imagined. In addition to developing sales skills, I've learned that I am interested in industries I knew almost nothing about before joining SIP, and I have had the opportunity to meet several SIP alumni that are a part of these industries.” Hope Wilde Junior Marketing Major Greenville, SC “ “The Sales Innovation Program has given me valuable opportunities to develop my sales skills through networking nights, sales competitions, and other events. These events have pushed me out of my comfort zone, and my sales skills have significantly improved because of them. Through this program, I have also gotten exposure to numerous companies I was previously unaware of, such as Otis Elevator Company. Without the SIP program, I would not have ever seen myself in the elevator industry, but now I am getting ready to pursue a full-time career with Otis, and I could not be more excited! SIP has been instrumental in setting me up for success in sales, and I couldn't be more thankful for my experience in this program!” Ashley Sullivan Senior Marketing Major Freeport, Pennsylvania Sales Innovation Program Copyright © Clemson University Sales Innovation Program | Wilbur O. and Ann Powers College of Business, 225 Walter T.
