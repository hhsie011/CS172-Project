An undergraduate concentration in Classics furnishes students with a broad liberal education, and provides specialized training for those students intending to enter graduate school. Students may choose to study Ancient Greek, Latin, Sanskrit, and/or Modern Greek, and to explore courses in literature, mythology, history, philosophy, and religion. Students may either pursue the standard Classics concentration – the most popular choice – or one of several optional tracks: Greek, Latin, Greek and Latin, South Asian Classics, Sanskrit, Greek and Sanskrit, or Latin and Sanskrit. Concentrators who pursue an honors degree write a senior thesis, typically over the course of two semesters during their senior year.
