Over time, Penn's global vision has deepened and expanded, particularly in these first decades of the 21st century. Building on President Judith Rodin's 1995 agenda to establish Penn as "one of the premier research and teaching universities in the nation and the world," President Amy Gutmann made strengthening Penn's global footprint a priority when she assumed office in 2004. In her inaugural address, Dr. Gutmann launched the Penn Compact with a clear call to engage globally. Ultimately, this led to the formulation of a five-year Strategic Framework for Penn's Global Initiatives in 2012, which sought to prepare students for an increasingly globalized society, strengthen Penn as a global agenda-setter, and promote healthy, inspiring, and productive lives. In its wake, Penn has been transformed, standing now as a comprehensive global institution. With over 5,000 international students, over 2,000 students studying abroad annually, and over 1,000 faculty conducting research, teaching, and leading other activities across all seven continents, Penn is more global now than at any point in its history. The University seeks to ensure that its students engage meaningfully with the world through courses, internships and research projects; as well as through their majors and professional specializations. Penn will continue to expand the resources and support for faculty, enabling them to generate knowledge of the world that is fundamental to outstanding achievement within and across disciplines. The Strategic Framework for Penn's Global Initiatives 2018-2023 is an update to the 2012-2017 Strategic Framework intended to continue to the efforts of University leadership and further Penn's preeminence as a global institution. At its core are the following three pillars: Pillar 1: Educate Global Citizens Provide a meaningful global experience to every Penn student by delivering a diverse set of rigorous global programs abroad, and expanding the range of global curricular and extracurricular programs. Pillar 2: Catalyze Transformative Ideas Bring leading global scholars and practitioners to engage the university community in generating transformative ideas on major global challenges by, for example, providing support from School-based, faculty-led research initiatives around the globe. Pillar 3: Bring the World to Penn and Penn to the World Further Penn as a global agenda-setter and catalyst for innovative and transformative ideas by leveraging existing services and resources, enhancing mechanisms for support, and expanding Penn's institutional reach. 1 College Hall Suite 122 University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia, PA 19104 global@upenn.edu Penn WebLogin Â©2022 University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104 Footer Menu Office of the Provost Report Accessibility Issues and Get Help Privacy Policy
