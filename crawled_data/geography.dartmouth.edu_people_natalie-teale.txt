In these fields, I investigate the multidirectional interactions between the climate system and hydrology. My research is centered on precipitation patterns, including the impacts of heavy precipitation, variability in regional precipitation, and linkages with atmospheric moisture. This research contextualizes variability in regional precipitation within a larger climate variability framework. Past research includes assessing climate change risk for a Fortune 500 company and characterizing the atmospheric conditions related to flash flooding in watersheds of the New York City water supply system, among other projects.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Geography Undergraduate Major, Minor and Modifications Courses Culminating Experience Senior Honors Thesis Awards Careers Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Research Overview Faculty Research Student Research Postdoctoral Fellowships Facilities Off-Campus Study News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
