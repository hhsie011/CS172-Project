The Architecture Computer Lab is equipped with 12 workstations with both Macs and PCs, scanners, and large format color plotters. Software includes Adobe Photoshop, VectorWorks, Autocad, Revit and Rhino. Drafting and model making facilities are located in the Architecture Studio. About the Discipline In Architecture 1 students develop skills needed to communicate architectural ideas in two- and three-dimensions. Such factors as climate, site, orientation, program, materials and structure are studied in the process of designing structures and buildings. Free-hand drawing, the use of architectural drafting tools, and model making are emphasized. Architecture students may also take advantage of the Hopkins Center Woodworking Workshops in conjunction with certain assignments. Along with more traditional media, the computer is introduced as a design and communications tool. In Architecture II/III students continue the study of architectural design by exploring the organization of space, manipulation of light, and the experience of time in the creation of architecture. Experimentation in the language and vocabulary of architecture as expressed through drawings, models, and digital media is explored. Contextual, cultural, economic, and technological conditions, including sustainability, are addressed in design projects. Review of student work takes the form of presentations made to the class and to guest critics.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Dartmouth Studio Art Department Undergraduate Overview Major Minor Honors Senior Seminar Art Awards Awards News 2020 Award Recipients Diversity Disciplines Overview Architecture Drawing Painting Photography Printmaking Sculpture Special Topics Visual Arts Digital Lab Artists in Residence Overview Current Artist in Residence Past Artists in Residence News About the Artists Artist-in-Residence Talks Exhibitions Overview Jaffe-Friede Gallery Past Exhibitions Barrows Rotunda Past Exhibitions Strauss Gallery Past Exhibitions Student Gallery Past Exhibitions Nearburg Gallery Internships Overview Current Interns Intern Exhibitions Apply for an Internship News & Events Overview Lectures Faculty News Students News Alumni Stories Tell us Your Story Videos & Links People Overview Visiting Faculty and Critics My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
