All full-time faculty members are invited to apply for an ETG. The maximum amount for an ETG is $3,000. During the summer, up to $1,000 may be used for a faculty stipend for work directly related to the project. Applications are accepted on a rolling basis and award notifications will be made within 30 days. The project must be completed within four months, after which any unused funds will expire.

Academic Technology Innovation Grant The Academic Technology Innovation Grant (ATIG) should bring new instructional and research technologies to Boston College or bring innovative approaches to teaching and research through technology. ATIGs should aim to be self-sustaining and impact a large number of Boston College faculty and/or students. ATIGs provide start up funding, typically between $5K and $40K, although larger grants have occasionally been funded. Any successful project which continues beyond the two year grant period will require localized funding support. Grant recipients must agree to provide status reports as requested. All full-time faculty members are invited to apply for an ATIG.
