The shortage will likely increase as veterinarians retire and producer needs change. To counteract the problem, Oklahoma State University seeks to offer intervention strategies for rural sustainability by expanding veterinary skills and knowledge of herd health, food nutrition, forage management, reproductive management, and other common needs of beef producers. We will achieve this objective through three specific aims: Develop, administer, and analyze data surveys in order to fully evaluate the shortage situation including geographic range of veterinarians. Develop a series of educational modules for veterinarians focused on Beef Cattle Herd Management. Connect veterinary students with participating rural veterinarians to help sustain rural veterinary practices. The expanded services provided by the practitioners will allow beef cattle producers to become more productive while simultaneously enhancing animal health and wellbeing. These benefits will ensure greater food safety, public health, and increase opportunities for Oklahoma and the region’s economic development and prosperity. We anticipate practices will experience an improvement in their businesses. Additionally, we expect that more students will graduate entering rural practice by providing them the skills needed to effectively sustain a rural practice and by providing networking opportunities with current rural practitioners.
