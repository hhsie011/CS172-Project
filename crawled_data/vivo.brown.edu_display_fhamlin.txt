Research Research Overview Current research includes work on children and youth and the complexities of activism during the civil rights movement. Professor Hamlin first monograph, _Crossroads At Clarksdale: The Black Freedom Struggle in the Mississippi Delta After World War II_ recently won the Berkshire Conference of Women Historians First Book Prize for 2012 and the Lillian Smith Book Award. She co-edited an anthology, _Truly These Are The Brave: An Anthology of African Americans Writing on Citizenship and War_ which was a finalist for the QBR Book Prize in 2015. Research Statement My current research includes work on children and youth during the mass civil rights movement with critical analysis on the nature of activism. _Crossroads at Clarksdale_ (UNC Press, 2012) studies the civil rights movement in Coahoma County, Mississippi from 1951 to the present. Three points of inquiry frame this work. First, I reinstate women's roles as paramount to the successful maneuverings at the local level and I recast their own understanding of those roles in their own terms, using the trope of motherhood and motherwork to reinterpret leadership. Second, I track the movement of organizations in the local area, analyzing those that passed through and those that stayed in order to better understand when and how organizations succeed in their goals given the multitude of variables the members confronted, and I utilize my concept of flexible loyalties to describe how local people consciously used the groups to fulfill their own needs, Finally I reassess the difference that community activism and group cooperation made for the success of social programs. By ending the project at the eve of the millennium, I question the conventional periodization of the civil rights movement as has been memorialized by political, social and cultural historians. How do we calculate the success of a movement? Funded Research Andrew Carnegie Foundation Fellow, 2021-2023. Edmond J. Safra Fellow-in-Residence, Center for Ethics, 2021.
