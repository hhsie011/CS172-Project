Benefits and Transition Act Faculty Archived BulletinsToggle Archived Bulletins Print Options Sample Schedule The premedical academic program can be tailored to meet the needs of the individual student. The tables in this section illustrate several options: a traditional sequence, a part-time sequence, and, for those students who are prepared to begin General Chemistry and Physics, an accelerated sequence. Information is also given on summer enrollment for students who may need to begin their studies in the summer before their first fall enrollment to prepare for mathematics, chemistry, and/or physics. Accelerated Sequence An accelerated 18-month premedical program, beginning with January enrollment, is available for those students who are prepared academically to begin Calculus, General Chemistry, and Physics, and have completed a requirement such as calculus or statistics prior to matriculation. The following is an example of an accelerated sequence, and should not replace an informed and comprehensive conversation with an academic advisor. Program planning decisions may vary depending on the student’s prior academic record, preparation, and circumstances. These should be made in consultation with an academic advisor. First Year First Year Spring Summer Fall General Chemistry: CHEM UN2443 CHEM UN1403 CHEM S1404X Organic Chemistry I: General Chemistry Lab: Organic Chemistry Lab I: CHEM S1500X CHEM UN2493 General Physics: Contemporary Biology I: PHYS UN1201 PHYS S1202X BIOL UN2401 General Physics Lab: Contemporary Biology Lab: PHYS UN1291 PHYS S1292X BIOL UN2501** Calculus I (if needed): Introduction to Statistics: MATH UN1101 STAT S1111D Second Year Second Year Spring Summer Fall Organic Chemistry II: Take MCAT Glide Year: CHEM UN2444 Begin medical school application process Deepen exposure to science coursework, research, or clinical work Organic Chemistry Lab II: CHEM UN2494 Contemporary Biology II: BIOL UN2402 Contemporary Biology Lab: BIOL UN2501 Note: * CHEM S1500X General Chemistry Laboratory should be taken concurrently with or subsequent to General Chemistry II. ** BIOL UN2501 Contemporary Biology Laboratory should be taken concurrently with either BIOL UN2401 CONTEMPORARY BIOLOGY I or BIOL UN2402 Contemporary Biology II: Cell Biology, Development & Physiology. Part-time Sequence A Postbac Premed student beginning part time with the most basic courses might take the following program. Until the third summer, the student could continue to work a full-time job. The academic program and schedule may be designed to meet each student's needs. The following is an example of a part-time sequence. Decisions regarding course selection and program sequencing may vary depending on the student's prior academic record and preparation. These decisions should be made in consultation with an academic advisor.

Traditional Program Sequence Academic programs and schedules can be designed in many ways to best meet individual needs. The following is an example of a traditional program sequence. Course selection and program sequencing will vary based on the student's prior academic record and preparation. Decisions about the academic program should be made in consultation with an academic advisor.
