The Department of Education has determined the Solomon Amendment supersedes most elements of FERPA. An institution is therefore obligated to release data included in the list of “student recruiting information,” which may or may not match Columbia University’s FERPA directory information list. However, if the student has submitted a request through the University Registrar to restrict the release of Directory Information, then no information from the student's education record will be released under the Solomon Amendment. Detailed information on withholding Directory Information is located on the Office of the University Registrar website.
