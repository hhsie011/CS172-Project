Research interests range from the upper extremity to the lower extremity and from cartilage degeneration to sports mechanics. Our teaching includes undergraduate and graduate students of Brown University and Rhode Island School of Design, medical students and orthopaedic residents of Alpert Medical School and Rhode Island Hospital. The RIH Orthopaedic Foundation Test Facility, located within the Bioengineering Laboratory, serves as a resource for orthopaedic and sports industries, resident and physician training. COBRE - Bioengineering Core The Bioengineering Laboratory serves as the primary bioengineering core and provides mentoring, administrative and imaging support for the Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) for Skeletal Health and Repair. The COBRE enables clinicians and basic scientists, engineers and biologists to work side-by-side on multidisciplinary research, helping us to better understand cartilage and joint health mechanisms and develop strategies for the prevention and treatment of skeletal joint diseases.
