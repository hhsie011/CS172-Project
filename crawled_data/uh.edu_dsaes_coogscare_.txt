The CoogsCare website will continue to be a resource for emergency aid resources at UH and in the city of Houston. However, we encourage you to please visit the websites of each campus department and local resource for updates on their delivery of services. For continued updates from the University of Houston on COVID-19, please visit UH Responds to COVID-19 Student Assistance General Assistance Emergency aid is for the unexpected or unforeseen expense, event or circumstances that could cause a loss of momentum toward student success. While we cannot solve every challenge, the University of Houston strives each and every day to support our students’ success but understands students may experience difficulties that disrupt their academic, professional and personal lives. Not having a place to live, food to eat or money for transportation or childcare can have a serious impact on a student’s ability to attend school or obtain a degree. This site provides connections to Coogs for help in urgent situations as well as offer longer-term solutions. This site may not be fully comprehensive – please visit our survey as we are continually requesting for additional resources!
