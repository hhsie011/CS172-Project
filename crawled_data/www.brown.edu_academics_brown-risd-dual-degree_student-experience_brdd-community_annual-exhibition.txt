Since 2013, the exhibition has been held in the Brown Granoff Center for the Creative Arts and has taken over all floors of the building! Students in the BRDD Program, form an Exhibition Executive Committee and multiple Subcommittees governing all aspects of the show from the theme, to jurying works, curation, branding, installation, multimedia, reception and performance work, and documentation of the exhibition. This annual event brings students across all the cohort years together to view and celebrate their work. In addition, the public reception has always been held the first Thursday of the Brown Spring semester, serving as an opportunity to bring our campus communities together. 6th Annual Brown | RISD Dual Degree Exhibit from A C H on Vimeo.
