The Summer 2022 guest policy is as follows: Barnard residential students with valid BC ID may visit other Barnard residence halls and are required to complete the following steps: Guest of the residence hall must tap their ID at the front desk and complete QR code Guest Form The host must meet visiting student at the front desk of the residence hall Unattended guests will not be permitted to enter the residence halls Barnard commuter Students and CU ID holders: Must complete the QR Guest Form at the front desk of the residence hall they wish to gain access to Must show Access Attendant CoVerify or ReOpenCU 'green screen' The host must meet the guest at the front desk of the residence hall Unattended guests will not be permitted to enter the residence halls Overnight guests are not permitted. Non-BC/CU students are not currently permitted as guests. The College hopes to allow friends & family to be signed in as guests later in the academic year as pandemic conditions allow. A valid Barnard ID is defined as an ID with a current residence hall sticker on it. Current commuter students may obtain a sticker from the CARES Response office (1st Floor of Elliott Hall) in order to access residential facilities. Residents may not accept any payment, service, barter, or other remuneration from a guest in exchange for the guest's ability to stay in a room or suite. Residents may host guests only in the room or suite in which they reside. Guest Limitations Guest limitations are inclusive of other residential students not assigned to your room/suite. Overnight guests are not permitted. Residents may host 1 to 2 guests at a time, and the total number of guests in the room or suite shall not exceed double to assigned occupancy. For example: a single room shall not exceed 2 people at one time (1 resident, 1 guest) a double room shal not exceed 4 people at one time (2 residents, 2 guests) a suite of four (4) residents shall not exceed a total of eight people at one time (4 residents, 4 guests) In some instances, the College will place restrictions on a person’s access to campus or specific buildings on campus. The onus to comply with restrictions is on the individual for whom the restriction is in place. However, residents in Barnard College residence halls are expected to inquire about whether or not a person is restricted from an area before signing them in as a guest. Knowingly assisting someone in an effort to gain entry into a building from which that person is banned is a violation of the Guest Policy.
