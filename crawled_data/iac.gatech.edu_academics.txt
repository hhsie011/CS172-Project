Highly Interdisciplinary Learning and Research Research Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts provides students with knowledge and skills that enable them to work across technological and non-technological realms, to define and solve complex problems, and to develop tech savvy — abilities that, our alumni say, distinguish them among their professional peers. This is a challenging and exciting intellectual environment that helps students define themselves and shape their future. Our students have the opportunity to: Work closely with faculty, all of whom teach, and many of whom engage in ground-breaking, interdisciplinary research Engage locally, nationally, and globally in research, internships, design, and service projects Explore complex problems, define their impact on society, culture, and policy, and innovate solutions to better our world Study immersively in interdisiplinary environs focused on sustainability, international cultures, world-leading research, entrepreneurial innovation, and big data.

In the end, I got something even better: a major that showed me how the creative and technical intersect, intertwine, and interact with each other." Adam Le Doux Program Manager, Microsoft (B.S.
