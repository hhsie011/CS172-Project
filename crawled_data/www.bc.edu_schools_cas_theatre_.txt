We seek to foster creativity, critical thinking, excellence, and professionalism through the integration of courses, productions, workshops, and other activities. We seek to understand theatre not only as a means of artistic expression and a form of entertainment but, as a window onto history, a method of inquiry into all things human, and a vehicle for social change. We invite you to join us in this mission. For more information, contact any Theatre department faculty or staff member, look around this website, or just stop by the Robsham Theater Arts Center today and say hello.
