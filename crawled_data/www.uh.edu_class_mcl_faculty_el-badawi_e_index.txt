El-Badawi also served as founding executive director and treasurer of the International Qur'anic Studies Association, which is the world's first learned society of its kind. Part of IQSA’s goal is to bridge the divide between scholars in the west and those in Muslim majority countries through international conferences.

His research examines Middle Eastern and Islamic civilization broadly, including subjects such as late antique Arabia, Qur'an and Bible, Syriac churches and classical Islam, and interdisciplinary discourse on modernity, gender and sustainability. El-Badawi has a bachelors degree in Computer Science from Rutgers University, and he received his Ph.D. with honors in Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations from the University of Chicago.
