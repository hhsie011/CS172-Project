Research conducted in the absence of diversity and inclusion of all people and their ideas slows the pace of science and our ability to treat diseases and improve lives. In order to pursue the above goals, the institute formed the committee on Diversity, Inclusion, Belonging, Equity and Justice (DIBEJ).
