The Office of the University Registrar creates the final exam schedule to minimize students' exam conflicts and spread students' workloads as evenly as possible over the eight days of exams. Per university faculty policy, the final exam schedule is to be created to minimize the number of students who have more than two exams in one twenty-four hour period. More than two exams in twenty-four hours is defined as one of the following: More than two exams in one day (9:00 AM, 2:00 PM, and 7:00 PM) An evening exam followed by morning and afternoon exams (7:00 PM, 9:00 AM, and 2:00 PM) Afternoon and evening exams followed by a morning exam (2:00 PM, 7:00 PM, and 9:00 AM) In the event that a student has more than two exams in 24 hours, members of the faculty are urged to grant student requests for a make-up examination, particularly if their course is the largest involved. In addition to minimizing the number of students who have more than two exams in one twenty-four hour period, the Office of the University Registrar makes every effort to minimize the number of students who have back-to-back exams. Back to back exams occur when a student has two exams in consecutive exam periods in one day: A 9:00 AM exam followed by a 2:00 PM exam A 2:00 PM exam followed by a 7:00 PM exam Final exams for fall and spring semesters are scheduled based on pre-enrollment data. The schedule will be published a few days prior to the add/drop periods in August and January. Final project and take home exam due dates will be determined by using the tables provided at the start of the semester. If a seven-week 1 class requires a final exam, the exam should be offered on a Tuesday or Thursday night during the approved examination times in the week immediately following the end of the session. The final deliverable should be due by close of business Tuesday or Thursday the week after the session ends. The final exam date, time, and location should be announced to the students after the end of the add period. Final exams for seven-week 2 classes are scheduled with exams for full semester classes. For more information on final exams, refer to the Faculty Handbook. Other Policies Return of Exams, Papers, etc. Although there is no federal or state legislation that pertains to the manner in which graded work is to be returned to students, the returning of such materials should be handled in such a manner as will preserve the student's privacy. Students have a right to examine their corrected exams, papers, and the like, in order to be able to question their grading. They do not, however, have an absolute right to the return thereof. Exams, papers, etc., as well as grading records, should be retained for a reasonable time after the end of the semester, preferably until the end of the following term, to afford students such right of review. Posting of Grades Posting of student grades by name or a personally identifiable number is prohibited under the terms of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA). However, a student waiver authorizing disclosure of educational records by means of a personally identifiable number (e.g. a student ID number) is acceptable provided that such consent is in writing, dated and signed by the student. NOTE: A name or social security number must never be used for this purpose. If instructors use this method, the waiver must be for a specific course; must be for a specified period of time (semester, academic year, etc.); must specify the records to be disclosed; and must be retained by the instructor of the course for a period of one year after its expiration. Students should not be coerced into signing a waiver, as the law requires that it be voluntarily given. Instructors may post grades for students who do not want their student ID number used by establishing a unique identifier known only to that student and the instructor.
