Georgia Tech offers an array of resources, services, and programmatic expertise to collaborate with industry and business — including the Fortune 1000, nonprofit organizations, governments, and other institutions of higher learning worldwide. Home to the Enterprise Innovation Institute (EI2), the nation’s largest and most comprehensive university-based program of business and industry assistance, technology commercialization, and economic development, Georgia Tech’s problem-solving and results-oriented approach focuses on bringing value by convening the talent, research, education, and other resources necessary to support the goals and strategic objectives of clients. Among EI2’s offerings are the Georgia Manufacturing Extension Partnership (GaMEP), which works with manufacturers through training and technical assistance to improve their competitiveness, increase growth, and cut costs. Another program, the Economic Development Lab (EDL), assists governments, communities, foundations, entrepreneurs, and small businesses in fostering value creation by applying innovative ideas, technology, and policy to initiatives focused on economic growth. EI2’s Safety, Health, and Environmental Services (SHES) group provides a broad range of occupational safety and health training, consulting services, and academic education to organizations in Georgia and the Southeast. The application of research and expertise to industry, business, and government is a campus-wide endeavor. In fact, Georgia Tech’s schools, colleges and research centers in various disciplines have external offerings aimed at bringing research solutions to solve challenges. For example, the Institute for People and Technology (IPaT) brings faculty and students from Tech’s varied academic disciplines together to translate their research into applications that have real-world use for industry, government, and non-profit clients. The Agricultural Technology Research Program (ATRP) leverages its research and technical expertise in robotics and automation, sensor and information technology, among other disciplines, to provide strategic advantages to industry and government customers, develop commercial products, build prototypes, and conduct real-time, real-scenario performance testing. An innovation leader in logistics and manufacturing, Tech is home to the Supply Chain and Logistics Institute (SCL), the world’s largest supply chain and logistics leadership center of comprehensive research, education, and outreach. Also a leader in manufacturing research is the Georgia Tech Manufacturing Institute (GTMI) which brings industry, government, and top researchers to collaborate and find solutions for the greatest challenges that American manufacturers face.
