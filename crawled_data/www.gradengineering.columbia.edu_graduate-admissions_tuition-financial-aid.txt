Contact Us To Top Cost of Attendance by Program The cost of attendance, also known as the "budget" or "COA," represents the student's maximum financial aid eligibility. The budget is determined by the school and consists of tuition and fees plus estimated living expenses. In determining the budget, the school applies a conservative estimate of living expenses to all students. We recognize, however, that actual living expenses vary from person to person. If the student faces higher actual costs or has extenuating circumstances that warrant a higher cost of attendance, the student may request a budget increase. 2020-2021 Financial Aid Checklist - Graduate Students (PDF) MS Students (12 Points)* Academic Calendar 2021-2022 Fall 2021 Spring 2022 Tuition ($2,272 per point/12 points per semester) $54,528.00 $27,264.00 $27,264.00 International Student Fee (International Students Only) $240.00 $120.00 $120.00 Health Insurance $3,892.00 $1,483.00 $2,409.00 Health Service Fee $1,246.00 $623.00 $623.00 Document Fee (1st Semester Charge Only) $105.00 $105.00 Facilities Fee $1,002.00 $459.00 $543.00 SEAS Graduate Student Activities Fee $600.00 $300.00 $300.00 Books & Supplies $2,100.00 $1,050.00 $1,050.00 Room & Board $25,245.00 $11,220.00 $14,025.00 Personal Expenses $6,075.00 $2,700.00 $3,375.00 Transportation (monthly MetroCard) $1,143.00 $508.00 $635.00 Loan Origination Fee (Federal Unsubsidized Loans) $216.00 $108.00 $108.00 Total Estimated Expenses $96,392.00 $45,940.00 $50,452.00 Ph.D. & CVN students: please check with your department for Residence Unit and other costs.

To Top Scholarships and Grants Institutional Columbia University offers need-based interschool fellowships for students in any Columbia school or college. More information about these awards can be found on Student Financial Services' website. External Graduate Engineering students may choose to search for external funding opportunities outside of Columbia University to support their education and research costs. Students may visit our Outside Awards page for additional options. Graduate students who obtain any type of external funding should report this amount to our office as it may impact loan eligibility. Departmental Institutional aid is administered by academic departments and includes funding from institutional grants, fellowships, teaching and research assistantships, readerships, and preceptorships. All of these types of aid are considered institutional aid and can be awarded individually or in some combination, upon admission or to continuing students, by the academic department. All prospective students may apply for admission to graduate programs in engineering with institutional aid consideration. There is no separate application for institutional aid. Yellow Ribbon Program The Yellow Ribbon Program supplements the base benefits of The Post-9/11 GI BillÂ® by allowing educational institutions to enter into dollar-for-dollar matching agreements with the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs. Participation in this supplementary program is determined by Columbiaâ€™s participating schools on a first-come, first-serve basis and is available only to students who meet the 100% eligibility level for the Post-9/11 GI BillÂ®. For more information, please visit the Columbia University Veteran Affairs website. CVN - Columbia Video Network CVN students are eligible for both federal and private student loans, depending on the student's citizenship status, number of credits taken, and degree status. If you are unsure if your program is a degree program or a certificate program, please reference the CVN website. If you have questions about your loan eligibility, please contact the Office of Student Financial Planning to discuss your options. Masters/Ph.D. Degree-Seeking Students US Citizens and eligible noncitizens who are enrolled in at least 6 credits may apply for Federal Student Loans (Federal Direct Stafford Loan or Federal Graduate PLUS Loan). More information on these loans can be found here and here. Non-US Citizens or students enrolled in less than 6 credits may secure private educational loans from an outside lender. Columbia University offers a suggested lender list for students to reference during their search. Students do not have to borrow from a lender on this list. Non-Degree/Certificate Students CVN students enrolled in a certificate program are not eligible for federal student aid. Students may borrow private educational loans from an outside lender. Columbia University offers a suggested lender list for students to reference during their search. Students do not have to borrow from a lender on this list. If at any point a student changes their enrollment (either by dropping a class or changing to auditing a class mid-semester), they should notify our office immediately as we may have to adjust loan amounts accordingly. FAQ: Graduate Students What if I change the number of credits I am taking? Loan eligibility is directly tied to the number of credits you are enrolled in each semester. If you add or drop a class after your loans have been processed, our office will make adjustments as appropriate based on your new loan eligibility. Students who drop below half-time will no longer be eligible for federal student loans. Should I borrow Federal Loans or Private Loans? Federal loans have a variety of repayment options, low fees and fixed interest rates for the life of the loan. Private loans may have lower interest rates, but these rates are often not fixed, and fees can vary. It is up to each borrower to choose the loan that makes the most sense for their individual needs. We recommend speaking with a Financial Aid Officer if you have questions prior to borrowing. How much should I borrow? Students may borrow up to the full cost of attendance in student loans. However, we recommend only borrowing what you need: this may be only to cover billed expenses or it may be to cover both billed and non-billed expenses. If you have questions about your borrowing need, please contact our office to speak with a Financial Aid Officer. Additionally if students receive any type of other funding, please note your loan eligibility will change. Are there loans for international students? International students may seek private lenders for available education loans. Some lenders may require a U.S. co-signer. Columbia offers a suggested lender list online, but students may choose a lender not on that list as well. Where can I see my bill? Students may view their bill online through their SSOL account. Can I borrow loans to cover non-billed items like rent, books and personal expenses? Yes, students may borrow up to the full cost of attendance if you are enrolled at least hafl time (6 credits). This includes both billed and non-billed expenses. All loans will first disburse to the student account. Once all charges are paid, any excess loan funds will be refunded to the student via direct deposit or paper check. How do I meet with a Financial Aid Officer? You can contact our office by phone at 212-854-7040, by email at [email protected], or in person at 202 Kent Hall. How do I defer my undergraduate loan repayment? Columbia University will send your enrollment status to the National Student Loan Clearinghouse after the add/drop period each semester. If you have loans from lenders who do not work with this clearinghouse, you may request a certificate of enrollment online through SSOL to submit to your lender. Are there any other funding opportunities? Students may be funded by their academic department. Any students who receive these funds are notified at the time of admission. There is no separate application process. Students may also search for available scholarships and fellowships online by using the Global Programs & Fellowship database or by visiting our Outside Awards page for additional options.
