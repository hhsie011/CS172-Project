Gain Independence. “ “I knew I wanted to get out of New England and experience something new. I always have viewed college as a way to experience a different way of life. I usually don’t like to push out of my comfort zone, so I saw it as an opportunity to go somewhere far away from home and experience a different culture.” Paige Holman Parks, Recreation and Tourism Management ’21 Clemson University Facebook Instagram Twitter Linkedin Youtube Tiktok Policy/Terms of Use Web Accessibility Ethics/Safety Hotline Privacy Policy Copyright © 2022 Clemson University • Clemson, South Carolina 29634 Clemson University Facebook Instagram Twitter Linkedin Youtube Tiktok Resources A-Z Index Campus Map CU Safety Directory Webcams Apply to Clemson
