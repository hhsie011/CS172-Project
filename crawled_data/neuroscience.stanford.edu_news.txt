Q&A: How the aging immune system impacts brain health May 25 2022 Katrin Andreasson discusses how immune cells can cause harmful brain inflammation and contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s disease. Young cerebrospinal fluid may hold keys to healthy brain aging May 25 2022 With a new study published in Nature, Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute researchers are helping to show that the cerebrospinal fluid that bathes our brains holds clues to healthy brain aging. Neuro-omics initiative sheds light on how neuronal connections are formed May 24 2022 By Medeea Popescu Ambitious brain recordings create unprecedented portrait of vision in action May 18 2022 Single-cell imaging across the brain’s visual cortex lets researchers track sensory processing from perception to action, resulting in new insights about the structure of neuronal signaling and new inspiration for computer vision. Q&A: GVVC director Nicholas Wall has a passion for nature's genetics toolkit May 17 2022 The Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute is pleased to welcome Nicholas Wall, PhD, as the new director of the Gene Vector and Virus Core (GVVC), which supports the Stanford neuroscience community through production of powerful viral genetic engineering tools. Q&A: Secrets of brain health may be hidden in nerve cells’ insulation May 13 2022 Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute interdisciplinary postdoctoral scholars Tal Iram and Miguel Garcia have been working to fill in gaps in neuroscience’s understanding of the development, function, and disease-impact of the brain's long-overlooked oligodendrocytes, which produce nerve-wrapping myelin. The teen brain tunes in less to Mom’s voice, more to unfamiliar voices, study finds May 6 2022 | Stanford Medicine Around age 13, kids’ brains shift from focusing on their mothers’ voices to favor new voices, part of the biological signal driving teens to separate from their parents, a Stanford Medicine study has found. The many ways Stanford Medicine is responding to the opioid crisis May 6 2022 | Stanford Medicine Researchers at the Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute’s NeuroChoice Initiative examine fundamental questions underlying addiction from numerous points of view, bridging molecules and neural circuits with individuals and even policy. Johannes Eichstaedt: Exploring the intersection of Psychology and AI May 3 2022 | HAI “The beauty of what we’re doing at these interdisciplinary AI intersections is that we’re really building things that haven’t existed before,” says the Shriram Faculty Fellow. Symposium highlights new imaging facility technology and services May 3 2022 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a central role in the quest to understand the brain, but researchers not experienced with the technique may find the technology and its physics intimidating. The Neuroscience Preclinical Imaging Laboratory (NPIL) at the Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute aims to...
