The boxes have the capability for two-way communication with the dispatcher, but communication is not essential. The instant the student presses the button, the department will automatically dispatch an officer to the location of the emergency call box, a warning will sound and the blue siren on the top of the pole will activate. In addition to the call boxes, the WSU Police Department dispatcher can be reached from any campus phone by dialing 911. Public campus phones are located in each building on campus.
