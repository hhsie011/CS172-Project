Persons of all sizes should be treated professionally and compassionately. We know that not all people are the same. Weight and eating problems may result from a variety of factors, including genetics, a slow metabolism, illness, eating or exercise habits, and emotional distress. Disordered eating also comes in many forms, including binge eating disorder, night eating syndrome, bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa. We recognize that many persons with higher weight have serious, related medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, sleep apnea and joint problems that lifestyle interventions can help. Additionally, people with or without a specific eating disorder or health diagnosis often find it challenging to make desired changes to their eating and physical activity habits or seek to improve their body image. Thus, we make special efforts to customize our programs to meet an individual's specific needs. We assess the causes of the eating or weight problem, determine its medical and psychological consequences, and then make a treatment plan, accordingly.
