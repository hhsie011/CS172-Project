You can learn German in class, of course, but you can also share an apartment in our German Living/Learning Community; join our German Club; or come to our co-curricular activities, social events, etc. The Max Kade German Center Twenty students live in our affinity house, the Max Kade German Center, the social and cultural hub for German-related lectures, films, conferences and other events. Activities If you're interested in all things German, we have plenty of activities on and off campus, many involving Germania, our German club. Events Don't forget to check our calendar and the German Club's Facebook page for the latest happenings in the department and with your fellow students!

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of German Studies Undergraduate Overview Why Study German?
