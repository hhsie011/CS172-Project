Be aware of your surroundings. Being aware of where you are and what is happening around you can help you to understand how information, events, and your own actions will impact your safety and your ability to protect yourself, both now and in the near future. Protect yourself. Based upon your assessment of the situation, use your best judgment to protect yourself and, if possible, others. Call for help. Any emergency service can be summoned by calling 911. Help others. Once you are safely away from the danger, warn others of the hazard and help if you can without putting yourself in danger.
