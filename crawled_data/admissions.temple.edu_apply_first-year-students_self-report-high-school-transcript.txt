This tool allows you to submit your high school courses and grade information prior to submitting your final official high school transcript, and it is a required step in the admissions process. Once you have submitted your Common Application and activated your TUportal account, you will be notified to self-report your high school courses and grades. This step is completed in TUportal. When entering your high school courses and grade information, you must use your own transcript, provided by your high school, to enter courses and grades exactly as they appear on your transcript. Inaccurate or false information could result in a review by our admissions committee and revocation of admission. Entering Courses Enter all attempted courses for grades nine through 12, including pass/fail courses. If you have repeated a course, you will enter it twice. You must also choose the correct level for the course (e.g., college preparatory, advanced placement or international baccalaureate courses). You will be able to indicate the academic level of all courses attempted. If you are enrolled or were previously enrolled in dual enrollment or college level courses, list them as “Dual Enrollment.” College prep courses includes pre-AP, gifted and talented and accelerated. Entering Grades Enter only final grades for courses in grades nine through 11, including semester, trimester or yearlong courses. If graduating in three years, you would enter courses for grades nine through 10, then see below on grade 12 courses. You must also add your grade 12 courses. You can select “in-progress” if you are currently completing grade 12 coursework and do not have grades or you can enter a current grade, even if it is not a final grade. If you earned grades outside the traditional A-F scale, enter "I Don't Know/Scale Not Listed." Do not add weight to your grades. Enter your grades exactly as they appear on your transcript. If you receive a final grade each semester for a course, please list the course twice indicating "half year” and then you will report a first and second semester grade. Block scheduled courses are considered full-year. A half block scheduled course is considered half-year. If you took a summer course, please include that course in the academic year prior to taking the course and list it as a full-year course. Temple realizes some high school level courses may be completed in middle school, however, please only include the courses taken during high school. Requests for Additional Grades If we request additional grade information, either your first-quarter or mid-year grades, please have your high school counselor submit your updated transcript. This step is not completed through the self-report tool. Submitting Your Official Transcript You must submit your official final high school transcript prior to enrollment. If you are offered admission to Temple, one of your next steps as an admitted student will be to submit your final high school transcript. Your final transcript will be reviewed against your self-reported transcript. Inaccurate or false information could result in a review by our admissions committee and revocation of admission. Students are required to provide a copy of their high school diploma, high school equivalency certificate (GED), or proof that the student has completed secondary school through homeschooling as defined by state law. Also acceptable as equivalent to a high school diploma; an associate degree, successful completion of at least 60 semester or trimester credit hours or 72 quarter credit hours that does not result in the awarding of an associate degree, but that is acceptable for full credit toward a bachelor’s degree at any institution.
