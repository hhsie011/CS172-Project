Your name * Your email * Your class year * Please indicate your graduation year. Your story As I am sure you know, one of the great things college offers is the chance to take classes in areas typically not covered, or covered in any depth, in most high schools, and one such area, we have found, is the academic and comparative study of religion. Yet because religion is such a ubiquitous aspect of world culture today, and has been throughout human history, its study is surely of critical importance for any well-educated and well-rounded person. In fact, we would argue that the study of religion is a key part of any liberal arts education. It seems that today, more than ever, students need to be reminded of the value of a liberal arts education. It is our hope to compile testimonials from our alumni that illuminate these values. Please take a few minutes to reflect on your time at Dartmouth, and your experiences as a Religion major.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Religion Undergraduate Overview Major and Minor Curriculum Course Schedule Dickinson Seminar Focus on Race Non-Western Courses Honors Program Sperry Fellows Program Past Honors Theses Career Information Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Awards and Prizes The Charles Howard Dudley Prize The Dickinson Senior Writing Prize in Religion The Hans Penner Prize The Religion Department Faculty Award The Sperry Writing Prize in Religion Foreign Study Program News & Events Overview Dickinson Distinguished Lecture Forum on Race & Religion Hardigg Family Fund Lecture Past Fellows Orr Lecture on Culture & Religion Past Lectures People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
