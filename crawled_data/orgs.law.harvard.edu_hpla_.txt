HPLA exists to support law students looking to become plaintiff-side attorneys who will represent the interests of victims, advocate for consumers’ rights and equal access to justice, and ensure that any person who is injured by the misconduct or negligence of others can obtain justice in America’s courtrooms, even when taking on the most powerful interests. We host and organize events centered around plaintiff-side law, coordinate with like-minded firms, as well as gather informational resources for interested students. To stay in the loop, join our mailing list. Upcoming Events Nothing found. See All Events Coffee Chats Are you an HLS student hoping to learn more about plaintiffs’ law?
