Moving forward with boldness More than 225 years ago, a radical idea took root in North Carolina: higher education, funded by the people, for the people. As we enter the third decade of this millennium, the challenges we face today are great, but, as we have demonstrated for more than two centuries, we are built to face great challenges. Timeless traditions Take a sip from the Old Well on your first day of classes to get good grades. Sign your name on the bricks inside the Bell Tower as a senior. Relax in the sun on Polk Place. Carolina is filled with traditions - some that date back for decades and others that are new - that students cherish today. Always a great day to be a Tar Heel “It’s a great day to be a Tar Heel” is a phrase you’ll often hear around Carolina, and for a good reason. Every day, Tar Heels create a positive impact on the world by improving their communities and inspiring change through their talents. They’re artists, scientists, humanitarians, researchers and innovators doing extraordinary things. Campus Events See all Events May 06 – Sep 12 Health Insurance is Mandatory!
