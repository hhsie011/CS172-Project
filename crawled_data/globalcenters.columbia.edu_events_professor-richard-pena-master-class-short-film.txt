Professor Richard Peña, Professor of Professional Practice at the School of the Arts at Columbia University, is invited to talk about a stepping stone on the way to full-length production, the "reduced" version of the 90-minute feature film. Throughout the world, those entering film production almost always begin their careers with a series of short films. During the master class, Professor Peña will introduce a brief history of short filmmaking, as well as how and why the short film form often offers even more possibilities for creative expression than the full-length feature. A number of examples of successful short films made by Columbia University graduate film students will be screened. Speaker Professor Richard Peña Richard Peña has been at Columbia since 1989, becoming full time in 1996 and being named Professor of Professional Practice in 2003; from 2006 to 2009 was a Visiting Professor in Spanish at Princeton University; from 2015 to 2016 was a Visiting Professor at Harvard University. Professor Peña has also served as the Program Director of the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the Director of the New York Film Festival from 1988 to 2012. At the Film Society, he has organized major film series devoted to African, Chinese, Cuban, Polish, Hungarian, Arab, Korean, Japanese Soviet and Argentine cinema.
