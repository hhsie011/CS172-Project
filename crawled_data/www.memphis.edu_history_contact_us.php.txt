Mitchell Hall, home of the Department of History If you are not familiar with the campus, a Google Earth image will show the location of Mitchell Hall at the tip of the green arrow, with enough of the surrounding area to place it in a recognizable context. To get a closer and more helpful view you should adjust the zoom control one step at a time to give whatever degree of detail you desire. As with all Google Earth images, you may change the view to hide or show labels such as street or building names, change to a map instead of an aerial photograph, print the image, or e-mail a link to the map to yourself or others. As an alternative, you may get an aerial photograph from Google Earth that shows Mitchell Hall and its surrounding area already at a fairly detailed zoom level. Mitchell Hall will be shown at the tip of the green arrow, as before. You may change this view in the same ways as described above. If you are using GPS to locate Mitchell Hall, the coordinates are 35.117848, -89.938654 (35° 7' 4.2528" N, 89° 56' 19.1544" W) The closest visitor parking is in the parking garage and metered spaces at 505 Zach Curlin, grid H/I/J-11 on the online campus map.
