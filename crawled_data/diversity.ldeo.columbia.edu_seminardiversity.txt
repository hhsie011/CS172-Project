It includes the organizers of various scientific seminars at Lamont, both divisional and Lamont-wide. This initiative complements our Diversity Seminar Initiative, which brings diverse speakers to Lamont to talk about diversity, equity, and inclusion. Kailani Acosta, PhD Student Spearheaded by graduate student Kailani Acosta, the goals of the Seminar Diversity Initiative are: 1. To support at least 3 underrepresented minority (URM) speakers per year in each of our five research divisions 2. To increase the number of women, other genders, and non-binary speakers 3. To increase visibility and representation of URM speakers Speaker Demographics: Gender: For the 2019-2020 year, around 45% of speakers identified as women. Race & Ethnicity: For the 2019-2020 year, around 39% of speakers were from underrepresented groups, with 17% identifying as Hispanic/Latinx, 14% identifying as Asian, and 8% identifying as Black. For gender composition of invited speakers in previous years (data on race/ethnicity were not formally requested) check out our LDEO Demographics page For Seminar Speakers Our seminar presentations typically run about 45 minutes followed by 10 minutes of questions. The audience is comprised mostly of students, postdocs, and faculty, usually from the Research Division in which you are presenting, but these presentations are open to the entire Lamont community. If you are available all day, we usually schedule additional meetings with graduate students, post docs, and faculty before and/or after your talk. ***Due to the pandemic, seminars for the 2020-21 year are expected to be virtual*** Notes for Speakers: We would welcome hearing about any broader impacts/outreach and DEI work that you and/or your groups have done, even if it is not directly related to the scientific research presented in your talk Please include your email, website, twitter, and any other platform that you would like others to see Before your visit, let us know if you would like the seminar recorded Contact This initiative is spearheaded by Kailani Acosta: [email protected] The full list of divisional seminar organizers are: Biology & Paleo Environment Seminar: Kailani Acosta: [email protected] Rachel Lupien: [email protected] Rose Oelkers: [email protected] Jonathan Lambert: [email protected] Ocean & Climate Physics Seminar: Carson Witte: [email protected] Kai Kornhuber: [email protected] Marine Geology & Geophysics/ Seismology, Geology, and Tectonophysics (MGG-SGT) Joint Seminar: Renata Constantino: [email protected] Andrew Lloyd: [email protected] Guy Paxman: [email protected] Seth Saltiel: [email protected] Geochemistry Seminar: Alexandra Balter: [email protected] Celeste Pallone: [email protected] Craig Connolly: [email protected] Matthew Jerram: [email protected] Geodynamics Seminar: Jacky Austermann: [email protected] Terry Plank: [email protected] Christine McCarthy: [email protected] Lamont-Doherty Earth Science Colloquium: (Coordinator) Kevin Uno: [email protected] Tanner Acquisto, MGG: [email protected] Shanice Bailey, OCP: [email protected] Alexandra Balter, Geochemistry: [email protected] Clara Chang, BPE: [email protected] Sarah Giles, SGT: [email protected] Joohee Kim, Geochemistry: [email protected] Office of Academic Affairs & Diversity61 Route 9W, 218 Monell Bldg. · Palisades, NY 10964 Contact Us [email protected] Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
