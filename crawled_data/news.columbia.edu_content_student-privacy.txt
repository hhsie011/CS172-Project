Advance written permission from each student is required. In general, if a student has agreed to be interviewed or if a student group has approached a media outlet to cover a student event, permission will be granted as long as the media agrees to comply with these policies. Media who seek interviews before or after an event must do so in approved outdoor spaces, so as not to impede attendees entering or exiting the event. Media and film crews are not allowed to enter classrooms without the advance permission of the instructor. Classes in progress must not be interrupted. 212-854-5573 [email protected] Contact Us [email protected] Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University Â©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
