Ensure continuously satisfactory service through good management practices and responsible stewardship and utilization of resources. Establish daily business practices which reflect the most advanced technological methods available to improve customer service. Make student data available in easily accessible formats to departments for administrative purposes and research. Interpret Institute, Board of Regents, and governmental policies to faculty, staff, students, parents and the general public. Assess the effectiveness of services provided to ensure equitable and ethical treatment of all customers. Audience: General Audience Our Vision The Registrar's Office at Georgia Tech will be a technologically advanced, highly efficient, customer-oriented, flexible organization adaptable to the changing needs of the Institute. It will deploy cutting-edge technologies and effective management practices to ensure that its resources are used wisely and to their full potential in the delivery of world-class customer service. It will create a work environment for its staff that fosters learning, creative thinking, effective problem-solving, and on-going commitment to excellence. Accountability at all levels will be a hallmark of its character. Audience: General Audience Computer and Network Acceptable Use Policy Policy Library: Acceptable Use Policy No scripts, robot programs, or abusive registration attempts. Students are required to abide by the Institute's Acceptable Use Policy when using Georgia Tech's computer resources, including the registration system. As such, no student may use any unauthorized computer program or script to register for classes or attempt to circumvent the registration system in any way. No student should repeatedly attempt to register for a closed section of a course by hand in an attempt to "brute force" into the next available seat. To do so is a violation, as "faculty, staff, and students are expected to behave in an ethical and professional manner when using IT resources." This also violates the section "Protection of IT Resources" by "knowingly installing or running...disruptive software" which results in depriving other students an opportunity to register. Information regarding any student who violates this policy will be forwarded to the Dean of Students for disciplinary action.
