I want to practice health law in Texas, so I moved down to Waco to learn all about Texas law in an environment that produces competent practicing attorneys straight out of 3L! What is your favorite thing about Baylor Law? It's so easy to connect to professors and staff at Baylor Law! I have been encouraged and welcomed to knock on professors' office doors, talk to them after class, chat in the halls, and set up regular meetings to talk about any topic under the sun. Even during COVID law school, our professors made themselves accessible to us, and I really appreciated that. What do you do to relax/for fun and/or what all are you involved with at Baylor Law? Whenever I'm feeling like I need to walk around in the sunshine, I jump over to main campus and hang out with Lady and Joy, our resident Texas bears! I love watching them lie in the sun, play, and eat, and the walk over feels so good. What advice would you give to someone thinking about law school? As the first person in my family to go to law school, I really didn't know what I was getting into! My best advice would be to plan ahead before each quarter: get a schedule ready based on your assignments, get a lot more school supplies than you anticipate, and make sure you have a flexible meal/workout/laundry plan to fall back on! Being a human comes before being a student, and I always get better grades when I have consistently taken snippets of time for myself throughout the quarter.
