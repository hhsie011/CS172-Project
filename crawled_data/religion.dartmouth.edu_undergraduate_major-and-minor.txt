The Department of Religion offers a rich list of courses on a subject that you will encounter in many other departments. This is because religion is at the core of all cultures and societies. Because religion is such a ubiquitous aspect of world culture today, and has been throughout human history, the academic and comparative study of religion study is surely of critical importance for any liberal arts education. Many students find that either a major, modified major, or minor in religion is an excellent choice for a concentration in the liberal arts. Religion Major/Minor/Modified Major Requirements How to Declare your Religion Major, Minor, or Modified Major: Request a meeting with Religion Department Chair, Professor Reiko Ohnuma. Be prepared to discuss your academic interests, specific courses that you would like to take, and any questions you may have regarding the major. Exemptions, special permissions, and proposals need to be addressed by Professor Ohnuma as well. Review the requirements of the major, minor, or modified major and fill in your worksheet (see links below) and DartWorks major planner with your proposed course of study. Bring the completed worksheet to your meeting with Professor Ohnuma. Confirm your proposed course of study for approval in DartWorks. Watch for occasional email announcements (events of interest, Major degree requirements, Commencement, etc) from the Religion Department. Religion Major and Minor Planner Worksheets The Dartmouth Organization, Regulations and Courses (ORC) contains online information about Religion course requirements. Please refer to the ORC of your matriculation year for the appropriate major requirements, and/or see the worksheet for your class year, here: Religion Major Worksheet for Classes 2020 and later Religion Modified Major Worksheet for Classes 2020 and later Religion Minor Worksheet for Classes 2020 and later See also the online Religion Course Schedule to find the correct course numbers (include decimals when provided) for the terms being offered.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Religion Undergraduate Overview Major and Minor Curriculum Course Schedule Dickinson Seminar Focus on Race Non-Western Courses Honors Program Sperry Fellows Program Past Honors Theses Career Information Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Awards and Prizes The Charles Howard Dudley Prize The Dickinson Senior Writing Prize in Religion The Hans Penner Prize The Religion Department Faculty Award The Sperry Writing Prize in Religion Foreign Study Program News & Events Overview Dickinson Distinguished Lecture Forum on Race & Religion Hardigg Family Fund Lecture Past Fellows Orr Lecture on Culture & Religion Past Lectures People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
