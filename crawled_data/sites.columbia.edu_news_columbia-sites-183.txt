Bug Zapper We fixed a bug where image carousels cut off images on mobile. Instead of displaying previous, current, and next semesters, courses imported from Vergil will now display only the available semesters as term and year value, i.e., Fall 2019. Search is better. Refined the wording used to describe PhD candidates and Phd students. In the research model, content managers were unable to edit the Affiliations content block. Remedied.
