The FSU College of Music's Music Theatre Program is designed to create music theatre performers who are truly "triple threats" and who are prepared to work professionally when they have completed the program. Although students study in each area separately, the strength of the program is in its joint nature, allowing students and faculty to explore the connections that unite singing, acting, and dancing. In addition to performing in the regular music theatre productions, music theatre students are encouraged to perform in as many venues as possible. The College of Music offers a wide range of performance opportunities, including FSU Opera and numerous choral and instrumental ensembles. In addition, music theatre students have danced in FSU Dance productions and performed in plays by such authors as Shakespeare and Chekhov on The Mainstage. Each year, graduating students present a Senior Showcase in New York City, performing for an audience of invited agents and casting directors, master teachers, producers, alumni, and friends. The FSU College of Music offers a Bachelor of Music in Performance (Music Theatre). Separately, the College of Fine Arts offers a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Music Theatre.
