Stanford University: VMware Women’s Leadership Innovation Lab See Bias | Block Bias Tools The VMware Women’s Leadership Innovation Lab at Stanford University generates foundational research to advance women’s leadership by diagnosing barriers and developing and evaluating interventions to get beyond barriers, and disseminates research-based solutions by bridging the gap between research and practice.

Hollaback! Eight Tools to Mitigate Implicit Bias Workshop Everyone holds implicit biases. That doesn’t make us “bad people,” it just means that we have work to do. This one-hour, interactive training offered by Hollaback! will teach you how to understand and begin to undo your own implicit biases. We’ll start by learning the brain science behind implicit bias and how the part of the brain that used to protect us now holds us back. Through polls, brief thought experiments, and journaling, we’ll reflect on how implicit bias can show up in our actions and the impacts those biases can have on ourselves and our teams. Then we’ll roll our sleeves up and get to work, practicing eight concrete ways that you can begin to mitigate bias in your own life. You’ll leave more confident in your ability to see and mitigate bias. RESOURCES: How to Outsmart Your Own Unconscious Bias, Valerie Alexander at TEDxPasadena We all have implicit biases. So what can we do about it?, Dushaw Hockett at TEDxMidAtlanticSalon Government of Canada and the Canada Research Chairs Program – Unconscious Bias Training There is overwhelming scientific evidence that unconscious bias may influence peer review and the evaluation and selection of candidates from graduate admissions through faculty hiring. This online unconscious bias training module, provided by the Government of Canada, explains what unconscious bias is, outlines how it can affect the peer review process, and suggests ways to mitigate the influence of unconscious bias. Though focused on peer review, this online module includes content that is transferable to other areas of academia including graduate admissions, postdoc selection, and faculty hiring. UCLA Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion: Implicit Bias Video Series This publicly accessible video series begins with an introductory video that describes how biases and heuristics can influence our decision-making and behavior without us even knowing it. It is then followed by six short video lessons on the following topics: Lesson 1: Schemas (mental short-cuts that help us navigate the world around us) Lesson 2: Attitudes and Stereotypes Lesson 3: Real World Consequences Lesson 4: Explicit vs. Implicit Bias Lesson 5: The IAT (Implicit Association Test – learn more about the IAT at Project Implicit) Lesson 6: Countermeasures Land Acknowledgement Cornell University is located on the traditional homelands of the Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' (the Cayuga Nation). The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
