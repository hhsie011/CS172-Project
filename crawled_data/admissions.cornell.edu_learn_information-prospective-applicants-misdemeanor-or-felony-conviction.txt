Cornell has committed to eliminating unnecessary barriers in the admissions process for applicants who provide information about a misdemeanor or felony conviction. In collaboration with the Cornell Prison Reform and Education Project (PREP), this information is intended to assist prospective students with information about Cornell’s commitment to eliminating unnecessary barriers in the admissions process. Among the elements of the pledge, Cornell has committed to: Following a protocol for reviewing applications involving students who have provided information about a misdemeanor or felony conviction. Considering information about a misdemeanor or felony conviction only after conducting an individualized and holistic review of the admissions application and determining sufficient potential for admission. Providing applicants the opportunity to explain a misdemeanor or felony conviction and to submit supporting information from officials at an educational institution (e.g. secondary school or institution of higher education).
