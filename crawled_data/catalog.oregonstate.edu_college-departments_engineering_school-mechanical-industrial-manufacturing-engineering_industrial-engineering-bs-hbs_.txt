At Oregon State University, the industrial engineering focal areas include work design, production planning and control, statistical quality control, facilities design and operations management, simulation, and information systems, and materials and manufacturing processes. Program Educational Objectives—Industrial Engineering Note: The Bachelor of Science and Honors Bachelor of Science degrees in Industrial Engineering are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.ABET.org, which requires stated program educational objectives and student outcomes to support these. OSU Industrial Engineering graduates receive an innovative education, and within 3 to 5 years of graduation will have: Created value to organizations through the analysis, evaluation, and improvement of engineered systems and processes using appropriate industrial engineering methods and tools. Communicated effectively across disciplines and cultures to manage and/or lead activities in support of organizational goals and objectives. Innovated systems and processes, in response to organizational challenges, though the application of structured and unstructured industrial engineering methodologies, including engineering design and problem solving. Major Code: 323 Identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics. Apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors. Communicate effectively with a range of audiences. Recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts. Function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives. Develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions. Acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies. Design, develop, implement, and improve integrated systems that include people, materials, information, equipment and energy. Accomplish the integration of systems using appropriate analytical, computational, and experimental practices.
