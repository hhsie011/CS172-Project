However, being a college student can be a challenge and especially so if you are the first in your family to earn a college degree. Some of the issues specific to first-generation students include the following: Pressure to be academically successful not only for you, but for your family. Feeling like everyone understands how college life works except you Self-doubt about your abilities Not being able to ask your parents what to do Feeling afraid to lose your identity within your family or community – you develop and change as you grow, but your family and community do not Feeling confused about social rules Worrying about finances Clinicians at BUCC can offer individual, couples, and group counseling to help decrease distress related to the challenges of university life. Additionally, clinicians can help you navigate the pressures of being a first-generation student and balancing academic, social, emotional, and family responsibilities. Beyond counseling, Baylor University offers several services that may be useful for first-generation students: For support in dealing with pressures of college life, visit “First in Line” https://www.baylor.edu/firstinline. “First in Line” is a network of staff and faculty who either were first-gen students themselves, or have expressed interest in directly working with first-gen students.

International Students Beginning college can be a time for transitions for any student, but especially for international students. Adjusting to a new country, culture, and academic system can be both exiting and demanding. Living in a new culture can present multiple challenges. Often the differences are interesting and even fun at first; but over time, it can become exhausting to have to adjust to so many new things at once. Some of the common issues that arise for international students include the following: Adjusting to a new culture and academic system Missing home but not being able to go home often, or not wanting to go home Difficulty completing academic work in a foreign language Concerns about how your family may react to the choices you are making Roommate conflicts Immigration and visa concerns Not being understood when you express yourself in your usual manner Finding out that some people are prejudiced against others from different cultures Relationship concerns (dating, friendships, social isolation) We recognize that while counseling is a common practice in the U.S. for people with emotional difficulties, individuals in your home country may not have the same views toward counseling. At Baylor University Counseling Center (BUCC), we are respectful of those differences and want to collaborate with you on how to meet your needs and goals best. Our staff are trained in working with students from different cultural backgrounds and work to provide a safe, welcoming, and culturally sensitive environment. Beyond counseling, BUCC encourages you to seek out other services offered by Baylor University that can be helpful to international students. To find support while adjusting to a new culture, visit the Center for Global Engagement as well as the Global Friendship Programs . Support in adjusting to a new educational system can be found through Academic Coaching https://www.baylor.edu/support_programs/index.php?id=22923. Support for relationship navigation can be addressed with a counselor or through Let's Talk.

To seek support if you or someone you know has experienced an incident(s) of sexual and gender-based harassment and/or interpersonal violence you can contact the TIX Office https://www.baylor.edu/titleix/ . Sexual and Gender Minority Students Students who identify as sexual minorities may experience additional struggles on top of those already experienced by most college students. Research shows that compared to the general population, sexual minorities are more likely to: Experience mental health issues Die by suicide Have a higher prevalence of abusing substances Engage in unhealthy relationships that include physical and verbal abuse Be bullied and harassed Be cyberbullied Struggling with issues around your identity in isolation often intensifies psychological distress. On the other hand, being cared for, connected and supported by others is the top protective factor for sexual minority students’ mental health. To this end, BUCC offers a group program for students navigating issues around sexual identities. It seeks to provide a caring and supportive community where students can journey together as they explore their sexual identities as it relates to their mental wellbeing. Discrimination in any form has no place in Baylor’s caring community. If you are faced with issues of prejudice, we recommend that you seek support through counseling or you can report your concern anonymously on “EthicsPoint” at https://www.baylor.edu/gr/index.php?id=871540.

We recognize the complexity of current issues around sexual and gender identity and desire to engage these conversations with courage, humility, convicted civility, and compassion. Students of Color Students of color may experience the same difficulties that white students on a college campus might face. Some of these issues include depression, anxiety, academic concerns, relational difficulties, trauma, grief, and career decision making.

Our clinicians offer a safe and welcoming environment for students with disabilities to share their experiences, or talk about concerns including emotions, relationships, and academics.
