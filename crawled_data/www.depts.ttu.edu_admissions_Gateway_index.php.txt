If you are unsure about course selection, please contact our office at 806.742.1480. The Office of Undergraduate Admissions must receive grades on your coursework before an admission decision can be made. We recommend that you make an early request to have your transcript sent to Texas Tech as soon as you complete your college coursework. If your community college is not able to send an official transcript as soon as your coursework is complete, contact our office at 806-742-1480, admissions@ttu.edu, or through chat on our website for details. It is your responsibility to ensure that the transcript is sent to Texas Tech ASAP.
