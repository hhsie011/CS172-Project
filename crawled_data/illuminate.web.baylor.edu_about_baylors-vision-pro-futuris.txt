Pro Futuris serves as a compass for the University’s future and provides principal direction defined by five aspirational statements. The aspirations illuminate a future filled with promise for promoting human flourishing and offering hope to the world. “Pro Futuris portends a growing academic enterprise dedicated to the search for new knowledge, not simply for the sake of knowledge, but for the love of all truth illuminated by our Christian faith.” The University’s Academic Strategic Plan, Illuminate, represents the second phase of Pro Futuris. It carries forward the vision’s spirit while providing emphasis to several of its key components, establishing detailed goals with outcomes that will enable us to realize our full potential as a preeminent Christian research university. As Baylor strives to prepare students to make a difference in our world as citizens and leaders who have the faith and integrity to do what is right in the face of competing pressures and to have a passion to apply their knowledge to ends that transcend mere self-interest, Pro Futuris calls Baylor to be a place where academic excellence and life-changing experiences ignite leadership potential that increases our students’ desire for wisdom, understanding of calling, and preparation for service in a diverse and interconnected global society. Pro Futuris calls Baylor to be a place “where research discoveries illuminate solutions to significant challenges confronting our world and where creative endeavors reflect the breadth of God’s creation.” Pro Futuris calls Baylor to be a place where our Christian faith, in conjunction with our expertise and resources, inspires a desire to address systemic problems facing our community, both local and global, and renews our dedication to improvement of self and service to others. Pro Futuris calls Baylor to be a place where the dedication of alumni and friends advances Baylor through sustained involvement in philanthropy. Pro Futuris calls Baylor to be a place where the value generated by and derived from a Baylor experience is supported through a diversity of revenues, prudent management of our resources and risks and the pursuit of outstanding quality and character in every area of university life.
