Gifts to the Social Alternative Fund will be invested in an external mutual fund that gives special consideration to social responsibility issues when making investments. The fund is an additional opportunity available for donors who want to support both Harvard and broader social interests. There is no minimum gift amount. Each year, 20 percent of the fund's beginning market value will be dedicated to support financial aid across the University. The fund will be managed separately from the endowment and will be invested in the Parnassus Core Equity Fund. For more information, please contact Fern Groebe at veritas@harvard.edu or 617-495-1661. Make a gift to the Social Alternative Fund today.
