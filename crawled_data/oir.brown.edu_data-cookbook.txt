Brown has begun implementing the Data Cookbook to be our data dictionary. This tool is intended to clarify how common reporting terms (e.g., student, regular faculty, course section) are used at Brown and to ensure a common understanding of what various metrics, key performance indicators, and other institutional calculations mean. The Data Cookbook includes terms from such administrative systems as Banner, the Faculty Information System (FIS), and FAMIS. Brown employees can also access the Data Cookbook externally using their standard Brown username and password. The Office of Institutional Research and CIS Business Intelligence are leading implementation of the Data Cookbook. Team membership will vary depending on the functional area being addressed. If you are interested in contributing definitions from your area, please contact Mary Heather Smith.
