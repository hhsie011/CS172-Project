Each plan includes vision and prescription drug coverage. Flu shots are covered at $0 out-of-pocket as part of your preventive benefit. Virtual Visits provides online access to physicians at your convenience. Expand all Collapse all Medical Plans Overview Columbia University offers the UnitedHealthcare Choice Plus 80 and the Choice In-Network medical plan options. Both plans cover a comprehensive set of services and provide in-network preventive care, such as annual physicals, immunizations and well-baby visits, at 100% with no deductible. The Choice Plus 80 plan also includes coverage for out-of-network services. If you enroll in either medical plan, you will be automatically enrolled in prescription drug and vision coverage. All university medical plan options cover only medically-necessary services and supplies for the purpose of preventing, diagnosing or treating an acute sickness, injury, mental illness, substance abuse or symptoms. For more details on the medical plan, review the Summary Plan Description (SPD) and Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBC). Choice Plus 80 Preventive care is covered at 100%. Other than preventive care and copays, for most in-network medical services you must meet an annual deductible of $400 per member before the Plan pays the coinsurance of 80% of the negotiated fee; you are responsible for the remaining 20% of the coinsurance. After you reach the in-network out-of-pocket maximum of $3,000 for an individual and $6,000 for a family, the Choice Plus 80 plan pays 100% of covered in-network medical charges and prescription drug copays for the remainder of the calendar year. Choice In-Network Plan Preventive care is covered at 100%. The plan has no deductible for all in-network services. Copays apply for certain services and in some cases are dependent on where the service is received. For example, inpatient hospital services require a $500 per admission copay; outpatient hospital services, including lab and radiology, require a $150 copay. In addition, after you reach the in-network out of-pocket maximum of $3,500 for an individual and $7,000 for a family, the Choice In-Network plan pays 100% of covered medical charges for the remainder of the calendar year. Out-of-network services are not covered. There is an out-of-network Emergency Room $150 copay (waived if admitted). The $150 outpatient hospital copay does not apply if you obtain your lab and/ or radiology at certain New York Presbyterian (NYP) locations. See list of participating NYP locations. Whenever you are having diagnostic or preventive tests, be sure to ask your physician if he/she is referring you to a provider who is in-network. Medical Plan Comparison Chart View 2022 Medical Plan Comparison Chart View 2021 Medical Plan Comparison Chart Important Notes on Referrals United Healthcare’s (UHC) Choice network is a national provider network. It does not require a primary care physician or referrals to see specialists. UHC does require precertification for some services. If you use an in-network provider, your participating network physician or hospital generally handles the precertification process. It is your responsibility to confirm your provider has obtained the necessary authorizations from UHC. If you see a provider who is out-of-network, you are responsible for obtaining precertification for most services except routine office visits. Cost of Coverage: Your Contributions Contributions are the amount you pay toward the cost of your medical, vision and prescription drug (“Rx”) coverage through pre-tax payroll contributions.

In addition, University contributions toward the total cost of coverage for your same sex domestic partner are taxable to you. In-Network Vs. Out-of-Network Coverage In-Network Coverage Whenever you are having diagnostic or preventive tests, be sure to ask your physician if he/she is referring you to a provider who is in-network. For both plans there is a $30 copay for physician office visits (including specialists and urgent care), when you use UHC network providers. Preventive care is covered at 100% with no deductible for in-network services. Out-of-Network Coverage Out-of-network services are covered by the UHC Choice Plus 80 medical plan, and are subject to deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums. You are responsible for obtaining precertifications from UHC before most non-office visit treatment begins, and within 48 hours of an emergency hospital admission. If you do not obtain precertification, you will be subject to a $500 penalty. Eligible Expenses are determined in accordance with the Claims Administrator’s reimbursement policy For more information, contact UHC at 800-232-9357. Out-of-Pocket Maximum The in-network deductible, coinsurance and medical and prescription copays accumulate toward the in-network out-of-pocket maximum. In addition, under the Choice Plus 90 plan, out-of-network out-of-pocket eligible expenses accumulate toward the in-network out-of-pocket maximum. Important Notes on Precertification UHC’s Choice network is a national provider network and does not require a primary care physician or referrals to see specialists. UHC requires precertification for some services. If you use an in-network provider, your participating network physician or hospital generally handles the precertification process. However, it is your responsibility to confirm that your provider has obtained the necessary authorizations from UHC.
