(Ithaca) Field of Study Computer Science Program Description Students wishing to earn a Ph.D. should apply directly to the Ph.D. program. However, it is possible to apply directly to the M.S. program. This is a very small, highly selective, four-semester program for students who wish to deepen their knowledge of computer science through advanced coursework, research, writing, and teaching. The program is ideal for self-motivated students who have expository skills, enjoy the research environment, and like working with undergraduates in introductory courses. Students in the program serve as teaching assistants and receive full tuition plus a stipend. Please refer to field of study directly for details.

Applicants must have a proven record of excellence as an undergraduate grader/TA in a computer science course. Experience as an undergraduate researcher is highly recommended. The Application Applications are due February 1 for a Fall Semester start. An application consists of (a) transcripts of all college-level work, (b) three letters of recommendation including at least one that addresses expository skills and the ability to work in a classroom setting, and (c) an essay that explains how the degree program and the anticipated thesis area resonates with career plans. Non-native English speakers are required to take the TOEFL or IELTS. TOEFL scores on the Writing, Listening, and Reading components must be 24 or higher and 28 or higher for the Speaking component. IELTS scores must be 7.0 or higher. The Research Option Although MS students are normally supported by teaching assistantships provided by the department, the Research Option makes it possible to admit students with less background or interest in teaching, who are then supported by research assistantships provided by sponsored research projects. The source of funding must be identified in advance, and students who wish to be supported in this fashion must have a recommendation letter from the sponsoring faculty member. TA support is not guaranteed in the event of a research funding shortfall. Learning Outcomes Demonstrate knowledge at the undergraduate level of four core areas in computer science Systems, AI, PL, and theory Students should be able to solve problems in these four core areas at the undergraduate level. Demonstrate knowledge, understanding, applications, analysis, and evaluation of material at the graduate level in four out of five important core areas of computer science The five different core areas are as follows: algorithms and theory of computation, artificial intelligence, systems, programming languages and methodology, scientific computing and applications Demonstrate knowledge, understanding, applications, analysis, and evaluation of the three different value systems of the three computer science research styles that differ in how they evaluate and validate research results The three different styles are: theory, systems, and applied Admissions Degrees & Fields Fields of Study – Graduate Catalog Understanding the Field Structure Graduate Degrees Explore Non-Degree Admissions Faculty Research and Scholarship Prepare Required Tests Recommendations Academic Statement of Purpose Personal Statements Transcript Requirements International Degree Equivalencies English Language Proficiency Requirement Admissions Review Considering COVID-19 Disruptions Apply Important Application Policies Application Fees Admissions Costs for International Students Apply Now Application Status Accepting, Deferring, and Reapplying Funding and Next Steps Admitted Students You Belong at Cornell Navigating Graduate School Resources for First-Year Students Living in Ithaca Visiting and Getting Around Housing Housing Tips Dining Admissions and Admitted Student FAQ Contact Graduate Admissions Financial Support Tuition Rates Tuition Rates by Field Health Insurance Rates Cost of Attendance Reduced Tuition for Advanced Self-Pay Doctoral Students Assistantships Fellowships New Student Fellowships Continuing Student Fellowships Presidential Life Science Fellowship External Fellowships List of External Fellowships Letters of Recommendation Writing Your Research Statement Financial Supplementation of External Fellowships NSF GRFP Fellowship Loans Stipend Rates Tax Information Understanding the 1098-T Form Preparing Taxes Travel Funding Opportunities Academic Progress Requirements Academic Structure Getting Registered Enrolling in Courses Finding Administrative Help Making Academic Progress Nominating Your Special Committee Advancing to Doctoral Candidacy Defending Your Thesis or Dissertation Taking Exams Petitioning for Exceptions Responsible Conduct of Research Student Progress Review Changing Your Committee Changing Your Field or Program Changing Your Status Educational Opportunities Off Campus Faculty Guide to Advising Research Degree Students Mentoring Remotely During Disruption Advising Guide for Research Students Advising Guide for Professional Students Office of Academic and Student Affairs Academic Writing Programs Fellowship Workshops Fellowship Application Tips Productive Fellowship Writer Writing and Publishing Workshop Series Interdisciplinary Research and Ethics Programs Three Minute Thesis 3MT 2022 3MT 2021 3MT 2019 3MT 2018 3MT 2017 Promoting Your Research with Compelling Communication (aka, 3MT and Beyond!)

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
