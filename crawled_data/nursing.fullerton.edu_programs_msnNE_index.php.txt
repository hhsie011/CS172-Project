The Master of Science in Nursing: Nurse Educator Concentration (hereafter MSN Nurse Educator) offers course work and clinical experiences which prepare nurses as nursing faculty or educators in practice settings. The degree prepares nurse educators to mentor current and future nurses and take a leadership role in implementing evidence-based practice. Graduates may work as faculty in baccalaureate, associate degree, or licensed vocational nursing programs or in staff development, community education, or as educators in allied health programs. Students gain an advanced knowledge base and skill set that is grounded in the scientific discipline and art of professional nursing. This level of professional education is necessary to meet the needs of a complex and changing healthcare system and student demands for excellence in learning and quality. The degree program is designed to foster interdisciplinary collaborative skills and independent functioning within the focused specialty area of Nursing Education.
