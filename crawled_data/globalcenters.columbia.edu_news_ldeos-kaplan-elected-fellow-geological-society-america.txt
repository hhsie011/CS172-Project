the Geological Society of America Santiago LDEO’s Kaplan Elected Fellow of the Geological Society of America September 02, 2019 Mike Kaplan, a Research Professor at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) has been elected a Fellow of the Geological Society of America. “Kaplan began research on the glacial history of northeastern North America, but soon refocused his research into the Southern Hemisphere where has generated fundamental contributions that enhance understanding of changes in the cryosphere during the late Quaternary, mentored students, and developed strong collaborations with Chilean and Patagonian researchers,” according to the Geological Society upon Kaplan’s election. On the list of new fellows, in particular Kaplan's international collaborations with Chilean scientists are noted. With fields of interest including how mountain glaciers and ice sheets changed in the past, cosmogenic surface exposure dating and geochronology, paleoclimate, and geomorphology, Kaplan has nurtured a close relationship with Chile and its scientists, including having spent several months in the country in 2017 as a Fulbright scholar at Universidad de Magallanes in Punta Arenas and at Universidad Católica, studying the past and historic trends in glacier behavior. Subsequently, he was also a CONICYT-funded (MEC) Visiting Scientist at the Universidad de Magallanes for 2 months in 2018 and 2019. To read an interview of him (in Spanish) by local LUN newspaper at the time click here. In August 2018, Kaplan, together with LDEO’s Joerg Schaefer and in association with Chilean researchers and students, began a three-year NSF-funded research project in Chile’s central area and southern tip to determine glacier sensitivity to past climate changes.
