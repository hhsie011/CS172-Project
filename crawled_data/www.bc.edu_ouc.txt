To enter an event, BC community members can click “submit an event” on the BC events webpage and specify the event name, description, location, and time. Multiple filters such as event type and audience type can be added to sort the event. By selecting a web filter, events will automatically appear on the school, department, or office website for increased visibility. For questions regarding the calendar, contact Christine Balquist.
