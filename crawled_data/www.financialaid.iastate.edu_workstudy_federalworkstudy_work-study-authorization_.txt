(Use this job aid for the full process Hiring Student Employees under Workday Human Capital Management) Or this job aid if student is already working. Under the job details section, select “work-study student” in the job profile box. Staff in the Student Employment Center will review the student for eligibility and either: a. Add the work-study job classification and approve the hire b. Send it back with a comment to change the student to the “student worker” profile if they are not currently work-study eligible. After approving a hire or add additional job in Workday, supervisors will get an email with the award amount approved for student hires. This will be outside the Workday system and will serve as final approval of the student’s eligibility for work-study. Note: End employment date for student employees should not exceed May 31st of the current academic year. Work-study dates for 2021-2022 academic year are August 16th–May 15th. Prior to and following these dates, if you have a student in the work-study profile, they will not be paid through work-study funds and wages will be the responsibility of the employing department. Several scenarios can occur that would prevent a student being paid on work-study, even if they have been approved in that job profile. These include: Student drops below one credit Change in a student’s financial aid award Change in a student’s academic standing To determine a student’s work-study eligibility, departments can utilize the AccessPlus system or check the Y/N work-study indicator in Workday External Student. Please contact the Student Employment Center at studentjobs@iastate.edu or 294-JOBS [5627] with any questions on this process. We appreciate your patience as we implement our new policies and procedures.
