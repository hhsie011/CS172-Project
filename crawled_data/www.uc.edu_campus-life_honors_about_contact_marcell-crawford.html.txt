Howdy hey! My name is Marcell (he/him/his). I am a Cincinnati transplant having previously lived in Oklahoma, New Jersey, and Virginia before making my way out to Ohio. I hold a Bachelor’s degree from the College of William & Mary where I double majored in Government and Secondary Social Studies Education, and a Master’s degree from Ohio State in Higher Education and Student Affairs (HESA). I am currently working on my MBA through Lindner, officially making me a Bearcat! Before arriving at UC, I worked as a Residence Hall Director supporting first year students in the Honors program and as an Academic Advisor for students pursuing degrees as teachers and educators. I currently advise our Arts & Sciences UHP students as well as oversee the UHP Discover summer research program. I am a pretty big technophile with a particular passion for telecommunications. I also enjoy playing video games (I’m a Sonic the Hedgehog nerd), listening to podcasts, cooking and trying new foods, and exploring new places with my partner, Erica. Ask me about... How many phones I've had thus far My dog, Lola The best and worst Sonic games What I'm listening to on Spotify this week My favorite cookbook, 2Chainz's #MealTime Fun fact I used to be, but am no longer, left-handed. You're braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think.
