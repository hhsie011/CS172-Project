Students enroll in doctor of philosophy [Ph.D.] or master of science [M.S.] degree programs to complete training via a coursework curriculum and through research with a faculty mentor they choose from among fourteen participating departments. The diversity of faculty in the IGG program ensures a broad, well-balanced education from the best instructors while offering flexibility in choice of research specialization. Genetics and Genomics faculty have strengths in many areas, from fundamental studies at the molecular, cellular, organismal, and population levels, to research with immediate practical application. Ongoing research projects span all the major areas of theoretical and experimental genetics, including molecular studies of gene regulation, systems biology, developmental genetics, functional genomics, transposable element studies, quantitative and mathematical genetics, evolutionary genetics and genomics, and population genetics. Consistent with the ISU mission, our graduate students learn to leverage these approaches to address grand challenges in biology and biotechnology related to agriculture, medicine, and other areas.
