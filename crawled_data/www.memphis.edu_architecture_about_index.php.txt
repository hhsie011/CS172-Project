Mission and Goals The mission of the Department of Architecture is to prepare graduates to enter the professional practice of architecture and/or interior design and to serve the Memphis and Mid-South region through research, engaged scholarship, interdisciplinary collaboration, and creative expression that contributes to sustainable, stable communities and enhances the quality of life for all citizens. The goals and objectives of the Department are: to provide the highest quality professional education through a well-rounded discovery-based curriculum in both the art and science of design with emphasis on processes, professional standards, and the practical application of design and technology; to provide research opportunities for faculty and students with emphasis on "hands on" multi-disciplinary projects through which students gain valuable professional experience while providing services to the citizens of the region; and to expand opportunities for students in the Department by bringing them together with faculty and students in City Planning and other programs to address public issues, support stable and sustainable neighborhoods, and develop community visions throughout the region. Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion The Department of Architecture is committed to equity, diversity, and inclusion to create a better environment for all students, faculty, and staff as well as the community partners and others with whom the Department is engaged. As such, the Department supports active, open dialogue in the design studios and other environments where diverse life experiences and opinions are shared and the contributions of those who bring diverse experiences, views, and needs into the design process are valued. A culture of respect and open inquiry supports the life-long learning process that begins in architecture and design school regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, physical abilities, or religious practices. As well as promoting social and cultural diversity, the Department also encourages students of different academic levels to collaborate with one another to participate in mutually beneficial learning experiences.
