We provide opportunities for undergraduates -- concentrators and enthusiasts alike -- to take part in departmental student events. Through movie screenings, lectures, and social events, we aim to develop critical awareness concerning what it is to study religion in an academic setting. We are also invested in building relationships with the graduate students and faculty, taking an active role in the shaping of the RS program.
