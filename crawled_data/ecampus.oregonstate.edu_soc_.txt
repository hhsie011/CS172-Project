View programs » Schedule of Classes Welcome to the Oregon State Ecampus schedule of classes. The majority of Ecampus courses are delivered online asynchronously, meaning there are no scheduled meeting times, and you can access courses at your convenience. Some of these courses may use a combination of delivery methods (e.g., they feature synchronous online meetings or are held at physical locations around Oregon). Those that are delivered synchronously will typically show the course type as “Hybrid” in the schedule of classes; a comment in the class notes that reflects “synchronous online meetings”; and additional day and time information in the highlighted meeting info section.
