By Jessica Reyes and Kelly Moffitt January 18, 2022 Click the image above to watch the video, As the Columbia Business School prepares to open on the Manhattanville campus later this month, we're helping people get to know the campus a little better with a series of videos about the resources you'll find there. A resource we're extraordinarily proud of is the Columbia-Harlem Small Business Development Center, which has a new home on the second floor of the Columbia Business School buildings on the Manhattanville campus. Did you know that the SBDC has worked with 3,482 local retailers, invested $181,600,489 in small businesses in neighboring communities, and created 5,506 jobs? The SBDC is an essential resource to the Harlem and Upper Manhattan communities, serving primarily local entrepreneurs who are interested in opening a business of their own or looking for help with an existing business. In the video below, we meet SBDC Managing Director Kaaryn Nailor Simmons, who shows us around the new space. In this video, we also meet Dawn Demry, the president and founder of The Little Hot Dog Wagon, which opened in 2017. The following year, Demry jump-started her career with the SBDC.
