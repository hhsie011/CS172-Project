During the 9-quarter program, students will be educated by exceptional Stanford clinical faculty, will immerse themselves in scholarly concentrations to build leadership skills, and will experience clinical practice in a world-class healthcare infrastructure. Redefining PA Education The Stanford University School of Medicine is at the forefront of transforming medical education. Medical students at Stanford benefit from an educational model known as the “flipped classroom”, which moves traditional lecture content to online video, thereby freeing classroom time for interactive learning among peers and faculty. The Master of Science Degree in PA Studies Program will harness this model and other innovative concepts in the future to redefine PA education. share Student Spotlights & More Learn more about our MSPA Students Read more MSPA in the News Stanford Medicine Flu Crew Read more Daughter of farmworkers Read more From Eritrea to Stanford Read more Pro Pitcher to PA Read more Master of Science in Physician Assistant Studies Program Overview Mission and Goals Program Accreditation Student Attrition PANCE Pass Rate Program History Program Competencies MSPA Classes PA Program Team Leadership Principal Faculty Instructional Faculty Administrative Team Admission FAQ How to Apply Admission Timeline Requirements & Recommendations Preparatory Coursework Preparatory Experience Entry Characteristics of MSPA Cohorts Non-Discrimination Policy Non-U.S. Citizens Technical Standards Applicant Self-Assessment Other Information Events Contact Financial Aid Tuition Curriculum Core Curriculum Clerkships Leadership Tracks and Capstone Student Support Services Student Handbook and Policies Frequently Asked Questions Contact Take a virtual tour of Stanford University What is a PA?
