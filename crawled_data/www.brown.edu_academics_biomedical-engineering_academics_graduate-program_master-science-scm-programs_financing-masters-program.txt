Our tuition scale is competitive. Students pay per course credit and are required to take 8 courses over 4 semesters. Learn more about tuition and fees. Important Notes: The Grad School's tuition rates are based on a 4-course per semester schedule. The BME Master's Program does not follow the pay scale for the Engineering Master's program (it's cheaper!). The BME Master’s degree is an eight credit degree which students typically complete over two years. The 2020-2021 cost of tuition is $ 8,156.50 per credit. With fees, the cost for the 1st year of a 2-year degree is $32,626 for the 2022-2023. The 2-year degree will cost approximately $65,152, but please note: tuition costs may increase in 2022-2023. The Graduate Financing Worksheet can be a useful tool for financial planning. Students can also spread billed costs by enrolling in an Installment Payment Plan. Limited funding opportunities are available: Recognizing that many students need additional funding sources, if accepted to our program we can work with you to identify potential internal and external collaborative relationships once you arrive on campus in the fall. Research apprenticeships and teaching assistantships appointments are available on a very limited, ad hoc basis. These options do vary from year to year and are highly competitive. Students can apply for outside fellowships such as those compiled in Outside Scholarships List. Some students may also be eligible for federal loans. Learn more about about financing a Master’s degree and loan options. Brown also participates in the Post 911 GI Bill and the Yellow Ribbon GI Education Enhancement Program for eligible veterans. In experiential learning, students can participate in a 6 month paid co-op.
