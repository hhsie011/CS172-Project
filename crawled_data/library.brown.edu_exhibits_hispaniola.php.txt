Haiti and the Dominican Republic share the land area of the Caribbean Island of Hispaniola. Although both of these former colonies of Spain and France have faced socioeconomic hardship and political instability in their post-colonial period, they show a sharp contrast in the current state of their natural resources. This exhibition traced the environmental history of Hispaniola from pre-Columbian times to the present and explores the evolution of its natural resources by highlighting special collections materials from the John Hay and John Carter Brown Libraries, and museum objects from the Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology.
