This Garland School FAQ does not replace that of the university; rather, it specifies how the university's policy has particular impact on GPA and course grade requirements that are particular to the Garland School. Frequently Asked Questions Q: I have just been accepted into the social work major. What happens if I take a "pass" in the SWO 2321 course? A: Students who have a grade of C or higher, or a "pass" for SWO 2321 taken in the Spring 2020 semester, will have met that element of eligibility for the major. Q: I have just been accepted into the social work major. How is the 2.7 GPA requirement impacted by taking a "pass" or "fail" on one of my Spring 2020 courses? A: Students should consider the impact of a "pass" or "fail" grade on their overall GPA. As noted in the policy & FAQs (see links above), pass/fail grades do not calculate into a student's GPA. Thus, students should consider the GPA impact (positive or negative) of a letter grade in any given course, vs a pass/fail grade (no GPA impact). Garland School administration will run final GPAs once the pass/fail window has passed, and use those final GPAs to determine eligibility to continue into the major. Q: I am in a social work class that requires a B or higher to move forward in the major and be accepted into a field internship. What happens if I convert my letter grade to "pass" in one of those courses? A: Students who have a grade of B or higher, or a "pass" for social work taken in the Spring 2020 semester (including SWO 4372 and 4373), will have met that course's element of eligibility for forward progression in the major, including progression into the field component of the BSW degree plan. Q: I am currently in my field internship seminar (SWO 4492) which requires a B or higher to complete the course and graduate. What happens if I take a "pass" in my field seminar? A: Students who have a grade of B or higher, or a "pass" for SWO 4492 taken in the Spring 2020 semester, will have met the requirement for completing 4492 as part of BSW degree. Q: Will converting a social work course to a "pass" impact my eligibility for automatic admission to the Garland School's 5th-year MSW program? A: The MSW catalog states the policy that "students admitted into the combined BSW/MSW program are admitted upon successful completion of the BSW from Baylor University with at least a 3.0 overall GPA, a B in every social work course, and the recommendation of the Field (SWO 4492) faculty." While it will not automatically disqualify students from entering the Garland School's MSW program, students who select a "pass/fail" grade for a SWO-prefix course in the Spring 2020 semester will receive an additional layer of review for graduate admission. Seniors who have already been accepted for Fall 2020 5th-year automatic admission will receive an additional layer of administrative review if their transcripts show any Spring 2020 SWO courses that are not a B or higher, or a GPA that falls under 3.0. The Associate Dean for Academic Affairs will write these students to notify them of whether or not their admissions status has been confirmed/maintained. All other BSW students hoping for automatic 5th year admission later than Fall 2020 that do not have a B or higher on all SWO-prefix courses or a GPA of 3.0 or higher will complete an expedited application for admission (directions will come from the admissions team at the appropriate time). Note: Required courses for the social work major that do not have a SWO-prefix (i.e. economics, neuroscience, etc) are not part of the "B in every social work course" requirement. A grade of "pass" for Spring 2020 in a course that does not have a SWO-prefix will count as completion of that requirement of the BSW degree plan. Q: I was approved to take online classes in the Fall 2020 semester. Will I have the option to convert the grades I receive in those classes to Pass/Fail? A: The Universityâ€™s Spring 2020 Undergraduate Pass/Fail Policy does not apply to Fall 2020 classes. Only students who elected to enroll pass/fail in a Fall 2020 course, with approval from the Dean, are eligible to receive a pass/fail grade in a course. This is in accordance with the Pass/Fail Registration Policy in the Undergraduate Course Catalog. The Garland School of Social Work cannot answer questions about how "pass/fail" grades will impact admissions at other universities. Students interested in other MSW programs should consult with those programs directly. For consultation about the pass/fail option specific to the BSW major, please contact Rachel_Garcia@baylor.edu as the BSW Program Manager, Luci_Hoppe@baylor.edu as the BSW Program Director, or Melody_Zuniga@baylor.edu as the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs.
