"An individual with a disability" is someone who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, has a record of such an impairment or is regarded as having such an impairment. To meet the job related requirements of the position and be considered a qualified person under the Americans with Disabilities Act, the individual must have the ability to perform the essential functions of the job with or without a reasonable accommodation. The Employee Relations and Compliance office is responsible for monitoring and addressing compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act as well as Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. A person with a disability has a right to equal access to programs, services, jobs, and facilities offered through the University; an equal opportunity to work and to receive reasonable accommodations, and/or auxiliary aids and services; appropriate confidentiality of all information regarding a disability; and information reasonably available in accessible formats. The University's Rights and Responsibilities The University of Louisville has the right to request and receive current documentation that supports requests for accommodations, and/or auxiliary aids and services; deny a request for accommodations if the request is not warranted, or if you fail to provide appropriate documentation; select among equally effective accommodations; and refuse an unreasonable accommodation that would impose an alteration of a job or program. The University has the responsibility to provide information to staff, and visitors with disabilities in accessible formats upon request; ensure that jobs, programs, services, and facilities are available and accessible; evaluate staff and applicants on their abilities and not their disabilities; provide reasonable accommodations for staff and visitors with disabilities in jobs, programs, services, and facilities; and to maintain confidentiality of records and communication, except where permitted or required by law. Employees who need information or reasonable accommodations to perform the essential duties of their jobs or to participate in any University sponsored program should contact the Employee Relations and Compliance office at emrelate@louisville.edu. Employee and Student Rights and Responsibilities As a person with a disability, you have a right to equal access to programs, services, jobs, and facilities offered through the University; an equal opportunity to work and to receive reasonable accommodations, and/or auxiliary aids and services; appropriate confidentiality of all information regarding your disability; and information reasonably available in accessible formats. You have the responsibility to meet and maintain qualifications for programs, services, jobs and facilities; identify yourself as an individual with a disability when an accommodation is needed and seek information, counsel, and assistance as necessary; document from an appropriate professional how your disability limits your participation in programs, services, jobs, and facilities.
