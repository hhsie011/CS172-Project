Day Distinguished Professor in the Natural Sciences goulian@sas.upenn.edu215-573-6991 Research Interests Microbiology Genetics, Epigenetics, Genomics Computational Biology Education Ph.D., Harvard University, 1990 Research Interests My lab is broadly interested in the mechanisms bacteria employ to adapt to changes in their environment. Most of our efforts have focused on the biochemical circuits that enable Escherichia coli and related bacteria to sense and respond to intra- and extracellular signals. We are especially interested in how these circuits evolve and how they interact with other pathways in the cell. Current research interests include antimicrobial peptide resistance, adaptation to changes in oxygen availability, and commensal colonization of animal hosts.
