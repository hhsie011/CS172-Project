The primary goal of the Iowa State University America Reads/America Counts program is to provide support for students’ reading and mathematical capabilities. You should know that your AR/AC tutor: Was subject to a Sex Offender Registry check Has been interviewed by the AR/AC staff May not be an education major Participated in AR/AC training sessions Arrives with enthusiasm, many talents, and is eager to work with the children Is allowed to tutor in math through 8th grade and reading through 6th grade We encourage you to: Take time to get to know your AR/AC Tutor (it may be helpful to exchange phone numbers or e-mail addresses). Create a game plan with which both of you are comfortable. Discuss classroom rules. Designate a place for the AR/AC Tutor to place their belongings. Discuss dress code. One Final Note An important factor in the success of the ISU America Reads/America Counts Program is to promote a positive and productive teacher-tutor working relationship. If you have any questions of concerns about the performance of your AR/AC tutor, the staff will be happy to discuss the situation and, if necessary, make staffing changes to your classroom.
