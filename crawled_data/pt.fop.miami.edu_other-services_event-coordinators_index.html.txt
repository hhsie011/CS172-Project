Please contact Business Services at 305-284-5550 for assistance. Electronic Message boards are required for events with an audience of 2,000 or more; a nominal fee applies. The boards are strategically placed to keep all drivers (event attendees and local community) informed. Parking and Transportation should be consulted regarding artwork placed on directional signs and sandwich boards (A-frames) in order to ensure alignment with campus traffic. University of Miami Police Department (UMPD) UMPD services are required with events that need intersection control on Ponce de Leon Boulevard, serving of alcohol or reinforcement. Visit the UMPD website. Optional Services Reserved Parking Spaces Certain events require that an area of a lot or a number of spaces be reserved. In most cases, this requires a lot attendant (nominal fee) to secure the area, regardless of the number of spaces. Spaces without an attendant cannot be guaranteed. Staff Resources Your event may require staff resources to secure lots and parking spaces, traffic control, maintain pedestrian safety, etc. Our event team will assist in determining the right mix for your event. Parking and Transportation reserves the right to determine the type of staff resources that best suits your event, based on variables such as traffic flow, construction, and/or other events taking place in the area. We will consult with you during the process of arranging your services. You must give at minimum, a seven (7) business-days' notice, in order for us to staff an event. Shuttle Services Shuttle service is available and prices vary depending on your need, for example, shuttle type/size, usage time and trip distance. You may book directly through Academy Bus Company at 305-688-7700 ext. 1. Or, if arranged through Parking and Transportation via the online Service Request Form, you will incur a 10% administrative fee. Refer to Shuttle Rates. Valet Services We offer a convenient, efficient and professional level of valet service. A valet parking attendant is often the first point of personal contact at any event. Valet service is provided by UM's authorized vendor, which is supervised and equipped by Parking and Transportation. Rates vary based on the estimated number of vehicles expected for the event. Refer to Valet Rates. Please note, valet staffing depends on the size and location of the event, as well as the distance of the vehicle staging area from the drop-off/pick-up points. Our expectation is to deliver the highest level of customer service by requiring sufficient valet staff in order to meet a vehicle retrieval time of 4-6 minutes.
