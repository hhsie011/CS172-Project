National Cancer Institute Designation The Stanford Cancer Institute has been designated a Comprehensive Cancer Center by the National Cancer Institute, a part of the National Institutes of Health and the world’s leading cancer research organization. Designation as a Comprehensive Cancer Center signifies that the Stanford Cancer Institute maintains the highest level of scientific rigor, institutional support and coordination for the complete range of cancer-related research, including basic, translational, clinical and population-based science. The designation is recognition of the institute’s robust and integrated programs encompassing laboratory research, clinical care and community outreach and education. The Institute’s mission is to support and coordinate the wide range of cancer-related activities — in basic, translational, clinical and population-based science — occurring at Stanford University, Stanford Health Care and Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital Stanford. Its over 450 members include scientists and physicians from a wide range of disciplines, all collaborating to translate research advances into improved cancer treatments. More about our NCI designation News & Publications Breast cancer disparities in Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders masked in larger ‘Asian American’ group Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders experience poorer breast cancer survival outcomes that are hidden when their data is included in Asian populations, Stanford researcher says. ‘Remote-controlled’ CAR-T cell therapy safer, more potent in Stanford mouse studies Stanford researchers modified anti-cancer CAR-T cells so they can be controlled with an oral drug. The modified cells are safer, more potent and more active against solid tumors in mice. Quest to find better treatments for rare blood cancer leads to new therapies Hematologist Jason Gotlib wanted more effective treatments for patients with systemic mastocytosis. His research has led to the approval of two new treatments by the Food and Drug Administration.
