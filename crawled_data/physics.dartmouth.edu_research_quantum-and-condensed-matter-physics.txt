We seek to understand how diverse complex phenomena arise when large numbers of constituents such as electrons, atoms and molecules interact with each other. Advances in our understanding of condensed-matter systems have led to fundamental discoveries such as novel phases of matter as well as many of the technological inventions that our societies are built on, including transistors, integrated circuits, lasers, high-performance composite materials and magnetic resonance imaging. Dartmouth's Quantum and Condensed Matter Group The Quantum and Condensed Matter Group at Dartmouth focuses on a range of problems at the intersection of quantum information processing, quantum statistical mechanics, and condensed matter physics. In this new frontier of condensed matter physics, our research involves not only understanding how systems work, but also how to design and control physical systems to function as we want. Common threads that run through both the experimental and theoretical research programs include: coherent control and many-body dynamics of complex quantum systems; dynamics of open quantum systems, quantum decoherence and quantum measurements; hybrid quantum device architectures. Some of our recent publications (on arXiv.org). Theory Professor Blencowe's research interests are primarily within mesoscopic physics, in particular nanometer-to-micrometer scale systems that possess quantum electronic, mechanical, and electromagnetic degrees of freedom. Professor Viola's research focuses on theoretical quantum information physics and quantum engineering. Current emphasis is on developing strategies for robustly controlling realistic open quantum systems, and on investigating fundamental aspects related to many-body quantum dynamics, entanglement and quantum randomness. Professor Whitfield focuses on the role that quantum mechanics plays in computation both in terms of quantum computers and classical models of quantum information. Important areas under investigation are density functional theory, quantum simulation on today's quantum computers, and the physics of computation. Experiment Professor Rimberg's research focuses on radio-frequency and microwave techniques to investigate quantum phenomena in such nanostructures as quantum dots and single-electron transistors. The group has active collaborations with the University of Wisconsin and NIST Boulder. Professor Ramanathan's research addresses the challenge of controlling and measuring quantum phenomena in large many-body systems by exploring the quantum dynamics of solid state spin systems. The group has active collaborations with the Institute for Quantum Computing at the University of Waterloo, Harvard University and MIT. Professor Wright is investigating the properties of quantum systems using ensembles of ultracold atoms, with an emphasis on atom-photon interaction in many-body systems. Specific topics of interest include nonequilibrium phase transitions, transport phenomena, cavity optomechanics and cavity QED. Professor Sarpeshkar's research focuses on using analog circuits and analog computation to design advanced quantum circuits, quantum computer architectures. and hybrid quantum-classical systems. Such systems have applications for simulating chemistry via analog supercomputing chips in his dry lab, in fault-tolerant quantum computing, and in quantum circuit design for NMR or superconducting RF circuits. Research and Adjunct Faculty Jifeng Liu, Assistant Professor (Thayer School of Engineering) focuses on the design of optoelectronic materials and devices for both solar cells and energy-efficient information technologies. Francesco Ticozzi, Adjoint Visiting Assistant Professor focuses on quantum control theory, information encoding and communication in quantum systems, and information-theoretic approaches to control systems.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Physics and Astronomy Undergraduate Overview Information for New Students Physics Major Astronomy Major Engineering Physics Major Undergraduate Awards Honors Recent Senior Theses Undergraduate Requirements Physics and Astronomy Course Offerings Physics Society Student Research Opportunities Careers in Physics and Astronomy Astronomy and Your Career Undergraduate Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Graduate Overview Graduate Awards Apply Financial Aid Degree Requirements Courses Recent PhD Graduates Graduate Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Foreign Study Overview Astronomy FSP in South Africa Research Overview All Projects Astrophysics Current Projects Particles, Fields, Gravitation, and Cosmology Current Projects Gravitational Quantum Physics Quantum and Condensed Matter Current Projects Plasma and Space Physics Current Projects Resources Overview Weather Archive News & Events News & Events Colloquia Physics and Astronomy Colloquia Colloquium Archives (before 2017) Symposiums Symposium on Charles Young's 1869 Discovery of Coronium Jay Lawrence Symposium Archive Pressure of Light Symposium Public Lecture Archives Public Observing People Faculty & Staff Students Alumni Advisory Board Membership Directory Committee Assignments Department Chair Diversity Statement Graduate Advisor Undergraduate Advisor My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
