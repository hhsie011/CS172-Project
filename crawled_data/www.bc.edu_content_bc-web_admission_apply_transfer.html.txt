A transfer applicant is any student who has completed minimally nine credits prior to the admission deadline for the semester they wish to apply. Each year, approximately 125 students transfer into Boston College. The majority enter in the Fall semester and a class of approximately 40 students will enroll each January. The Committee on Transfer Admission reviews each application individually. Primary emphasis is placed on the college record. However, the high school record, SAT and/or ACT test scores, essays, recommendations, activities, and work experience are also critical components of the application. In recent years, students most successful in the transfer admission process had very strong records from both high school and college. Boston College has adopted a test-optional policy for transfer students applying for Spring 2022 or Fall 2022 admission. Associate Director Jeff Gallant Application Requirements Print Please note: Boston College does not conduct interviews as part of the admission process. Common Application For our undergraduate admission process, Boston College uses the Common Application. We require that all candidates submit their application electronically. commonapp.org Selecting an Academic Division Candidates are required to apply to one of the University's four undergraduate academic divisions: the Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences, Carroll School of Management, Lynch School of Education and Human Development, or Connell School of Nursing. Boston College strongly encourages students to apply to their first choice undergraduate division, as this can be challenging to change later in the undergraduate process. Students do not have to declare a specific major at this time (with the exception of Nursing). Learn more about choosing an academic division. The Office of Undergraduate Admission deeply values the contributions made by a diverse community of scholars. Learn more about Boston College's notice of nondiscrimination. Boston College Required Personal Statement The Boston College Personal Statement must be submitted along with your application to Boston College at www.commonapp.org. Please do not mail or email your essay response. Boston College Required Personal Statement Boston College strives to provide an undergraduate learning experience emphasizing the liberal arts, quality teaching, student formation, and engagement of critical issues. Please provide a statement that addresses your reasons for transferring and why you are choosing to apply to Boston College. (650 word limit) Standardized Testing Play Director Grant Gosselin Boston College has adopted a test-optional policy for transfer students applying for Spring 2022 or Fall 2022 admission. Transfer applicants have the option of submitting an ACT (College Code: 1788) and/or SAT (CEEB Code: 3083) as an application credential. If you submit multiple scores, we will superscore the tests for our evaluation. Official standardized test results must be sent directly from the testing agency to Boston College. If having score reports sent from the College Board or ACT to Boston College presents a financial hardship, applicants should have their high school guidance counselor contact the Office of Undergraduate Admission. Alternatives may be explored on a case-by-case basis. You are welcome to submit SAT Subject Tests for consideration with your application. Subject Tests in foreign languages may be used for placement during the first year. Learn more about advanced placement at Boston College. In addition to the ACT or SAT, international applicants must submit TOEFL IELTS, or Duolingo English Test examination scores. Learn more about standardized testing requirements for international applicants. It is your responsibility to ensure that we receive all of your standardized testing by the stated application deadlines. Official Transcripts Play Associate Director Danielle Wells The quality of your academic achievement is one of the most important measures of your preparedness for Boston College; special consideration is given to the balance and difficulty of the program you have carried. In addition to the official high school transcript (sent directly from the high school) or Certificate of GED, official transcripts of all courses taken in all semesters at other colleges or universities (post-high school graduation) must be submitted. Faxed transcripts or transcripts issued to students are not considered official and cannot be accepted. Supporting Materials In addition to the Common Application, Boston College requires that you also submit the following forms. These forms can be printed and mailed (see below for address) or submitted electronically at www.commonapp.org. Academic Evaluation An instructor's recommendation is helpful in assessing your academic achievement and your contributions to your school. Complete the Personal Information section and submit it to a college professor or instructor who has recently taught you in an academic subject. Applicants who have been out of school for more than one year may present this form to an adviser or employer for completion. Academic & Disciplinary Report This report is necessary to assess your personal standing at all of the institution(s) you have attended on a full-time basis. Complete the personal information section and submit it to the Dean of Students at each institution you have attended full time.

Special Notice Regarding Application Deadlines In recent years, a small number of Boston College applicants have faced challenges in meeting our application deadlines through no fault of their own. Natural disasters, political unrest, local school strikes and other unexpected events can add a level of complexity to the college application process. To the extent possible, Boston College is committed to working with students or those writing recommendations to extend deadlines, if necessary. Impacted students should contact us directly to discuss their circumstances. Fall Enrollment Deadline: March 15 Notification: May 20 Applicants will be notified via email no later than May 20 Spring Enrollment Deadline: November 1 Nursing & mid-year freshmen applicants are not eligible for spring enrollment Notification: December 15 Applicants will be notified via email no later than December 15 Transfer of Credit and Course Selection Transfer of Credit Policy Boston College's transfer credit policies are established by the deans and faculty of each undergraduate division. Course evaluations are completed by the Office of Transfer Admission. In order for courses to be accepted, they must be equal in depth and breadth to courses taught at BC, and a grade of C- or better must be achieved. Course descriptions for all Boston College courses and information on requirements according to academic division can be found in the University Catalog. The maximum number of transferable credits is 60 credits. All transfer students must enroll as full time students and spend a minimum of four semesters at Boston College to earn a degree. If you are interested in part-time studies, please visit the Woods College of Advancing Studies for more information. Transfer Course Selection Guide Prospective students often call asking two important questions. First, which courses they should be taking at their current institutions to increase their chances of acceptance to Boston College? And second, which courses would most likely be accepted for credit should they be admitted and choose to enroll at Boston College? Appropriate course selection is one of the most important factors in presenting a strong transfer application. The following guides are intended to help students interested in transferring to Boston College choose courses at their current institutions. Any questions regarding the selection and evaluation of courses, either before or after enrollment, should be directed to the Office of Transfer Admission. Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences Carroll School of Management Lynch School of Education and Human Development Connell School of Nursing Course Selection Guide for the Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences We recommend that students take a variety of liberal arts courses that can be used to fulfill requirements in the core curriculum. Most departments require students to take the majority of their major requirements at Boston College, therefore it is our recommendation that students take only three or four courses in their intended major. Intermediate proficiency in a foreign language is required for all students in the Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences. We strongly recommend that students pursue a foreign language in their first year of studies if they do not fulfill this requirement through AP or SAT Subject Test exams. For students that apply after one year of coursework, we recommend that they complete at least 30 credits. For students that apply after two years of coursework, we recommend that they complete 60 credits. The completed coursework should be some combination of the academic areas listed below: Mathematics (1 course, 3 semester hours) Calculus, Finite Mathematics, or Linear Algebra English (2 courses, 6 semester hours) Literature and Writing/Composition Natural Science (2 courses, 6 semester hours - lab not required for non-science majors) Biology, Chemistry, Physics, or Earth/Environmental Science History (2 courses, 6 semester hours) Modern World History* (1500-1750 and 1750-present) Fine Arts (1 course, 3 semester hours) Fine Arts, Music, or Theatre (Course must include a reading and writing component) Social Science (2 courses, 6 semester hours) Economics, Political Science, Psychology, or Sociology Theology (1 course, 3 semester hours) Theology** Philosophy (1 course, 3 semester hours) Philosophy** Other Electives of choice from academic areas that are comparable to the academic areas offered at Boston College. *US History courses are transferable to Boston College, but they do not fulfill the core requirement in History. **Two courses are required for the Theology and Philosophy requirements; Boston College requires that students take at least one course (3 semester hours) each of Philosophy and Theology at our University.

Boston College is unable to accept upper level business courses from institutions that do not hold the same professional accreditation.

Students who have completed more than one year at another college or university should note that it will likely take at least two to three years to complete the LSEHD requirements. For students that apply after one year of coursework, we recommend that they complete at least 30 credits. The completed coursework should be some combination of the academic areas listed below: Mathematics (1 course, 3 semester hours) Calculus, Finite Mathematics, or Linear Algebra Fine Arts (1 course, 3 semester hours) Fine Arts, Music, or Theatre (Course must include a reading and writing component) English (2 courses, 6 semester hours) Literature and Writing/Composition Natural Science (2 courses, 6 semester hours - lab not required for non-science majors) Biology, Chemistry, Physics, or Earth/Environmental Science History (2 courses, 6 semester hours) Modern World History* (1500-1750 and 1750-present) Other Electives of choice from academic areas that are comparable to the academic areas offered at Boston College.** *US History courses are transferable to Boston College, but they do not fulfill the core requirement in History. **Students in the Lynch School of Education and Human Development also complete a 1 credit course Professional Development Seminar that transfer students can complete upon enrolling at Boston College Course Selection Guide for the Connell School of Nursing Boston College does not recommend that students apply to the Connell School of Nursing if they have completed more than one year of study at another college or university, due to the specialized curriculum students are expected to follow in this school.

For students who have completed a BS or BA program prior to applying and have all of the coursework listed below, it will take three years to complete our program. For any coursework that is specific to nursing, students must submit course syllabi to the Office of Undergraduate Admission in order for their work to be evaluated.

Transfer Student Outreach Thinking of transferring to Boston College? Take a look below to read more about some of the wonderful students who have transferred to BC. Filter Filter By Transfer MCAS Carroll CSON All MCAS Carroll CSON Frequently Asked Questions Transfer Admission Process Is it easier to apply and enroll for September or January? The admission process is generally very similar in terms of selectivity for each semester. Selectivity does vary a bit by semester because transfer enrollment figures depend on how many openings there are at the University, which can fluctuate from one semester to the next. How many students apply for admission? We generally have about 1,700 applicants for September and 400 for January. If I applied as a freshman and was not accepted, should I apply? As in freshman admission, the transfer admission process is highly selective. Students most successful in our transfer process will be competitive out of high school and have strong college records. Although students are welcome to re-apply, please be aware of the selectivity of our process. I'm an international applicant. Do I need to submit both the SAT and the English proficiency? Students whose first language is not English must have a current TOEFL IELTS, or DET score (within the last two years) and either the SAT or the ACT in order to apply. This applies to all international students, even those who attend schools where the primary language of instruction is English. The only way the TOEFL requirement will be waived is if the student scores 650 or above on the SAT EBRW or a 29 or above on the ACT English. If you attended a U.S. high school for at least three years and you are enrolled in a traditional university curriculum without ESOL coursework, an English proficiency exam is not required. If you feel further evidence of your English skills will enhance your application, you are still welcome to send those test scores. Is it easier to be admitted to one major over another? Students must apply to one of the four academic divisions at Boston College (The Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences, the Carroll School of Management, the Connell School of Nursing and the Lynch School of Education) and selectivity is very similar across the divisions, with the exception of the Carroll School of Management and the Connell School of Nursing. In recent years, few seats have been available in the Carroll School of Management, thus allowing us to enroll only a handful (5–10) of new sophomores and juniors. Please be advised that transferring into the Carroll School of Management once enrolled at Boston College is not allowed. The only way to enroll in the Carroll School of Management is to apply directly. Can I reactivate my application from a previous admission cycle? No. If you wish to re-apply to Boston College, you must submit all new documents and a new application fee. If I apply as a transfer candidate and do not get in can I reapply in the future? We recommend that a student wait one full year before reapplying, so that they have time to improve their academic record in order to have the best chance of being admitted should they attempt to apply again. Please note: We do not hold or store past applications; therefore, students reapplying must submit all new documents and another application fee. Residential Life Will I get housing as a transfer student? Housing availability varies. In recent years, students entering in September have been awarded one year of guaranteed housing, while those entering in January have been awarded one semester of guaranteed housing to begin their time at Boston College. It is likely that students will spend at least part of their time at BC living off campus. Will applying for on campus housing hurt my chances of admission? No. Students should apply for housing if they wish to live on campus. Your housing request in no way impacts our admission decision. For more information on the Office of Residential Life, click here. Nursing Transfer Students What kind of undergraduate nursing program does Boston College offer? Boston College offers a Bachelor of Science (nursing) at the undergraduate level through the Connell School of Nursing. Am I able to attend the undergraduate Bachelor of Science (nursing) part-time? No, the Bachelor of Science (nursing) program is only offered for full-time day students. Does BC offer a RN to Bachelor of Science (nursing) program at the undergraduate level? No, there is no formal RN to Bachelor of Science (nursing) program. However, students with an RN may apply as transfer students. Do you allow nursing transfer students? Yes. Boston College enrolls a very small cohort of nurses to the Bachelor of Science (nursing) program in the fall semester only. We usually enroll approximately three to five nursing students each fall, depending on how many openings are available. Several times in the last few years we have not admitted any students to our nursing program because it was at capacity. I have already earned a Bachelor's degree from another college or university. May I apply to Boston College for a second bachelor's degree (nursing)? Yes, the Bachelor of Science (nursing) program is the only program for which we allow students to pursue a second bachelor's degree. Please note that it will take 3 years to graduate with your Bachelor of Science (nursing).
