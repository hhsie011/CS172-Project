Returning service members must submit confirmation of military service orders that necessitated absence from the university in order to receive an application fee waiver. Freshman Admission Requirements For purposes of admission, a freshman student is one who has earned no more than six hours of college level credit after graduation from high school. This excludes credits earned concurrently with high school enrollment and credit earned by examination. Students must graduate from an accredited high school or have earned a General Education Diploma (GED). OSU follows accreditation standards as outlined in Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education (OSRHE) policy. Assured Admission Criteria To be admitted in good standing, a student must satisfy at least one of the following performance standards and all of the curricular requirements listed below. Achieve a four-year high school unweighted GPA of 3.00 or higher (on an unweighted 4.00 grading scale; GPA is an unweighted average of all grades, “A” equating to 4.00 and “D” equating to 1.00 taken 9th through 12th grades), and rank scholastically among the top one-third (33.3%) of their graduating class, or Achieve a GPA of 3.00 or higher (on a 4.00 grading scale, adding standard weighting (1.0) to The College Board’s Advanced Placement courses and the International Baccalaureate higher-level courses) in the required 15 core high school courses (see Curricular Requirements listed below) and attain either an ACT composite score of 21 or higher or SAT score 1060 nor higher, or Attain an ACT composite score of 24 or higher or a total SAT of 1160 or higher. Comprehensive Review At Oklahoma State University, ALL STUDENTS are encouraged to apply because we individually review each application through our holistic and alternative admission programs. We consider many factors, including: high school GPA, ACT or SAT scores, responses to application essays, academic letters of recommendation, leadership experience, community involvement and accomplishments. Students admitted via the comprehensive review process are advised in University College their freshman year. Students who score between current OSU admission standards and the minimum State Regents’ standards will be considered for holistic admission (admission in good standing): ACT 22/SAT 1100 or SAT 1020, OR High school core curriculum GPA of at least 3.0 Cognitive Factors (60 percent) Non-Cognitive Factors (40 percent) which are measured by responses to the application essays, recommendations, leadership involvement and accomplishments. All other students will be considered for alternative admission (probationary admission). See Special Freshman Admissions Programs section below for more information. SAT total score is the combination of Critical Reading and Math sections only. SAT scores indicated here represent tests taken on or after the National March 2016 test. ACT composite is the Final Composite Score or Superscore as calculated and reported by ACT. Test Optional Students have the option to apply to OSU without consideration of a test score. Students may indicate on their application for admission that they would like to be considered as test optional and submit their high school transcript for review. This includes home school, private, parochial, or other non-public high schools which are not accredited by a recognized accrediting agency. Students who apply via the test optional process will be considered for admission in good standing (assured and holistic admission) as well as alternative admission. Currently, consideration for most university scholarships requires an official test score from ACT or SAT, and we encourage students to provide us their test scores as soon as they are available for complete scholarship consideration. Curricular Requirements All students must complete the following curricular requirements for admission: Admissions Requirements Subjects Years English (grammar, composition & literature) 4 Mathematics (algebra I & above) 3 History & Citizenship (American history required, plus additional units from economics, geography, government, history, or non-Western culture) 3 Laboratory Science 3 Other (from any of the above or foreign language or computer science) 2 In addition to the above requirements, it is recommended that students also complete the following additional courses: Admissions Requirements Subjects Years Fine arts (music, art, or drama); Speech additional 2 Lab science additional 1 Mathematics additional 1 Students who have earned any hours of college-level credit must also meet university retention standards to be admitted in good standing (see "Retention Standards" in Transfer Admission). Curricular Deficiencies and Remediation Students must ‘place’ into college-level coursework in the areas of English, math, reading, and science through appropriate placement testing. The predicted grade index, which is a regression equation that uses items from students’ high school transcripts and/or standardized test scores, is used to place students into English, reading or science courses. The OSU Math Placement exam is used for placement in math courses. Secondary testing for placement purposes is available through the College Board's ACCUPLACER exams. For additional information visit placement.okstate.edu or contact University Assessment and Testing at 405-744-5958. English Proficiency Requirement All new applicants for undergraduate study for whom English is a second language are required to show proficiency by achieving the following minimum scores on either the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or International English Language Testing System (IELTS) exams. Scores over two years old by the beginning of the term students wish to enter are not acceptable unless they have been attending school in the U.S. since the test date. 500 for a paper-based TOEFL or 61 for internet based TOEFL or 5.5 for an IELTS exam When requesting ETS send official score reports to Oklahoma State University, please use the ETS institution code, 6546, for OSU and department code, 00. In extraordinary and deserving cases, the President or the President's designee may admit a student who fails to meet the above requirements. In these situations, the applicant must have demonstrated proficiency in the English language prior to admission. For further details, contact the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Special Freshman Admission Programs Alternative Admission Students whose high school achievement is below the standards specified in the performance requirements may be eligible for admission under the Alternative Admission Program. Space is limited and only those applicants showing the best promise of academic success, consistent with OSU's enrollment goals and objectives, will be admitted. Adult Admission Adults 21 years of age or older or individuals on active military duty may be admitted after careful consideration is given to determine the probability of academic success of the student. Factors such as maturity of the individual, job skills and life experiences, motivation, ability to benefit, and access to educational programs are considered in addition to past academic achievement in determining probability of academic success. Summer Provisional Admission Individuals not meeting requirements for admission under another category may be eligible for enrollment in the summer session immediately following high school graduation. Students must have graduated from high school or have earned the GED, meet all 15 curricular requirements, and meet at least one of the following: HS GPA greater than or equal to 2.5 or ACT composite greater than or equal to 18 or SAT total score greater than or equal to 850. Students must also "place" into college-level coursework in the areas of English, math, reading and science. See Curricular Deficiencies and Remediation on previous page. Opportunity Admission Program Students who have not graduated from high school but whose composite score on the ACT or combined verbal and mathematics scores on the SAT places them at the 99th percentile, may apply for full admission. Admissibility will depend on test scores, evaluation of maturity level, and whether the experience will be in the best interest of the student, both intellectually and socially. Assured Admission Criteria (for students attending homeschool or unaccredited high schools) An individual who is a graduate of a private, parochial, or other non-public high school which is not accredited by a recognized accrediting agency is eligible for admission to the University if: The student has graduated from high school or a home study program, and The student has attained an ACT composite score of 24 or higher, or a total SAT composite score of 1090 or higher, or a total SAT-R composite score of 1160 or higher, and The student has satisfied the high school curricular requirements as certified by the school official or, if home study, the parent. Students attending homeschool or unaccredited high schools are eligible for test optional, holistic and alternative admission. See Test Optional and Comprehensive Review sections above for more information. Correspondence Study Enrollment Admission to the University is not required for enrollment in correspondence study courses. However, academic credit for these courses will not be applicable toward a degree until the student has been formally admitted to the University and has secured the approval of the appropriate academic officer for such credit. Non-Degree Option Students who wish to enroll in courses without intending to pursue a degree may be permitted to enroll in up to nine credit hours without satisfying admission requirements. If a student wishes to enroll in additional coursework (over the nine hours allowed) he or she will be required to satisfy admission requirements. Enrollment for this program opens two weeks prior to classes beginning. High School Concurrent Enrollment A senior or junior student enrolled in an accredited Oklahoma high school may, if he or she meets the requirements below, be admitted provisionally as a special student. Achieve a current cumulative high school grade-point average of 3.00 or higher (on an unweighted 4.00 grading scale; GPA is an unweighted average of all grades “A” equating to 4.00 and “D” equating to 1.00 taken 9th through 12th grades), and rank scholastically among the top one-third (33.3%) of their graduating class, or Attain a Pre-ACT (10th Grade) composite score of 24 or higher or a total PSAT/NMSQT score of 1160 or higher, or Attain an ACT composite score of 24 or higher or a total SAT score of 1160 or higher, and Be eligible to complete requirements for graduation from high school (including curricular requirements for college admission) no later than the spring of the senior year, as attested by the high school principal. Students must also provide written permission from their counselor, principal and from their parents or legal guardian. A student receiving high school-level instruction at home or from an unaccredited high school may be admitted provisionally as a special student after completing enough high school coursework to be equivalent to an individual who is classified as a junior or senior at an accredited high school. For students applying with a standardized test score, national ACT and SAT testing is preferred for concurrent student admission. One OSU residual ACT per year may be used for concurrent admission. Concurrent students are eligible for test optional admission. See Test Optional section above for more information. SAT total score is the combination of Critical Reading and Math sections only. SAT scores indicated here represent tests taken on or after the National March 2016 test. ACT composite is the Final Composite Score or Superscore as calculated and reported by ACT. A high school student admitted as a concurrent student may enroll in a combined number of high school and college courses per semester not to exceed a full-time college workload of 19 semester credit hours. For purposes of calculating workload, one high school credit course is equivalent to three semester credit hours of college work. A student may enroll in a maximum of nine semester credit hours during a summer session or term at a college or university of the State System without the necessity of being concurrently enrolled in high school classes during the summer term. For purposes of calculating workload, one-half high school unit shall be equivalent to three semester credit hours of college work. For calculation of work load for students in "blocked" courses, contact the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. The completion of the high school curricular requirements shall not be required of concurrently enrolled high school students for purposes of admission. However, students may only enroll in curricular areas where they have met the assessment requirements for college placement. Concurrently admitted high school students will not be allowed to enroll in any zero-level courses designed to remove high school deficiencies. Students must ‘place’ into college-level coursework in the areas of English, math, reading, and science through appropriate placement testing. The predicted grade index, which is a regression equation that uses items from students’ high school transcripts and/or standardized test scores, is used to place students into English, reading or science courses. The OSU Math Placement exam is used for placement in math courses. Once a student is concurrently enrolled at OSU he or she may continue enrollment, provided that during the concurrent enrollment period the student achieves a college grade-point average of 2.00 or higher, and upon graduation from high school meets both the performance and curricular requirements for admission. To continue concurrent enrollment, the student must submit an updated Concurrent Application Form to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Credit by Exam A brochure of the CLEP, AP and IB examinations and corresponding scores accepted by OSU can be found on the Undergraduate Admissions website. Additional information pertaining to these examinations can also be found in the University Academic Regulations section of this Catalog. Transfer Admission The information in this section is designed to provide transparency to Oklahoma State University’s (OSU) transfer admission processes including admission requirements, awarding transfer credit, equivalency guides and articulation agreements. Definitions: Transfer Student—for the purpose of determining admission, a transfer student is one who has earned a minimum of seven or more semester hours of college-level credit in all college-level coursework attempted after graduation from high school . Concurrent Student—one who is currently enrolled as a high school junior or senior and is interested in earning college coursework during their junior or senior year of high school. Course articulation—the act of evaluating coursework earned at another institution to match content and identify the closest equivalent OSU course. This evaluation includes associated credit hours, grades, and other related course attributes to articulate on the OSU transcript. Transfer articulation agreement—formal agreement between OSU and another institution that defines how courses taken or degrees earned at that institution can be used toward fulfilling specific degree requirements at OSU. These agreements are signed for specific academic years and correspond to OSU degree requirements in the catalog for that academic year. Prior Learning—applies to learning acquired from, but not limited to, work and life experiences, non-degree granting institutions, professional training, military training, or open source learning. Accreditation—is the process used by the State Regents or other entities recognized by the U.S. Department Education (USDE) to ensure postsecondary education providers meet and maintain minimum standards of quality and integrity regarding academics, administration, and related services. Transfer Admission Requirements Students who have earned between 7-23 hours of college credit must satisfy both freshman admission requirements and achieve a minimum transfer GPA of 2.25 or higher in all college-level coursework attempted. Students who have earned 24-59 hours of college credit must achieve a minimum transfer GPA of 2.25 or higher in all college-level coursework attempted. Students who have earned 60 or more hours of college credit must achieve a minimum transfer GPA of 2.00 or higher in all college-level coursework attempted. Awarding Transfer Credit Transfer credit evaluation is initiated in the Office of Undergraduate Admissions and determines acceptable transfer credit on a course-by-course basis for college-level credit. Students must have a completed application on file or be a currently enrolled OSU student to receive an official course evaluation. The evaluation is based on course content, as described in the catalogs of the transfer institution(s) and in consultation with academic units at OSU. Transfer credit is awarded based on accreditation standards as outlined in Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education (OSRHE) policy. All parts of students’ previous collegiate records must be submitted as part of the transfer application requirements. In order to continue enrollment at OSU, students are required to submit an official in-progress or final college transcript from every institution attended and listed on their application prior to admission at Oklahoma State University. Students must also submit any transfer credit attempted from other institutions during their college career at OSU. Students who do not submit transcripts from institutions at which they’ve attempted/earned coursework are subject to the disciplinary action described in OSU’s Student Code of Conduct, which may make an individual ineligible for admission, or continuation at Oklahoma State University. Any coursework taken at least two semesters prior to the desired application entry term must be fully transcribed before the transcript can be utilized for admission evaluation or determining admissibility to the university. All transfer courses are recorded on the student's OSU academic transcript. Developmental education, audited courses, and courses with grades of I, W, AW, S, U, P, NP, N, and X are not calculated in the GPA. See also University Academic Regulation 4.3 Transfer Credit from Other Accredited Four-Year Institutions and 4.4 Transfer Credit from Community Colleges for more information. Evaluating and Modifying Course Equivalencies The Office of Undergraduate Admissions performs the initial evaluation of transfer credit and will establish a direct course equivalency or elective credit in the student information system transfer catalog. Academic colleges determine how transfer credit, on a course-by-course basis, applies to requirements in a specific degree major, minor or option. Courses transfer as elective credit when there is not a direct OSU equivalent course. Students and/or college partners may request a re-review of any course by emailing the Undergraduate Admissions Office. Any changes based on this review require approval from the academic department head or designee. Students should include information beyond the course description, like a course syllabi and/or course assignments. Course equivalency modifications can be submitted at any point throughout the year. However, updates in the Banner student information system will only be made at the beginning of each term. Modifications will be made on a term-forward only basis. Any updates to courses for current terms will be applied on an individual student basis. Approved Equivalency Guides Equivalency guides are tools designed to help prospective students determine how courses already earned from other institutions transfer to OSU. The guides also assist current OSU students plan what courses to take at other institutions that will transfer back to an OSU degree plan. The current OSU approved equivalency guides are explained below. Each of these interactive tools can be found on the OSU website. The OSRHE Course Equivalency Project Matrix can be found on the OSRHE website. Transfer Equivalency Self-Service is an interactive tool for prospective students to show how their credits from other institutions will transfer course-by-course to OSU degree plans. Transfer Guides are designed to help current students who are looking for specific courses to take at another institution that will transfer to their OSU degree. Transfer Maps are established agreements between OSU and other higher education institutions designed to show students course-by-course and semester-by-semester what courses they will take at both institutions to complete degrees. The Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education (OSRHE) Course Equivalency Project Matrix is designed to help students during the transfer process. OSRHE provides a course transfer matrix that outlines courses that will transfer among Oklahoma's public colleges and universities. In addition, each bachelor's degree-granting university lists the requirements for each of its bachelor's degree programs and publicizes those requirements for use by all other colleges and universities. Courses listed under the same Common Course category on the Course Equivalency Project Matrix will be accepted by OSU from all institutions listed in that category as equivalent for the academic year during which those institutions’ courses are listed. Credit Conversion Calculations Semester Calendar Credit Hours. Most U.S. higher education institutions operate on an academic year divided into two equal semesters of 15-16 weeks’ duration, with a winter break of 2-3 weeks and a summer session of 10-12 weeks, plus additional shorter breaks. OSU operates on the semester calendar. The unit of credit at Oklahoma State University is equal to the semester hour. Quarter Calendar Credit Hours. Some institutions use a quarter calendar, in which the academic year is divided into three terms, called quarters, of 10-11 weeks’ duration plus a summer session (optional), a short winter term and other calendar breaks. Quarter credit hours represent proportionately less work than semester hours due to the shorter terms, about two-thirds of a semester credit hour. For example, a bachelor’s degree at an institution on the quarter calendar may require a minimum of 180 quarter hours, which compares to 120 semester hours at an institution on the semester calendar. Credit hours earned at colleges or universities on a quarter-hour system will be multiplied by two-thirds (2/3) to produce the OSU semester-hour equivalent (i.e., one quarter-hour equals two-thirds of a semester hour; or a 5-hour quarter course equals 3.34 hours in semester credit). Clock hours. Clock hours are the total number of actual hours per week a student spends attending class or other instructional activities that count toward completing a program of study. 37.5 clock hours equals 1 OSU semester credit hour. Competency-based and no-level courses will be evaluated on a course-by-course basis. See University Academic Regulation 4.8 Semester Credit Hour section of this catalog for more information. Minimum Grade Requirements for Transferring Credit to OSU OSU articulates all previous coursework for college-level credit earned at institutions which are fully accredited as outlined in OSRHE policy. However, minimum grade requirements exist for various OSU degree requirements (i.e. minimum grades of D required for all degrees, and some degrees require minimum grades of C or higher). Students are responsible for satisfying all degree requirements in effect for the declared program, including minimum grade requirements for specific courses that may be in addition to meeting the minimum passing grade for a course (D) or minimum GPA requirements for the degree. Credit for Prior Learning See University Academic Regulation 4.6 Credit for Prior Learning (Credit by Exam) section of the catalog for information about obtaining credit from work and life experiences, non-degree granting institutions, professional training, military training, open source learning and extra institutional learning. Transferring Credit Earned in High School: Concurrent and Credit by Examination Concurrent. When a student earns college credit through concurrent enrollment, school districts shall provide academic credit on the high school transcript for any courses that are equivalent with the academic credit awarded by the institution of higher education. Academic credit shall only be transcripted as elective credit if there is no equivalent between the concurrent enrollment higher education course and a course provided by the school district. Credit by Examination. See University Academic Regulation 4.6 Credit for Prior Learning (Credit by Exam) section of this catalog for more information. Credit Levels Lower-division coursework cannot substitute for upper-division credit-hour requirements. However, the content is transferable. For example, if a student completes Smart Course 2000 at two-year college A, it will transfer in content to four-year college B for its Smart Course 3000. The student will not need to repeat the content or learning competencies acquired in Smart Course 2000. But, the student must still complete the full amount of 3000- and 4000-level semester hours that college B requires for a baccalaureate degree. Applying General Education Credit Students who transfer to an Oklahoma public four-year university with an associate in arts or associate in science degree (two-year degrees) from another Oklahoma public college, are guaranteed via OSRHE policy that the associate’s degree will satisfy all freshman and sophomore general education requirements at the four-year university. Students who transfer to another college before completing an associate’s degree will receive general education credit for courses that match those at the transferring institution. Credit Life and Expiration The time limit for following a given undergraduate degree program is six years. A student generally follows the degree requirements associated with their matriculation year or the year they begin enrollment at OSU. Although the curriculum may be revised before a student graduates, students will be held responsible for the degree requirements in effect at the time of matriculation and any changes that are made, so long as these changes do not result in semester credit hours being added and they do not delay graduation. A student has the option of adopting the new degree requirements that have been established since matriculation. Transfer of Graduate Coursework for Undergraduate Credit In general, OSU does not evaluate graduate-level transfer work for students pursuing new undergraduate degrees. Students may, however, inquire about the potential transfer of individual graduate credits with their academic advisor. If it is determined that graduate coursework transferred from another institution could meet requirements for an OSU undergraduate degree, students should submit the official graduate transcript with a completed Request for Transfer of Graduate Coursework for Undergraduate Credit form to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions for review. Graduate coursework accepted for transfer as OSU undergraduate credit is not eligible for consideration by the OSU Graduate College for graduate level credit. For OSU Graduate College policies on transfer of graduate credits, please see the Graduate College Policy 5.0 Transfer of Graduate Credits section of this catalog for more information. Technology Credit In general, OSU does not accept credit from technology or vocational institutions. Some departments may offer Advanced Standing Exam options for experiential learning earned at a technology center. See University Academic Regulation 4.6 Credit for Prior Learning (Credit by Exam) section of this catalog for more information. Military Credit See University Academic Regulation 4.6 Credit for Prior Learning (Credit by Exam) section of this catalog for information about transferring military credit. Readmission A student who has attended OSU but was not enrolled during the immediate past semester (except the summer session) must file an updated Application for Admission/Scholarship and current application fee or waiver. A student who has enrolled in another college or university since last attending OSU must submit a transcript from each institution. Admission status will be determined after an evaluation of the previous work has occurred. Additional Requirements for Admission or Continued Enrollment Enrollment Information Admitted freshmen must pay the $300 enrollment deposit beginning December 1 to register for housing and orientation and enrollment. Room selection will be based on the date and time students submit their application for housing. Students who are eligible for a Pell Grant as determined by the Free Application for Federal Student Aid will complete the online process and have their enrollment deposit deferred. The enrollment deposit can be refunded in part ($250) until May 1. After admission is granted, all students will receive detailed information on new student orientation. The fall semester enrollment process for freshmen is completed during scheduled orientation sessions conducted on campus during the summer. Parents are welcome and are encouraged to participate in the enrollment process with the student. Students are required to submit a final high school transcript which includes confirmation of high school graduation to complete their admission record. Immunization Requirements and Health History All new students are required by Oklahoma law to provide evidence of having been immunized against measles, mumps, and rubella, (two shots), and against Hepatitis B, (three shot series). A meningitis vaccine is strongly encouraged (but not required) if you are living in campus housing. In addition, students are required to complete a brief medical history found on the Immunization and Health History form. Students can submit shot records and complete the health history form on the OSU University Health Services website. If this information is not received during the student's first semester, a hold will be placed on future enrollment until the requirement is met. In-State/Out-of-State Status of Enrolled Students As a state-supported institution, Oklahoma State University is supported by legislative funds derived from State of Oklahoma tax revenue; therefore, In-State/Out-of-State status for tuition purposes is determined according to Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education (OSRHE) policy. The definition of the term "resident" may be different from the definitions developed by other agencies. For the purposes of tuition, the general definition of a resident is an independent person who has permanently resided in Oklahoma for 12 consecutive months, not primarily as a student at a post-secondary institution, and provides for his or her own financial support. Initial Classification A student's initial In-State/Out-of-State classification is determined by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions when the Application for Admission/Scholarship is received. VA beneficiaries should refer to this link regarding in-state residency classification and considerations: Residency FAQs | Oklahoma State University (okstate.edu). Petition for In-State Status A student classified as out-of-state for tuition purposes may petition for in-state status if the student believes he/she has been incorrectly classified as out-of-state. A Petition for In-State Status form must be submitted along with any additional supporting documentation to the Office of the Registrar. The student will be notified in writing of the decision following the final review. Deadlines for submitting petitions to be considered for reclassification in a given semester are as follows: Fall Semester - October 31 Spring Semester - March 31 Summer Semester - June 30 In-state status (and associated in-state tuition) is not granted on a retroactive basis. If you are receiving federal financial aid, please seek advice from the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid on how a reclassification may affect your aid. Regulations governing the in-state/out-of-state status of students can be found in OSRHE policy and apply to all colleges and universities of the Oklahoma State System of Higher Education.
