You must demonstrate that you, your parent, your spouse, or your U.S. court-appointed guardian (if you are a minor) is a legal resident of Georgia for tuition purposes. You may establish this claim by providing documentation to support the definition established by the Board of Regents. Please note that establishing residency for tuition purposes as defined by the Board of Regents is different from establishing residency with regards to voting, having a Georgia driver's license or vehicle tag, etc., and it requires more than establishing eligibility to vote, securing a Georgia driver's license, and/or paying taxes.

Any Petition which is incomplete at the tuition-payment deadline will be reviewed for the subsequent academic term. *File form updated Aug. 2021 File Type: PDF Topic: Tuition Residency Out-of-State Tuition Waivers Catalog: Out-of-State Tuition Waivers Georgia Tech has permission from the Board of Regents to award out-of-state tuition differential waivers and assess in-state tuition for certain nonresidents of Georgia under the following conditions.
