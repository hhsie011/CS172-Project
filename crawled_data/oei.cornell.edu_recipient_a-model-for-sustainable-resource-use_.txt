This project pairs Cornell students with students and community members from the Kailapa Community Association, to study ecosystem restoration and monitor how land-based management practices affect life in the sea nearby. The partnership draws on Cornell’s decade of scientific research in the area and the Kailapa community’s centuries of cultural wisdom.
