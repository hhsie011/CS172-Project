To promote a culture of belonging, the University developed a set of common values, leadership expectations, and service standards that increase engagement, productivity, and positive outcomes. The Office of Institutional Culture promotes these principles through various programs and initiatives. If we are not deliberate about creating the conditions that encourage real bridging, we are left with multiplicity rather than real diversity.
