Innovations in Graduate Education proposals to pilot new programs that will improve graduate education at Boston College are due April 15, 2022. Summer Internship for PhD Students: Boston College is piloting a summer internship program for PhD students in the humanities and qualitative social sciences sponsored by the Institute for the Liberal Arts, the Office of the Provost, and the Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences. Given the current shortage of full-time academic teaching positions, these internships are designed to let PhD students explore possible non-professorial careers, learn more about how to make a transition to an “Alt-Ac” career path, and provide work experience that will facilitate such a transition. CWBC Colloquium Fellowships in keeping with the CWBC Colloquium mission, are designed to advance women’s leadership by providing funds to help offset the costs of an unpaid summer internship that either (1) provide a position with an organization (or part of an organization) focused on advancing issues related to women’s leadership, or (2) promote the leadership skills of individual women.
