Jennifer Peavey Left apositive review Wednesday, July 10, 2019 8:00 pm I have taken a beginning Tai Chi class before and fell in love with it. To be able to do this such a beautiful setting really put it over the top! Nan Clarke Left areview Wednesday, July 10, 2019 8:00 pm It was a great idea but very difficult to participate. Couldn't see the instructor very well, and she was hard to hear even though I was near the front. Too many people for it to be effective or very enjoyable for me.
