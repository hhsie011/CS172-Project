These sessions will explore non-verbal and experiential healing techniques, self-calming tools, and guide participants in incorporating mindfulness into your daily lives. This Movement Medicine webinar is a virtual setting for survivors and co-survivors to move from their headspace into full-bodied presence through awareness of our breath, gentle stretches, and guided/free movement. By incorporating mindfulness and movement therapy practices, participants will learn tools to support the body, process emotions and trauma, and release stress. The class is open to all levels of movement. Throughout the workshop, soft and fast instrumental music will be played in the background. Instructor Renk Koctruk will be sharing affirmations, invitational language, and choice-making opportunities to bring participants closer to making decisions about their body Registration for this Event can be found here: https://columbiacuimc.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_bu0yOx54SOmg6CokozkeJA Contact Information Ashley Delphia 212-854-3500 [email protected] Upcoming Events Columbia Health Administration Wallach Hall, Suite 125, Mail Code 4202, 1116 Amsterdam Avenue · New York, NY 10027 Phone 212-854-2284 Contact Us [email protected] Internal Use Only Login to Access Follow Us Facebook Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
