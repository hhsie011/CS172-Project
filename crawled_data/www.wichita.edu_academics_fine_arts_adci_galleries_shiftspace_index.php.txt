Established in 2005, ShiftSpace Gallery earned its name from its early days as a "roaming" gallery. In 2019, ShiftSpace is on the move once again, exchanging its Commerce Street address for a new spot at Groover Labs, at Third and St. Francis in Wichita's Old Town district. The ShiftSpace Student Group programs the gallery, prepares exhibitions, and engages in community outreach. With the assistance of Gallery Manager Kristin Beal, students take on every gallery role, including curator, preparator, community outreach coordinator, social media manager, and more. The group is open to any currently enrolled Wichita State student.
