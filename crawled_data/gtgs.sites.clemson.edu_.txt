Welcome to the Graduate Travel Grant Service (GTGS). GTGS is an electronic system for handling Graduate Travel Grants (GTGs) administered by the Clemson Graduate Student Government. What? GTGs, Graduate Travel Grants, are reimbursement-based grants from Graduate Student Government that support graduate student travel to conferences, workshops, and field experiences. Due the COVID-19 pandemic, there are Clemson University travel restrictions currently in place. GTGs will only fund travel that follows university guidelines. To determine if your travel is allowed, please view Clemson’s Travel Policies. Online events are still being funded. Students need to follow university guidelines upon returning from travel. Please contact gtgs@clemson.edu if you have any questions. Who? Any current Clemson University graduate student may apply for a GTG. Students must be enrolled during the semester a GTG would be used. How? Submit an application by going to the “Applicants” tab on the left. Be sure to read through the Applicant Manual for detailed instructions and policies. When? There are three application periods a year. Applications typically open one month before each period and will typically be open for two weeks. Your event end date must be within the event dates (listed below) to apply in that period. Graduate students can only receive a maximum of three GTGs in an academic year. For more information, refer to applicants manual.
