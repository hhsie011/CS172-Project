Policy Text Columbia University is fully committed to the well-being and competitive strength of minority-, woman-owned and locally-based businesses and to provide maximum practicable opportunities in contracting for construction and facilities-related projects. This policy commitment is related directly to the maintenance of a strong and healthy free enterprise system, the goals of equal opportunity and diversity, and increasing the participation of qualified minority- and woman-owned and locally-based businesses working with the University. The University believes that the goal of assuring that a fair proportion of University construction contracts initiated by Columbia University facilities departments are awarded to Minority-owned Business Enterprises (“MBEs”), Woman-owned Business Enterprises (“WBEs”) and Locally based Business Enterprises (“LBEs”) is consistent with reasonable pricing, quality, and prevailing law. This belief is best served by the employment of Contractors who do not discriminate against minority- and woman-owned businesses in the awarding of construction subcontracts and which engage in substantive, honest and fair marketing outreach efforts to members of these traditionally disadvantaged groups of contractors. It is the policy of the University to comply with all Federal, State and local laws, policies, orders, rules and regulations which prohibit unlawful discrimination, to prohibit discrimination because of race, creed, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability or marital status, and to take affirmative action to ensure that Minority and Woman-owned Business Enterprises, Locally-based Business Enterprises (M/W/LBEs), Minority Group Members, women and local area residents share in the economic opportunities generated by Columbia’s participation in projects or initiatives.
