On-Campus Interviewing Program Fall and Spring (OCI) Each semester, the Office of Professional Development invites legal employers on campus to recruit law students for summer associate, law clerk, intern and entry-level attorney positions. Law firms, government agencies and a host of other legal organizations find on-campus recruiting to be the most practical way to recruit because they can interview a large number of talented students during a full- or half-day schedule. The University of Louisville Brandeis School of Law values our alumni and employers who hire and support the law school. Accordingly, the law school charges no fees for on-campus recruiting and allows all employers 100-percent selection. The Office of Professional Development staff will coordinate on campus interview dates and gather application materials from students who meet your hiring criteria. The Fall 2022 Recruiting session is now open for employers to request an interview schedule either on campus or virtually. Employers can request a schedule by downloading and returning the Fall 2022 Recruiting Registration form to Debra Reh, completing an online registration at: https://law-louisville-csm.symplicity.com. To digitally sign the form, open in Adobe acrobat, not your web browser. If questions or you need assistance, contact Debra Reh, the Career Services Coordinator, at (502) 852-6368.
