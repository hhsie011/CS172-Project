Spectators enjoyed a review of the University’s history by President Sears, a number of distinguished speakers and an ode written by Bishop George Burgess, Class of 1826, followed by a dinner for 700. A centennial poem by John Hay, Class of 1858, began: “A hundred times the bells of Brown Have rung to sleep the idle summers, And still today clangs clamoring down A greeting to the welcome comers.” Brown University Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA Phone: 401-863-1000 Maps & Directions / Contact Us © Brown University X
