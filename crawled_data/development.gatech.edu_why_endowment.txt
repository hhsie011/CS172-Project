Reynolds, is a National Defense Science & Engineering Graduate Fellowship recipient. Breadcrumb Home Reasons to Give Endowment funds provide crucial support for students, faculty, and programs in perpetuity. Permanent endowments ensure that talented students are able to continue their research. Details The power of permanent endowment comes from the long-term growth of assets, most of which are managed by the Georgia Tech Foundation. They may be established with a minimum commitment of $25,000, generally payable over five years or through an estate gift or life-income arrangement. Named recognition opportunities are available by giving to an endowment fund at a designated level, allowing you and/or a loved one to leave a lasting legacy of support. You may direct your endowment gift for unrestricted use by the Office of the President, or for a particular college, school, or program. Ready to Give?
