The 34th Annual Workshop on Recent Developments in Electronic Structure Theory will be held May 31-June 3, 2022 at Columbia University. This workshop series travels to a different institution within the US each year. This year, we will also celebrate Richard Martin's 80th birthday! Typical scientific themes for the workshop include: Quantum chemistry on solids Green function techniques Materials data Quantum Monte Carlo Density functional theory Applications of machine learning to electronic structure The planned scientific program will include ~20 invited talks, two poster sessions: in-person and virtual, and a hands-on tutorial on open-source code. The scientific level is appropriate for advanced undergraduate students, graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and senior scientists. The meetings will take place at International House, 500 Riverside Drive New York, NY 10027.
