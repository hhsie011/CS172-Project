Give Useful Links Alumni and Friends website 2020-2021 Giving Report A Letter from Peggy Burns Dear Alumni and Friends, I am excited to share the Alumni & Friends website! It is on this site that you’ll be able to listen, learn, and engage with the GSD. Solving global challenges using design is at the heart of the GSD, and this website is an important tool for this work. The time, energy, and resources generated from our community directly impact our abilities to research, formulate, and create change. Highlights of the site to explore: Engage with the Development & Alumni Relations team including finding the regional contact for your area. Meet the members of the Dean’s Leadership Council and GSD Alumni Council. Discover how you can create a lasting legacy at the GSD with a planned gift. Join us for a virtual event, including the GSD’s Public Program. Read updates on your fellow alumni and submit your news. Be inspired by the newly launched or relaunched initiatives that the GSD is committed to funding. I hope you enjoy discovering the new website. We look forward to seeing you at events (on Zoom, or later in-person), hearing your stories, connecting over causes that are close to your heart, and working together to support design students as they follow in our alumni’s path and seek to change the world. If you have questions, comments, updates, or want to say hi, please connect with us. Please consider making a gift to support the GSD.
