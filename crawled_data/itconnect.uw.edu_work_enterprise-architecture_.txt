City dwellers tend to want tolerable traffic, plenty of clean, safe parks, and manageable growth. Getting there requires planning that’s comprehensive, well-understood and well-coordinated among all stakeholders. EA calls for a similar holistic approach toward the optimal future state. Featured Enterprise Architecture (EA) at UW How do I engage with Enterprise Architecture How do I get started with Enterprise Architecture EA Resources Architecting the EA Practice at UW At the start of each quarter in 2019, the EA team identified goals for maturing our practice. EA Showcase Event Resources The Enterprise Architecture (EA) team and colleagues from across the UW discussed high-level challenges and trends, and did work in groups on common issues. Containers UW-IT teams across multiple disciplines plan our approach to container-based applications. Enterprise Architecture (EA) at UW Enterprise Architecture’s focus is on the UW’s broad, long-term interests. At the direction of the VP for UW-IT and CIO of UW, EA helps stakeholders maximize the architectural value of their services, solutions, data, processes, or organizations on behalf of the UW in an environment of constant change. 💎 Architectural Value Delivering value to our customers 🐺 EA Charge Reasons for engaging with EA ⚙️ Change Lifecycle How to put changes in context Engaging with Enterprise Architecture 🎟 Events Information about upcoming and previous events 🌐 Communities of Practice Embedded Architects CoP, Business Analysis CoP, Itana (National) 👩‍💼 Consultation Prepare for change initiatives, process transformation and systems replacements Getting Started with Enterprise Architecture 🗺 Set a Strategy Align on drivers and outcomes 📝 Define a Service Plan how to provide long-term value to customers 🏗 Plan a Project Put your project in enterprise context 🧩 Design a Solution Align solutions to the future state and roadmaps EA Resources ⚖️ EA Principles Guide decision-making for architectural value 🛠 Reference Architectures Documents that guide decision-making 🔬 Methods Your toolbox for architectural analysis We’re here to help Request a Consultation EA News Architecting EA – EA Practice 2.0 Dec. 16, 2019 EA Showcase 2019 – Event Resources Oct. 25, 2019 EA Showcase October 22, 2019 Sep. 21, 2019 UW-IT teams plan approach to container-based applications Aug. 05, 2019 News archive Quick links EA Guiding Principles Architectural Methods See a problem on this page?
