At this critical time in education — as the sector manages the fallout of the pandemic’s disruptions, while looking ahead to future needs, critical equity mandates, and opportunities for innovation — the case for courageous and transformative leadership in the field has never been more apparent. Today’s most promising education leaders are driven by passion and empowered by evidence. You are acting with urgency to build a future that recognizes and overcomes grinding systemic inequities. Whether you seek to make an impact in early education, in K–12 districts and networks, or in higher education — or whether you want to drive educational change outside of those realms — you share a vision of education where every learner has an opportunity to be seen, to be challenged, to excel, and to reach their fullest potential.  As educators, entrepreneurs, designers, and changemakers, you are committed to preparing a new generation of 21st-century learners with the tools to solve the interconnected challenges ahead. You deserve a graduate education program — from one of the world’s top education training grounds — that builds on a century of innovation, that’s grounded in the competencies you need to reach your leadership potential, and that supports your current work and future aspirations. The Harvard Graduate School of Education offers two Master of Education (Ed.M.) programs to meet these needs. Widen Layout: wide Master's in Education Our residential Master's in Education — a full-time, one-year, on-campus experience — is designed for aspiring or established educators, leaders, and innovators seeking an immersive Harvard experience, with program options spanning education leadership and entrepreneurship, education policy, human development, teaching and teacher leadership, and learning design and technology. Online Master's in Education Leadership Our online Master's in Education Leadership — a part-time, two-year, online program — is designed for experienced professionals interested in honing their leadership skills, deepening their changemaking potential, and advancing their careers, with preK–12 and higher education pathways that complement their careers and chosen area of impact. Both of HGSE's Ed.M. programs allow you to interact with our world-class faculty, build a sustained community of practice and a lifelong professional network, and gain the preparation necessary to grow, advance, and become the type of leader that education needs now.
