Cognitive Remediation in Psychiatry Friday, June 10, 2022 9:45 AM to 6:00 PM Venue Online Event Categories College of Physicians and Surgeons People with psychiatric disorders may have cognitive impairments that affect their ability to function in daily life, and benefit from psychiatric interventions. Cognitive skills training directly targets impaired cognitive processes seen across a variety of psychiatric conditions and thereby seeks to improve behavioral functioning. This conference will provide a forum for academic researchers, clinicians, and students to learn about evidence-based cognitive interventions. Research symposia will spotlight novel treatment approaches and inform key issues pertinent to treatment implementation and effectiveness. A clinical workshop will provide expert guidance in translating evidence-based cognitive remediation approaches for virtual delivery. At the conclusion of the program, mental health professionals will be better able to: • Identify cognitive deficits, motivation deficits that interact with cognitive deficits, and how both can be targeted in recovery-oriented treatments for people with psychiatric disorders • Identify integrative intervention approaches to improve cognitive health, mental health, and functional outcomes in people with psychiatric disorders • Summarize factors that impact engagement in cognitive treatments and potential strategies to facilitate motivation and cognitive learning • Describe challenges to implementing empirically based cognitive interventions in routine settings and approaches to overcome them • Summarize how to provide remote cognitive health care CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE AGENDA ICG Seminar - Peter McKinnon, PhD Tuesday, June 14, 2022 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM Venue Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, 1130 St. Nicholas Ave., New York, NY 10032 Florence Irving Auditorium Categories Research The speaker is Peter McKinnon, PhD (St Jude).
