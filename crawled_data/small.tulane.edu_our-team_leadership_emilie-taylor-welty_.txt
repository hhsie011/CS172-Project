She is a leader in the design/build field, and at Small Center, she focuses on teaching students how to be better designers, makers, and citizens. When she’s not wrangling Small Center’s Design/Build studios, Emilie helps provide structure, schedule, and nifty graphics for projects we’re working on. Emilie’s wordy titles include Professor of Practice at Tulane School of Architecture and Design/Build Manager at Small Center, but she prefers to think of herself as a Doer of Things. One of those current things is a book project in the works titled Fieldwork; Designbuild Education’s Past, Present, and Potentials. A native of southern Louisiana, Emilie knows the difference between Cajun and Creole and is adapted to our humid swampland. Emilie’s side hustles include: Principal at Colectivo and she is currently working on a book about designbuild education Recent Awards + Publications 2017 Barbara E.
