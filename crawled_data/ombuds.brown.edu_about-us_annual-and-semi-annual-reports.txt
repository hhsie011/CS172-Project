The purpose of these reports is not to criticize or point out fault, but rather to convey areas of concern and identify opportunities for improvement. Using anonymized, non-confidential statistical data, these reports articulate the types of visitors (e.g., staff, faculty, graduate students, medical students, and postdoctoral scholars) who sought out the Ombuds Office’s services. In addition, these reports share the kinds of concerns, as categorized in large part by the International Ombudsman Associations’ Uniform Reporting Guidelines, that these visitors brought to the Ombuds Office. These reports also spotlight visitor patterns and trends that emerged over the course of the reporting period.
