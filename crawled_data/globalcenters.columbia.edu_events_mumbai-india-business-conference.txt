We are bringing together 300+ participants, 10 + speakers spread across several sessions to discuss and ideate India's drive towards self-reliance, as it positions itself in a Post-COVID-19 world. The conference will bring together such voices at the forefront as they share their stories, challenge conventional wisdom and provide insights into the future they are writing – the future of a “new” India. The 16th edition of the conference will be held virtually and is brought to you by the students of Columbia Business School, Columbia Global Centers | Mumbai and the Jerome A.
