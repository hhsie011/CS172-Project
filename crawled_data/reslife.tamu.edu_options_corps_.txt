The Department of Residence Life through the Corps Area Housing Office administers on-campus housing for the Corps of Cadets at Texas A&M University. Accommodations for approximately 2,600 students are currently available in 12 halls on the Corps of Cadets Quad. Members of the Corps must reside in the Corps residence halls unless approved by the Commandant because they are married, living at home with family (in Bryan/College Station), or have prior military service. Considering joining the Corps? Visit corps.tamu.edu to explore the leadership experience available to cadets. Corps of Cadets History The Corps Halls were constructed in 1939. During construction, cadets referred to the site as the “new area.” Today, the location of the Corps Halls is referred to as the Corps Quadrangle or “Quad” for short. Renovations to the Corps dormitories would take place in the late 1960s, early 1980s with smaller renovation projects in the early 1990s. In 2015 – 2017 a major renovation of the Corps Halls took place with the addition of connector buildings. Housing & Assignment Process As you might have expected, housing within a Cadet Hall requires your participation in this elite leadership organization. By applying for Corps Housing, you are agreeing to be a member of the Corps of Cadets. Housing assignments within a Cadet Hall is designated by your unit, class year, and gender. These assignments are determined by Corps Operations & Training as well as Corps Area Housing. Corps of Cadets Hall Information Learn more about the history of the different halls on the Quad.
