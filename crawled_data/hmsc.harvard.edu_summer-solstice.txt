Join us on the longest day of the year from 5:00–9:00 PM to explore—free of charge—the galleries and new exhibitions at the Harvard Museum of Natural History, the Peabody Museum of Archaeology & Ethnology, the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments, and the Harvard Museum of the Ancient Near East. Then step outdoors to create a community mural, enjoy uplifting musical and circus performances, make a flower crown, or enjoy a snack at a food truck. Don’t miss this wildly popular event for all ages. Free parking will be provided at the 52 Oxford Street Garage.
