Fortune Men Columbia Global Centers | Nairobi is pleased to introduce our ongoing virtual book series featuring African authors! With this series, we hope to offer a platform where African writers can engage a global audience, offering not just their work but exciting perspectives on how personal, political, and cultural experiences drive their storytelling. The book features Mahmood Mattan, a fixture in Cardiff's Tiger Bay, 1952, which bustles with Somali and West Indian sailors, Maltese business people, and Jewish families. He is a father, chancer, some-time petty thief. He is many things, in fact, but he is not a murderer. So when a shopkeeper is brutally killed, and all eyes fall on him, Mahmood is not too worried. He has indeed been getting into trouble more often since his Welsh wife Laura left him. Nevertheless, Mahmood is secure in his innocence in a country where, he thinks, justice is served. It is only in the run-up to the trial, as the prospect of freedom dwindles, that it will dawn on Mahmood that he is in a terrifying fight for his life - against conspiracy, prejudice, and the inhumanity of the state. Moreover, under the shadow of the hangman's noose, he begins to realize that the truth may not be enough to save him.
