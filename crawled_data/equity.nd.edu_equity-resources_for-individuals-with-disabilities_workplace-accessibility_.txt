The Office of Human Resources at the University of Notre Dame is committed to guiding employees and the departments involved through the accommodation process with great care and attention to the needs of all impacted by the outcome. The Office of Institutional Equity has created the ADA Procedure Document to provide clarity to individuals and their departments going through the ADA interactive process.
