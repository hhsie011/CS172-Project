Tropical forests cover more than 10 percent of Ghana’s total land area, but land-use conversions for large-scale and plantation farming threaten these biodiversity hotspots. The capital of Ghana is the coastal city of Accra, with a population of more than four million. The University of Ghana's Great Hall forms the northern border of Accra and is in the suburb of Legon.
