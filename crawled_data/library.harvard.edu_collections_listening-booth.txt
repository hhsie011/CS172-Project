Explore This Collection Online From the 1949 Harvard Library Bulletin article on the Woodberry Poetry Room. Click here for additional images of the Poetry Room. The Listening Booth represents a small portion of the Woodberry Poetry Room’s total audio-visual collection. It features selections from our on-going digitization of fragile phonodiscs and magnetic media (associated with the Harvard Vocarium and other early Poetry Room recording initiatives), as well as born-digital recordings from our recent Poetry Room events. Accessing These Materials Unless otherwise indicated, all recordings were made by or at Harvard University. Additional information about each recording is available via HOLLIS by searching under the author and the year. Many of our recordings--by such authors as T. S. Eliot, Robert Frost, Ted Hughes, Marianne Moore, Sylvia Plath, and Louis Zukofsky, to name a few--are constrained by copyright, and we are not permitted to share them in their entirety on our website. These recordings can be listened to by Harvard ID holders via HOLLIS. Scholarly-use copies may also be requested.
