Respondus 4.0 is a a Windows-based tool for creating and managing exams that can be published directly to Canvas or printed. NOTE: Respondus 4.0 is not currently compatible with New Quizzes in Canvas. LockDown Browser is a custom web browser that locks down the testing environment within online courses. Students are unable to print, copy, or access other websites and applications. When an assessment is started, students are locked into it until they submit it for grading. LockDown Browser is available as a free download for Baylor students, faculty, and staff on both Windows and Mac platforms. NOTE: Respondus LockDown Browser can only be enabled by Instructors in a course. Teaching Assistants cannot enable LockDown Browser. Monitor is a built-in feature of LockDown Browser that enables assessment sessions to be recorded with a webcam. Monitor is ideal for non-proctored environments where online tests pose unique challenges. Students use their own computer and a webcam to record assessment sessions, all without leaving Canvas. When an assessment requires Monitor, students must start the LockDown Browser application, log into Canvas, and then complete a brief startup sequence prior to beginning the exam. IMPORTANT: Before using Respondus Monitor, faculty must view this information and training resource. Instructor Live Proctoring "uses LockDown Browser to prevent cheating on the computer itself, while the instructor watches students via video conferencing on platforms like Zoom, Microsoft Teams or Google Meet. This method is only recommended for small class sizes where instructors can effectively observe and track students during the exam." Learn more about Instructor Live Proctoring on the Respondus web site. Availability Faculty can download and install Respondus 4.0, on Windows-based computers. Lockdown Browser, Monitor, and Live Proctoring can be enabled from within Canvas.
