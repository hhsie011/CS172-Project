It turns out that Australians, Costa Ricans, Venezuelans, Spaniards, Texans, Floridians and people from Turkey, China, Burkina Faso, and beyond don't see and experience Yale and New Haven the same way that I do. Shocker (sarcasm)! But really, when you push yourself to see and understand your surroundings through the eyes of others, you turn your world from a single light into a kaleidoscope.
