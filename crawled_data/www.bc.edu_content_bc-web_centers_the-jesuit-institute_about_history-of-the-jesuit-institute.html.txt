Robert Daly, S.J. was named its first director, a professor in the Theology Department and editor of Theological Studies. In 1992, Fr. Michael Buckley, S.J. became its second director. Prior to his appointment, he was a professor of systematic and philosophical theology at the University of Notre Dame. Fr. Buckley also served as rector and professor at the Jesuit School of Theology in Berkeley, Calif. from 1969 to 1986, and was a delegate to the 34th General Congregation of the Society of Jesus held in Rome in 1995. In 1996 Fr. Buckley became the inaugural holder of the Canisius Chair. Named by the University for the 16th-century Jesuit educator, writer and theologian Peter Canisius, the chair was set to be held by an accomplished scholar whose academic interests and influence would further the institute's efforts to foster the Jesuit and Catholic nature of Boston College. During Fr. Buckley’s tenure the Institute took its actual shape. He sponsored many important events, among them was an international conference held in late May 1997, entitled “The Jesuits: Culture, Learning, and the Arts, 1540-1773.” The University of Toronto Press published the proceedings of the conference under the very same title. 2002–2014 On 2002, Fr. T. Frank Kennedy S.J., chair of the Music Department, became the third Jesuit Institute director. In 2006 he was named the second holder of the Peter Canisius Chair. A specialist in the early Baroque period, Fr. Kennedy broadened the international scope of the Institute by bringing visiting scholars from all around the globe and sponsoring international conferences like the ones featured below: June 5-9, 2002. "The Jesuits II: Cultures, Sciences and the Arts, 1540-1773."

This conference brought together religious and lay people, academics, and practitioners from apostolic works and from various different levels of Jesuit structures of governance, to initiate a line of reflection on the opportunities and ways to develop international networking in the Ignatian family; given the challenges that globalization poses to the universal body of the Society of Jesus. The main goals of the conference were: a) Identify and analyze the main initiatives that already exist or are developing in the SJ. b) Analyze the key aspects for Jesuit international networking and identify concrete problems and questions that should be addressed. c) Present concrete proposals and recommendations for developing and improving international networking in the Society of Jesus. d) Position BC as a leading university in Jesuit international networking.

A group of prominent sociologists and Jesuits met at Boston to discuss the challenges of Secularization to the Society of Jesus. The aim of the workshop was to provide the Jesuits a better understanding of Secularization and its challenges and opportunities, and to give social scientists the opportunity to study and discuss the impact of Secularization on this international religious body. The event was sponsored by the Jesuit Institute, The Secretariat for the Service of Faith of the Society of Jesus, and the Sociology Department of Boston College June 11-15, 2014 "Jesuit Survival and Restoration, 200th Anniversary Perspectives from Boston and Macau." 2014 marked the 200th anniversary of the restoration of the Society of Jesus, one of the most significant events in nineteenth-century cultural and religious history but also one of the least well-studied. Scholars from across the globe convened at Boston College to look at arguably the three most important engine-rooms of Jesuit activity during this turbulent period: east-central Europe/Russia, China, and the United States. This international conference aimed to shed new light on neglected aspects of this vital subject. The conference also highlighted the exhibitions “Jesuit Survival and Restoration” and “The Jesuit Victorian Poet Gerard Manley Hopkins” on view at BC's John J. Burns Library. July 15-16, 2014. "Listening to Early Modern Catholicism. New Perspectives from Musicology." An international group of musicologists convened at Boston College to discuss the sonic cultures of Early Modern Catholicism (c.1500–1750). Scholars from nine different countries demonstrated the unique insights that can be gained about Early Modern Catholicism from the study of music and sound. Keynote addresses were offered by John O’Malley, S.J. (Georgetown University), and Robert L. Kendrick (The University of Chicago). The conference also featured a round table (chaired by T. Frank Kennedy, S.J.) concerning the role of the Jesuits and their networks in the creation of Catholic soundscapes. 2014–Present On July 1, 2014, Fr. James Keenan S.J., Founders Professor in the Theology department and Director of the Presidential Scholars Program, became the fourth director of the Institute and the third holder of the Canisius chair.

Growing Apart On October 5–6, 2017, and February 19, 2018, the Jesuit Institute co-hosted "Amoris Laetitia: A New Momentum for Moral Formation and Pastoral Practice," conferences that brought together clergy and laity to discuss Amoris Laetitia, Pope Francis's 2016 apostolic exhortation addressing the pastoral care of families. Amoris Laetitia On April 5–7, 2017, the Jesuit Institute co-sponsored "Toward a Culture of University Ethics," a conference that raised a range of ethical issues that unfortunately, but routinely, arise at institutions of higher education: unsustainable tuition; gender bias; sexual violence; cheating and plagiarism; accountability of tenured faculty, administrators, and trustee members; binge drinking; conflicts around race, class and homophobia; treatment of adjunct faculty, and more.
