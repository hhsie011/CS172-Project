This Certificate is available to all undergraduate degree students, except students pursuing the Architecture Major or the Historic Preservation Major. Students majoring in disciplines such as community development where students learn to work with communities and public policy, art history where students are educated to understand the broad scope of art and architectural historical knowledge, or public history where students focus on the cultural dimension of history, may find the certificate's coursework is a valuable complement to their degree programs. The Certificate in Historic Preservation requires 15 credits of coursework that includes the Architectural History survey sequence and core Preservation courses. The Certificate gives students an overview of the preservation field and an opportunity to work on projects that address current issues of historic preservation in contextual settings. Requirements This credit certificate may be conferred upon a student by recommendation of the faculty and upon satisfactory completion of the required credits with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0. At least half of the courses required for the certificate must be completed at Temple University.
