The classic detective question is not much different from a research question that has consumed Dr. Kristy Nielson’s career. Only Nielson, a cognitive psychologist, might pose a variant — what did you know, and when did you start to forget it — as she unlocks mysteries of memory and learning, especially as they relate to aging. In Nielson’s 22 years at Marquette, her focus has been both on older people with obvious signs of dementia — Alzheimer’s disease is the main one — and people earlier in life whose brains show markers that predict memory loss but whose behavior isn’t yet affected. Asking the questions that yield useful answers requires high-tech imaging tools, including functional MRI and electroencephalography. And Nielson notes her good fortune in getting an early start with fMRI thanks to being in Milwaukee. Early access to emerging fMRI technology helped Dr. Kristy Nielson make breakthroughs in detecting brain changes that precede dementia. EEG technology figures significantly in her work too. The Medical College of Wisconsin was one of three centers in the nation to develop the technology. At the time, the late 1990s, it wasn’t yet used to study aging or Alzheimer’s. But Nielson quickly saw its potential. “I thought right then, as I started to learn it, that it would become incredibly important for understanding how and when the brain begins to change, letting us look inside much earlier than before — before the symptoms start — to see what changes and to try to stop it,” she says. “Of course, that’s what we still do, so it was certainly discernment.” The role of Nielson, professor of psychology, in developing techniques that aid in the detection of cognitive dysfunction prior to full-blown dementia, stands as one of her most important contributions, says Dr. Stephen M. Saunders, chair and professor of psychology. So does her work developing procedures to improve memory, especially among individuals experiencing early memory loss due to aging. Nielson has secured 35 research grants in her Marquette tenure, with another five ongoing. The grants have brought in more than $15 million and resulted in about 70 articles in peer-reviewed publications. In her department, “she is unmatched in the number of and total value of extramural grants she has obtained,” says Saunders, “and her research productivity in terms of publications and presentations is unparalleled.” For all these accomplishments, Nielson was a winner of the 2018 Lawrence G. Haggerty Faculty Award for Research Excellence, Marquette’s highest research honor for faculty. In accepting the award, she recalled her undergraduate career, when she was studying speech pathology and thinking of becoming a chef. Nielson’s development of techniques that help detect cognitive dysfunction prior to full-blown dementia stands as an important contribution, as does her development of memory-boosting procedures for those with early memory loss. “Then I fell completely in wonder and in love with the brain during a brain dissection class,” she says. “I volunteered as a research assistant for three different professors and became the teaching assistant for that brain dissection class. And then I blinked, and here we are.” During that span, Nielson’s Aging, Imaging and Memory Lab has established itself as a recognized leader in research on memory with a partner list of researchers, universities and labs from around the world. Using technology such as the aforementioned fMRI and EEG scanning, the lab investigates how memory can be made stronger and how the brain ages. Students use the lab to search for the roots of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia (she’s earned a reputation as a generous mentor too). Nielson has directed multiple long-term studies that identified extensive functional brain region differences associated with Apolipoprotein-E ε4, a genotype present in some people that increases their risk for late-onset Alzheimer’s. These inheritable differences are apparent prior to any measurable cognitive problems and predictive of future decline. In fact, using fMRI imaging, Nielson has helped reveal the brains of high-risk carriers of the genotype engaging at an earlier age in activity through which aging brains compensate for decline — essentially working harder to perform memory tasks. In earlier phases, this increased brain activity masks decline among carriers of this genotype (referred to as e4, for shorthand), until eventually these efforts fall short. “Then the system is essentially ‘tapped.’ When there is enough damage that further compensation is not possible, the brain activity actually reduces, which is associated with cognitive decline.” Fortunately, regular exercise has proved protective in e4 carriers, improving their ability to compensate for declining brain integrity — a promising line of research Nielson is pursuing through two major National Institutes of Health grants with partners at the Cleveland Clinic, University of Maryland and elsewhere. “We are doing a clinical trial of exercise to examine whether brain function and cognition improve and are better maintained over time in those at risk for Alzheimer’s as a result of exercise,” she says. “We are also examining the ways in which exercise might have its protective effects. We are particularly studying whether exercise reduces inflammation in the brain that APOE e4 is known to increase.” With additional NIH support, Nielson is also working to understand the role improved cardiovascular health plays in maintaining brain function, specifically how well a person’s autonomic nervous system regulation responds to difficult thinking tasks. “Thinking requires more oxygen to the brain cells, increased blood flow,” she says. “But older adults have poorer regulation, a lessened ability to respond quickly, and those with e4 have even poorer regulation. However, through exercise, this regulation can be improved, so we are beginning to study whether interventions targeting improvement in autonomic nervous system regulation could improve cognition and decrease the rate of cognitive decline in those at risk.” At the cutting edge of science with implications for how millions live out their later years, Nielson is driven by unflagging passion. “I’m never bored. And I’m really, really lucky to get to do what I love.” Nielson would like to give a shout-out to university retirees and particularly the Marquette University Retirees Association for playing a key role in her research, including providing volunteers to participate in her research. -- -- -- More from We Are MarquetteFollow Stories of Marquette University students and alumni Read more from We Are Marquette Recommended from Medium Marquette University in We Are Marquette A Sickle Cell Advocate Gregory B.
