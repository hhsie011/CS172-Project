For many more, our memories, movements, thoughts, and even personalities will be siphoned away as we age by the scourge of brain degeneration. The Phil and Penny Knight Initiative for Brain Resilience asks: Why? What causes brain cells to die in people with conditions like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease? Why do our brains become vulnerable to degeneration as we age? And how can we promote resilient aging so all of us can live out our lives with our mental faculties intact? By uniting the Stanford neuroscience community around these unsolved questions, the Knight Initiative, based at the Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute, aims to inspire new discoveries in brain aging and resilience and usher in a new era for brain science and health. LAUNCHING SOON Learn more Read the announcement Initiative leadership Stay tuned for updates Follow us @StanfordBrain | Join our mailing list Join our team Associate Director Research Core Leader “This initiative will examine long-standing assumptions about the causes of neurodegeneration and advance our understanding of how to maintain brain resilience into old age, which is a cornerstone of quality of life.” — Stanford President Marc Tessier-Lavigne “We are calling it the ‘Initiative for Brain Resilience’ because we want to focus on the positive outcomes this important research may yield—healthy aging and the possibility of helping all people live fuller, more vibrant lives late into life. We are excited to invest behind our belief that Stanford is the place to make this happen, and we feel privileged to have the opportunity to do so.” — Penny Knight "About one in ten thousand individuals reaches age 100 cognitively unscathed—seemingly resilient to the effects of time. The Phil and Penny Knight Initiative for Brain Resilience seeks to emulate this sidestepping of the aging process and raise the hope of reversing brain aging altogether to rejuvenate the mind. — Tony Wyss-Coray, Knight Initiative Director Contact Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute Stanford Neurosciences Building 290 Jane Stanford Way, Rm E152 Stanford, CA 94305 (650) 723-3573 neuroscience@stanford.edu Campus Map Connect Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Join the Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute Mailing List Giving to the Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute Make a Gift Learn more about giving opportunities for the neurosciences at Stanford Stanford Home Maps & Directions Search Stanford Emergency Info Terms of Use Privacy Copyright Trademarks Non-Discrimination Accessibility © Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305.
