The Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action provides training programs to educate faculty, staff and students about conduct that may constitute a violation of University policy, their duties and responsibilities under the policies, and to inform them of the procedures that are available to manage alleged violations. While any member of the University community may attend, management and supervisory personnel are especially encouraged to participate in these programs, and are expected to be knowledgeable about the University’s policies and procedures. The programs are available to all University departments, and the sessions may be designed to tailor and meet the needs of specific participants.
