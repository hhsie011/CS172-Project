Right on Broadway, clean, located near Lerner Hall, fast elevators, and well air-conditioned. It also has a great lobby with a lot of space to study.” “If you live on the 13th floor you have an amazing view of the city… The doubles at the ends of the halls look out over the city and easily boast the best views to wake up to in all of campus.” “Broadway may be the most underrated hall on campus. The rooms aren’t huge, but there are great views, quiet floors, fast elevators, and nice kitchens.” Additional Photos: Broadway floor lounge Columbia Housing Portal Submit a Service Request Housing Web Forms Contact Us: 212-854-2946 (Monday - Friday 9:00 - 5:00) 212-854-2779 (After hours and weekends) [email protected] Questions?
