Upon submitting, you will be asked to pay a $70 nonrefundable application fee. Be sure you use the same email address for every part of the application process. In the Common Application, you will be asked to respond to a prompt addressing your reasons for transferring to the University, using 650 words or less. This essay portion of the application gives you the opportunity to demonstrate your ability to develop your thoughts, to communicate them clearly, and to write them concisely conveying your unique voice. We also ask that you list your involvement in extracurricular activities, outside of school involvements and/or commitments; these will be evaluated as another factor in the admission process. STEP 2 Send Official College Transcripts If you have attended more than one college/university (including dual enrollment courses), request that all of your official college transcripts be sent electronically to mydocuments@miami.edu or by mailing them to one of the addresses listed below. If you have completed less than 30 postsecondary credits (not including dual enrollment/concurrent enrollment courses), you’re required to submit your final high school transcripts. Have your official high school transcripts sent directly from your high school to mydocuments@miami.edu or to one of the addresses below. University of Miami Office of Undergraduate Admission PO Box 249117 Coral Gables, FL 33124-9117 If sending via FedEx, DHL, UPS, or courier: University of Miami Office of Undergraduate Admission 1320 S. Dixie Highway Gables One Tower, Suite 945 Coral Gables, FL 33146 STEP 3 Complete the College Report The College Report should be completed by a college official who has access to both your academic and disciplinary information. The University of Miami requires a College Report from every previously attended postsecondary institution. Note: If a student enrolled at the University of Miami prior to the Fall 2018 entry term, the University of Miami reserves the right to retroactively request College Reports from previously attended postsecondary institutions if any information should come to the attention of Undergraduate Admission about potential academic and student conduct while a student was enrolled at another college or university. If you are currently attending a college/university on a part-time basis (11 or fewer credits) as a non-degree seeking student, you are not required to submit a College Report. All others, including part-time degree-seeking and full-time non-degree seeking students, must submit a College Report. STEP 4 Letter of Recommendation We require you to submit one letter of recommendation from an instructor/professor. This should be submitted electronically through the Common Application or by email to mydocuments@miami.edu, or by mailing it to one of the following addresses: University of Miami Office of Undergraduate Admission P.O. Box 249117 Coral Gables, FL 33124-9117 If sending via FedEx, DHL, UPS, or courier: University of Miami Office of Undergraduate Admission 1320 S. Dixie Highway Gables One Tower, Suite 945 Coral Gables, FL 33146 STEP 5 Send Official Test Scores and Final High School Transcripts, if applicable If you have completed less than 30 postsecondary credits (not including dual enrollment/concurrent enrollment courses), you’re required to submit your standardized test scores and your final High School transcripts. Have your final high school transcripts sent to mydocuments@miami.edu (or to one of the addresses listed in requirement #2). Have your official ACT and/or SAT scores sent directly from the testing agency. Test Codes for UM ACT Code: 0760 SAT Code: 5815 STEP 6 Submit Educational Activities, if applicable If you have a time gap of three months or more and were not enrolled at a college/university from the time you graduated high school to the date of your intended University of Miami enrollment, you must submit an Educational Activities statement explaining the reason for the gap(s) and include the dates. You may provide this explanation within your Common Application or by emailing it to us separately at mydocuments@miami.edu. Be sure to include the subject line “Educational Activities” and your full name and date of birth on all correspondence. STEP 7 Submit Financial Aid Documents, if applicable Visit our Applying for Aid page for a financial aid checklist of documents and dates needed to be considered for need-based financial aid. STEP 8 Send Conduct Updates, if applicable If there is an update to your conduct (academic or behavioral) or your standing as a student in your college/university (suspension, expulsion, withdrawal, etc.) you must alert the Office of Undergraduate Admission immediately at conductupdate@miami.edu. All other non-conduct updates can be sent to mydocuments@miami.edu. Be sure to include your name and date of birth on all documents.
