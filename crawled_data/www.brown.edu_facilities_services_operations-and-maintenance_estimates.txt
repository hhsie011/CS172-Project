Work that a requester will be expected to pay for is called sold service Work Orders The Service Response Center manages estimates for jobs of smaller scope to be done by in-house staff on a work order. Estimates are provided upon request and at no charge to the department or organization making the request. Estimate requests can be submitted via the web Facilities Self Service (FSS), by telephone at (401) 863-7800. When submitting an estimate request, the requestor should provide a detailed description of the work to be done and any time restraints that might be applicable. A divisional representative will conduct a site visit to evaluate the request. Events The Events Support office provides non-binding estimates for the costs relating to a planned event. These costs include equipment as well as labor. Equipment can include tables, chairs, tents, stages and sound equipment. Labor can be required for the set up, break down, and cleaning after an event. If needed, a sound technician or custodian on duty, and municipal fees for permits and fire inspections of rented tents may be included in the estimate for an event. An estimate request for an event can be submitted via the web Facilities Self Service (FSS), by telephone at (401) 863-7820, or by campus mail. Projects The Planning, Design & Construction office provides oversight for the development of all construction projects. Most facilities projects are initiated through senior administration; however, any University entity can suggest a project. Individual departments can initiate small department funded projects by contacting the Planning, Design & Construction office directly at (401) 863-7838. These requests are reviewed by senior administration and, if approved, authorized to proceed. For more information about initiating projects refer to Project Delivery Process (PDP).
