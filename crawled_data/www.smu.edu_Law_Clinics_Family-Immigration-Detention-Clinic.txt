The vast majority of detainees at Karnes are fleeing gang or family violence, making them eligible for asylum protection. While at the detention center, students provide aid to families seeking refuge in the United States by: conducting intakes with newly arrived families, working with women and children to prepare for credible fear interviews (the first step in applying for asylum in the U.S.), drafting declarations, supporting attorneys representing clients before the Immigration Court, and conducting pre-release orientations. Course Details Credit Hours: 2 Maximum enrollment: 8 students (Spanish speakers given preference) Course is graded pass/fail Student work at the detention center occurs over the week (M-F) of Spring Break each year. Seminar courses will be held both before and after the trip. Lodging and transportation is paid for by the Judge Elmo B. Hunter Legal Center for Victims of Crimes Against Women.
