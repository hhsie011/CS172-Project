If you have not yet decided on a major, we recommend working toward the requirements for the College of Arts and Sciences. If no foreign language is indicated, it means that no college coursework is required if the undergraduate admission requirement (two high school years or two college quarters of one foreign language) has been met. Students entering the University in Autumn of 2014 (or later) must also meet a Diversity requirement. These three credits will simultaneously satisfy other Area of Knowledge requirements and do not add to the total number of credits you need to graduate.
