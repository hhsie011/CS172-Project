Lee considers depictions of “Chinese- ness” in Brazilian popular music, literature, and visual culture, as well as archival documents and Brazilian and Qing dynasty diplomatic corre- spondence about opening trade andimmigration routes between Brazil and China. Mandarin Brazil begins during the second half of the 19th century, the transitional period when black slavery shifted to “yellow labor” and racial anxieties surged and explores Brazil’s whitening project, a fundamentally white supremacist ideology that intertwined the colonial racial caste system with new im- migration labor schemes. 212-854-5573 [email protected] Genre Nonfiction Topic Latin American Studies Contact Us [email protected] Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
