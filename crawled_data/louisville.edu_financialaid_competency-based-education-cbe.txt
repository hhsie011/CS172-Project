Based Education—Healthcare Leadership Flex Option Program Competency Based Education —Healthcare Leadership Flex Option Program Are you looking for financial aid information for the Flex Option degree path of the online Healthcare Leadership (HCL) program? If so, this webpage is for you! The Flex Option is a competency-based education (CBE) model that allows you to move more quickly through course material you already know, so you can focus on the learning you need to know. Since the Flex Option program allows students to start and finish competencies outside of established term dates, the Flex Option is considered a credit hour non-term program for financial aid purpose. I’m interested in federal financial aid. What do I need to do first? For federal financial aid purposes, the first step you need to take is to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for the applicable aid year. The FAFSA is an annual application used for students seeking federal financial aid. Filling out the FAFSA form can be a straightforward and easy process. For more information, please visit the U.S. Department of Education’s Filling Out the FAFSA Form website. In order for us to receive your FAFSA information, please ensure you select the University of Louisville (school code 00199) as the school for which you want your FAFSA information sent. Once your FAFSA is processed by the U.S. Department of Education, you will be sent a Student Aid Report (SAR). The SAR is a paper or electronic document generated by the U.S. Department of Education that provides basic information about your eligibility for federal student aid, summarizes information you submitted, lists your answers to questions on your FAFSA, and provides directions to resolve FAFSA issues. Review your SAR to confirm the accuracy of your FAFSA information. The SAR may also contain important messages, so please be sure to read it carefully. Ensure you keep the SAR for your records. We receive the results of FAFSAs electronically. We will notify you if additional information is needed to complete your federal financial aid file. Please continue to review and check your UofL e-mail and ULink To Do List. ULink is the University’s student portal, which can be accessed at ulink.louisville.edu. Financial aid information and items required to be completed can be access through your ULink account. In addition, important information is sent to your UofL e-mail account or through the mail. Please be sure to check all of these sources often for updates and/or additional required information. How will my financial aid be processed? Depending on if you processed federal aid while enrolled in the Flex Option of the online Healthcare Leadership (HCL) program prior to July 1, 2020 will determine how your financial aid will be administered. If you processed federal aid while enrolled in the Flex Option prior to July 1, 2020, please click here Flex Option when enrolled for additional information.
