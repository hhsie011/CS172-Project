Applications are accepted during both the Fall and Spring semesters. To be eligible for admission, current students must have a cumulative grade point average of 3.50 or higher by the end of the semester in which they apply. Overview There are two types of programs current students can pursue as an accepted member of the Honors College: General Honors and Departmental Honors.

Please refer to the Honors Student Handbook for ALL the requirements and policies for each program before submitting your application. The application links below will direct you to create an ApplyWeb account to access the Honors applications. General Honors Application (Continuing Students) The main purpose of General Honors is to broaden the student’s intellectual perspectives. Students are encouraged to take honors courses in many different areas of study. Most of the courses you will take for General Honors are 1000-2000 level courses that satisfy the university’s General Education requirements or serve as introductory courses in your major. Typically, students take most of their General Honors courses during their first and sophomore years, although many students enroll in General Honors courses as juniors and seniors. For more information please visit the General Honors web page. Department Honors Application (Continuing Students) The purpose of Departmental Honors is to provide students a unique opportunity to do an advanced, in-depth study or project, thesis research, or a combination, within an academic discipline. Departmental Honors is typically completed during your junior and/or senior years, depending on the requirements set by the department Normally, students achieve Departmental Honors in the academic discipline of their major. However, permission may be granted for Departmental Honors to be earned in an area of study other than that of the student's major. It is required that applicants independently contact the academic department in which you wish to pursue Departmental Honors to discuss possible opportunities and an appropriate proposed faculty mentor before you submit your Honors application. You will be asked to identify your academic department contact within the Departmental Honors application. If you cannot find an academic department contact for your program, please email Katie Maxwell. Students who are accepted for membership in the Honors College to pursue Departmental Honors are admitted at the discretion of the academic department. For more information, please visit the Departmental Honors page. Note: Students that enroll as continuing students pursuing General Honors are welcome to begin Departmental Honors at the appropriate time at the discretion of their academic department – no extra application to the Honors College is needed. Keep in mind that some academic departments have an internal application process for Honors students wanting to pursue Departmental Honors. If you have identified your departmental contact, check with them to see if this applies for the Departmental Honors program you are interested in pursuing. For More Information Please email HonorsAdmissions@clemson.edu if you have any questions about the application process.
