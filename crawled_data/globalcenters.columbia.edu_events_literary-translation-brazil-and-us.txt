9:00 PM Casa Guilherme de Almeida Literary Translation at Columbia (LTAC), a joint course of study housed within the Columbia University School of the Arts Writing Program, was founded in 2009 in the belief that engagement with literary translation is beneficial to a writer’s development and imagination, and also that the skills involved in writing well are essential for translation. Through workshops, seminars, and master classes—as well the collaborative translation initiative Word for Word, which pairs Columbia writing students with writing students at partner universities abroad to engage in projects of mutual translation—LTAC is unique among American programs in its approach to translation as a creative literary art. Dr. Susan Bernofsky, Director of LTAC, will discuss the program’s structure and pedagogical goals, as well as the role of literary translation in the U.S. publishing market. To attend the event, please RSVP here. SUSAN BERNOFSKY holds an M.F.A. in Fiction Writing from Washington University in St. Louis, and a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature from Princeton University. Her literary translations include eight works of fiction by the great Swiss-German modernist author Robert Walser, as well as novels and poetry by Jenny Erpenbeck, Franz Kafka, Yoko Tawada, Gregor von Rezzori, Uljana Wolf and others. Most recently, for her translation of Jenny Erpenbeck’s The End of Days, she received the 2015 Independent Foreign Fiction Prize, the Ungar Award for Literary Translation, and the Oxford-Weidenfeld Translation Prize. She has been an Associate Professor in the Writing Program at Columbia University School of the Arts since 2012, and also serves as the Director of Literary Translation at Columbia (LTAC). MARIA TERESA QUIRINO is a professor, translator and a specialist in translation studies. She holds a Master and a Doctoral in Linguistics and Literary Studies in English from USP (São Paulo’s University). She earned scholarships from James Joyce Summer School 2010, at the University College Dublin (Ireland), from Intercultural Studies Group in Tarragona, Spain, and from the International House London in 2012.
