This course satisfies the American Board of Obesity Medicine (ABOM) requirement of at least 30 hours of live CME credit on the topic of obesity. Program Overview: Lifestyle behaviors – including diet, physical inactivity, alcohol abuse, and tobacco use – have been linked to an increased risk of the leading causes of death and chronic diseases around the world. The challenge of reversing the obesity epidemic has highlighted the need for new ways to teach complex skill sets which effectively target lifestyle behaviors, particularly diet and physical activity. However, most health professionals (with the exception of registered dieticians) have little or no training in the science of nutrition, diet and physical activity. Moreover, health professionals lack training in facilitating behavior change. Many, in fact, do not engage in nutrition counseling at all. The American Board of Obesity Medicine (ABOM), along with the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME), has established a credentialing protocol, which includes an exam for physicians to become certified in the field of obesity medicine. The Institute of Human Nutrition (IHN) at Columbia University is an ABOM Partner Organization; the IHN now offers its long-standing obesity course to prepare physicians for the ABOM exam, and to provide CME credits to help physicians meet the requirements to become a Diplomate of the ABOM.
