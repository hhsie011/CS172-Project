Going to college is a big decision. Temple University helps you make informed decisions about your future by guiding you through the types of financial aid available so that you can enroll and stay enrolled. Our mission is to provide an excellent education to our curious, talented and motivated students, regardless of their backgrounds or means. That’s why we limit tuition increases, and why we ensure our students understand their finances, as well as their financial aid and scholarship opportunities. At Temple, all admitted first-year students are automatically considered for academic scholarships—no separate application is required—and transfer students are guaranteed scholarships if GPA requirements are met. Financial Aid Seventy percent of first-year Temple students receive need-based financial aid. Financial assistance is available to eligible students in the form of scholarships, grants, loans and work-study programs. Other types of aid are also offered. Learn more about what these different types of aid mean. Financial Aid First Step: FAFSA Submitting your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is an important first step when making a financial plan for college. FAFSA helps us determine the amount of need-based financial aid for which you may be eligible. If you are a U.S. citizen or eligible noncitizen seeking financial aid, you must complete a FAFSA at fafsa.gov. Temple’s FAFSA code is 003371. Submit a FAFSA to apply for federal grants, loans and work-study opportunities. This is the only action required to apply for most financial aid at Temple, although there are some scholarships and non-Pennsylvania state grants that require separate applications. After you submit your FAFSA, you’ll receive a Student Aid Report, which provides information about your federal aid eligibility and your responses to questions in the FAFSA. Students must complete the FAFSA every year they’re enrolled in college. While you’re a student, Temple’s Student Financial Services hosts workshops to help coach you through the process each year. Important Dates to Remember Oct. 1: FAFSA opens. Feb. 1: Priority filing deadline. Priority consideration is given to applications received and completed by this date. After Feb. 1, financial aid awards will continue to be made, but funding is first come, first served. Visit the FAFSA website to learn more about and complete your application. Types of Aid Scholarships Scholarships don’t need to be paid back. Temple awards more than $100 million in scholarships each year, and many of our first-year, transfer and international students receive merit scholarships. There is no separate application required to be considered for merit scholarships. Learn more about scholarship opportunities. Grants Like scholarships, grants don’t need to be paid back. They’re awarded according to your family’s financial need and offered by the federal government, state governments and Temple. Learn more about grant opportunities. Federal Work-study Earn money to help cover expenses other than tuition by working for Temple on campus or for an employer off campus. Get more information about work-study opportunities. Veteran Benefits If you’ve served in the U.S. military, you might qualify for educational benefits. Explore veteran benefits opportunities. Educational Loans There are several different educational loan options, from federal to private, and all of them must be paid back with interest. Consider applying first for government loans, which often have lower interest rates than private loans. Some loans are need-based while others are available to any enrolled student. Explore available educational loans. Beyond Temple, many outside groups sponsor private scholarships, loans and grants. You’re encouraged to explore all available financial aid opportunities and apply for additional aid as early as possible.
