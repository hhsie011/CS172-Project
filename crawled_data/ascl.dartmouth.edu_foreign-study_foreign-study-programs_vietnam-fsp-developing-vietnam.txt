Students will study the remarkable social, economic and environmental changes that have transformed Vietnam since the 1980s. Developing Vietnam is an interdisciplinary program that incorporates methods and perspectives from History, Environmental Studies, and Film and Literary Studies. This FSP is based in Ho Chi Minh City, with field trips to the Mekong Delta and other sites in southern Vietnam. Starting in Fall 2021, Developing Vietnam will be offered in a unique fall-winterim format. Students admitted to this program will enroll in two courses. The first is ASCL 70.22, a one-credit course that they will take in Hanover during September-November, as part of their regular fall term course load; the second is ASCL 59.04, a one-credit, three-week intensive course that will take place in Vietnam during the December 2021 winterim. Both courses will count as fall term courses, even though they will be taken in sequence. Developing Vietnam is a key component of Dartmouth's partnership with Fulbright University Vietnam, an independent liberal arts university in Ho Chi Minh City. During the program, teams of Dartmouth and Fulbright students will collaborate to design and execute a research project on some aspect of development in Vietnam. These projects will include field research conducted in Vietnam in December. For more information, please visit the Developing Vietnam program website.
