Student Resources Vaccination requirement Toggle Vaccination requirement The university requires every student, faculty, and staff member to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 (or to have recieved a vaccination exemption from the university). Please note that being fully vaccinated allows individuals to engage in the widest range of activities permitted by the university, while individuals with a vaccination exemption will be required to abide by strict health and safety precautions which will significantly restrict their ability to participate in some activities. Fall activity for fully vaccinated individuals Toggle Fall activity for fully vaccinated individuals The university will allow fully vaccinated Yale School of Music students, faculty, and staff to engage in the following activity for the fall semester, beginning on Aug. 30: All activity will take place in-person. Fully vaccinated individuals will not be required to physically distance on campus, including while participating in classes, lessons, coachings, chamber music, and large ensemble activity. The universityâ€™s current mask policy requires everyone (including fully vaccinated individuals) to be masked at all times while indoors on campus except when using individual spaces. Until such time as the transmission rate in New Haven County declines and the university can amend the mask requirement, this means that wind and brass players will wear slit masks and use bell covers while playing, and singers will be masked while singing. Large ensembles comprised of Yale community members, such as the Yale Philharmonia, will return to their pre-pandemic sizes. Room capacities will return to the standard limits set by the fire marshal. Classes and rehearsals will take place for their standard duration, at their regular times and in their usual locations. Student and faculty performances will take place. For the fall semester, only Yale ID holders will be permitted to attend. Initial events will be open to only YSM and ISM students, faculty, and staff, and audiences will be gradually expanded to include other members of the Yale community. Guest performances will not take place in the fall. Individuals must swipe into facilities with their Yale ID but are not required to check in and out with building monitors. ArtsVision reservations will still be required for most YSM spaces, and reservations for some ISM spaces will still be required through appropriate ISM calendaring. The daily health check will no longer be required. Weekly testing may still be required, depending on public health conditions. Please note that the university may implement additional health and safety precautions at various times during the term as conditions warrant. Prior to engaging in in-person activity, all fully vaccinated individuals are required to: Have documentation of a verified full vaccination against COVID-19 on file with the university by August 1. It is essential that you submit your vaccination record immediately if you have not done so already. We understand that many international students will be unable to be vaccinated before arriving in New Haven; please see this FAQ from OISS for additional guidance. Students must submit the YSM arrival form by Aug. 6. Complete any online COVID-19 safety training (details will be provided in August). Sign the Fall 2021 Compact (students: links will be provided in August) or review the Expectations (faculty/staff). If arriving from another country, complete arrival testing. If arriving from another state, arrival (gateway) testing is recommended but is only required for students residing in Yale housing. If you have questions about any of the requirements above, please contact the YSM Health and Safety Team at yalemusic.info@yale.edu. Requirements for unvaccinated individuals who receive a vaccination exemption Toggle Requirements for unvaccinated individuals who receive a vaccination exemption The permissions and policies described above apply ONLY to fully vaccinated individuals. The university is granting a limited number of exemptions (medical, religious, or strongly held personal belief) to the vaccination requirement. Unvaccinated individuals who are granted a vaccination exemption will be required to abide by strict university health and safety protocols including but not limited to: possible restrictions on participation in certain activities limitations of access to certain events, spaces, and roles must be masked and physically distanced at all times must receive a mandatory COVID-19 test twice a week If you have received or will be applying for an exemption, please contact Krista Johnson at krista.johnson@yale.edu immediately for more details and to discuss your options for the 2021-2022 academic year; students, please note that deferral or a leave of absence may be possible. Mandatory training Toggle The online COVID-19 training program for students has been updated for fall 2021. All studentsâ€”except for those who completed the spring 2021 trainingâ€”are required to complete the Student Return to Campus COVID-19 Training. Community Compact Toggle All students are required to read and sign the Fall 2021 Compact, even if they signed last yearâ€™s compacts. Gateway testing Toggle Gateway testing is required for the following students: All students living in certain graduate dorms (Helen Hadley, Harkness, Baker, 254 and 276 Prospect, and 272 Elm) All students arriving from out-of-state locations Students arriving from outside of the U.S. must also get a second test 3-5 days after arrival Unvaccinated students with exemptions (or those with vaccination underway upon arrival) Please see your email for detailed instructions from the YSM H&S team Once you have completed all Gateway testing, please submit this form to confirm. Routine weekly testing Toggle In consideration of the risks posed by asymptomatic COVID-19 due to the Delta variant, we have now determined that all fully vaccinated YSM students will be required to test once weekly, at least through the end of September. This surveillance approach, which will also apply to all undergraduates and residents of Yale graduate dormitories regardless of school, will allow us to assess the status of our vaccinated students and to identify possible asymptomatic infection early. We will update you in late September as to whether the testing requirement will be extended. Once you have completed your gateway test, you should plan to self-schedule a weekly test at the site of your choice through https://covidtesting.yale.edu. For full guidance on the testing process, go to the Yale COVID-19 Screening Program web page. You may do your weekly test any day of the week but should not let more than 7 days pass between tests; you will be notified on day 8 if you fail to schedule a test. Be sure to register for your MyChart account if you have not done so already. (A registration code was sent to new students on August 3; search your email for messages from Yale Health; you may also request one through the link above). We appreciate your patience with these evolving policies. If you have questions, you may contact the YSM Health and Safety Team at yalemusic.info@yale.edu or for clinical questions contact the Campus COVID Resource Line at 203-432-6604. Additional guidance Toggle The university continues to monitor the state of the pandemic closely and will implement additional health and safety measures as necessary in response to changes in conditions. As a public health precaution, most activities involving non-Yale individuals and external venues are not yet permitted. Further guidance is expected from the university in August and early autumn about when the following activities can resume, and what precautions will apply. Music in Schools Initiative: Yale students are not yet allowed to teach public school students in off-campus locations, and public-school students are not yet allowed to use YSM spaces for MISI rehearsals and lessons Collection of Music Instruments: not yet open for visits Non-Yale affiliated audience members are not yet allowed to attend Yale events; we hope that their attendance will be permitted in the spring. Non-Yale-affiliated community members are not yet allowed to participate in Camerata. Off-campus performances are not yet permitted. Health and wellness Toggle If you experience fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, stay home and contact a healthcare provider for guidanceâ€”do not go to a health care facility before you have called your health care provider or a hospital emergency room for instructions. If you are a Yale student or Yale Health member, you should contact Internal Medicine (203-432-0038), Student Health (203-432-0312), or Pediatrics (203-432-0206). For nights and weekends, please call Yale Health Acute Care (203-432-0123). If you are an Aetna member or have other healthcare coverage, please contact your physician. All members of the Yale community may also contact the Campus COVID Resource Line (203-432-6604). Avoid contact with others to limit spread. Cover your cough/sneeze with a tissue or sleeve, not your hands. Wash your hands with soap and water after coughing, sneezing, and blowing your nose. (See CDC handwashing video.) Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are unavailable. Wear a face mask or face covering to minimize the risk of spread of infection. If you are diagnosed with COVID-19 at any time, please call the Campus COVID Resource Line (203-432-6604), so we can initiate contact tracing and other infection control measures.
