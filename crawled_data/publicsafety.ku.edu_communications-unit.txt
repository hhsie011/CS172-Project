In addition, the Communications section acts as the central repository for crime reporting, associated statistical data and criminal history reporting systems. The Communications Center (Dispatch) The Communications Center provides emergency and non-emergency call-taking and dispatching services for the university community, including police, fire and medical, safety and security, maintenance, and parking services. In a support role, the Communications Center functions as a backup to the Douglas County Emergency Communications Center that serves the residents of Douglas county. Emergency and non-emergency calls Click to expand 911 Calls When you call 9-1-1, the dispatcher will answer "911, what is the address of your emergency?" The name, address and phone number of the calling party will be displayed on a screen for the dispatcher to confirm and verify. Call 911 for emergency situations only! If there is an immediate threat to life or property, such as a crime in progress, fire or medical emergency, use 911. Do not call 9-1-1 for weather or road conditions, telephone numbers, directions to a location, or any other type of general information that is better handled by a non-emergency number. Non-emergency Calls The KU Office of Public Safety maintains a non-emergency phone number (785-864-5900) for routine requests and general information. This includes requests for copies of police reports, campus directions, lost and found, and other non-emergency-related calls. Alarm monitoring Click to expand The Communications Center provides alarm-monitoring service for the university community. With state-of-the-art fiber optic and graphical display system, the Communications Center directly monitors fire alarm systems for university-owned and affiliated buildings. Due to the technology available through this system, the Communications Center can also monitor campus building security systems. Alarms are prioritized as follows: Primary Fire Alarms Armed Robbery (locations that have a high cash flow/volume) Bank (ATM Machines) alarms Anti-Theft alarms Secondary Call-in alarms to include doors and temperature controls at campus locations.
