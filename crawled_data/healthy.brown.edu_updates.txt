With near-universal vaccination rates on the Brown campus (exceeding 90%) and with ongoing monitoring of public health conditions, the University is gradually reducing the number of health and safety protocols in effect. Updates are continually available via the Messages to the Community page and all current public health protocols are outlined on the Campus Activity Status page. Highlights of Brown's operations for the 2021-22 academic year include the following: The University transitioned back to in-person academic instruction and operations for the 2021-22 academic year. Brown is requiring all students, faculty and staff to receive the COVID-19 vaccine and a COVID-19 booster when they become eligible and to stay informed about the vaccines by learning about their safety, effectiveness and availability. Routine COVID-19 testing is mandatory for all unvaccinated employees and students (those with approved exemptions and those who are in the process of getting vaccinated) and optional for all other employees, undergraduate, graduate and medical students who are on campus. Testing requirements are updated for periods of high transmission and for students during the period of the return of the student population to campus following breaks in the academic calendar. Requirements for masking and other health protocols continue to be updated as public health conditions evolve. Brown's policies for visitors and guests are designed to engage in community-building in-person, while also limiting risk and prioritizing the health and safety of community members. Employees may work with supervisors to develop flexible work arrangements for operations that do not have to be performed fully onsite.
