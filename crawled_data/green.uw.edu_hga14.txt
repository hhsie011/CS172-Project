Students, faculty and staff from Seattle, Bothell and Tacoma are eligible to nominate and receive this award. Winners were announced at the annual Earth Day celebration, see the 2014 Husky Green Award recipients below, or all of this year's nominees. Cameron McCallum Bioresource Science and Engineering/Restoration Ecology Major As an assistant in the Physics Instrument shop, Cameron has taken the initiative to improve sustainable practices within the department including waste diversion and recycling. He has also served as the outreach coordinator for UW SER (Society for Ecological Restoration) where he led large projects in campus ecological restoration and environmental education. Additionally, he is a leader within the Biodiesel Cooperative, pushing for recycling of cooking oil as fuel for UW Fleet Services. Campus Grounds Management UW Seattle Grounds Management This past year, the Grounds Management Team and gardening staff supported and implemented sustainability projects such as building an on-site compost facility, supporting campus wide habitat restoration efforts, and achieving the Salmon Safe Certificate, signifying strong ecologically sustainable land management. They are constantly improving operation efficiency, which decreases environmental impact of necessary maintenance activities, while seeking ways to expand sustainability initiatives within daily operations. Carter Case Undergraduate, Environmental Studies Major Carter is a co-leader of four clubs including Earth Club, Student Association for a Green Environment, Divest UW, and EcoReps. Conservation Biology 476 Faculty and Staff Current Instructors Meade Krosby & Tim Billo and Past Instructors Ursula Valdez, Josh Tewksbury & Dee Boersma The Conservation Biology 476 faculty and staff offer an extra credit opportunity, the “Ecological Footprint” assignment. Students who choose to participate measure their ecological footprint at the start of the quarter and choose an area such as water, paper, or other resource usage to reduce. This innovative assignment raises awareness, increases understanding of lifestyle choices, and impacts hundreds of undergraduates, which reaches further into the community. The instructors themselves also participate in the activity. Prairie Line Trail Project UW Tacoma The Prairie Line Trail project repurposed the Burlington Northern Santé Fe (BNSF) railroad right of way that ran through the Tacoma campus into a downtown amenity, connecting the campus to other areas throughout Tacoma. This project is a prototype for collaborative partnerships to reduce energy consumption and pollution, in addition to providing alternative transportation, open space in an urban environment, and educational opportunities.

Husky Green Legacy Awards were presented to Dean Sandra Archibald and Astronomy Professor Bruce Balick for their dedication and years of service to advancing campus sustainability at the University of Washington. In recognition of each award recipient, 10 native plants are planted in their honor. We would like to thank the UW Botanical Gardens and the UW Environmental Stewardship Committee (ESC) for making this possible.
