They are the foundation, the bottom line, of information security within any institution. The Information Security policies are formal statements that specify a set of rules that all users must follow when gaining access to UC’s information and information systems. Policies are high-level management directives, and they are mandatory. A policy has four parts: purpose, scope, responsibilities, and compliance. The purpose will describe the need for that policy. The scope will describe what systems, people, facilities, and organizations are covered by the policy. The responsibilities are those of the information security staff, policy and management teams, and of the whole organization. In order to be in compliance, a policy will be judged on how effective it is and what happens when it is violated. The University of Cincinnati Information Security Policy and Compliance Framework allows for a formal process to develop and review policies that support the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and accountability of university data and critical technology resources.
