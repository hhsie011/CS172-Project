Texas Tech University Directory Raiderlink A-Z Index Atmospheric Science Menu Search TTU Department of Geosciences Atmospheric Science Atmospheric Science For over 40 years, the Atmospheric Science Program at Texas Tech University has been dedicated to research of the lower atmosphere. We have a broad array of ongoing research thrusts, including severe thunderstorm dynamics (e.g., as relevant to tornadoes, severe hail/wind, and lightning), numerical weather prediction, boundary layer meteorology, wind power meteorology and aerosols in climate. We remain committed to a better understanding of our earth's atmosphere through the development and application of instrumentation and the integration of state-of-the-art computational facilities. At the same time, we are focused on educating and preparing the next generation of atmospheric scientists. Academics The Atmospheric Science Program offers a course of study leading to the Master of Science degree in Atmospheric Science and the Ph.D. in Geosciences (Atmospheric Science track). In addition, courses in Atmospheric Science are offered at the undergraduate level to meet general education requirements. A minor in Atmospheric Science is offered for both B.S. and B.A. students. Graduate Student Support Teaching assistantships are available for qualified graduate student applicants on a competitive basis. These assistantships provide the opportunity for students to acquire instructional skills while further developing their understanding of topics in atmospheric science. As a matter of university policy, out-of-state tuition and fees are waived for graduate students who serve as teaching assistants in the department. Research assistantships might also be available for qualified applicants depending upon the research needs of the faculty. These research assistantships allow students to participate in funded research projects in the field of atmospheric science. As is the case with teaching assistants, out-of-state tuition and fees are waived for graduate students who serve as research assistants in the department. Application Procedure We are always looking for enthusiastic students for our M.S. and Ph.D. programs! Please find details about the application process here.
