We must acknowledge the past to define what the present and what the future will tell us.” This was the advice of Dr. Jeffrey F. Hines, a 1986 graduate of the Warren Alpert Medical School, to the members of the medical school community gathered to commemorate a half century of Brown’s impact in medical education and research. Hines borrowed from Shakespeare's concept of "what's past is prologue" as he addressed hundreds of past and present students, faculty members and staff, as well as parents, friends and community partners.
