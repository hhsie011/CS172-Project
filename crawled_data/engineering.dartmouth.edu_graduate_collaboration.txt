Most research projects integrate one or more engineering disciplines with other sciences, and our human-centered approach encourages connection with service-oriented organizations to address critical local and global needs. Faculty and researchers across campus and around the world are making breakthroughs at the interfaces of traditional disciplines in both the sciences and the liberal arts. Involved students learn important lessons about the interconnectedness of the world and develop skills that make them both innovators and team leaders.
