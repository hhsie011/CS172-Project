We continue to be committed to protecting minors and ensuring university compliance with employment laws in the state of Pennsylvania. Pursuant to Pennsylvania Child Protective Services Law, Title 23 Pa. Cons. Stat. Chapter 63, (the “CPSL”), and Temple University policy, Background Checks for Employees Having Contact with Minors #04.61.14, individuals who have responsibility for the care, supervision, guidance or control of minors or routine interaction with minors are required to provide the university with comprehensive background checks prior to the commencement of service. The law excludes an employee of an institution of higher education whose direct contact with minors, in the course of employment, is limited to either prospective students visiting a campus operated by the institution of higher education, or matriculated students who are enrolled with the institution. Failure to comply with university policy may lead to suspension without pay or termination. Child Protective Services Law Background Checks In accordance with the child protective services law (CPSL), the following background checks will be conducted for all applicants and employees 14 years of age or older who, as a result of their current or prospective role within Temple, are responsible for the welfare of minors or have direct contact with them. Pennsylvania Criminal History Record submitted through the Pennsylvania State Police Pennsylvania Child Abuse History Certification submitted through the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services Federal Criminal History Record (fingerprint-based) submitted through the Pennsylvania State Police or its authorized agent Certification Provisions Child abuse certifications are a requirement for new and current employees and volunteers who will have direct contact with minors. A minor is an individual under the age of 18. Learn more about child abuse certification provisions. Dismissal: If the information obtained pursuant to the CPSL reveals that the applicant is disqualified from employment or approval, the applicant shall be immediately dismissed from employment or approval.
