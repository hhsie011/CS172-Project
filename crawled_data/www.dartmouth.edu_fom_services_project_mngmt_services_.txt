All of our projects are thoughtfully designed and constructed to support student living, academic learning, and world-class research. Each project is managed through the full life cycle of project delivery, from conceptual design through construction and building occupancy. Our team uses a world-class methodology that delivers facilities that enhance the campus and environment in a manner that is consistent with Dartmouth’s mission. Weekly updates on what to expect are provided for all active construction projects that are visible and important to the College and local community. Starting a Capital Project Dartmouth follows a standardized calendar and process to initiate and approve a capital project. Details on the following topics to start a capital project are available: Criteria to prioritize and approve capital projects Process to initiate and approval projects: the capital budget Developing project budgets and fundraising targets Campus Design Campus design principles have been developed to guide design professionals for new building and landscape projects. Capital Project Milestones Dartmouth Trustees have defined four capital project milestones that mark significant stages for each project whose cost exceeds $10M. Trustee approval is required at each of these milestones which are associated with specific funding targets and project phases. Projects Details on all major or highly visible capital projects are available. Projects in the Planning & Design phase Projects in the Construction phase Weekly Project Updates for projects in the construction phase Completed projects Capital Project Renewal Facilities Operations & Management (FO&M) regularly re-invests in Dartmouth's physical assets to maintain quality buildings and ensure major systems continue to function well. These "capital renewal” investments are made primarily in critical systems such as structure and building envelope (roofs, masonry, etc.), life safety systems (fire alarm and sprinkler), mechanical, electrical, and plumbing. An in-depth Facilities Condition Assessment is performed on all Dartmouth buildings every five (5) years. During this audit, all aspects of a building are carefully reviewed to assess their condition and remaining useful life. This data used to develop a Facilities Condition Index (FCI) which is then used by the Project Management Services team to help prioritize new projects. Capital Project Resources Dartmouth has a number of resources and standards for project managers and contractors who work on capital projects.
