Brenda Selman, an accomplished painter, returns to her alma mater for a Homecoming exhibit of her recent work. A student of the legendary Robert Sudlow, Brenda creates compelling oil landscapes from her childhood home in the Kansas Flint Hills to the mountains of California. Brenda’s show is all the more appropriate during Homecoming given her time as student in 1982-83 as SUA Gallery Chair for the very gallery in which she will be featured. In a newsletter comment from the period, Brenda indicates “To open the show, we gave away beer and big pretzels.” One of the show pieces will include her own “Sunflowers” landscape which was selected in a contest for art for the newly renovated Sunflower Atrium in the Kansas Union. One perverse element is her role as Registrar at KU’s nemesis—the University of Missouri-Columbia. She has atoned for this with her daughter’s graduation with a Master in Higher Education from KU. The exhibit will run from October 4 through October 22, 2021. Gallery is open 7 to 7 pm Monday through Friday. The Gallery reception will be held on October 16, 2021—11 am kick-off, 2pm to 4pm; all other game times, two hours before kick-off.
