At the conclusion of each academic term, all students with a deficient GPA will be reviewed. Depending on the severity of their case, and extenuating circumstances when relevant, the student will be placed into one of the following categories: Probation One – Students placed on Probation One are able to fully continue within their program, but must show consistent progress towards regaining good standing. Failure to show consistent academic progress, per terms set by the academic department, could result in the student being moved to another deficiency category. Probation Two – Students placed on Probation Two are able to fully continue within their academic program, but must meet additional probationary terms as well as showing consistent progress towards regaining good standing. These terms include full completion of the Academic Coaching and Success program, as well as remediation as deemed appropriate by the academic department. Failure to meet the full terms of probation and/or to show consistent academic progress, per terms set by the academic department, could result in the student being moved to another deficiency category. Departmental Suspension – Students placed on Departmental Suspension will not be able to continue within their academic program. Any classes that student has registered for will be dropped, and they will not be able to register for additional classes until they have successfully applied and been accepted into a new major. Admission to another major is not guaranteed. Campus Suspension – Students placed on Campus Suspension will not be able to continue at Texas A&M University at Galveston for a minimum of one (1) full semester. During that time, the student is required to develop an action plan addressing the specific issues causing their academic difficulty. After the semester suspension concludes, the student is eligible to reapply to the campus; readmission is not guaranteed. University Suspension – Students placed on University Suspension will not be able to continue at Texas A&M University for a minimum of 12 months. Following the completion of the 12-month suspension, the student may apply for readmission; readmission is not guaranteed.

Graduate Admission to Texas A&M University at Galveston For information or applications for graduate admission, please contact the Texas A&M University at Galveston Office of Graduate Studies at (409) 740-4704 or email gradstudies@tamug.edu. For additional details visit http://www.tamug.edu/grad. Tuition and Fees for Texas A&M University at Galveston On This Page One Time Only Fees Housing and Meal Plans Tuition and Fees: Texas Resident and Non-Texas Resident (Both undergraduate and graduate) Tuition and Fees: Texas A&M Maritime Academy Cadets Emergency Tuition and Fee Loans Returned Payments Fees Other Expenses Student Fiscal Appeals Scholarships Payment of Tuition and Fees Students must meet all financial obligations to the University by their due dates to avoid late penalties, regardless of timing of payment assistance (scholarships, loans, tuition assistance, etc.). Failure to pay amounts owed may result in cancellation of the student’s registration and their being barred from future enrollment and receiving official transcripts. Students who wish to pay fees in installments can select the option on the My Finances tab in the Howdy portal. Payments to Student Business Services may be in the form of cashier’s check, personal check, debit card or money order payable to Texas A&M University at Galveston (or TAMUG). All checks and money orders are accepted subject to final payment. Cash is not accepted at the Cashier’s booth. Visa, Discover, Mastercard and American Express credit cards and E-checks are accepted for tuition and fee payments over the website via the Howdy Portal/ My Finance Tab. Convenience fees of 2.25% will be charged for online credit card transactions. No tuition and fee statements will be mailed. Notices of amounts owed should be obtained through the Howdy Portal/ My Finance Tab. Students may choose to pay tuition and fees in installments. Students on the installment plan will receive notification through their University email account that the fee statement is available to view on line and when each installment payment is due and payable. In addition, students will be notified through this medium when any changes have occurred to their tuition and fee statement and if and when they have a refund available. All financial aid or loans must be accepted before being applied toward the student’s account. Late Payment Penalty There are severe penalties for failure to pay student account balances and installments by their specified due dates. If a payment is delinquent when a semester ends, the student will be blocked and may not receive credit for academic work performed. Students will not be readmitted to the University until all past due balances, including late charges, are paid. A late fee will be assessed for each payment not received on or before it is due. If a student is removed from the rolls of the University or is withdrawn for failure to pay amounts owed the University, a reinstatement fee of $200 will be assessed in addition to any other late fees or penalties already incurred and must be paid before the student will be reinstated. Current due dates can be found at the Student Business Services website, https://sbs.tamu.edu. Late Registration Fees Students who register on or after the first day of classes are assessed a late registration fee of $100. Students who register after the official census date (12th class day for fall and spring, 4th day for summer) are assessed a late registration fee of $200. Students who add classes after the official census date are assessed a late fee of $50. Note: Penalties, late registration and late add fees also apply to students who are required to re-enroll because their registrations were cancelled for nonpayment. Registrations are subject to cancellation and/or financial penalties if sufficient payment is not received before 5:00p.m. on the semester due date. Use of Collection agencies and Credit Bureau If amounts become past due, the University reserves the right to report the account to the Credit Bureau. This will also initiate internal collection efforts and could cause the University to employ an outside collection agency to collect the debt. If any collection efforts must be made, the student will be required to reimburse the University for the fees of any collection agency, which may be based on a percentage at a maximum of 30% of the debt, and all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees the University incurs in such collection efforts. Cancelling Registration Once students have registered for classes, they must select one course of action from the following to remain in good standing with the University: pay all amounts due by the specified due date. use online registration to drop all classes prior to the first day of classes. initiate the withdrawal process online in Howdy to begin the process to withdraw from the University after the first day of classes. Following this procedure is especially important for students who have been awarded scholarships or financial aid since the aid may automatically pay tuition and fees and cause the registration to be held even though the student has decided not to attend. Failure to request cancellation of an unwanted registration may result in grades of F or I in all courses for the semester. The student will be required to reimburse the University for scholarships and other financial aid applied to their account and will be held responsible for paying all fees for the semester, regardless of whether they attended classes. Cancellation for Nonpayment of Tuition and Fees The University reserves the right to cancel registrations not paid by their due date, or the official census date for a semester or summer term, to comply with state laws requiring payment of tuition and fees, to free the classroom spaces for other students, and to ensure the most efficient use of university resources. One Time Only Fees Housing Application (not refundable) $ 75.00 Freshman New Student Conference Fee (not refundable) $ 225.00 New Transfer Student Conference Fee (not refundable) $ 153.00 General Property Deposit (refundable) $ 100.00 Housing and Meal Plans With limited exception, all undergraduate students enrolled in more than nine credit hours are required to reside in campus housing (if available) and are required to purchase a meal plan. Information concerning a request to live off-campus can be obtained at http://www.tamug.edu/cll/PoliciesProcedures.html. Any student living off campus at the beginning of the semester who adds enough hours to require living on campus must pay for room and board for the entire semester. Residence hall fees are included in the fee schedules at http://www.tamug.edu/cll/HousingOptions.html#Pricing. In certain cases, single room housing is offered. The fee for that room is the normal rate plus 50%.

Supplementary Fee for Courses Attempted More than Twice Certain courses that are attempted by a student more than twice at a public institution of higher education in Texas may not be reported for state funding. As a result, the institution must either pass the non-funded portion to all students, or charge a supplementary fee to the student who is repeating the course. Texas A&M has chosen to assess a supplementary fee to those students repeating a course more than twice. A student attempting certain courses more than twice at Texas A&M University will be subject to a supplementary fee of $125 per semester credit hour ($375 for a 3 hour course) for the repeated course, in addition to tuition and required fees associated with the course. The general criteria for determining which courses are subject to the supplementary fee are: A course is subject to the fee if a student has completed it twice at Texas A&M University with a grade of A, B, C, D, F, F* (academic dishonesty), S (satisfactory), U (unsatisfactory), I (incomplete), Q or W (authorized drop after the add/drop period), X (no grade submitted), or NG (administrative no grade). Courses identified by the University as repeatable for credit are not subject to the fee. The Three Peat Exclusion attribute is displayed under course attributes in the Schedule of Classes for each course identified as repeatable for credit. Students will be notified at the time they register for a course that it has been taken twice at Texas A&M University and is subject to the supplementary fee. Testing Administrative Fee A $50 per test fee will be used to pay for personnel to proctor credit-by-exams and TSI tests and to pay shipping costs to send tests to testing centers. Texas A&M Maritime Academy Orientation Week Fee The Texas A&M Maritime Academy Orientation Week (O-Week) Fee is $43 and covers equipment and supplies needed during the Corps of Cadets O-Week. Meals for O-Week are a separate charge and will be added to the semester bill following O-Week. University Advancement Fee The variable University Advancement Fee is a required fee charged to all Texas A&M University students. The Advancement fee funds services such as advising, technology, library and administrative services such as ID services, utilities, access to discounted software and many services provided through Student Services.

Other Expenses Textbooks and Supplies: The cost of textbooks and supplies will vary with the quality of items purchased and with the course of study pursued. Students can expect to pay about $800 for each fall and spring semester. Expenses for the summer term should amount to approximately one-half of the above estimates. License Option Cadet Expenses: License-option Cadets must purchase uniforms with initial outfitting estimated at $1,500. Other items such as caps, belt buckles, and name tags may be required to be purchased from the TAMUG Bookstore.

The Maritime Academy educates and trains professional U.S. Coast Guard-credentialed mariners, Navy Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC), as well as Drill and Ceremony cadets who carry on the maritime and military traditions of our campus while they pursue other career goals serving the needs of the State, the Nation and the global marketplace. Admission to the Texas A&M Maritime Academy Applicants to the Texas A&M Maritime Academy (TAMMA) must apply to the university and to TAMMA. Admission to the TAMU Galveston Campus does not guarantee admission to the TAMMA. In addition to the common application, (Applytexas.org) prospective students must submit an application to the TAMMA to one of the three programs embedded into the Corps of Cadets. Each individual programs has additional admissions requirements. Refer to the License Option, NROTC, and Drill & Ceremony program requirements found om the TAMMA website [3]. Due to program and professional requirements established in Federal law (46 CFR Part 310) by the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) and the Maritime Administration (MARAD), the application for admission to TAMMA requires additional application elements detailed below. Evidence of the ability to meet the most current medical and physical standards established by USCG regulations. Applicants must apply to the USCG for a medical certificate. The medical and physical evaluation process includes a vision test, hearing test, general medical exam, and demonstration of physical ability [1]. License Option (LO) Cadets must demonstrate ability to meet USCG medical and physical standards within nine (9) months of enrollment. LO Cadets must continue to meet the USCG medical and physical standards throughout enrollment in an LO program. LO Cadets who fail to demonstrate ability to meet most current USCG medical and physical standards will be transferred out of the LO programs until the individual is able to meet the most current USCG medical and physical standards. Additional programs such as D&C and NROTC admission requirements can be found on the TAMMA website application page [3]. Evidence that the Cadet or Midshipman is not a user of dangerous drugs. According to Federal regulations [2], TAMMA maintains a program for testing individuals for evidence of dangerous drug use. During O-Week, TAMMA will test entering freshmen and Cadets transferring into TAMMA for evidence of the use of dangerous drugs. In addition, TAMMA conducts random tests throughout the academic year. Any Cadet who tests positive for the use of dangerous drugs or refuses to be tested will be immediately suspended from the Corps and all LO courses and activities for a period of at least one (1) calendar year, depending upon the outcome of a Return-to-Duty process prescribed and monitored by the USCG. There is no guarantee that a Cadet who is suspended will be permitted to re-enroll in a LO program. A criminal background check. Prospective Cadets may download a TAMMA application through the TAMMA website [3] for a complete detailed list of all admissions requirements. License Option Graduation Requirements TAMMA’s Cadets may receive diplomas from Texas A&M University only after 1) successfully completing the courses of study in their academic degree plans, 2) successfully completing required sea service 3) passing a comprehensive professional examination administered by the USCG, and 4) demonstrating knowledge, understanding, and proficiency competencies required by the International Convention on Standards for Training, Certification and Watchkeeping (STCW). The following degree plans offer a License Option: BS Marine Biology BS Marine Sciences BS Marine Engineering Technology BS Marine Transportation Any Graduate Program offered by TAMUG All students enrolled in the Marine Transportation program are required to be in the LO program. Cadets who select an LO degree plan must be motivated, honorable, and willing to experience the rigor and discipline of the regimental structure of the Corps of Cadets for the duration of their enrollment in the program. License Option Requirements In addition to the degree requirements contained in the Texas A&M at Galveston Students Rules and the University catalog, LO Cadets must complete the requirements to achieve a Merchant Mariner Credential (MMC)[4] issued by the USCG. The requirements for the MMC are determined by International conventions, Federal law and regulations, and policies established by the USCG and the Maritime Administration (MARAD). The requirements for an MMC are subject to change according to developments at the International Maritime Organization, Congressional action, the Federal rule-making process, and consultations between the USCG, MARAD, and the Maritime Academies. The international convention with the most direct impact on TAMMA and the requirements for an MMC is the International Convention on Standards for Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW Convention). The main purpose of the STCW Convention is to establish international agreement on training and education standards to promote safety of life and property at sea and the protection of the marine environment. The STCW Convention establishes endorsements that LO Cadets must achieve in order to graduate and serve aboard commercial vessels in international trade. “Deck Cadets” must achieve the STCW international endorsement as Officer In Charge of a Navigation Watch (OICNW). “Engine Cadets” must achieve the STCW international endorsement as Officer In Charge of an Engineering Watch (OICEW). LO Cadets must also pass each course required for the desired STCW Convention international endorsement with at least a C and demonstrate each of the required competencies contained in each course. Attendance in LO courses is mandatory. LO Cadets, regardless of age, prior experience as a mariner, or prior military service must maintain membership in the Corps and complete all of the requirements of the LO program. The minimum period of training is three (3) years or six (6) full semesters as a full-time student. All License Option Cadets and NROTC must participate in the Corps of Cadets until graduation. Applicants who desire to transfer into TAMMA from other State or Federal Maritime Academies are encouraged to inquire regarding current policy and provide documentation regarding prior coursework, sea service, and conduct records from other Academies. LO Cadets are required to attend all classes in each course required for the desired STCW Convention international endorsement. These courses are identified in the Texas A&M University Catalog. Unexcused absences are not permitted. All sea service must be achieved according to TAMMA’s USCG-approved License Option programs. Sea Service Requirements Under Federal law all LO Cadets are required to complete 360 days of sea service. Cadets may achieve the required sea service through a combination of TAMMA-approved assignments aboard training vessels, commercial ships, military vessels, USCG-approved courses that employ simulators, watches aboard TAMMA’s training vessel, and maintenance work. Cadets assigned to approved training vessels receive 1.5 days of sea service for each 1 day assigned. Cadets assigned to commercial or government vessels receive 1 day of sea service for each 1 day assigned. All assignments must be approved by the Superintendent or delegate. Corps of Cadets The Corps of Cadets (Corps) focuses on leadership development and provides Cadets and Midshipmen enrolled in the Navy Reserve Officer Training Corps program (NROTC) a disciplined environment designed to prepare its members to become successful Merchant Marine or military officers. Members of the Corps are required to attend formations, drills (including parades at College Station), stand announced and unannounced personnel and room inspections, participate in physical fitness activities, and perform other duties required by the Corps Operations Manual and Sea Term manual (LO cadets). TAMMA’s Superintendent is responsible for TAMMA’s administration and the operations of the Corps of Cadets. The Corps of Cadets includes 1) License Option Cadets (LO Cadets) who are studying and training to fulfill the professional requirements to become Merchant Marine Officers through TAMMA’s USCG-approved training program. These Cadets enroll in TAMMA’s License Option (LO) programs and must maintain membership in good standing in the Corps, 2) Midshipmen who meet the qualifications for acceptance into TAMUG’s NROTC program. Midshipmen seek commissions in the U.S. Navy upon graduation. Midshipmen integrate fully into the Corps, and must complete all degree requirements as well as courses required by the Navy. Students may join the NROTC program as National Four-Year Scholarship Winners or as non-subsidized college program applicants. Interested prospective Midshipmen may obtain information on the National Four-Year Scholarship program through any Navy recruiting office. The application deadline is January 15 of the year of admission. All NROTC scholarships cover the costs of tuition, fees, and uniforms. All scholarship- junior and senior-level Midshipmen receive a monthly allowance and are paid for summer training periods. 3) Drill and Ceremony (D&C) Cadets who desire the structure, rigor, leadership training, and camaraderie of membership in the Corps. D&C Cadets are full members of the Corps, must purchase all required uniforms, perform drills, stand formation, and participate in personal and room inspections. Drill and Ceremony cadets do not participate in summer sea term courses aboard the training ship. Each D&C Cadet will receive a certificate indicating voluntarily participation and membership in the TAMUG Corps of Cadets. Corps members are encouraged to participate in on-campus sports, clubs and educational activities and may compete for places on the Hearn Honor Guard, the Drill Team, the Sea Aggie Band, and the Flag Color Guard. Members of the Corps are generally required to live on campus in the state-of-the-art Texas A&M Maritime Academy Hall. Standards of Conduct In addition to the Texas A&M University at Galveston Student Rules and the Texas A&M University Rules the Corps operates according to rules and standards contained in the Corps Operations Manual and the Cadet Instructions Manual[5]. Among other things, these publications establish mandatory uniform regulations, standards of dress, grooming, and discipline. The Corps’ conduct and discipline system, administered by the Commandant, is a method for assessing the aptitude and motivation of each corps member for becoming a mariner or military officer. Corps members who violate the Corps’ standards of conduct receive demerits and Cadets that consistently violate the Corps’ standards of conduct may be suspended or dismissed from the Corps. Cadets enrolled in any of the LO programs must maintain membership in good standing in the Corps. LO Cadets who are dismissed or suspended from the Corps but who are permitted to remain at TAMUG may not enroll in LO courses and will be removed from the Corps housing. Cadets who are not Texas residents, will be required to pay to out-of-state tuition costs retroactively to the beginning of the term. The Corps includes a special unit called “Victor Company”. Victor Company is veterans of the U.S. Armed Services or individuals who are married and/or with dependents or over the age of 25 when first enrolled in TAMMA. The Victor Company Cadet Commander reports directly to the Commandant and Victor Company members follow all Corps regulations including watches and practical training aboard TAMMA’s training vessel. Cadets in Victor Company are permitted to live off campus. The Corps also includes International Cadets. With approval, international Cadets may pursue the LO education and training required to become Merchant Marine Officers and earn a degree from Texas A&M University. However, International Cadets are subject to U. S. immigration laws and may not take the USCG license exams. Instead, international Cadets receive a certificate of completion of their respective degree plans. TAMMA will provide each Cadet accepted into the Corps a list of required uniform items along with procedures for purchasing uniforms. Entering Cadets should order uniforms as soon as they learn they have been accepted into the Corps. TAMMA will issue uniforms during Orientation Week prior to the start of the Fall Semester. Orientation Week Prior to the beginning of the Fall semester, all freshman and transfer students entering TAMMA, NROTC, or D&C must attend Orientation Week (O-Week). Under the guidance of the Commandant, members of the Corps of Cadets’ leadership team plan and execute O-Week to introduce each new member to the Corps’ routines and traditions. Cadets also learn military bearing and customs, basic seamanship, engineering, and nautical science skills. O-Week training includes, military formations, marching to class and meals, team-building exercises, hands-on seamanship training, and other training to enable new members to hit the decks running when the entire Corps returns from training sea terms and/or assignments at sea. Student Incentive Program (SIP) LO Cadets may qualify for financial support through MARAD’s Student Incentive Program (SIP).[6] LO Cadets who receive financial support through SIP participate in the Navy Strategic Sealift Midshipman program (SSO) program and receive a commission as Ensign, USNR upon graduation and may apply for active duty service with the Navy following graduation. In order to qualify for the financial support under SIP, LO Cadets must: Pass a Navy physical examination and maintain Navy medical standards, Pass semi-annual Navy Physical Readiness Tests, Maintain a minimum GPA of 2.5 (4.0 system), Be under the age of 27 by graduation.

Counseling Services The Office of Student Counseling provides services to undergraduate and graduate students at Texas A&M University at Galveston. The Office is staffed by licensed counselors and the services rendered to students are free, voluntary, and confidential. The Office staff is dedicated to assisting students in their pursuit of personal and academic growth, to helping students gain a better understanding and appreciation of themselves, and to supporting students as they make important decisions about their lives. What is counseling? Counseling, most simply stated, is an interaction between a person who is struggling in some way and in need of help, and another person who is trained in helping people find solutions for their struggles. The reasons for coming are many, and the counseling strategies employed also vary from counselor to counselor. The one constant is that the counselor focuses all energies on trying to help the student. It doesn't always work, but our student evaluation forms suggest that most students who seek counseling believe that it has been helpful to them. And if you feel uncertain about whether counseling is for you, we encourage you to make an initial appointment and discuss any reservations you might have with one of our counselors. There is no obligation to continue. Course Support Course Support sessions aim to provide students with deeper understanding, extra practice at applied theory, and intellectual skill building. Peer Consultants guide learning in foundational courses such as Chemistry, Math, and Physics; as well as, discipline-specific courses including Accounting, Economics, Engineering, Marine Transportation, and Statistics. Course Consultants are successful students whom made an A in the course and are endorsed by faculty; they facilitate sessions in one-on-one and small group settings guiding students through homework problems and difficult course concepts using example problems. Groups of five to seven students work together in small blocks of time throughout the week. www.tamug.edu/tutoring Disability Services The Counseling, Career and Abilities Services office provides services to students with documented disabilities. The office offers information on disabilities, campus services, and related resources.

These guided group study sessions are taught by successful students whom made an A in the course and are endorsed by faculty. GGS leaders partner with faculty to design active learning sessions and prepare students for exams; these sessions are taught at three diverse times weekly for broad access to all students. Regular attendance throughout the semester helps students stay on track or get ahead, build confidence through critical thinking and problem solving, and meet other students and form study groups. http://www.tamug.edu/supplementalinstruction Health Services Texas A&M University at Galveston contracts health services for our enrolled undergraduate students with the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) Family Medicine clinic.

Scholarships & Financial Aid The mission of Scholarships & Financial Aid is to provide students with information and financial resources to attend Texas A&M University at Galveston as well as supporting programs that promote higher education and developmental opportunities. As a part of this promise, we strive to give financial solutions to students at all income levels and with different academic, merit, and leadership qualifications. Need-based financial aid is designed for students who have financial need, as defined by the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) or other applicable application. All financial aid is dependent on student enrollment and meeting Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP), as defined by Scholarships & Financial Aid or the specific aid program. Financial Aid Financial aid is available in two forms: Gift Aid and Self-Help Gift Aid Grants (Federal, State, Institutional) Scholarships Non-resident Tuition Waivers Self-Help Loans (Federal, State, Institutional, Alternative) Student Employment (Work Study, Part-time Employment, Internships, Assistantships) Texas A&M University’s packaging philosophy for need-based financial aid is to provide the greatest amount of gift aid to those students with the highest need and to keep loan debt to a minimum. Financial aid is awarded on a first-come, first-served basis with a priority date of January 15, prior to the fall semester for which the student is seeking aid. To apply for financial aid, a student must submit a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The FAFSA becomes available on October 1 each year for the next academic year. Students are encouraged to submit their FAFSA online at https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa by the state priority deadline of January 15.

Changes in Status that Impact Financial Assistance Dropping or Q-dropping a course affects a student’s enrollment status. In turn, enrollment status may impact certain funding sources. The following describes these impacts. Enrollment Status – A student’s enrollment status continues to be adjusted throughout the semester when a student drops or Q-drops a course. Please visit or speak with Scholarships & Financial Aid to determine if dropping a course will have an impact on your financial aid. Health Insurance – In the past, students often needed to maintain full-time enrollment to continue to be covered under their parents’ health insurance policy. With the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), that is no longer required. A dependent can now be covered under their parents’ insurance plan until the age of 26 regardless of their enrollment status as a student. Financial Aid and Scholarships – Scholarships & Financial Aid will check enrollment status on two occasions – when a student’s aid is released to their billing account and on 12th class day of a Fall or Spring semester. A student’s aid amount can be adjusted if the student’s enrollment status changes between the time funds are disbursed to the billing account and the 12th class day. However, after the 12th class day, enrollment status is not a factor for aid that has already disbursed and instead any changes in enrollment status will be reviewed through financial aid’s Satisfactory Academic Progress standards for subsequent semesters. If aid has not been disbursed prior to the 12th class day, then the enrollment status on the date the aid is disbursed is what matters. In the Summer semester, enrollment status is officially checked on the 5th class day of the Summer session(s) in which the student is enrolled. Student Loan Repayment – Students must maintain at least half-time enrollment throughout the semester for student loans to remain in an in-school deferred status. Dropping below half-time enrollment will trigger student loans to enter any applicable grace period, with repayment required after the grace period has elapsed. Changes in enrollment status from full-time to half-time have no consequence on student loans. Half-time enrollment for a graduate student is defined as 5 hours and for an undergraduate student it is defined at 6 hours. Student Activities It is easy to get involved at Texas A&M University at Galveston, and there are many good reasons to do so. As would be expected, student life at TAMUG is often centered around the ocean. Many clubs and sports often involve water, but we have numerous active student organizations including many professional organizations that cover a wide variety of interests. The only question is which organization, or organizations, are right for you? We follow Aggie traditions such as Yell Practice, Muster, Silver Taps, SALT Camp (Sea Aggies Learning Traditions), The Big Event and the famous Aggie Ring. Students may also get involved with the Student Government Association, the Nautilus (newspaper), or Sea Spray (literary magazine). As you can see, there are numerous opportunities to enrich your college career by practicing the six core values of Texas A&M University: Excellence, Integrity, Leadership, Loyalty, Respect, and Selfless Service. Student Affairs The Division of Student Affairs, Suite 101 in the Seibel Student Services Center, is responsible for the social, moral, and intellectual development of Texas A&M University Galveston Campus students through their involvement in student organizations, leadership activities, recreational sports, and other co-curricular and extracurricular activities. Student Affairs also oversees Campus Living and Learning (Housing, Community Standards, Campus CARE Team, Camps and Conferences, Healthy Relationship Programming), Student Intercultural Learning and Engagement (SILE, formerly Student Diversity Initiatives), Counseling and Career Services, Campus Recreation (Rec Center, Outdoor Programming, Wellness, Intramurals, and Club Sports programs), and the Office of Student Activities which advises student organizations about program planning, risk management and the function of organizations to students throughout their college career. Furthermore, Student Activities allocate funding for eligible student organizations and aid in campus wide events such as Aggie Muster, Maritime Ball, Family Weekend, Springfest and many other events. In addition to providing students an avenue to participate in several club activities, Student Affairs is also responsible for dispersing football tickets and ordering and dispersing the highly honored Aggie Ring. Through the use of JOURNEY, the program for curricular approach developed and implemented in the Spring-Fall of 2020, the Division of Student Affairs serves an integral role in the holistic educational experience enjoyed by the Aggies of the Galveston Campus. JOURNEY learning goals are four-fold: 1. Self-Discovery Becoming leaders of character requires Aggies to understand themselves before they understand others. Texas A&M students gather insight into their purpose and passion by developing their personal core values, articulating their identities to enrich experiences with others and describing ways in which they live their core values in daily activities. Aggies must also lead others to take action with integrity. Each student will be able to: Articulate who they are. Identify their purpose and passions. Describe their personal core values. Demonstrate character by acting with integrity 2. Lifelong Learning Curiosity fosters lifelong learning to unlock potential. Aggies commit to participating in learning opportunities that positively impact current and future communities and lead them to new growth. They not only embrace change to adapt to new environments, but produce innovative ideas that create positive change in their communities and help others understand the connection between learning and decision-making. Each student will be able to: Seek out new learning opportunities with curiosity. Adapt to change. Innovate to improve their communities. Apply learning to decision-making. 3. Cultural Competence Through learning of others’ culture, Aggies will contribute to a more just and equitable world. Understanding cultural perspectives is a critical skill to be successful and impactful in a global society. The student must then take action, and assume leadership, based on understanding of oppression and privilege. Each student will be able to: Articulate their own cultures and impact. Describe the value of other cultural perspectives. Discuss systems of oppression and privilege. Contribute toward a more just and equitable world. 4. Active Citizenship Active citizenship is a keystone of democracy. A student exhibiting active citizenship leads others to participate in opportunities for engagement in communities and acts of selfless service. Through an active and ongoing mentoring relationship, the student encourages others to engage in community. Each student will be able to: Identify opportunities for engagement in communities. Practice selfless service. Mentor others. Engage in local, national, and international communities.

Aggie Honor Code Integrity is a fundamental core value of Texas A&M University. Academic integrity requires a commitment by all faculty, students, and administrators to: Remain constantly focused on the quality of the academic programs; Achieve and maintain academic excellence in all courses and programs to assure the value of Texas A&M University degrees; Demand high academic standards from all members of the Aggie community. All Texas A&M University students, graduate and undergraduate, part-time or full-time, in residence or in distance education, are expected to follow the guiding rule of the Aggie Honor Code: “An Aggie does not lie, cheat or steal, or tolerate those who do.” Upon accepting admission to Texas A&M University or one of its branch campuses, a student immediately assumes a commitment to uphold the Honor Code, to accept responsibility for learning, and to follow the philosophy and rules of the Honor System. A student will be required to state his/her commitment on examinations, research papers, and other academic work. Ignorance of the rules does not exclude any member of the Texas A&M community from the requirements or the processes of the Honor System. The Honor System Office is charged with promotion of the honor code and administration of academic misconduct cases. The Honor Council, comprised of students and faculty from colleges and offices across the University, will investigate all such infractions of the honor code and recommend appropriate sanctions. The website, http://aggiehonor.tamu.edu, defines the types of infractions and the possible consequences. Students are urged to review this information. In addition to adherence to the Honor Code, a student (graduate students in particular) who is completing a thesis, record of study, dissertation, and publication may fall under the additional federal requirements promulgated by the Office of Research Integrity (Scientific Misconduct Regulations — 42 CFR part 50), as well as Texas A&M System Regulations and Texas A&M University Rules (Texas A&M System Regulations — Ethics in Research, Scholarship and Creative Work — 15.99.03, and Texas A&M University rules and standard administrative procedures — Responsible Conduct in Research and Scholarship — 15.99.03.M1, 15.99.03.

An individual wishing to pursue disciplinary remedies and criminal remedies simultaneously should make a report to both entities. For emergencies, call 9-1-1.

Amnesty for Students and Employees When a student or employee in good faith reports or assists in the investigation of a report of an incident of sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking, the University will not take disciplinary action against the student or employee for any violations of the University’s rules or Codes of Conduct which are reasonably related to the incident reported. The University may, however, investigate to determine whether a report of an incident of sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking was made in good faith. The amnesty will not apply to a student or employee who reports their own commission or complicity in the commission of sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking. Retaliation Students, faculty and staff are prohibited from retaliating against a person for (1) making a good faith report of a violation of Texas A&M System policies, university rules, student rules, and or/the law; or (2) participating in any proceeding related to the investigation or resolution of such report. Retaliation includes threatening, intimidating, harassing, coercing or any other conduct that would discourage a reasonable person from engaging in activity protected under this policy. Retaliation may be present even where there is a decision of “unsubstantiated,” “insufficient information to substantiate,” “not responsible” or “not guilty” on the allegations of discrimination, harassment, or related retaliation. Retaliation does not include good faith actions lawfully pursued in response to a report of discrimination, harassment, or related retaliation. Violation of an interim, remedial, or protective measure will be considered retaliation. False Complaints Any person who knowingly files a false complaint of discrimination, harassment, complicity or retaliation is subject to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal or separation from the University. A finding of "unsubstantiated" or “insufficient information to substantiate” does not imply that a complaint was false. Confidentiality The confidentiality of a complaint of sexual misconduct and all documents, correspondence, and information collected during an investigation will be maintained by the University on a need-to-know basis to the extent permitted by law.
