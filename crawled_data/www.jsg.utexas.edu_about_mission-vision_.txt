Combining innovative research with educational experiences, we work to train future generations of geoscience leaders. Vision The goals of the Jackson School of Geosciences are to: Address fundamental geosciences questions regarding Earth’s transitions over space and time. We will lead research in the areas of Earth science that directly relate to societal challenges of the 21st century, including water, energy, natural hazards, natural resources, climate, life, land use, and soils. Foster a diverse community of scholars that includes collaborative research groups that promote transformative research at the interfaces between traditional disciplines. We will develop new programs and capabilities by not only working between units within the JSG, but also collaborating with other schools and colleges at UT-Austin, as well as at the state, national, and international levels. Provide world-class education for students at all levels by involving them in research, offering comprehensive, innovative curricula and field and practical experiences, focusing on student learning outcomes, and preparing them for successful careers so they can create, innovate, and lead the geosciences into the future. Strategic Plan In 2018, the Jackson School successfully finished it’s latest 10-year strategic plan, “Earth Transitions in Space and Time.” The Strategic Plan identifies the vision, objectives, priority areas and roadmap for success of the school’s enterprises over the next 10 years. The plan: informs the school’s longterm funding priorities and infrastructure investments; guides engagement with federal and state agencies, industry, non-governmental organizations and philanthropists, as well as institutions based in other countries; influences new directions for improving education of JSG students; and helps faculty and research scientists organize into teams for major research initiatives. The plan covers the major aspects of research, education, broader impacts for equity and inclusiveness, and buildings and facilities.
