An undergraduate BS program in Fisheries and Wildlife Sciences offers excellent training in processes and strategies for the management and conservation of fish, wildlife, and marine species and their habitats. Students learn to think critically and evaluate problems using basic and applied science and fundamental ecological principles, and through consideration of social influences on conservation. The curriculum (180 credits) is composed of core courses as well as specialization courses. The core represents the educational foundation of fish and wildlife conservation and specialization courses provide students with an opportunity to build their curriculum to meet specific goals. Combined with required internships and a capstone course, Fisheries and Wildlife Sciences graduates will be well prepared to begin professional careers in fish and wildlife conservation, or to continue their education in graduate school. For further information about the Fisheries and Wildlife Sciences program, see the Fisheries and Wildlife website. Specializations Students develop a specialization plan in FW 307 in which they define career and life goals and develop a list of specialization courses to achieve those goals. Students who have completed lower division major course work and have at least junior standing may enroll in FW 307 . Specialization plans contain at least 24 credits: 20 credits must be upper division with four lower-division credits allowed. A maximum of two courses should be completed prior to approval of the specialization plan. Additional upper-division credits taken prior to approval of the specialization may be allowed through petition to advisor. Double counting (when credit is given twice for a course) is not permitted between the specialization and other university or departmental course work except in the following circumstances: The writing intensive courses (WIC) applied to specialization may double count with the OSU Baccalaureate Core WIC requirement; Students completing their first BS degree may apply 12 credits from a minor towards the specialization (requires approval by advisor in minor department and advisor); Post-baccalaureate students who are completing their second degree may use a maximum of 12 credits from their first degree towards their specialization (approved by advisor). Examples of specializations include forest wildlife management, stream ecology, marine fisheries, aquaculture, avian or mammal conservation and management, marine mammal conservation, fish and wildlife law enforcement, conservation education and extension, fisheries business, human dimensions of resource management, and conservation biology. Specializations may include OSU or Hatfield Marine Science Center courses or approved transfer courses, special field courses (when college credit is earned), or one or more terms of study abroad. A maximum of 12 credits in any combination of FW 401 and FW 410 can be used towards the specialization. Specialization guidelines are available on the Fisheries and Wildlife Department Curricula and Course Offerings page. Internships One of the best avenues to a permanent job in Fisheries and Wildlife is through employment and volunteer positions before graduation. Therefore, students are required to complete a minimum of two internships: one exploratory (1–2 credits) and one intensive (3–6 credits) internship. This requirement is listed as FW 410 under the Fisheries and Wildlife Core. Students are encouraged to start gaining professional experience by volunteering or interning with a natural resource organization as early as possible. For more information on the internship requirements see the Internship page on the Fisheries and Wildlife Department website. Major Code: 733 Understand the physical and ecological elements and processes sustaining ecosystems, and recognize the implications of altering those components. Apply conservation principles in developing conservation approaches for ecosystems or organisms within ecosystems. Incorporate social information in fisheries and wildlife management. Understand the biology, ecology, and evolution of at least one major vertebrate taxon, and explain how the structure, behavior, and physiology of animals in that taxon adapts them to their environment and influences their ecology. Interpret, represent, and present data in accordance with professional standards. Recognize biases and assumptions in published and unpublished scientific writing. Use logic, reasoning, analysis, and synthesis to arrive at defensible conclusions. Demonstrate the capacity to clearly and effectively express themselves in written communication. Demonstrate the capacity to clearly and effectively express themselves in oral presentations. Develop and learn about the importance of professional collegiality and team building. One course used to meet major requirements may be taken for a satisfactory/unsatisfactory (S/U) grade.
