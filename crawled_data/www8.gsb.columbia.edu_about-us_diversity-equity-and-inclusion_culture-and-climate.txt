We believe that the values of diversity, equity, and inclusion should be embedded into every facet of the of the Columbia Business School culture. The 2019-2020 DEI Standing Committee developed the Columbia Business School Values Statement to articulate our community’s commitment to these values: “To achieve our vision of developing innovative ideas and inspiring leaders that transform the world, Columbia Business School (CBS) is committed to the principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion. The faculty, staff, students, and other stakeholders of CBS strive to build and sustain a welcoming and intellectual community that values and respects individuals’ different and shared identities and perspectives, leading to a sense of belonging for all. Individuals’ identities can be based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, language, socioeconomic status, geographic origin, political ideology, and more. CBS proudly celebrates the diversity of its hometown, New York City, and promotes diversity, equity, and inclusion in the following ways: Actively seeking and including new members in our community who challenge conventional beliefs and propose and respectfully debate bold ideas Fostering an inclusive learning environment and curriculum for all students Continuously measuring our progress by eliciting meaningful feedback from our community Basing decisions about policies and initiatives on evidence and data We have a community-wide responsibility to uphold and defend our shared values and principles at CBS and beyond.” In Fall 2019, Columbia Business School introduced online diversity in the workplace training through Everfi for all faculty, staff, and doctoral students. We have and will continue to follow up on the themes of that module with events, workshops, and trainings for faculty and staff.
