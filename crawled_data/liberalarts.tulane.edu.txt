Matt Sakakeeny, Tulane School of Liberal Arts associate professor of music, is a conservatory-trained musician with a PhD in Ethnomusicology who studies the intersections of music, race and power. The return of festival season, our city‚Äôs soundtrack, and specifically New Orleans #brassbands provides an opportunity to reflect on its impact on local culture and what makes our music so unique. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs actually a phrase that people use to describe the uniqueness, which is called the New Orleans style. [The musicians] are playing a song, it has a melody, but they‚Äôre open within the kind of structures of that melody to add in something different every time. That‚Äôs what makes New Orleans really unique.‚Äù In honor of this quintessential #NOLA‚Äîone we‚Äôve waited so long to get back‚Äîcheck out Matt‚Äôs full interview and recent conversation with @tulaneu‚Äôs On Good Authority podcast. #NewOrleansBrassBands #NewOrleansMusic #NewOrleansLife Ethnomusicology #TulaneLiberalArts tulaneliberalarts Congratulations to Amalia Leguizam√≥n, Associate Professor of #Sociology, on winning the 2022 GDS #BookAward! Her book "Seeds of Power" explores environmental injustice in Argentina through an agricultural lens, helping us better understand the narratives of development and prosperity and those who are left behind.

Assistant Professor Mercein and Professor of Practice Thornton (both of @tulaneonstage) worked with Linguistics Visiting Assistant Professor of #AmericanSignLanguage Crochet and Mullenix to incorporate #ASL into the Spring 2022 mainstage production of #Antigone. Thank you to Dr. Anneliese Singh and the Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion for the support. As Crochet stated, ‚ÄúTheatre and #thearts hold value for all, and it is vital to afford the Deaf and Hard of Hearing community opportunities to share, learn, and enjoy theatrical experiences.‚Äù Added Thornton, ‚ÄúThe entire team of ASL interpreters brought a new level of theatricality to the world of the play, and more importantly, they played an important role in signaling to the cast and the audience our department‚Äôs commitment to fostering greater accessibility in our productions.‚Äù Full article available via April Arts link in bio! üì∏: Professor Crochet depicting King Creon üì∏: Student/interns Carson Koffler and Eliana Kaufman signing dialogue in pairs tulaneliberalarts #AprilArts Newsletter: An archival photograph of Lib Delery teaching golf during a physical education class at @TulaneU in the 1950s. This issue celebrated Elizabeth ‚ÄúLib‚Äù Brewer Delery, who was the first Chairperson of what is now @tulanedance, as well as #Tulane's former Director of Women‚Äôs Athletics and Chair of the Department of Physical Education. A mainstay of Lib‚Äôs legacy on our campus was her championing of curriculum that allowed students to minor‚Äîand later major‚Äîin #dance, reflected in the annual Elizabeth "Lib" Delery Award for Excellence in Dance. Thank you, Lib, for sharing your trailblazing accomplishments and lifelong passions with us.
