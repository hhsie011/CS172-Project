This mostly will affect students who will graduate at the end of the fall semester. If you fail to notify the financial aid office of your upcoming graduation prior to the disbursement of your loans, the financial aid office will receive an official graduation list from the registrar's office and your loans may be adjusted which could result in a bill with the university.
