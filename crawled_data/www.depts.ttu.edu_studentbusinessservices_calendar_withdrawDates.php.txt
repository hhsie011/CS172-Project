Current refund policies for students who withdraw or drop all courses during a term are determined by the Higher Education Title IV refund regulations. Federal Refund and Repayment calculations must be performed for students who receive Title IV (Pell, FSEOG, Direct Loans) funds and officially withdraw from all courses, drop out of all courses, are expelled, take an unapproved leave of absence, “unofficially withdraw” by ceasing attendance in all courses or fail to return from an approved leave of absence prior to the 60% date of the term. All "unearned aid" must be returned to the federal aid programs as determined by the Federal Refund and Repayment calculations. The requirements for Title IV program funds are separate from the university refund policy. As such, you are responsible for unpaid institutional charges remaining after the refund calculation. You are also responsible for charges/balances created by the required return of Title IV program funds to the originating federal aid program. If you have questions about your Title IV program funds, you can call the Federal Student Aid Information Center at 1-800-4-FEDAID(1-800-433-3243).TTY users may call 1-800-730-8913. Information is also available on Student Aid on the Web at www.studentaid.ed.gov.
