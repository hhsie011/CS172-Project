Our team offers workshops, tutorials, and consultations to increase awareness, proficiency and adoption of digital technologies that are essential to scholarly communication, publishing, research collaboration, data management, & bibliometrics. Our goal is to provide expert services and support to the Harvard community in efforts that foster participation in Open Science initiatives, and share Harvard's scholarly outputs and unique digital collections with researchers throughout the world. What is Digital Scholarship? You can think of digital scholarship as encompassing scholarly activities that make heavy use of digital tools in multiple realms and stages of the research process, including publishing, data management, teaching, pedagogy, and more. Our team is ready to collaborate you with finding innovative and creative ways to incorporate digital tools into your workflows, intentionally making your research open and accessible, and more effectively demonstrating the impact of your work. Our team is ready to help add your working papers, peer-reviewed manuscripts, and other scholarship into Harvard's open access repository DASH, as well as help facilitate the sharing of data and protocols using open repositories available to the Harvard community. Please contact us, and we can work with you to conduct your research with a variety of digital tools, and to share your scholarship widely and responsibly.
