YourSpace Performance, Spring ’19: Revival PreviousNext Beyond the Department of Theater Arts-related funding opportunities at Dartmouth (If you know of opportunities that are not listed here, please contact our Academic Assistant so that we can add it to this list!) We recommend that you share your proposal with a faculty member for feedback, since that can help to ensure your chances of success. Center for Professional Development: Student Experiential Learning Fund (up to $5000 for experiential learning/internships) Undergraduate Research Leave Term Grants (up to $5000 for independent projects) The Leslie Center for the Humanities Student Research Fellowships offer up to $1,000 for faculty-supervised research or creative projects in the humanities. Student Professional Development Fellowships offer up to $500 for participation in unpaid internships or attendance at scholarly meetings. Hopkins Center for the Arts The Robert Dance ’77 Initiative Fund The Robert Dance ’77 Fund enables talented Dartmouth undergraduates to undertake special projects in the arts. Preference is given to performing or visual arts projects that are “site specific works,” created for venues other than traditional galleries, theaters or auditoriums. Outdoor venues, residential spaces, and dining halls are among the sites which might be appropriate. The fund makes a total of up to $4,400 available to sponsor major student projects in the performing and visual arts. Undergraduate students and organizations are eligible to apply. The Lazarus Family Musical Theater Fund The Lazarus Family Musical Theater Fund supports student-initiated projects in musical theater, with a priority given to original work. Although projects need not be curricular to be considered, senior projects which bring together work in drama and music are particularly appropriate. In the absence of proposals featuring original music, lyrics and/or text by students, productions which are to be directed, choreographed and designed by students can also be considered. The fund provides a total of up to $1,900 to support student-initiated projects. The Class of 1961 Arts Initiative Fund Undergraduates are invited to apply for support of student enterprises in the arts. This award is funded by members of the Class of 1961 in order to enable talented Dartmouth undergraduates to undertake special projects in the arts. Particular interest will be given to those projects that “stand alone”—that is, projects that are not undertaken as senior fellowships or honors projects, or are affiliated with student organizations. The fund makes up to $1,500 available to sponsor student-initiated projects in the performing and visual arts. Application is open to single or group projects.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Theater Undergraduate Overview Equity and Inclusivity Peer Advisors and Student Representatives The Major Major Requirements Honors Thesis The Modified Major Modified Major Requirements Modifying another Major with Theater The Minor Minor Requirements Courses: offerings by term Course Descriptions Instructor Permission Courses Independent Study Off-Campus Exchange National Theater Institute For Prospective Students Onstage Overview Get Involved Performing and Auditions Directing and Designing Playwriting Stage Managing The Scene Shop The Costume Shop Now Onstage: Upcoming Productions Season Archives: Past Productions Production Photos About Student Productions Workshops and Full Productions Studio Lab: Exploring Theatrical Boundaries YourSpace: Performance Spaces for Creative Minds Student Work in the time of COVID About MainStage Productions Opportunities Overview Summer Theater Lab: Cultivating New Work VoxLab Frost and Dodd Play Festival New York Theatre Workshop Residency The VOICES Program Experiential Learning with Northern Stage Testimonials Student Funding Opportunities Kingsdale Fund Need-Based Funding Goldner Mini-Fellowship Other funding opportunities Funding for Graduate Studies Internships, Fellowships, and Graduate Programs The Neukom Institute Literary Arts Award in Playwriting Foreign Study News & Events All News and Events MainStage Production News Student Production News Honors Thesis Productions Summer Theater Lab News Faculty News Student News Visiting Artist News Alumni News People Faculty and Staff Visiting Artists Alumni Tell Us Your Story Theater and Performance Studies My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
