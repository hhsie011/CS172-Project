Best-kept-secret pizzerias. Broadway’s lights. Enviable internships. When you study at Barnard, everything New York City has to offer is at your fingertips. Why You’ll Love Your Metrocard Culture on Every Corner More than 8 million New Yorkers from every country on the planet call this city their own. You’ll hear 800 languages in Queens alone. Entertainment on a Dime Barnard students get discounted tickets to shows at many of NYC’s 148 Broadway and off-Broadway theaters. Fascinating Museums Baseball history, news media, skyscrapers, sex, the Cold War, tenement life — you name it, there’s a museum for it here. As a freshman, I took a full course load while appearing in two Broadway shows simultaneously. During my four years at Barnard, New York City was an extension of the classroom. I received my degree in 1988. After the ceremony, I scooted down on the subway in cap and gown and off to my matinee performance as Juliet in ‘Romeo and Juliet.’ Cynthia Nixon ’88 Barnard and NYC New York City’s perpetual energy and vast cultural diversity make it the world’s most exciting metropolis and the perfect home for students who are passionate, driven, and inspired. The Barnard community is woven into the City’s fabric, and before long, you’ll be a New Yorker, too. Living and Studying in New York City Academics NYC: A Class Act Barnard professors make New York City your classroom. You might conduct fieldwork along the Hudson River, go behind the scenes at the Metropolitan Museum, or work with archival materials at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. See NYC as Lab New York City by the numbers 430 + art galleries 550 + newspaper and magazine publishers 18,700 + restaurants There’s no place like New York City to start exploring your career. Whatever your interests, exciting opportunities await. Unparalleled Internship Opportunities Cinneah El-Amin ’16 “As an intern at BET, I worked in the office doing research, pitching ideas, and developing social media posts.” Adriana Moore ’15 “I interned at a women’s rights-based organization. I was able to apply what I was learning in the classroom to a professional setting.” Colette Juran ’20 “After receiving a Beyond Barnard summer internship grant, I interned at a literary agency in New York City, which was an incredible introduction into the world of publishing..." See Internships & Student Jobs I could spend 50 years at Barnard and still have more to explore. Nicki Camberg ’23 Across New York City I love being able to explore all corners of the City, thanks to the subway, while also having access to the beautiful nature of Morningside Heights. Sophie Baum ’22 One of my favorite things to do is to go out to the different restaurants, and because New York City is such a diverse place there’s a lot of cultural experience you can get from just tasting the food. Janice Fong ’17 Having the freedom to go anywhere, combined with the wide range of museums, food carts, parks, and experiences that exist in NYC, gives me the opportunity to expand my education beyond Barnard’s halls.
