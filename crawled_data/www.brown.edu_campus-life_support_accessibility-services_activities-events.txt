About: We typically have a group ranging anywhere from a 10-20 students who attend these sessions, undergraduate, graduate, and medical students. Students do not have to come every week; some attend when they need it, others come every week - whichever you feel comfortable with. Students bring up any ADHD relevant topics (medication, frustrations, study tips, relationships, school work, tips, tech suggestions, etc., ). For more information about this group, please feel free to check out About ADHD Support Group at Brown. In previous semesters, we organized the group by having students RSVP via email, and they would be added to the Google Calendar invite. Due to the increased volume of interest, we have streamlined the RSVP step. If you have additional questions, please feel free to email [email protected] .

About the film: In the early 1970s, teenagers with disabilities faced a future shaped by isolation, discrimination and institutionalization. Camp Jened, a ramshackle camp “for the handicapped” (a term no longer used) in the Catskills, exploded those confines. Jened was their freewheeling Utopia, a place with summertime sports, smoking and make-out sessions awaiting everyone, and campers experienced liberation and full inclusion as human beings. Their bonds endured as many migrated West to Berkeley, California — a hotbed of progressive activism where friends from Camp Jened realized that disruption, civil disobedience, and political participation could change the future for millions. ASL interpretation and live transcription will be provided for this event.
