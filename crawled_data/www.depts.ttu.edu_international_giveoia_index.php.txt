Acquiring a well-developed global perspective is one of the most valuable assets in today's complex and interconnected global marketplace. In the near future, if not already, virtually all occupations will be international in scope. Students with knowledge about and experience in other cultures and with people from around the world have a wide-ranging variety of career options available to them: international trade, banking and financial services; law; architecture and engineering; all levels of government; human services; health and environmental organizations and education; agriculture - to name but a few. Here at TTU's Office of International Affairs (OIA), we believe that all students should have access to the advantages that a global education confers. There are many ways to make a gift to OIA. Funds may be used for a variety of purposes including scholarships, support for international students, study abroad opportunities, and outreach initiatives. To be able to attract and retain the best minds of the world, we must have the resources to offer competitive financial packages. We must also have the ability to extend a helping hand if and when our international students experience unanticipated financial emergencies, especially if and when ther native lands are destabilized by health crises, natural disasters, waer or political unrest. There are also domestic students who hunger for an international experience -- yet lack the funds to allow them to pursue this life-altering opportunity. For these students, the possibility of studying abroad seems remote, even though the realities of the global marketplace make a study abroad experience vital to the future success of today's college graduates. Scholarships are crucial if we are to increase global literacy of our domestic and international student population through myriad of globally themed initiatives offered by TTU and OIA. Even though Texas Tech takes pride in its affordability, it is still a steep price to pay, for students from home and abroad, to receive a quality education. Please consider giving to the Office of International Affairs. Who knows? Your contribution could make it possible for a student to receive a first-class education and go on to become a teacher, a doctor, perhaps even a legislator or head-of-state. Your tax-deductible contribution is appreciated by all of us here at the Office of International Affairs as well as by all the students whose lives will be forever changed because of it.
