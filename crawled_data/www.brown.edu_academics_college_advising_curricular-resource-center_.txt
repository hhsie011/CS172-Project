Welcome to the CRC! The Curricular Resource Center for Peer Advising (CRC) is a community of advisors who helps students engage with the Open Curriculum and effectively utilize Brown's academic resources. Our collective goal is to help students feel a sense of agency in making decisions and see the realm of possibilities for their college experience. The CRC was established in 1976 to support the fullest use of the New Curriculum. The CRC Director, Assistant Director, Program Coordinators, student advisors, and volunteers facilitate information sessions, community-building events, and individual meetings for advising about navigating and accessing the Open Curriculum, finding and fostering academic communities, and seeing pathways for deep engagement with the learning process and high-impact learning opportunities. The CRC staff collaborates with various groups, centers, and educators to provide the best possible advice about the wealth of academic resources at Brown and beyond. The CRC is part of the division of The College.
