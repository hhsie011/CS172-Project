This is accomplished using a variety of optical imaging modalities, including laser point (LSCM) and field scanning confocal (CSU), Total Internal Reflectance Fluorescence (TIRF), Multi Photon (MP), and Widefield (WF). These technologies provide us with the highest light microscope resolution obtainable, giving the scientist a clearer picture of macro, cellular, and subcellular structure and function. We can image single or multiple labeled specimens, using magnifications from 4X to 150X with a temporal resolution up to 400 fps. Our laboratory has experience imaging in mammalian cells, yeast cells, Drosophila and Zebrafish embryos and ovaries, bacteria, sections of brain and other tissues, in both fixed and live specimens. Quantitative imaging methods such as FRAP, FLIP, and FRET are available. The laboratory also maintains several workstations with software packages for image processing, analysis, and 3D image reconstruction. To get an insight which of our microscopes can be used for which kind of sample, have a look at the modality tree here or use the modality selector below.
