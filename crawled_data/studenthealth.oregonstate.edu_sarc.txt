We provide information about survivors’ choices and their rights, referrals to other services, and support for their right to regain control over their lives. Any form of interpersonal violence, including sexual assault, dating or domestic violence, stalking, harassment, or bullying can have a profound and harmful impact. We are committed to listening, believing and supporting survivors and providing resources to aid in the healing process. We believe in the value of all persons and their right to make their own choices. Confidentiality Oregon law has granted confidentiality and privilege for any communications between a campus-based survivor advocate and a person seeking support as a result of interpersonal violence. SARC policy regarding confidentiality is reviewed during intake appointments for new clients and client information is not shared with anyone unless explicit permission from the client is obtained. For safe, confidential, free support and resources, please contact us for an appointment.
