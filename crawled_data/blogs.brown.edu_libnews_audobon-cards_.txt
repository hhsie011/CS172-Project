The front of each card features a masterful color portrait by Allan Brooks (1869–1946). The back contains the bird’s common name, as well as its description, classification, scientific name and migration range. Founded in 1905, the National Association of Audubon Societies for the Protection of Wild Birds and Animals eventually broadened its mission to include the conservation and restoration of natural ecosystems and habitats “for the benefit of humanity and the earth’s biological diversity.” A pamphlet accompanying each set of bird cards describes the organization and its work. Special Collections has myriad Audubon-related treasures, including Bird Cards sets one and two (1929), postcards (1959), limited edition prints published by the Rhode Island Hospital Trust National Bank (1986) and a double-elephant folio edition of John J. Audubon’s Birds of America (London, 1827–1838). Dates: June 1 – June 30, 2017 Time: John Hay Library Hours Location: Second Floor Landing Case, John Hay Library, 20 Prospect Street, Providence This entry was posted in Exhibits & Events, Exhibits & Events, General Interest, Hay, Special Collections by Jennifer Braga.
