Home Home Students Parents Faculty & Staff Alumni College of Engineering Industrial and Systems Engineering G6 Mechanical Engineering Building 206-543-1427 Website Faculty Website Industrial and systems engineering (ISE) prepares students for careers in an increasingly diverse, dynamic, and technological world. Industrial and systems engineers integrate a systems approach to design and engineering, by integrating people, materials, information, equipment and energy to design, implement, and improve systems. Industrial and systems engineering involves the study of engineering design, system integration, optimization, quality and reliability, supply chain management, virtual reality, and manufacturing. The most distinctive aspect of industrial engineering is the flexibility it offers. Industrial engineers have the opportunity to work in many different kinds of businesses and nonprofit organizations. Many industrial engineers eventually move into supervisory or management positions where they continue to draw on their technical background. Demand for industrial engineers has grown dramatically over the past two decades.
