Thousands of shattered limestone pieces came to light in 1974 in Mont'e Prama (western Sardinia) and have been reassembled into dozens of massive statues that reward close study by archaeologists, historians, conservators, and restorers. Now symbols of Sardinia's rich cultural history, these sculptures draw crowds to the museums in Sardinia. Their story can be explored through the six chapters and photo galleries of this exhibition: Introduction By Barbara Faedda, Executive Director, Italian Academy, Columbia University; Paolo Carta, Professor, University of Trento Rites of Initiation, War, and Death in Mont’e Prama By Raimondo Zucca, Professor, University of Sassari (Sardinia) Mont’e Prama Excavation, Research, and Restoration By Emerenziana Usai, Archaeologist, Superintendency of Archaeology, Fine Arts and Landscape for the Metropolitan City of Cagliari and Provinces of Oristano and South Sardinia (Sardinia) Landscapes of Mont’e Prama By Peter van Dommelen, Director, Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World, Brown University (Providence, R.I.); Alfonso Stiglitz, Former Director, Municipal Archaeological Museum, San Vero Milis (Sardinia) The Restoration and Conservation of the Giants of Mont’e Prama By Roberto Nardi, Director, Archaeological Conservation Center (Rome) The Illicit Trafficking of Sardinian Cultural Property By Giuditta Giardini, Consultant, Manhattan District Attorney’s Office (New York, N.Y.)
