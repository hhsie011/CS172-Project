The OIC reviews all sponsored research proposals to private industry, negotiates contract terms and conditions, and works with Clemson researchers and industry partners to ensure that agreements are in accord with university policies and procedures as well as federal regulations and requirements. The OIC is available to answer questions, review and negotiate contracts with private industry, and otherwise assist researchers in securing private funding support. To initiate a new project/matter, please complete and submit an Agreement Request Form. If you have any questions, please contact the OIC at cuic@clemson.edu or 864-656-3989. If you are submitting a sponsored research proposal to a company, rather than completing the Agreement Request Form, submit your proposal/budget through your college’s Office of Sponsored Programs Pre-Award Support Center (OSP-SC). That office will contact the OIC if needed.
