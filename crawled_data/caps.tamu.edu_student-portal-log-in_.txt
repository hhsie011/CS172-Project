Please note: In using the TAMU CAPS student portal, you are leaving the Texas A&M domain. Access the CAPS Student Portal During high-traffic points in the semester, CAPS switches to a single-session counseling format, primarily offering one-time, goal-focused sessions designed to address specific needs. Depending on the nature and outcome of these sessions, some limited options for follow-up may be available. Once final exams begin, our counselors are available for urgent, crisis-related services and will resume all services the first day of the following semester. Options for scheduling appointments will resume the week before classes begin. During the summer, Texas A&M students who are not currently enrolled in courses can still utilize CAPS services if they were enrolled in the Spring, are enrolled in the Fall, and pay a $25 bridge charge. If you meet this criteria, please fill out our Summer Services Request Form. Visit End of Semester Care/While You Wait for more information and to explore a variety of self-help opportunities provided by CAPS, including My SSP @ TAMU, a partnership with My Student Support Program offering short-term counseling in multiple languages, available 24/7 by phone or chat.
