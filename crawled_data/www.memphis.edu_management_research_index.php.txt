Our areas of research expertise include human resource management, organizational behavior, leadership, strategic management, entrepreneurship, international management, and organizational research methods. Below is an overview of our research programs along with examples of representative research articles that we have published in scholarly journals. Human Resource Management & Organizational Behavior Dr. Wendy Bedwell-Torres studies HR/OB topics related to various aspects of talent management, such as individual/team performance as well as training and development. Her research investigates factors (e.g., team composition, workload, strategic core) that influence team processes (i.e., cognitive, affective, and behavioral) and how those processes affect individual and team outcomes (e.g., satisfaction, efficacy, burnout, performance, etc.) as well as the factors and curriculum content that influence various training outcomes.
