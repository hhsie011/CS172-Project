Through this minor students undertake formal studies about public planning, thereby preparing themselves for contributions as informed citizens, civically engaged professionals, or ultimately as professional planners. In this 18 credit minor, the required courses provide common background in the basics of planning, including history, theory, comprehensive planning and its components, ethics and principles of planning practice with particular emphasis on citizen participation, and exposure to a range of analytical methods for understanding community planning issues. The four electives allow students to explore interests in different facets of city planning: land use; housing; economic development; transportation; sustainability and environmental planning. The minor provides students with the background and with stronger credentials to apply for graduate level work in planning. Requirements Students must earn a minimum grade of C- in courses satisfying minor requirements and must have a minimum 2.0 grade point average in the required 18 credits to earn the minor. A student may not double count any course for the Minor in City & Regional Planning toward any other major, minor, or certificate. At least half of the courses for the minor must be taken at Temple University. Courses for the minor must be completed prior to graduation.
