Using game-building technologies such as real-time rendering, it is possible to create responsive digital environments to enhance teaching, learning, and entertainment. Spatial and immersive technologies include head mounted displays, body-tracking cameras, holographic projectors and other controllers. VR makes the experience of using a computer more intuitive, rewarding, or immersive. Virtual reality can include: Video game applications and worlds Digital elements superimposed on physical environments to add additional detail, instructions, or context Prerecorded 360 degree video with added information or interactive elements 3D modeling of objects, environments, or art Software that utilizes body-tracking or other unique physical interactions for greater user control and comfort NC State University Libraries lends VR equipment and hosts spaces for utilizing such equipment for research, instruction, development, and recreation. How can I get started with VR? Take our online orientation (via REPORTER and Moodle). After you complete the orientation, come to VR Studio anytime we’re open to get a chance to use the equipment. Ask a friendly staff member for recommendations for what to try out first and how to use the equipment. What can I do at the VR Studio? At the VR Studio, you can...
