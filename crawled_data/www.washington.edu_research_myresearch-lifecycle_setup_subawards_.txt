Review information for setting up an incoming subaward. Outgoing Subawards You can request an outgoing subaward via SAGE once you have received your prime award and the associated UW budget number. Review subaward permissions and set up your SAGE ASTRA “Subaward Preparer” role. Learning Opportunities Gain practice using the self-directed subaward scenarios in the SAGE training site. Review the SAGE Subaward Quick Guide Register to attend a Subawards in SAGE or Subaward Fundamentals training course Create and Submit Requests in SAGE: Login to SAGE and select the “subawards” tab. Is this a new subaward? Use “create subaward” Is an existing subaward being amended? Use “create modification” Include Ariba Contract Request (CR) or Blanket Purchase Order (BPO) number Attach required documents Submit to the Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP) After your subaward has been fully executed and placed in “Active” status in SAGE, remember to submit Ariba CR/BPO for approval so your subrecipient can submit invoices. Required Documents NEW subaward requests must have: Letter of Intent (LOI) or subrecipient face page signed by authorizing official Subaward Scope of Work (SOW) that includes background info/objectives and a clear description of the work to be performed Detailed budget on prime sponsor budget form or spreadsheet, and Budget Justification that ties specifically to the budget line items. Modification requests must include backup documents for the requested changes. Examples: Is funding being added? Provide a detailed budget. Is the Scope of Work being changed? Provide a new Scope of Work. The subrecipient negotiated F&A rate agreement may also be required. Compliance Considerations When establishing subawards, there are many compliance areas to consider. For example, human subjects and animal use protocols must be in place for subrecipient entities to engage in these types of research. Review: Non-Financial Compliance Requirements GIM 7: Sponsored Program Subaward Administration GIM 8: Subrecipient Monitoring New BPO Requests with Carryforward When approving a Subaward BPO in Ariba, UW Procurement confirms the totals in Ariba match the subaward total in SAGE.
