The Program gives special emphasis to deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer to improve our capacities for cancer diagnosis, prognosis and treatment, as well as prevention. We also conduct research on other chronic diseases and on new methods in statistical genetics in collaboration with colleagues at the School of Public Health, Harvard Medical School, The Broad Institute, and elsewhere. The Program has several components: (1) High-Throughput Polymorphism Detection Core Facility (2) Biostatistical Analysis and Bioinformatics (3) Teaching and Research in Genetic Epidemiology and Statistical Genetics The Program collaborates broadly with colleagues in the Department of Epidemiology as well as other departments. 2016-2017 Academic Year Genetics and Genomics courses, 2016-2017 Open Postdoctoral Fellowship positions Click here for opportunities to join PGSG New Members Meet our newest group members!
