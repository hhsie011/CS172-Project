The 120-hour Bachelor of General Studies is a challenging and rewarding option for students who wish a greater degree of flexibility in their course of study. As an interdisciplinary degree, it is not based on a specific major or minor. Instead, the student's curriculum will consist of courses from three areas of study which must be selected from established minors recognized in the Texas Tech Catalog. Two of the three areas of study must be administered by the College of Arts & Sciences. A well-designed B.G.S. degree can help a student prepare to pursue a particular intellectual interest, a professional ambition, or graduate study. The three areas of study form a coherent specialization that is unavailable elsewhere in the university as an organized plan of study. Online options and satellite campuses in Hill Country, Waco, and McKinney are available for distance students.
