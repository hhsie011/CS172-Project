Please review the information below. To be eligible, a student must be awarded a competitive scholarship or fellowship, considering both in-state and out-of-state students equally. The award must come from Cockrell School or university resources, not an external source such as a student's high school or home country. Additional information is available on the university's Texas Residency webpage. Undergraduate Students Undergraduate students meeting the eligibility criteria rarely receive a tuition waiver. The Cockrell School receives a very small number of waivers for undergraduates. If you were not offered a tuition waiver in your scholarship award letter, then we will not be able to offer you a waiver now or in the future. There is no application process for waivers. Waivers are awarded automatically to eligible students with the highest academics. Graduate Students Graduate students meeting the eligibility requirements listed above may contact the graduate coordinator in their area. The graduate coordinator can advise whether a student will be nominated by the department for one of the limited waivers available. Receiving a qualifying fellowship does not automatically qualify graduate students for a non-resident tuition exemption. Privacy Policy | Web Accessibility Stay up to date with Cockrell School news!
