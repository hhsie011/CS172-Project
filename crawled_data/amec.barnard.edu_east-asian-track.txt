Students must have a 3.6 GPA in major. Decisions are made by June 1. All students accepted are required to enroll in the Senior Thesis Research Workshop (EAAS UN3999) for the senior fall term. Students who perform satisfactorily in the workshop, successfully complete a thesis proposal, and find a faculty advisor, will then write the Senior Thesis in the senior spring term under an adviser and a graduate student tutor (EAAS UN3901). Successful completion by the April 1 deadline will be necessary but not sufficient for a student to receive Departmental Honors.

Students should enroll in two semesters of independent study (Asian Studies BC 3999) with their faculty adviser.
