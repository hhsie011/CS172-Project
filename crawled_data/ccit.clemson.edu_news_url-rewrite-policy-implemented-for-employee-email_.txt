Proofpoint, already in place safeguarding Clemson employee email since 2015, will scan incoming email for malicious hyperlinks and for attachments containing malware. When you hover over a link in your email, it will be rewritten and begin with https://urldefense.proofpoint.com. When you click on the link, it will be scanned again and if safe, you will proceed as normal. If it is malicious, you will see a message indicating the website has been blocked by Proofpoint. An example of a rewritten URL in Microsoft Outlook: Messages containing known malicious URLs will be quarantined by Proofpoint and will not reach your inbox. Proofpoint will only scan incoming email from external senders, and emails from Clemson users will not contain rewritten URLs. If you have questions about this change, contact the CCIT Support Center by emailing ITHELP@clemson.edu, calling/texting (864) 656-3494, or beginning a chat at ccit.clemson.edu.
