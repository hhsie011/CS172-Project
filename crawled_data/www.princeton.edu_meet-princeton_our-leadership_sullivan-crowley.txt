Sullivan-Crowley Vice President for Human Resources Website Human Resources Phone 609-258-3300 Bio Lianne Sullivan-Crowley, vice president for human resources, arrived at Princeton in 2005 with more than 20 years of professional human resources experience in higher education, including having worked at Smith College and Harvard University. Sullivan-Crowley came to Princeton to help build a human resources function that emphasizes the "human" in human resources.
