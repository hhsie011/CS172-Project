Resilience, Relocation, and Climate Justice This is a virtual conference. The working agenda can be found here. Building on the success of the 2019 conference on Managed Retreat, the 2021 conference will address a range of scientific, social, policy and governance issues around managed retreat (also known as strategic realignment and planned relocation). The conference, a major initiative of the Columbia Climate School and the Earth Institute, will bring together stakeholders from the public, private and nonprofit sectors, together with academics, scientists, and community representatives, to help develop a common understanding of this complex issue, and move the needle toward equitable solutions. A major emphasis will be on issues of environmental justice, in recognition that the people most impacted by decisions around retreat have a key role in these conversations. Our goals are to: advance the research agenda around managed retreat in an interdisciplinary, solutions-oriented way; facilitate networking and discussion among many types of stakeholders, and bridge the information gap between academics, practitioners, and affected communities; and develop concrete solutions and best practices around a complex climate adaptation issue.
