Tyler Photography provides access to a wide range of faculty expertise, generously equipped photography studios and an interdisciplinary spirit, making it possible for all types of undergraduates to develop their skills as problem solvers and find pathways to meaningful expression and success. Whether students are interested in deep exploration of cutting-edge digital techniques, historic darkroom processes or incorporating methods from other artistic disciplines, Tyler's faculty offer personal guidance. Tyler BFA students can take advantage of the school's location at a large research university in Philadelphia, a vibrant art center with a pioneering photography tradition, to find internships and jobs, explore museums and galleries, launch creative practices, start businesses and earn placements in competitive graduate programs. Designed to complement the studio experience with tools to support a studio practice or pursue graduate studies, the Entrepreneurship coursework enhances students' career options. Graduates of this degree program will possess requisite business skills to support themselves as visual artists or entrepreneurs in art and related fields.

Please Note: An approved study abroad program waives the GenEd Global/World Society (GG) requirement; however, these credits must be made up with academic coursework taken outside of Tyler departments to be in compliance with BFA accreditation. BFA majors interested in studying abroad should consult with an academic advisor to determine if a semester (generally spring semester of second year) or a summer program would be the best option to remain on track for graduation.
