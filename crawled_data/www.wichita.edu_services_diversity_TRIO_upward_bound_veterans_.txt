Services Program Eligibility COVID-19 Office Policies About the Veterans Upward Bound Program Veterans Upward Bound (VUB) is an educational and skills program designed to meet the needs of today's veterans. VUB's goal is to prepare veterans for post-secondary education (i.e.-college, vo-tech schools, etc.), regardless of desired institution. VUB is a TRIO Program funded by the U.S. Department of Education and hosted by Wichita State University. We serve veterans in Sedgwick, Butler and Harvey counties. The best time to begin the program is at least one semester BEFORE enrolling in classes. Some veterans may need only a few of VUB's services, while others may want to participate in everything VUB has to offer. All services -- including academic/career counseling, workshops and instruction -- are free of charge.
