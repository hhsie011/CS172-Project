In 1829, Joseph M. Urquiola from Cuba became the first Latino to receive a degree from Penn and in 1836, Auxencio Maria Pena became the first student from Venezuela to graduate from the Medical School. In the early 1900s, Penn faculty members conducted groundbreaking archaeological research in the region, and by the middle of the century, the University had become home to the first center outside of Washington, D.C. to provide intensive training in Latin American languages and area studies. Today, Penn students have a wealth of opportunities to engage with Latin America & the Caribbean both in the region and on campus, and faculty from across multiple disciplines are collaborating to produce innovative research on this vitally important part of the world.

Her work includes mapping narratives and reactions to important current events in Brazil’s culture, society and politics online via social media platforms news forums and examining them against longstanding views and stereotypes in Brazilian culture. Better understanding of the manifestations of Brazil’s discriminatory discourse on digital platforms will help activists and policymakers in addressing the behavior. Updated November 2020 Mércia Santana Flannery Bio Research, Consulting Asylum from Central America Fernando Chang-Muy Law Engagement Type Research, Consulting Country in Focus Honduras Penn School Law Professor Chang-Muy, an expert in refugee law and policy, is responding to the call for legal assistance at the US-Mexico border, where tens of thousands of asylum-seekers await decisions on whether they may take refuge from violence and persecution in Central America. Professor Chang-Muy’s research into instances which legitimize claims for asylum, running the gamut from gang violence to femicide, aims to confirm the legitimacy of refugees’ claims: he leverages this work in his consulting support and training of government agencies as well as local and national philanthropic groups, and by serving as faculty advisor to student groups which focus on human rights and refugees. In the summer of 2019, he traveled with Adam Garnick (L'21) to provide Know Your Rights talks throughout Honduras. Updated November 2020 Fernando Chang-Muy Bio New York Times Op-Ed Research Study on Impact of Warning Posters for Sugary Drinks Laura Gibson & Christina Roberto Health Policy Engagement Type Research Country in Focus Guatemala Penn School Perelman School of Medicine In a study led jointly with Guatemala’s Universidad Rafael Landivar’s Joaquin Barnoya, Professors Roberto and Gibson, together with Professor Stephens-Shields are researching the impact of sugary drink warning posters on adolescent purchases in Guatemalan schools. Given that Guatemalan teens consume a high amount of sugary drinks, Professors Roberto and Gibson’s research will assist in curbing the obesity epidemic in Guatemala, and their findings may also assist other Latin American countries combatting similar obesity epidemics. In addition, their assessment of non-communicable disease research capacity at a Guatemalan hospital has identified gaps that leadership is now working to address. Updated November 2020 Laura Gibson & Christina Roberto Bios Research The Politics of Climate Change Daniel Aldana Cohen Sociology Engagement Type Research Country in Focus Brazil Penn School Arts & Sciences Daniel Aldana Cohen, Assistant Professor of Sociology in the School of Arts and Sciences works on the politics of climate change, investigating the intersections of climate change, political economy, inequalities of race and social class, and political projects of elites and social movements in global cities. His work on social equity and urban sustainability appeared in Nature in 2016. Daniel Aldana Cohen Bio Read More About Aldana Cohen's work in Nature Research Tihosuco Heritage Preservation and Community Development Richard Leventhal Anthropology Engagement Type Research Country in Focus Mexico Penn School Arts & Sciences The Tihosuco Heritage Preservation and Community Development Project, supported in part by the Global Engagement Fund, works with a Maya community in the Yucatan, Mexico on the development of a very different heritage story of their past. It is a story not about the ancient Maya pyramids and tourist sites, but rather a story tied to a massive rebellion against Mexico in the 19th century. The project’s focus has been defined by the local community and is tightly integrated with small-scale economic projects. This is a major shift in how archaeology is conducted and the connection of archaeological research, not just about the past, but for the creation of communities in the 21st century. Equally groundbreaking, the project follows a bottom-up model of heritage and economic development.

This work was initiated under the umbrella of the Genographic Project, a study launched in 2005 by the National Geographic Society that was designed to map historical human migration patterns through the analysis of genetic variation in populations from around the world.
