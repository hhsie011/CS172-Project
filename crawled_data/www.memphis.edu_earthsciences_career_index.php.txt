News and Colloquium Field Activities Contact Us Home Earth Sciences Career Path What You Can Do with a Degree in Earth Sciences The Earth Science major at University of Memphis offers three concentrations to help students tailor their studies to their career goals: Geography, Geology, Geoarchaeology. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that the job outlook for geoscience careers will grow 14% through 2026, twice as fast as the national average. The bureau suggests that this growth is due to “the need for energy, environmental protection, and responsible land and resource management.” Earth science is a good major for students who are motivated to understand Earth’s systems through scientific exploration. The American Geosciences Institute created a comprehensive tool kit for students to navigate the pathways for success in various industries and sectors. These pathways begin with tips and strategies as a student gains critical skills, experiences, and competencies, then transition into entry-level positions into the workforce and ultimately lead up to higher levels within the organization.
