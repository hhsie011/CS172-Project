Students usually focus on study, work, or volunteering abroad, and these experiences take a variety of forms and can incorporate a number of different activities. As a result, it's important that students take the proper steps to plan accordingly well in advance of their intended departure date. All students interested in an international experience should begin by exploring what opportunities already exist by attending a First Timer Info Session hosted by UC International. To prepare for any international opportunities, we suggest you visit the Study Abroad site for updated information. When interested in experiences abroad, UHP students are strongly encouraged to participate in UC-sponsored opportunities. We highly suggest you also review the University Travel Policies early in your planning process. Independent International Travel If you intend to propose an international honors experience independent of UC faculty or staff-led opportunities, official university student organizations, or partner organizations/exchanges, you must submit your self-designed honors experience proposal by the following deadlines: October 5: Winter break experiences January 5: Spring break experiences March 5: May/June experiences April 5: July/August experiences June 5: Fall experiences If you have any questions about whether you should submit a self-designed honors experience proposal, please check-in with your honors advisor. All independent, international honors experiences require a completed Worldwide Honors Experience application through UC International. UC International will verify successful completion of the application before an experience can be approved. The UC Student Travel Policy restricts UC-sponsored travel to countries (or areas of countries) that are under a U.S. Department of State Travel Advisory. Those who wish to visit a country (or an area of a country*) with a Level 3 or higher Travel Advisory Level must seek an exemption through International Travel Oversight Committee. Students traveling without a faculty or staff leader must individually request an exemption. Please note that it is extremely unlikely that an exemption would be approved. We cannot allow you to count this travel as an honors experience nor can we give you a grant without an approved exemption. *Some countries that are Level 1 or Level 2 have locations within them that are Level 3 or Level 4. Students who wish to visit any area that has a Level 3 or Level 4 Travel Advisory must seek an exemption to travel to that Level 3 or 4 area. Please note that it is extremely unlikely that an exemption would be approved. Please also note that international proposals may be denied based on the inclusion of high risk activities. For example, the UHP cannot approve proposals that include a student driving a car themselves while in another country. Some proposals, based on location or activity, may require further review and vetting through UC International or International SOS.
