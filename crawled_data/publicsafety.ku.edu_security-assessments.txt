A PSO security staff member will come to your office, building, etc., to conduct a site-specific security assessment for a nominal fee. A security assessment includes a tour of your area, during which time we will discuss your security concerns and provide preliminary recommendations on how to address those concerns. Contact PSO Security staff at 785-864-5900 or kupso@ku.edu if your unit is interested in a security assessment. All requests must have signed approval of the appropriate dean, director or department chair before the assessment is scheduled.
