To be admitted to Clemson for the subsequent fall semester, Bridge students are required to earn a minimum of 30 transferable credit hours and a 2.5 grade point average (GPA) during their freshman year at Tri-County. (Course credits and GPA must be earned at Tri-County after high school graduation.) Students who satisfy Bridge academic requirements will be admitted to Clemson for the subsequent fall semester without being required to resubmit a Clemson admission application. Students who do not satisfy the Bridge academic requirements will be encouraged to apply for admission to Clemson at a later date as a transfer applicant. While grades earned at Tri-County will not subsequently be included in a student's Clemson grade point ratio (GPR), the grades and credit hours a student earns at Tri-County will count toward determining the student's eligibility for the South Carolina LIFE scholarship. Community Living Community living is one of the most important experiences for a first-year college student. Bridge students live in four-person apartments on campus at Clemson in either Lightsey Bridge I, Lightsey Bridge II, Calhoun Courts or Thornhill Village. Upper-class resident assistants coordinate social and academic programs and are available to assist students throughout the year.
