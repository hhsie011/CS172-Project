To meet the needs of its rapidly growing programs, Brown is leasing 50,000 square feet for 15 years as part of a major development project by Wexford Science & Technology in Providence’s Jewelry District. Known as the Innovation Center, the new building will be 191,000 square feet, and Brown will occupy part of the 4th floor and all of the 5th floor. The building’s location at 225 Dyer Street is diagonally across from SPS’s current location at 200 Dyer Street. SPS’ growth and participation in the Wexford Innovation project fulfill goals set in Brown’s strategic plan, Building on Distinction. The new space will provide exemplary classroom and conference facilities, support and encourage the growing SPS staff, and facilitate advancement of digital teaching and learning for the University. The design imagines the classroom of the future as a catalyst for connection, creation and collaboration that will benefit students, faculty, Brown, and Providence.
