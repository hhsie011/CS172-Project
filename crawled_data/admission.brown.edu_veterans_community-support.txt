OMAS connects students to campus and community resources, as well as offering programming to assist students as they transition to Brown. The OMAS student lounge is also a popular spot to meet and unwind. Support from OMAS includes its Peer Advisors for Veteran Education, or PAVE, which connects incoming student veterans with those already on campus to help them navigate the challenges of college life. Many students also choose to join the Brown University Student Veterans Society, which raises awareness of veterans’ and military issues, participates in community service, and hosts campus events including the annual Veterans Day ceremony.
