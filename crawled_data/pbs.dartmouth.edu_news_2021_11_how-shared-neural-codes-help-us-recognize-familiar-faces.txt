But how individuals in social groups process this information in their brains has long been a question. Distinct information about familiar faces is stored in a neural code that is shared across brains, according to a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. “Within visual processing areas, we found that information about personally familiar and visually familiar faces is shared across the brains of people who have the same friends and acquaintances,” says first author Matteo Visconti di Oleggio Castello, Guarini ’18, a postdoctoral neuroscience scholar at the University of California, Berkeley, who conducted this research as a graduate student in psychological and brain sciences. “We were surprised to find that the shared information about personally familiar faces also extends to areas that are non-visual and important for social processing, suggesting that there is shared social information across brains.” Quote We were surprised to find that the shared information about personally familiar faces also extends to areas that are non-visual and important for social processing. Attribution Matteo Visconti di Oleggio Castello, Guarini ’18 For the study, the research team applied a method called hyperalignment to create a common representational space for understanding how brain activity is similar among participants. The team obtained fMRI data from 14 graduate students in the same PhD program in three sessions. In one session, participants watched parts of the film The Grand Budapest Hotel. This data was used to align to participants’ brain responses to a common representational space. In the other two fMRI sessions, participants were asked to look at faces of fellow graduate students with whom they were personally familiar and at faces of strangers with whom they were visually familiar, but about whom they had no other information. The researchers used machine learning classifiers to predict what face a participant was looking at based on the brain activity of the other participants. For visually familiar identities, participants only knew what the faces looked like. The results showed that the identity of visually familiar faces could be decoded with accuracy only in brain areas that are involved in visual processing of faces. On the other hand, the identity of personally familiar faces could be decoded with accuracy across participants in brain areas involved in visual processing and, surprisingly, also in areas involved in social cognition. These areas included the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, which is involved in processing other people’s intentions and traits; the precuneus, an area active when processing personally familiar faces; the insula, which is involved in emotional processing; and the temporal parietal junction, which plays an important role in social cognition and in representing the mental states of others—what’s known as the “theory of the mind.” This research builds on the team’s earlier work, which found that these theory-of-mind areas in the brain are activated when a person sees someone personally familiar. “This is what allows us to interact in the most appropriate way with someone who is familiar,” says senior author Maria (Ida) Gobbini, a research associate professor in the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience and associate professor in the department of experimental, diagnostic, and specialty medicine at the University of Bologna. For example, how you interact with a friend or family member may be quite different from the way you interact with a colleague or boss. “It would have been quite possible that everybody has their own private code for what people are like, but this is not the case,” says co-author James Haxby, professor of psychological and brain sciences. “Our research shows that processing familiar faces really has to do with general knowledge about people.” Related DepartmentClassicsRelated DepartmentFilm and Media Departments African and African American Studies Anthropology Art History Asian Societies, Cultures, and Languages Program Biological Sciences Chemistry Classics Cognitive Science Comparative Literature Computer Science Earth Sciences Economics Education Engineering Sciences English Environmental Studies Film and Media Studies French and Italian Geography German Studies Government History Humanities 1 & 2 Institute for Writing and Rhetoric Jewish Studies Latin American, Latino and Caribbean Studies Linguistics Mathematics Medieval and Renaissance Studies Music Native American Studies Philosophy Physics and Astronomy Psychological and Brain Sciences Religion Russian Sociology Spanish and Portuguese Studio Art Theater Women’s and Gender Studies Inclusivity “Dartmouth’s capacity to advance its dual mission of education and research depends upon the full diversity and inclusivity of this community…Diversity and inclusivity are necessary partners. Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences Undergraduate Overview Psychology Major Minor Major & Minor FAQs Honors Honors FAQs Neuroscience Major Minor Major & Minor FAQs Honors Honors FAQs Curriculum Transfer and AP Credit Courses and Syllabi Introductory Intermediate Topics Labs Independent Research Course Syllabi (ID login required) Permission Courses Request Form Fall 2022 Winter 2023 Spring 2023 Resources Graduate Graduate Program in Psychological and Brain Sciences Research Areas Coursework and Curriculum Mentoring Toolkit Resources Current Graduate Students Graduate Admissions Admissions FAQs Our Graduates Recent Dissertations Research Overview Recent Research Findings Facilities Undergraduate Research Post-Doctoral Fellows Post-Doctoral Opportunities Participate in Experiments 2021 Honors Student Thesis Presentations (ID Login Required) 2022 Honors Student Thesis Presentations (ID Login Required) Community Diversity Suggestions For Current PBS Community (ID Login Required) News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
