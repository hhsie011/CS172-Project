Strategy is defined by the question of 'Why are some companies successful while others fail?' The field builds on and integrates other functional areas to further our understanding of how firms gain and sustain a competitive advantage. Innovation, in turn, broadly includes value creating activities, such as those associated with the creation of new or improved ideas, products, processes, services, and organizational business models. Examples of topics of research interest and strength for our area at the intersection of strategy and innovation are technology-based entrepreneurship, R&D productivity, appropriability of returns from innovation, internal and external knowledge networks, intellectual human capital, and markets for technology.
