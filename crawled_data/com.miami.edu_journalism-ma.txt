Change the World. The program in Journalism includes coursework that prepares a student to be a writer and/or designer for print media and the internet. The program is an intensive combination of academic study and hands-on practice designed to develop competitive, high-level, cross-platform digital storytelling skills appropriate for today’s media landscape. Students take a common core of courses designed to provide a foundation in all aspects of contemporary journalism. Beyond that, students have the opportunity to focus their work in a particular area of study, including broadcast journalism, news and feature writing, and various aspects of multimedia journalism. Through a combination of journalism courses and related courses offered by other programs, students may also concentrate some of their work in particular areas of interest (e.g., sports reporting, journalism for social change or international journalism). The program begins in the fall semester and lasts for 18 months. No prior training or experience in journalism is required.
