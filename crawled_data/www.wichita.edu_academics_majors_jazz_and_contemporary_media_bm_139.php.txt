Admission requirements Inside the Program Playing the trumpet is easier with WSU invention David Hunsicker is not only a longtime musician. The associate professor of trumpet is also an inventor and business owner. Hunsicker partnered with WSU's National Institute for Aviation Research and WSU Ventures to create the Gapper, a flexible plastic device that allows musicians to control the third valve slide. Hunsicker says the ring on the third valve slide tends to too big for musicians with smaller hands. The gap between the finger and the ring causes a delay in moving the slide, which results in a missed note. The Gapper fixes that problem. “That's why we call it the Gapper. It fills the gap between the finger and the ring.” Curriculum The BM degree combines courses in performance, musical development and WSU's general education requirements.
