Education is a crucial factor in promoting development in Latin America, with direct impact internationally and in the Texas economy and educational system. Thriving economies depend on investments in human capital. A central element of human capital formation is educational quality and access. Baylor’s researchers will study educational environments and systems in order to improve outcomes and ultimately allow individuals to flourish in their societies. Primary and secondary schools across the country serve as loci of connection for government and NGOs devoted to health, economic development, and crisis intervention. Baylor will work to further investigate and address issues related to the rights of children and students, multicultural curriculum in schools, and English language acquisition in the Americas.
