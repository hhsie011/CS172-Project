Our Approach Being at the intersection of business and technology means we produce leaders who are uniquely qualified to impact an ever-evolving business climate on a global scale. Our approach is exceptionally relevant to business today—and that produces results. It begins with the way we think —using an analytical approach to solve business problems. Technology also serves as a filter for our curriculum, so that our graduates excel at global corporations and small start-ups alike, in any industry or organization. Many of our graduates are also immersed in a technical discipline. They get access to some of the preeminent academics in their field, backed up by an institution with a reputation for excellence in technology worldwide.
