Through our identity and cultural centers and groups, you can engage with individuals of similar background or connect with identities other than your own on topics ranging from academics and activism to arts and service. The resource centers, advising units, and affinity groups that comprise the Office of the Dean of Students focus on identity development, student support, and advocacy, and create opportunities for students to explore the intersectionality of identity development. As a unit in Student & Campus Life, the Office of the Dean of Students works to promote a cohesive campus community that brings people together across lines of difference and allows all students to benefit from the educational and cultural value of various identities.
