During the year, we hold game watches, social gatherings and volunteering opportunities and in a state dominated by "Maize and Blue" and "Green and White," we are happy to bring ORANGE into the mix. We are always looking for suggestions on events and other opportunities to engage the Syracuse University faithful in SE Michigan. If you have ideas/suggestions for an activity/event or want to get more involved with the club, please email us. GO ORANGE!
