Share thisFacebookTwitterEmail While Dartmouth’s winter carnival was first held in 1911, the craft of designing and building the snow sculptures began later but has been practiced for close to 100 years, starting in 1925. The 112th winter carnival celebrates the beauty of winter, the athleticism of our winter sports teams, and the fun to be had in the snow. This year’s sculpture, based on the theme: Mission: Winter Carnival—License to Chill, will be front and center on the Green. Here’s a look back at some of the sculptures from the past.
