Some positions use higher education data, some use general industry, and many use a combination of the two. GTHR, in consultation with Institute leadership, defines our peer group. Salary Structure Updates: GTHR reviews the structure annually based upon market trends, and adjusts it as need. How staff jobs are placed into salary grades: Jobs are placed into salary grades based on a blend of external salary survey information and internal job evaluations. Therefore, jobs with a similar value in the external marketplace and within the Institute are in the same salary grade. To accurately assess jobs, GTHR periodically reviews job descriptions and salary ranges to ensure competitiveness. How you can grow within the range: Your pay can grow with merit increases or through promotions and career change/advancement. Merit Increases: When available, merit increases are awarded in July and are based upon annual performance appraisal ratings (subject to availability of funding).
