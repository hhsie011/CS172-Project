My experience in the field began at NASA Dryden working with the US Air Force (USAF) on the first full version of the F-16 Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System (Auto GCAS), currently the highest level of autonomy on any production aircraft. Auto GCAS went on to win multiple awards, including the prestigious Collier Trophy, and save many lives and USAF F-16's. The development of Auto GCAS continued as we transitioned the technology to a diverse range of aircraft, including small unmanned and general aviation. From there, I expanded into autonomous recovery controllers for emergency landing, geo-fencing, and aircraft navigation. More recently, I have focused on higher level aspects of advancing autonomy, with major emphasis on regulation, acceptance, and the run-time assurance approach. Aircraft autonomy is my passion and I believe these systems hold the key to a revolution in personal transportation as the skies are opened up to the masses.
