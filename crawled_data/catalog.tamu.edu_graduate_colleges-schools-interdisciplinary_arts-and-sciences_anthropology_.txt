J. de Ruiter Director of Graduate Studies: L. Wright Director of Undergraduate Studies: A. Hopkins The Department of Anthropology offers programs of study and research leading to a PhD in Anthropology. Students admitted to the PhD program may elect to earn an MA en route to their terminal degree. Additionally, a MS in Maritime Archaeology and Conservation is offered as a separate track. Students enrolled within these programs receive training preparing them for professional research and/or teaching careers in academic institutions, governmental agencies, museums or private industry. The department has a well-rounded program in anthropology with offerings in archaeology, biological anthropology and cultural anthropology. The department is particularly noted for its strength and emphasis in the fields of nautical archaeology, the archaeology of the first Americans, archaeological conservation, palynology and paleoethnobotany, behavioral ecology, economic anthropology, globalization, biological anthropology, and zooarchaeology. Once admitted to the graduate program, students concentrate their academic and research efforts in one or more areas within the Department of Anthropology. The degree plan is prepared by the individual student with the assistance of a faculty advisory committee and the department's academic advisor, and the coursework is kept flexible (within the guidelines of graduate studies) in order to allow students to pursue their individual professional goals. In addition, whenever possible graduate students are encouraged to gain teaching and/or research experience as assistants within the department. Thirteen fully-equipped, modern laboratories help the Department of Anthropology carry out its primary function of teaching and providing research facilities for its staff, students and faculty. Two research centers provide opportunities for graduate students to participate in active research projects around the world. The Center for Maritime Archaeology and Conservation conducts underwater excavations around the world and conducts research in new conservation methods for waterlogged artifacts. The Center for the Study of the First Americans conducts excavations on the earliest sites in the Americas and their likely precursors in northeast Asia. The department is affiliated with the Institute of Nautical Archaeology which provides support for research projects involving nautical archaeology and maintains research and laboratory facilities in Bodrum, Turkey. The department also boasts a new ancient genetics laboratory, which opened in Fall 2016. Students also work in collaboration with other campus research centers including the stable isotope lab in Geology, the Center for Chemical Characterization in Chemistry (induced neutron activation analysis and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry with laser ablation), the Electron Microscopy Lab, the GIS and Remote Sensing Lab in Geography, and the Center for Heritage Conservation in Architecture.
