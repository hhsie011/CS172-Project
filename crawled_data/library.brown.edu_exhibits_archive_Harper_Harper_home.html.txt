Celebrating Harper John Forasté © Brown University An Exhibition In Honor of Michael S. Harper John D. Rockefeller Library Brown University Providence, Rhode Island July - August 1997 Hawthorne-Longfellow Library Bowdoin College Brunswick, Maine October 1996 Michael Harper is one of America's most celebrated poets, having received honors and appointments from artistic organizations and academic institutions across the country, ranging from National Book Award to a Guggenheim Fellowship. He is much sought after for poetic readings, guest lectureships, and visiting professorships, and served as the Poet Laureate of Rhode Island from 1988 to 1993, and as Kapstein Professor of English at Brown University. His poetry is highly influenced by the music he loves: jazz and blues sound through the lines and often appear as inspiration, metaphor or rhythm in individual poems. His poetry is filled with references to his past; history, experience, and family are strong inspirations which reverberate throughout his work. His ancestry, to which he refers frequently, is filled with fascinating and inspirational individuals. Paraphrasing Ralph Ellison, Harper once said: "Relatives are people that you are born into, and have no choice about them. Ancestors are people you choose." His ancestors live on and their voices can still be heard in the lines of his verse. Harper Exhibition Gallery Note on the Exhibition Michael S.
