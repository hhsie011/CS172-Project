The team assembles researchers from across Columbia and other universities who are committed to enacting thoughtful change together with professionals from government, foundations, business, civil society and local communities. Our work is both global and local, with particular emphasis on Harlem, home of Columbia’s Manhattanville campus and CWP. The research and engagement team is currently working on topic areas of enormous global consequence: democratic renewal; inclusive urbanism; and implementation and scaling. Within these topic areas, the team assembles working groups and initiatives (clusters of several working groups focused on a single theme within the broader topic area). Research and engagement initiatives and working groups turn cross-disciplinary solutions into action by issuing reports, developing learning materials for professionals, hosting public events and high-level discussions with decision makers, and building partnerships with organizations that drive change.
