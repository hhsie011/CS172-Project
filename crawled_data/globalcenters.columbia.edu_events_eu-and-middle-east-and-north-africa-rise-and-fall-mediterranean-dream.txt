8:00 PM Columbia Global Centers | Tunis This talk will examine what kind of role the EU is playing in the current turbulent MENA/Mediterranean scene and what is left of the EU’s influence in what appears to be a time of flux and crisis, both internally and externally, for this complex, hybrid and increasingly unconfident international actor. Answers to these question need to be put in historical perspective, starting from the ‘good old days’ when the EU seemed to have a distinct political vision for its southern outer periphery, and behaved as a major international actor there in terms of presence, opportunity and capability. The talk will trace the process of what one may call the rise and fall of the EU’s Mediterranean project, addressing the following stages: The ‘happy 1990s’ and the 1995 Euro-Mediterranean Partnership (EMP) as the golden age of liberal region-building in the Mediterranean The European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and the era of bilateral differentiation and competition starting from the mid-2000s The 2008 Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) and the era of functionalist/technocratic de-politicisation The 2011 Arab Uprisings and the era of EU frenzy, uncertainty and disorientation The 2016 EU Global Strategy and the era of EU self-absorption and realist restraint, or ‘principled pragmatism’ Short bio: Irene Fernández-Molina is lecturer in International Relations at the University of Exeter.
