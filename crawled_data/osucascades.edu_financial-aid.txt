Financial aid is money to help pay for school. It comes in the form of grants, scholarships, federal work-study, and federal loans. You can obtain financial aid from many sources, including federal and state governments, private organizations, and OSU-Cascades. Grants are often called “gift aid” because it does not need to be repaid unless, for example, you withdraw from school before finishing a term. Scholarships are money awarded to you based on academic or other achievements and do not have to be repaid as long as the scholarship requirements, if any, are met each term and/or academic year. Work-Study is a federal student aid program that allows you to earn money while you are enrolled in school. Earned work-study funds do not need to be repaid. Federal loans are borrowed money and must be repaid with interest.
