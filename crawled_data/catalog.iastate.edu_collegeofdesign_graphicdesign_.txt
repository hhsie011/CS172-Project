Information on the admission criteria is posted each year on the College of Design website. Graduate Programs The department offers the degrees of Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) in Graphic Design and Master of Arts (M.A.) in Experiential Graphic Design. Credit earned at Iowa State University or other institution for the Master of Arts degree may be applied toward the Master of Fine Arts degree at the discretion of the program of study committee. Applicants to the graduate program should have an undergraduate major in an art or design area and demonstrate the ability to do technically competent and original work through the presentation of a digital portfolio for faculty review. Past academic performance and the quality of studio work are critical in the admission process. A minimum 3.0 GPA in the student's undergraduate major is the standard for full admission to the graduate program. Admission is also determined by studio space available within the program area, which changes yearly due to graduate students' progress in their programs of study. Graduate students who have not completed an undergraduate program of study substantially equivalent to that required of undergraduates in the department can expect that additional supporting coursework, determined by the graduate faculty, may be required. Prospective students are advised to contact the graduate coordinator with specific questions about admission procedures and portfolio review. Application and additional program information may be obtained from the Department of Graphic Design, College of Design, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 50011-3092. Master of Fine Arts in Graphic Design (M.F.A.) The Master of Fine Arts in Graphic Design is recognized as the terminal degree in the field and requires a minimum of 60 credits. M.F.A. graduates in Graphic Design are skilled in communication design, problem solving, and are adept in the use of visual language, symbology, and interaction. Graduates are proficient in the design of communications and the use of technologies that incorporate human interaction with environments, objects, and electronic and traditional publications. Students and faculty work collaboratively on a required thesis; integrating theory, creation, research, and design problem solving. Master of Arts in Experiential Graphic Design (M.A.) This 30-credit degree focuses on preparing students for visual communication. This degree provides a comprehensive exposure to all aspects of user experience, including but not exclusive to wayfinding, exhibition design, interaction, information design, and placemaking. The MAXGD is for those seeking a graphic design specialization with little to no previous experience in the area. Students may use the degree as a complement to a bachelor's degree in graphic design or another design field to enhance their skills and qualifications for employment. It can also be used to complement those students with an undergraduate degree in a graphic design area that would like to add an additional graduate level study to their coursework prior to enter the field.
