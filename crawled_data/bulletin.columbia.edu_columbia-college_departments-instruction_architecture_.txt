Through the Architecture curriculum, students participate in the ongoing shaping of knowledge about the built environment and learn to see architecture as one among many forms of cultural production. At the same time, the major stresses the necessity of learning disciplinary-specific tools, methods, terms and critiques. Thus, work in the studio, lecture or seminar asks that students treat architecture as a form of research and speculation which complement the liberal arts mission of expansive thinking. Undergraduate Study in Architecture Studying Architecture at Barnard College, Columbia College, and General Studies leads to a liberal arts degree – a Bachelor of Arts with a major in Architecture, and Barnard College is the administrative location for all undergraduate architecture studies at Columbia University and its partner institutions. A liberal arts education in architecture holds a unique position in academia and in relation to the discipline. If the goal of a professional education in architecture is to enable students to participate directly in the world as an architect – a liberal arts education asks that students consider the broader and myriad conditions in which architecture is conceived and practiced and, in turn, to understand how architecture inevitably alters those conditions. Students are asked to confront and interpret the complex social, cultural, political, and environmental processes that weave through architectural design and urbanism. The purpose of an undergraduate liberal arts degree in architecture is to educate students to think about the world through architecture. The Architecture curriculum introduces design at a variety of scales, acknowledging that integrated design thinking is effective for problem solving at any scale and in any discipline. Students will experiment with full-scale installations and devices and make small-scale models of urban conditions from which they extract, interpret and invent new possibilities of inhabitation and use. The curriculum intentionally balances the traditions of handcrafted representation with evolving digital technologies of architectural design and communication. The Architecture major complements, and makes great use of its University setting. With access to superb libraries, research centers, graduate programs, and abundant intellectual resources, our students have the opportunity to follow their creative instincts to great depth and breadth – and they do. The major depends on New York City as more than a convenient site for many design and research projects and frames the City as one of the key social and architectural, and thus didactic, markers of Modernity. Architecture students study with peers from countries around the world in one of the most diverse cities in the world. A large majority of the Architecture students expand their education by interning in Architecture or a related field during their undergraduate studies. Alumni of the Department are leaders in architecture and design fields around the world. The faculty teaching in the undergraduate program are dedicated teachers who are also at the forefront of practice and research and are similarly drawn to New York City as a nexus of global design thinking. Students interested in obtaining a professional degree in Architecture continue on to graduate programs after their undergraduate degree, and students from the Barnard Columbia program have enjoyed enormous success in their admissions to the most competitive graduate programs in the country. Students who study Architecture as undergraduates have also pursued graduate degrees in a variety of disciplines including Urban Planning, Law, and Media and Communications. Student Learning Outcomes Students in the Architecture Majors who fully engage with the curriculum should be able to complete the following outcomes: Apply integrated design thinking to specific problems in and beyond the discipline; Visually communicate architectural concepts and research using discipline-specific techniques in multiple media; Verbally present independent, group or assigned research, in multiple media formats; Organize and concisely write in a variety of formats including reports, case studies, synthetic overviews, etc.; Understand and critically interpret major buildings and themes of Architectural history and theory; Be intellectually prepared for graduate studies in architecture and related disciplines. Departmental Honors Senior requirements (a portfolio and research paper from a previous architecture course) are used to award departmental honors. Students must have a grade point average of at least 3.6 in classes for the major. Normally no more than 10% of the graduating majors in the department each year receive departmental honors. Advising Appointments Current students as well as prospective students with questions about our courses and programs of study are encouraged to meet with our full-time faculty members. Faculty advising appointments are open to anyone who is interested in learning more about our department. During the summer break, all current and prospective students are instead invited to submit their questions by email to architecture@barnard.edu.

The required classes are broken down into four categories: studio, lectures seminars and workshops, senior courses, and the specialization: Course List Code Title Points Studio Courses Four studio courses, to be taken one per semester (studio courses have limited enrollment and priority is given to Architecture majors): ARCH UN2101 ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN: SYSTEMS AND MATERIALS ARCH UN2103 ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN: ENVIRONMENTS AND MEDIATIONS ARCH UN3201 ADVANCED ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN I ARCH UN3202 ADVANCED ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN II Lecture, Seminar, and Workshop Courses * Five courses following the distribution requirement below: ARCH UN3117 Modern Architecture in the World Architectural Elective: History Architectural Elective: Society, Environment, and the Global Architectural Elective: Design, Media, and Technology Architectural Elective Senior Courses * ARCH UN3901 SENIOR SEMINAR Elective Architecture seminar (another Senior Seminar in the Department, Advanced Architectural Research and Design, or Independent Research) Specialization Courses All majors are asked to complement their work with a thematic unit (three courses) called the "specialization." Each student develops a specific specialization that broadens their architectural studies in one of the following areas or combination of areas: History, Society, Environment, Global, Design, Media, and Technology. Courses may be taken from across various departments. All majors, in consultation with their advisers, will develop a short (100 word) description of their specialization and advisers will approve their course selections. Students can request and develop other areas of specialization with adviser approval. Graduation Requirements The major also requires that students submit a portfolio and a writing sample before graduation. The design portfolio includes representative work from all design studios and the writing sample is a paper or essay from a senior level architecture or architecture-related course. Final submissions are archived in the department, the portfolios are displayed at the end of the year show, and both are used to award graduation honors. * These are courses offered by the architecture department or other applicable departments offered within the University. Students should consult the program office for a list of applicable courses each semester. The Major in the History and Theory of Architecture The History and Theory of Architecture major stresses research and writing in Architectural History. This program of study is only open to Barnard College students; Columbia College and General Studies students that are interested in majoring in architectural history should contact the Department of Art History and Archaeology at Columbia University.

This architectural design studio explores material assemblies, techniques of fabrication, and systems of organization. These explorations will be understood as catalysts for architectural analysis and design experimentation. Both designed objects and the very act of making are always embedded within a culture, as they reflect changing material preferences, diverse approaches to durability and obsolescence, varied understandings of comfort, different concerns with economy and ecology. They depend on multiple resources and mobilize varied technological innovations. Consequently, we will consider that making always involves making a society, for it constitutes a response to its values and a position regarding its technical and material resources. Within this understanding, this studio will consider different cultures of making through a number of exercises rehearse design operations at different scales—from objects to infrastructures.

This course investigates the dramatic urban transformation that has taken place in mainland China over the last four decades. The speed and scale of this transformation have produced emergent new lifeways, settlement patterns, and land uses that increasingly blur the distinction between urban and rural areas. At the same time, Chinese society is still characterized by rigid, administrative divisions between the nation’s urban and rural sectors, with profound consequences for people’s lives and livelihoods. The course therefore examines the intersection between the rapid transformation of China’s built environment and the glacial transformation of its administrative categories. We will take an interdisciplinary approach to this investigation, using perspectives from architecture, history, geography, political science, anthropology, urban planning, and cultural studies, among other disciplines. The course is divided into two parts: Over the first five weeks, we will consider the historical context of China’s urbanization and its urban-rural relations, including the imperial, colonial, and socialist periods, as well as the current period of reform. In the remainder of the semester, we will turn our focus to contemporary processes of urbanization, with a particular emphasis on the complex interrelationship between urban and rural China. This portion of the semester is organized into three two-week units on land and planning, housing and demolition, and citizenship and personhood. ARCH UN3901 SENIOR SEMINAR. 4.00 points.

This seminar examines architecture and urban planning in North Africa from Napoleon’s invasion of Egypt in 1798, through the French conquest of Algeria in 1830, the establishment of French protectorates in Tunisia (1881) and Morocco (1912), and the Italian colonization of Libya (1911), to the period of decolonization and post-independence, concluding with present-day struggles over national identity and governance. This course will be paired with seminar taught by Mary McLeod at the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation at Columbia University. A central concern of the course will be the role of modernization in both colonial and postcolonial societies—a process, while integrally connected to European power, dominance, and violence, is often complex and ambiguous. In fact, modernization sometimes precedes European control as was the case in nineteenth-century Egypt, and, in other instance post-independence, it becomes a means to establish national identity and separation from European powers, as in the case of Egypt under Nasser or Algeria under Ben Bella or Boumediene (note, for example, the public commissions of the Brazilian modern architect Oskar Niemeyer in Algiers and Constantine, in which a modern architecture is seen as a distinct break with the Arabesque/ Neo-Mauresque forms of French colonialism). Nor should European influences in North Africa, however dominant and pervasive, be seen as only related to its political and economic control; multi-ethnic populations, trade and commerce, different places of architectural training, and cross-national infrastructures, such as railroad routes, all contributed and continue to contribute to making exchanges between European and Muslim culture diverse and multi-directional, if uneven in their power and influence. Among the many issues the course plans to address, as it considers connections between architecture and its political and social context, are: modernization under the Ottoman empire, differences among English, French, and Italian colonization, the role of the Catholic church in the destruction of Muslim religious structures and urban transformation, stylistic hybridity, association versus assimilation, Lyautey’s vision of cultural difference and urban segregation, colonial cities as “laboratories” of modernization, Mediterraneanism and visions of integration, debates about historic and urban preservation, modernism as form of national identity, and contemporary efforts to reclaim vernacular traditions ARCH GU4150 ARCHITECTURE AND MIGRATION IN NEW YORK. 4.00 points. This course explores the role that migrant communities have historically played in the construction of New York as well as the spatial negotiations, frictions, and conflicts derived from their settlement in the city. Architecture and urban strategies have historically participated in the definition of frameworks of belonging for migrant communities. However, they have also been used as tools for the exclusion of minority communities, as an alibi in xenophobic arguments, and as mediators of assimilationist policies. We will discuss the manifold relations of architecture and migration. Migrant individuals and communities are responsible for the design, transformation, and resignification of different structures and enclaves. We will regard both the spatial, material, and aesthetic properties of these transformations as well as the social and cultural struggles, exchanges, and dislocations that they mediate. We will also discuss the inextricable connection between New York City and migration. The city historically served as the major port of entry for migrants into the US and continues to be a major attractor for transient populations. We will regard New York simultaneously as a city characterized by its ethnic diversity, and one in which immigrants continue to struggle to secure housing, assert their presence in public space, guarantee their access to resources, and defend their rights Spring 2022 Courses The course schedule listed below may be subject to change.

Prerequisites: Designed for but not limited to sophomores; enrollment beyond 60 at the discretion of the instructor. How has architecture been “modern”? This course will introduce students to things, practices, figures, and ideas behind this contentious and contradictory concept, emerging in multiple locations around the world. Students in this course will learn about architecture as it was practiced, taught, thought, and experienced across landscapes of social and cultural difference during the past two centuries. Learning about the past through historical consciousness around architecture and investigating the history of architecture as a discursive field are fundamental to liberal arts thinking generally, and important for students in architecture, the history and theory of architecture, art history, and urban studies.Students in this course will be introduced to: Architecture as enmeshed with other forms of cultural production Culturally-specific intellectual and public debates around the architectural and urban Makers, thinkers, and organizers of the designed or built environment Geographies, territories, and mobilities associated with architecture as an end or means for material extraction, refinement, trade, labor, and construction Sites, institutions, media, events, and practices which have come to hold meaning Modernity, modernism, and modernization in relation to each other, as social, cultural, and technological drivers holding stakes for past events as well their histories. In this course, we will ask questions about ideas and practices within disparate socially-and culturally-constructed worlds, and across other asymmetries. For example, can we draw a coherent historical thread through Lisbon in 1755, Bombay in 1854, Moscow in 1917, the moon in 1969, and al-Za’atari refugee camp in 2016? Are such narratives of coherence themselves the trace of the modernist impulse in architectural history? In this course, we will study modern architecture’s references to an art of building as well the metaphors it gives rise to. Embedded in this examination are social and cultural questions of who made and thought modern architecture, and aesthetic and historical questions around the figure of the architect.

We will focus on two catastrophic events and sites: Greenpoint Oil Spill (1978), Newtown Creek; and Hurricane Sandy (2012), Lower Manhattan; and examine related toxic histories, environmental damage, impacted communities, clean-up and protection efforts and planning and design possibilities. Resourcing historical maps, on-site documentation and future design proposals, the class will explore environmental crises and their impact on the built environment and on the social, cultural and political life of the city. Students will conduct research at The Map Division of the New York Public Library, meet with environmental and design experts, and visit sites in Brooklyn and Manhattan. Based on this research, students will use digital mapping techniques, 360 video, VR (virtual reality) and AR (augmented reality) technologies to create compelling experiential, spatial, analytical, critical, and reflective reconstructions of catastrophic events and remediation. Course readings further examine environmental issues and climate change from four unique perspectives: mapping and urban/ecological histories; design research reports; global and planetary views; and graphic, audio-visual imaginaries.

Urbanization is inherently unequal, inscribing social, economic, environmental, and political unevenness into the spatial fabric of the city. But the distribution of such inequality is not inevitable. Urbanization is a product of the collective decisions we make (or choose not to make) in response to the shared challenges we face in our cities. And, thus, the patterns of urbanization can be changed. This is the task of urban planning and the starting point for this advanced seminar, which asks how we can reshape our cities to be more just—to alleviate inequality rather than compound it. In embarking on this effort, we face numerous “wicked” problems without clear-cut solutions. The approaches one takes in addressing urban inequality are therefore fundamentally normative—they are shaped by one’s place in the world and one’s view of it. The central challenge in addressing inequality is thus establishing a basis for collective action amongst diverse actors with differing—and sometimes conflicting—values and views. In other words, planning the just city a matter of both empathy and debate. In this course, we will endeavor to develop informed positions that can help us engage with others as a basis for taking collective action. The course is organized into four 3-week modules, each of which addresses a dimension of the just city: equity, democracy, diversity, and sustainability. In the first week of each module, we will discuss how the issue has been understood in history and theory (with an emphasis on tradeoffs between different priorities and values); in the second week, we will apply this discussion to a global case study prepared and presented by a team of students; and in the third week, we will hold an in-class debate to determine what should be done.
