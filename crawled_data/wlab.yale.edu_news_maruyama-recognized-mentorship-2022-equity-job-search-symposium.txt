This year’s theme was “Mastering Inclusive Mentoring to Catapult Your Career”. As part of the symposium, twelve faculty from Yale and other institutions were recognized for their mentorship, including Reina Maruyama, professor of physics and of astronomy and a member of Yale’s Wright Lab. The symposium website posted this comment about Maruyama’s mentorship: ”Dr. Maruyama has been very supportive during my appointment as a postdoctoral researcher in her group. She has been essential in promoting diversity in the physics department, particularly at Yale’s Wright Lab, and this can be seen in the members group. For her minoritized mentees, Dr. Maruyama has been a great mentor helping them develop their skills as PhD students and postdocs as well as navigating the intricacies of academia and how to prepare for the academic job market. Her mentorship has helped her mentees, other students, and postdoctoral researchers in her group, grow professionally.” External link: https://equityinthejobsearch.sites.yale.edu/past-ejs-symposia/2022-ejs-symposium Archives April 2022 (9) March 2022 (7) February 2022 (7) January 2022 (1) December 2021 (3) November 2021 (8) October 2021 (9) September 2021 (1) August 2021 (6) July 2021 (3) June 2021 (3) May 2021 (6) 1 2 3 4 5 next › last » Yale Accessibility at Yale · Privacy policy Copyright © 2022 Yale University · All rights reserved Wright Lab Internal Pages | Suggestion Form Facebook Twitter Instagram YouTube Flickr
