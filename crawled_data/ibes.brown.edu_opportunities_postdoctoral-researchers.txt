The scientist will join a growing cohort of polar oceanographers and polar-focused scientists at the Institute at Brown for Environment and Society. They will focus on understanding ocean and wave-driven mixing under sea ice - specifically coupling and running an ocean general circulation model (e.g., MITgcm/ROMS/MOM) with new discrete and continuum sea ice models. IBES Faculty and Postdoc Travel Awards Application Deadline : October 15, 2019 This opportunity is currently on hold, due to COVID-19 travel restrictions. IBES competitively awards travel grants of up to $2,000 to IBES faculty fellows and to postdocs whose primary mentor is an IBES fellow.
