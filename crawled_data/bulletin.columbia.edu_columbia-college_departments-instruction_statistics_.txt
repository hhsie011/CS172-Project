Students interested in statistical concepts, who plan on consuming, but not creating statistics, should take STAT UN1001 INTRO TO STATISTICAL REASONING. The course is designed for students who have taken a pre-calculus course, and the focus is on general principles. It is suitable for students seeking to satisfy the Barnard quantitative reasoning requirements. Students seeking an introduction to applied statistics should take STAT UN1101 Introduction to Statistics. The course is designed for students who have some mathematical maturity, but who may not have taken a course in calculus, and the focus is on the elements of data analysis. It is recommended for pre-med students, and students contemplating the concentration in statistics. Students seeking a foundation for further study of probability theory and statistical theory and methods should take STAT UN1201 Calculus-Based Introduction to Statistics. The course is designed for students who have taken a semester of college calculus or the equivalent, and the focus is on preparation for a mathematical study of probability and statistics. It is recommended for students seeking to complete the prerequisite for econometrics, and for students contemplating the major in statistics. Students seeking a one-semester calculus-based survey of probability theory and statistical theory and methods should take STAT GU4001 INTRODUCTION TO PROBABILITY AND STATISTICS. This course is designed for students who have taken calculus, and is meant as a terminal course. It provides a somewhat abridged version of the more demanding sequence STAT GU4203 PROBABILITY THEORY and STAT GU4204 Statistical Inference. While some mathematically mature students take the more demanding sequence as an introduction to the field, it is generally recommended that students prepare for the sequence by taking STAT UN1201 Calculus-Based Introduction to Statistics. The Department offers the Major in Statistics, the Concentration in Statistics, and interdisciplinary majors with Computer Science, Economics, Mathematics, and Political Science. The concentration is suitable for students preparing for work or study where substantial skills in data analysis are valued and may be taken without mathematical prerequisites. The concentration consists of a sequence of six courses in applied statistics, but students may substitute statistics electives numbered 4203 or above with permission of the concentration advisors. The major consists of mathematical and computational prerequisites, an introductory course, and five core courses in probability theory and theoretical and applied statistics together with three electives. The training in the undergraduate major is comparable to a masters degree in statistics. Students may wish to consult the following guidelines when undertaking course planning. It is advisable to take STAT UN1101 Introduction to Statistics and STAT UN2102 Applied Statistical Computing before taking any of the more advanced concentration courses, STAT UN2103 APPLIED LINEAR REG ANALYSIS, STAT UN2104 Applied Categorical Data Analysis, STAT UN3105 Applied Statistical Methods, and STAT UN3106 APPLIED MACHINE LEARNING. It is advisable to take STAT UN1201 Calculus-Based Introduction to Statistics, STAT GU4203 PROBABILITY THEORY, STAT GU4204 Statistical Inference, and STAT GU4205 Linear Regression Models in sequence. Courses in stochastic analysis should be preceded by STAT GU4203 PROBABILITY THEORY, and for many students, it is advisable to take STAT GU4207 Elementary Stochastic Processes before embarking on STAT GU4262 Stochastic Processes for Finance, STAT GU4264 STOCHASTC PROCSSES-APPLIC, or STAT GU4265 Stochastic Methods in Finance. Most of the statistics courses numbered from 4221 to 4234 are best preceded by STAT GU4205 Linear Regression Models. The data science courses STAT GU4206 Statistical Computing and Introduction to Data Science, STAT GU4241 Statistical Machine Learning, and STAT GU4242 Advanced Machine Learning should be taken in sequence. Advanced Placement The Department offers three points of advanced credit for a score of 5 on the AP statistics exam. Students who are required to take an introductory statistics course for their major should check with their major advisor to determine whether this credit provides exemption from their requirement. Departmental Honors Students are considered for department honors on the basis of GPA and the comprehensiveness and difficulty of their course work in the Department. The Department is generally permitted to nominate one tenth of graduating students for departmental honors. Undergraduate Research in Statistics and the Summer Internship Matriculated students who will be undergraduates at Columbia College, Barnard College, the School of General Studies, or the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences may apply to the Department's summer internship program. The internship provides summer housing and a stipend. Students work with Statistics Department faculty mentors. Applicants should send a brief statement of interest and a copy of their transcript to Ms. Dood Kalicharan in the Statistics Department office by the end of March to be considered. If summer project descriptions are posted on the Department's website, please indicate in the statement of interest which project is of interest. Students seeking research opportunities with Statistics Department faculty during the academic year are advised to be entrepreneurial and proactive: identify congenial faculty whose research is appealing, request an opportunity to meet, and provide some indication of previous course work when asking for a project.

These courses are GU4203 Probability Theory, GU4204 Statistical Inference, GU4205 Linear Regression, GU4206 Statistical Computing and Introduction to Data Science, and GU4207 Elementary Stochastic processes. Ideally, students would take Probability theory or the equivalent before taking either Statistical Inference or Elementary Stochastic Processes, and would have taken Statistical Inference before, or at least concurrently with taking Linear Regression Analysis, and would have taken Linear Regression analysis before, or at least concurrently, with taking the computing and data science course. A semester of calculus should be taken before Probability, additional semesters of calculus are recommended before Statistical Inference, and a course in linear algebra before Linear Regression is strongly recommended. For the more advanced electives in stochastic processes, Probability Theory is an essential prerequisite, and many students would benefit from taking Elementary Stochastic Processes, too. Linear Regression and the computing and data science course should be taken before the advanced electives in machine learning and data science. Linear Regression is a strongly recommended prerequisite, or at least co-requisite, for the remaining advanced statistical electives.
