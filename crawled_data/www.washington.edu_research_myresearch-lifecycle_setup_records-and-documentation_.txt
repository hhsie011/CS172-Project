The more complex your project is, the more important an organized file becomes. Most projects span multiple years and involve many collaborators. Personnel may change during the project. Having clear project documentation sets you up for success to meet project requirements, deadlines and reporting. Include a calendar to help with completion of regular reports, invoicing and other scheduled tasks, and note your UW budget number Final Action Date. The documentation used for proposal preparation and submission is the foundation of your project file. Review the sponsor’s program announcement and award documentation as you set up these files. They typically specify implementation and reporting requirements for the project. Carefully review and implement records retention guidance from the UW Records Management Services. Consider: Information that needs to be documented and retained (fiscal as well as non-fiscal) How to document unusual circumstances Who will need access to the files Coordination with other participants to obtain information for the file (co-investigators, subrecipients, etc.) Project due dates (financial and programmatic reports, protocol renewals, deliverables, etc.) Storage and security options that best fit your needs Audit requirements: records are subject to audit so be audit ready; review Guidelines for being Audit Ready Forms, Tools, and Resources Data Management Resources at UW Financial Reporting: Internal Controls Records Management Services: University General Records Retention Schedule Records Management Services Records Management Services: Records Retention Schedules by Department Records Management Services: Records Retention for Grants & Contracts Records Management: Paperless Systems/Electronic Files Announcements November 16, 2017 NIH Clinical Trial Stewardship Resources January 11, 2011 NSF Requirement for a Data Management Plan All Announcements Home Setup Sponsor Requirements Federal Non-Federal Internal Sponsors Industry Clinical Trials Agreement Considerations Facilities and Resources Financials Program Income Subawards Compliance Requirements (Non-Financial) Human Subjects Research Animal Use Export Control Measures Financial Conflict of Interest (FCOI) Environmental Health & Safety Information Privacy and Security Classified Research Faculty Effort Certification Audit Records and Documentation Methods Collaborations Agreement Types Sharing Information and Data Sharing Material Consultants Subawards Data Collection Information Privacy and Security University of Washington Office of Research Tools MyResearch SAGE Zipline More Tools OR Support Offices Human Subjects Division (HSD) Office of Animal Welfare (OAW) Office of Research (OR) Office of Research Information Services (ORIS) Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP) OR Research Units Applied Physics Laboratory (APL-UW) WA National Primate Research Center (WaNPRC) Research Partner Offices CoMotion Corporate and Foundation Relations (CFR) Enivronmental Health and Safety (EH&S) Grant and Contract Accounting (GCA) Institute of Translational Health Sciences (ITHS) Management Accounting and Analysis (MAA) Post Award Fiscal Compliance (PAFC) Collaboration Research Expertise Centers and Institutes Interdisciplinary Resources Guidance for NIH Institutional Training Grants Collaborative Proposal Development Resources About Research Fact Sheet Research Annual Report Stats and Rankings Honors and Awards Office of Research Contact Us Manage Subscriptions Gerberding Hall G80 Box 351202 Seattle, WA 98195 Accessibility Jobs Campus Safety My UW Privacy Terms © 2022 University of Washington | Seattle, WA
