The Waadookodaading Ojibwe Language Institute (WOLI)—on the Lac Courte Oreilles Ojibwe Reservation in Hayward, Wisconsin—turns activities such as harvesting wild rice, maple sugaring, and snaring rabbits into hands-on math, science, and anatomy lessons. "We have our own cultural ways to teach," Ammann says. "Language and culture revitalization are a vital part of our holistic, wellness approach." Waadookodaading—which means "place where people help each other"—began in 2000 as a half-day kindergarten language-immersion program. Hired as director in 2010, Ammann added a preschool, and the school now runs through eighth grade. She now hopes to broaden WOLI's teacher training and revitalization research. "Indigenous people often are disenfranchised from their language," says Ammann, whose 12- and 13-year-old sons are bilingual in English and Ojibwe. She has adapted various approaches to teach young children their native tongue, including the innovative methods of renowned Dartmouth language professor John Rassias. "She's a tenacious leader," says Michael Migizi Sullivan, director of Native American studies at Lac Courte Oreilles Ojibwe College. "She won't compromise the integrity of our language, the integrity of our culture." Ammann, who majored in religion, earned a master's in education at Harvard and is pursuing a doctorate at the University of Hawaii. A 2021 Luce Foundation Indigenous Knowledge fellow, she also consults with several tribes and Indigenous nations on how they can reclaim imperiled languages and traditions. "Our own language has a really good chance of being spoken 50, 100 years from now because of the work we've all done and the investments we've made in our children."

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Religion Undergraduate Overview Major and Minor Curriculum Course Schedule Dickinson Seminar Focus on Race Non-Western Courses Honors Program Sperry Fellows Program Past Honors Theses Career Information Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Awards and Prizes The Charles Howard Dudley Prize The Dickinson Senior Writing Prize in Religion The Hans Penner Prize The Religion Department Faculty Award The Sperry Writing Prize in Religion Foreign Study Program News & Events Overview Dickinson Distinguished Lecture Forum on Race & Religion Hardigg Family Fund Lecture Past Fellows Orr Lecture on Culture & Religion Past Lectures People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
