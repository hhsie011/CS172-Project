Showcase participants gain valuable experience in oral and graphic presentation. Students can include their presentations on resumes and graduate school applications. The Showcase includes projects from all disciplines, allowing students to learn from each other about a broad range of exciting research topics. Humanities, Arts, and Creative Posters. While poster sessions have been a long-standing and valued method of presentation in the sciences and social sciences, they are relatively new to the humanities, arts, and creative disciplines. The process is similar, however. For critical and research papers, presenters follow the research processes and procedures in their disciplines, and then summarize their work for the poster which would include their argument, their method, their conclusions, and any other relevant background information. For the arts and creative posters, presenters would include samples of their work such as a poem, a sample set design, or an excerpt from their short story or play. The poster would also include some discussion of the particular method the presenter used, any historical context, or other relevant information. As with all posters, readers should understand the presenter’s project even when the presenter is not present. Also, remember all posters have three main points: To illustrate your project as you describe it to listeners when you are present To provide a basic introduction to your work when you are not present To spark interest in your project and make viewers want to learn more.
