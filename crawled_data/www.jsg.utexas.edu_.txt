The World Needs Geoscientists From the energy transition and climate change to natural disasters and drought, geoscientists are at the forefront of solving society's critical issues. Join a Unique Geosciences Community The Jackson School of Geosciences combines three world-class integrated units to offer a depth and breadth of educational and research opportunities found at no other institution. All three have a global reputation and some of the world's best experts in their scientific disciplines. The combination makes the Jackson School a truly unique place to pursue an education and conduct research. Click on the links below to explore the amazing research being conducted at each unit. Department of Geological Sciences Department of Geological Sciences The Department of Geological Sciences is one of the largest and best geosciences programs in the world. It is the academic unit of the Jackson School of Geosciences which has the No. 1 graduate program in geology and other top ten rankings from U.S. News and World Report. Undergraduate and graduate students have unparalleled field, computational and laboratory research opportunities with faculty tackling some of the most pressing global issues in the 21st century, including climate, water, energy transition, natural resources, or natural disasters, while exploring fundamental processes and questions in Earth and planetary sciences. Visit Bureau of Economic Geology Bureau of Economic Geology The Bureau of Economic Geology is the both the oldest research unit at The University of Texas at Austin and the State Geological Survey of Texas. The Bureau's mission is to conduct objective, impactful and integrated geoscience research on energy, environmental and economic issues that affect Texas and the world. Its research staff includes scientists, engineers, economists and graduate students. Ongoing work includes basic and applied research projects in energy resources and economics, coastal and environmental studies, land resources and use, geologic and mineral mapping, hydrogeology, geochemistry and subsurface nanotechnology. Visit Institute for Geophysics Institute for Geophysics The University of Texas Institute for Geophysics is a world leader in expeditionary research. UTIG scientists and student researchers work to advance fundamental knowledge and address problems facing Texas, the nation, and the world. Current research efforts are focused on evaluating the scientific and energy potential of methane hydrates; understanding Earth's ice sheets and their impact on our coasts; designing next generation computer models of earthquake and tsunami-generating regions; imaging planetary bodies; and deploying rapid response teams to assess the effects of natural disasters.
