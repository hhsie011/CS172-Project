Why Recruit Columbia Talent? Employment Reports Contact Us Interview Schedules For a full day’s schedule, you can invite 13 students for 30-minute interviews or 9 students for 45-minute interviews. We encourage you to indicate at least two alternate candidates, listed in order of priority, for each closed schedule. Rotational Interview Schedules Rotational (or Back-to-back) schedules are appropriate when you want each student to have two interviews, one right after the other with two different recruiters. We will reserve two rooms for your rotational schedules. For a full day’s schedule, you can invite 14 students for 30 minute interviews or 10 students for 45 minute interviews. These schedules must be requested when your original date request is submitted. We are unable to convert single-interview schedules to rotational schedules after the original booking date.
