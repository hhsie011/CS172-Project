More Events Student Life News VOICE Team Expands On-Call Services With RAINN VOICE, Georgia Tech’s sexual violence prevention and victim-survivor support program, has been available 24/7 for several years. They are now expanding their services by partnering with RAINN, a national sexual assault hotline service with trained staff that will provide additional service to the Georgia Tech community. This expansion centralizes the support service to a single phone number (404.894.9000) instead of calling one number during the day and the Georgia Tech Police Department (GTPD) after hours. Student Emergency Fund Closing For the last two years Georgia Tech has worked to distribute emergency funding to students through the Student Emergency Fund. It is now closing due to lack of funds. Winter Student Organizations Fair This February, the Winter Student Organizations Fair will feature 140 of Georgia Tech’s Registered Student Organizations and provide an easy way for interested students to connect with activities on campus. Food Project Making an Impact on Campus and Beyond Progress and service are two constants that guide Georgia Tech’s Campus Kitchens Project in providing support and sustainable food options for our community.
