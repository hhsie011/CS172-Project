Building on Brown’s strengths, the project brings together the disciplines of Mathematics, Statistics, and Theoretical Computer Science to define and refine the foundational landscape of the emerging area of data science. Through focused workshops, lectures, and mini-courses that cut across disciplinary boundaries, researchers and students at all levels work together in domain areas from neuroscience to climate modeling, from genomics to public policy. The three-year project examines three research areas: Geometric and Topological Methods in Complex Data Causal and Model-Based Inference Data Analysis on Massive Graphs and Networks In addition, Brown researchers are collaborating on three grants in the TRIPODS+X program, which was designed for TRIPODS institutes to collaborate with researchers at other institutions on more specific research questions.
