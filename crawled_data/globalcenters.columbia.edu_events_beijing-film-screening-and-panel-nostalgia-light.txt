In the film, the director Patricio Guzman revisits Chile's political past and the revolution's thwarted hopes. The extreme dryness in the desert makes this place the best locale on earth for astronomical observation and for archaeological excavation. By watching the stars, whose light has come over hundreds of thousands of years to reach the earth, walking in the desert, which is marked with fossils from the past, the filmmaker reflects on the luminous aspirations of the past and its violent suppression, and ask how we live, excavate, and search for light on today's world.
