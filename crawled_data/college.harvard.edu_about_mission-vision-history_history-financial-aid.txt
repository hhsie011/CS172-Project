Transformational Gifts Through financial aid, alumni and friends extend the transformational opportunity of a Harvard education to future scholars who are empowered to achieve their promise as individuals and leave Harvard ready to make a difference in the world. 2014 was a historic year for Harvard College. It marked the 10th anniversary of the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative, as well as the largest gift in support of financial aid in Harvard College's history with Kenneth Griffin's '89 donation of over $125 million on February 19, 2014. In addition to supporting a cohort of 200 Griffin scholarship recipients, the gift provides matching funds through the Griffin Leadership Challenge Fund for Financial Aid to inspire other alumni and friends to create 600 new scholarships as part of The Harvard Campaign for Arts and Sciences. In recognition, the Harvard College Office of Financial Aid was renamed the Griffin Financial Aid Office, now headed by the Griffin Director of Financial Aid. This transformational investment will ensure the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative’s continued success for future generations of students. History For almost as long as the College has existed, Harvard has provided financial aid to students. This tradition began with Anne Radcliffe, Lady Mowlson of London, who in 1643 left a bequest to aid students with need admitted to Harvard College. Bequest of Lady Mowlson, Ann Radcliffe, to establish Harvard's first endowed scholarship, May 9, 1643. Harvard University Archives Financial aid achieved its modern form in the 20th century. Harvard President James B. Conant, a former undergraduate scholarship student, created the first large financial aid initiative in 1934—the National Scholarship Plan—which helped open the gates not only to Harvard, but also to higher education more broadly. Today, more than half of families receive scholarship aid from Harvard, and families with incomes below $75,000 pay nothing towards the cost of a Harvard education (up from $65,000 starting the 2022-23 academic year). Every student shares in the financial responsibility for his or her education through student earnings. Robust support for financial aid enables students to meet this obligation in a way that complements, rather than competes with, their academic responsibilities.

Mission, Vision, & History Our mission is to educate the citizens and citizen-leaders for our society through the transformative power of a liberal arts education.  Types of Aid Your financial aid package is made up of a combination of scholarship (grant) funds, student employment, and any potential outside awards.
