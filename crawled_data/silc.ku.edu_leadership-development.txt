Whether for a semester-long program or one hour, you'll learn and develop leadership skills that will take you to the next level. Leadership in Student Organizations Joining a student organization is a great way to develop your leadership skills! Once you are a student organization member or leader, join the Student Involvement and Leadership Center at our SILC Workshops! During our workshops, we cover pertinent KU policies and opportunities, as well as complementary topics including conflict resolution and social justice that help develop holistic leaders on our campus.
