Students develop the skills specific to the practice of art in addition to and within the understanding that there are more general skills necessary to a critical apprehension of the collective condition. This distinction is made in order to clarify that the department does not view art itself merely as a profession, but as a way of understanding and communicating meaning through materials, situations, language, and images. "As artist-educators, we assume a unique and critical role in connecting some of the most complex aspects of art practice to pedagogy," says Paul Ramírez Jonas, Professor and Chair of the Department of Art. " We do this understanding that the next generation of artists live in a world that is both fraught with compounded crises and full of opportunities for engagement, intervention, and for making lasting change."

They Cannot Represent Themselves; They Must Be Represented Art at 100 Letter from the chair Paul Ramírez Jonas "One hundred years is not a lot of time. For 50-60,000 years, what we now call art has been consistently mixing and hybridizing across cultures. It has been and continues to be borrowed respectfully and not, outright stolen, cast into an imagined future, and revived from its own past. This cultural back-and-forth and side-to-side is a relay between individuals. And this constant motion has often managed to transcend membership, nationality, biology, religion, other forms of identity. Art suggests that we can knit together a self-organized, spontaneous group across cultures and time. Our community is one hundred years old this year."
