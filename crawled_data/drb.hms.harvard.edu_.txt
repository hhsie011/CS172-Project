Across the campuses of Harvard Medical School and Harvard University, students and faculty are pursuing exciting research in Stem Cell, Developmental and Regenerative Biology (DRB) from specification and evolution of vertebrate organ systems, to identification of novel regulatory networks shaping cell function and fate, to the production of patient-specific stem cells for the treatment of human disease. The DRB Program unifies these laboratories into a collaborative community and degree-granting track, providing a mechanism for students to access and engage with more than 75 DRB faculty from across Harvard. Our course curriculum provides a strong foundation in basic developmental and stem cell biology principles and skills, while our recurring events program propels trainee development through presentation and networking opportunities. Key Benefits of DRB Participation: Participation in a dynamic and collaborative research community. Peer and faculty feedback on trainee research via our data club and student/faculty seminar series. Cutting-edge hands-on experimental techniques course and foundational developmental biology curriculum with proposal writing practice. Cross-campus networking opportunities via our annual retreat and social events. Professional development funding for external meeting attendance.
