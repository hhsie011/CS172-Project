Our Approach The department of Educational Leadership and Higher Education prepares administrators and leaders of educational institutions ranging from pre-schools, to K-12, public, Catholic, charter schools to universities, to post graduate institutions. Graduates are prepared to bring perspectives from sociology, psychology, history and philosophy, as well as social justice and public policy to their analysis and articulation of educational issues. Course work and field-based learning experiences develop reflective practitioners who integrate theory with practice. Courses in the department encompass these primary themes: Social Justice Diversity Reflective practice Partnerships and collegiality Courses in the various programs of study explore how economic, societal, political, and global forces change the way people think about schooling, educational leadership, and post-secondary administration. To keep up with the constantly changing world there have been broad shifts in the knowledge and skills required of educational leaders today: from technical skills to interpersonal skills from command and direction to consensus building and motivating from resource allocation to being accountable for learning processes and outcomes from campus administrators to coordinator of institutional and community services from policy recipient to shaping and informing policy These shifts have been reflected in courses throughout the Educational Leadership and Higher Education programs. The Boston College Environment Students engaging in Educational Leadership and Higher Education programs benefit considerably from the location of Boston College. Boston as a city is one of the richest post-secondary environments in the world, and offers a diverse range of educational environments. The Boston College O'Neill Library has an excellent collection of books and journals in higher education and educational leadership resulting from decades of focus in the field. The university offers strong supporting faculty in education, management, and the social sciences, and a strong tradition of collaborative scholarship. Close relations with other academic institutions in the area mean extensive opportunities for internships and research around the metropolitan area. Boston College's Jesuit identity also offers an underlying concern with social justice issues that is unique among education programs, and of course the program benefits from the Jesuit tradition of rigorous intellectual discourse.
