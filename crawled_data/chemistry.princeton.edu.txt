Annual Ceremony Honors Grad Students The Department of Chemistry honored graduate students at its Annual Graduate Student Awards ceremony held in-person for the first time in three years on Friday, May 20 with Robert Knowles, Director of Graduate Studies, presenting. Class Day ’22 Awards Conferred, Seniors Recognized Our Class Day ’22 Awards and Recognition Ceremony was a joyful, in-person celebration honoring the 29 members of the Great Class of ’22 to receive an A.B. Degree in Chemistry. Dept to Welcome 43 grad students; Sorensen new DGS Erik Sorensen will be the Department's new director of graduate studies as of July 1. Sorensen, the Arthur Allan Patchett Professor in Organic Chemistry, succeeds Robert Knowles, who has held the post since 2019. Wu/Schoop/Cava reveal new quantum state in novel material In an experiment related to the theory of Luttinger Liquids (LLs), a team led by Princeton University physicists and chemists reports the realization of a one-dimensional linear array of LLs in a moiré superlattice – a new quantum state in an engineered structure made from a known material. A Schmidt Grant and a Bold Idea for Imaging A Chemistry/Mol Bio collaboration, bolstered by an Eric and Wendy Schmidt Transformative Technology Fund award, may well result in the first technology able to map small molecules in their living environments on a resolution close to the atomic scale. DOYLE LAB RETHINKS WORKFLOW FOR SUBSTRATE SCOPE ANALYSIS Their concise, user-friendly tool broadly spans the chemical space, providing information about steric profiles, electronics, and other info. The tool was developed during an investigation on a versatile approach towards the alkylation of aryl halides using an alcohol-derived coupling partner. KLEINER LAB CREATES OUTREACH VIDEOS Backed by the able narration of graduate student Emilia Argüello, the new Kleiner Lab outreach videos use primary literature to highlight chemistry’s historic achievements in nucleic acid science. CHIRIK LAB SYNTHESIZES AMMONIA FROM AN N2-DERIVED NITRIDE In a first, the Chirik Lab reports room-temperature, photocatalytic ammonia synthesis from a N2-derived terminal molybdenum nitride, using photodriven PCET. Torquato Lead on Dept of Defense MURI Grant The Department of Defense (DoD) has awarded a Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI) grant to a research team headed up by Salvatore Torquato, one of 28 such teams throughout the country to receive funding beginning mid-2022. ❯❯ Latest (4/8/22) Princeton COVID Policy and Resources: covid.princeton.edu Job Opportunity: Specially Appointed Research Employee (Single-molecule Biophysics) of the International Research Collaboration Center (IRCC) in Japan Upcoming Seminars & Events Seminar Thursday, Oct. 13, 2022 4:30pm Andrew Rappe University of Pennsylvania Taylor Auditorium, Frick Chemistry Laboratory VIEW MORE SEMINARS & EVENTS Recent News Chemistry Hosts ICCDU, Long-standing CO2 Confab, at Princeton Wednesday, Jun. 1, 2022 Annual Ceremony Honors Grad Student Awardees Wednesday, May. 25, 2022 Class Day ’22 Awards Conferred, Seniors Recognized Tuesday, May. 24, 2022 Dept to Welcome 43 grad students; Sorensen new Director of Grad Studies Friday, May. 13, 2022 VIEW MORE NEWS Faculty & Research A New World In Chemistry Catalysis / Synthesis Chemical Biology Inorganic Chemistry Materials Spectroscopy / Physical Chemistry Theoretical Chemistry Engagement & cooperation fueling progress Faculty in the Department of Chemistry value collegiality, innovation and scientific rigor.
