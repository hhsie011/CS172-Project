Reporting Process The Financial Fraud & Ethics Hotline is intended for faculty, staff, students and others to report suspected fraud or irregular activities such as improper transactions, suspected thefts, losses, misuse, or inappropriate action involving public funds, equipment, supplies, or other assets. If you suspect an incident, situation or conduct violates a law, regulation, requirement or university policy, it is your duty to report it.
