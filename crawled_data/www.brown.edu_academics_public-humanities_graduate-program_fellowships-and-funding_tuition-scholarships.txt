Carter Brown Architecture Lectures Performances Workshops Blog Tuition Scholarships Public Humanities Master's students are eligible for partial tuition scholarships* provided by the Center for Public Humanities. In recent years, most admitted students who request program aid on their applications have been awarded a tuition scholarship equal up to 40% of the tuition cost for the duration of the program. Starting with the 2021 admission of student entering the program in the Fall 2022, tuition scholarship will be determined based on financial need and merit. Students who are requesting financial assistance from the program must complete the FAFSA application facilitated by the Office of Financial Aid. The tuition scholarship award is conditional upon satisfactory academic progress, and students in good academic standing can expect to receive similar support for their second year. Students who require additional support are encouraged to visit the Office of Financial Aid, which can provide information on student loans and leads on sources of funding beyond Brown University. In addition to tuition scholarships, the Center for Public Humanities provides other forms of support for student activities. Conference Funds and Class Trip* Public Humanities M.A. students who entered the program in 2020 were awarded up to $500 award to offset participation expenses in up to two conferences or workshops during enrollment in the program. For students who entered the program in the Fall 2021, the conference funding will be replaced with the funding of the class trip during the 1st year of studies. Students in this cohort who present at a conference and exhausted the available external funding from the Graduate School, can apply for supplemental travel funds from the Center for Public Humanities. All students can apply for the Graduate School Conference Travel Funds and Graduate Student Council Travel Funds. Summer Practicum Funding* The Center has limited funds to offer some financial support to help Public Humanities M.A. students defray the cost of living expenses during the summer practicum. Funding amount will be determined based on financial need (via FAFSA facilitated by the Financial Aid office). *Ph.D. Students who are getting a transitional Master's degree in Public Humanities are not eligible for tuition scholarship, program's conference funds, summer practicum funding, or class trip funding.
