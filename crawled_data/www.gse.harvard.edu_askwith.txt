Widen Layout: wide Upcoming Event Writing About Resilience and Courage Tuesday, June 7, 3 - 4 p.m. EDT In this Children’s Author Series event, the Askwith Education Forum will welcome Mona Golabek, author of The Children of Willesden Lane. These books, written for different age groups, are stories of courage, perseverance, and resilience, centered on how Lisa Jura, Mona’s mother and a teenage refugee, held on to her dreams, survived the Holocaust, and illustrated the power of music as a form of healing. The discussion will delve into the story behind the books, the process of writing for multiple age groups, and the timeless lessons they teach. This individual story has implications for courage, perseverance, and resilience across many communities.
