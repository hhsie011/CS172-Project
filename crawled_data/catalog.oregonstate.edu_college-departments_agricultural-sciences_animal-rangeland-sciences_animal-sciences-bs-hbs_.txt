In addition, the department addresses the care of animals that enhance human well-being through companionship, recreation, and human aid such as horses and companion animals. Essential to this information is knowledge generated from the fields of animal behavior/bioethics, genetics, nutrition, and physiology. The various teaching and research programs explore modern areas of animal biotechnology and data processing and how they apply to present day livestock and poultry production. Study in these areas provides the core around which various curricula leading to the BS degree in Animal Sciences can be developed. To allow students flexibility in course arrangement, three specialized program options are offered. Increasing demands for livestock and poultry products by a rapidly expanding human population mean potential employment for well-trained individuals in such areas as farm, ranch, feedlot operation; meat, poultry, egg and milk processing, meat grading with the USDA; Federal Cooperative Extension Service, county and 4-H work; sales or technical employment with commercial feed, seed, and chemical companies and pharmaceutical houses; agricultural loan officer; government agency positions at local, state and federal levels; the Peace Corps; animal welfare auditing; as well as in journalism, mass media, and public policy. The expanding support structure for companion animals has created a growing job market for graduates in areas such as animal behavior consultant; veterinary technician (animal nurse); and business management. In addition, students become prepared to go on to advanced studies in animal sciences, veterinary medicine, and education. Graduate students may pursue research projects through the Agricultural Experiment Station as part of their programs for MS or PhD degrees. Graduate areas of concentration are offered in animal nutrition, dairy production, embryo physiology, endocrinology, ethology, growth and development, livestock management, muscle biology and meat science, nutritional biochemistry, reproductive physiology. Cooperative Programs Students transferring after one or two years at a community college should also be able to complete the requirements for a BS after three or two years, respectively. Rangeland Resource Management Rangeland resource management is one of the family of natural resources professions important to the social, economic, and political development of Oregon, the nation, and the world. It is based upon ecological principles and is concerned with the restoration, improvement, conservation, and use of rangelands. Since range management is practiced on lands producing domestic and wild animals, timber, water, and recreation, concepts of integrated land use are included in the curriculum. A balance of soil, domestic animal, wildlife, ecology, and other biological sciences is realized in the educational program. The curriculum includes university and departmental requirements for the BS degree and provides emphasis either in science, management, ecology, or allied disciplines. The BS degree is also offered on the campus of Eastern Oregon University at La Grande through an extension of the OSU Department of Animal and Rangeland Sciences. Facilities for study include classroom and field-oriented educational environments both on-campus and at locations throughout Oregon. Field trips are taken in conjunction with specific courses. Graduate work leading to MAIS, MS, or PhD degrees may involve research on domestic or wild animals, rangeland nutrition, community ecology, physiology of rangeland plants, rangeland improvement, rangeland watershed, and riparian zone management, rangeland restoration, utilization and management, agroforestry and landscape ecology. Summer employment with private industry, government agencies, and on range research projects makes possible learning experiences while earning a salary. Employment opportunities include resource management, research, Extension, ranch management, college and university teaching, business and industrial activities related to rangeland resources, and foreign agricultural and resource development assistance. The Department of Animal and Rangeland Sciences is accredited by the Society for Range Management. It is recognized throughout the country as one of the leading institutions of rangeland management. Major Code: 125 Demonstrate the use of discipline-specific scientific information in written and spoken formats using citation. Identify anatomy and physiology of organ systems and describe hormonal function in the male and female reproductive tracts of mammals and poultry. Classify and compare anatomy, physiology and nutritional status of commonly-raised domesticated animal species. Identify interactions of genotype and environment which produce phenotypes adapted to human uses. Apply the methods used to evaluation animal health and well-being. Departmental requirements may be utilized to satisfy baccalaureate core and non-departmental minor requirements.
