Sunflower CMS Guide Menu link to menu page Search this unit Start search Submit Search Home Instructions Creating Content Tables Tables On This Page Select to show menu items Description Tables Used Correctly With Table Headers Accessibility Guidelines and Best Practices Support Description Tables allow you to present sets of data in visually appealing displays to help convey detailed information. In the KU CMS - Sunflower tables are created by using the section Body 9 - Tables. See the section documentation for instructions. Tables Used Correctly With Table Headers Tables must have table headers either in a column header or row header. Table headers cannot be empty. Tables that are used to present data in a column and row format must be appropriately marked up in the html. Accessibility Without the correct markup, a screen reader would read the table from left to right and line by line. Which might not make much sense, particularly in a large data table. With correct markup, screen readers users will hear the information presented in a logical way. Guidelines and Best Practices Organize your tables in order of importance from left to right Use clear and simple language Remove complexity where possible Consider breaking complex tables into smaller tables Avoid combining multiple types of data into a single cell Avoid hosting large data sets when possible Consider how your table displays on mobile screens Consider removing non-essential columns for the best user experience on mobile screens When possible, consider making a table the last section on a page to prevent information from being pushed down and hidden on mobile screens Follow best practices for Links Add a caption to provide broad context for users – especially those accessing the table with a screen reader.
