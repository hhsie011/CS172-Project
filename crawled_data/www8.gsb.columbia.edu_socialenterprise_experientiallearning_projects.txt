Students in the past have taken advantage of Columbia Business School's reputation, connections, location, and access to a wide selection of organizations and industries both in New York City and around the world. Projects can be integrated into elective courses, both within and outside the social enterprise concentration, and in extra-curricular and club activities. These opportunities allow MBA students to learn from and apply their business skills to real world situations in areas relevant to business school courses and individual career interests. Lab and consulting courses are also currently being offered. Please see the courses section for further details. Student clubs that currently offer extra-curricular consulting projects include the Small Business Consulting Program, which consults to local nonprofits as well as small businesses, and Pangea Advisors, an initiative of the Social Enterprise Club. Also, the Tamer Center for Social Enterprise through the International Development Consulting Project Travel Fund provides support for international pro bono projects, as well as project opportunities to work on climate change with the Three Cairns Climate fellowship. Organizations looking for pro bono consulting assistance can contact student clubs via the links above, or contact the Tamer Center for Social Enterprise for referrals to specific professors.
