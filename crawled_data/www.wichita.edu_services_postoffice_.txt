For outgoing mail, the postal contract station provides nearly every service that would be found at a regular U.S. Post Office and may be used for sending mail, the purchase of postage, money orders, special U.S.P.S. shipping services and other products. The postal contract station is open from 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday. For special shipping needs, Federal Express, FedEx Ground, and UPS services are also available at the Campus Post Office starting at 7:30 a.m Monday through Friday. These special services will close by 3:30 p.m. each day, and may possibly close earlier depending on the collection schedule for these services. Finally, the WSU Campus Post Office is also a certified Passport Acceptance Center that processes United States passport applications from 8 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. Both post office and passport services are closed for all holidays recognized by the university. 1845 Fairmount St.Wichita, Kansas 67260 USA (316) 978-3456 Request InfoVisitApply Contact Us Virtual Tour Campus Map and Directions Facebook Twitter Instagram YouTube TikTok Wichita State has helped me put marketing strategy in a real-world perspective.
