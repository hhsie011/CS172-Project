The rooms are great, there's plenty of storage, the kitchen and bathroom facilities are among the best I've seen on campus, and it's not far from Lerner Hall, Butler Library, or the rest of campus. It's also really great that you and your neighboring suites can do as you please without really disturbing each other."
