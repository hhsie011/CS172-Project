The Dean’s Student Circle (DSC) is an organization of student ambassadors who represent the School to prospective students, new students, and the University of Miami at large by participating in outreach and recruitment, leading tours, and assisting in orientations and panels. Members also share ideas and student feedback with School leadership. The DSC also offers a mentorship program which connects students within their first two semesters at the SoC with students who have ideally at least three semesters at the School. The Dean’s Student Circle Mentorship Program The Dean’s Student Circle Mentorship Program at the School of Communication helps students succeed by connecting students within their first two semesters at the SoC with students who have ideally at least three semesters at the School.
