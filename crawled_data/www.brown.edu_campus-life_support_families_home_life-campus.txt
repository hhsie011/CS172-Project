Students' success at Brown is measured in part by their ability to participate in and contribute to this larger campus community. Our students bring a diversity of experiences, beliefs, and identities to bear on their studies and their lives outside the classroom. Our campus is designed to honor and celebrate this diversity while promoting civil discourse among groups that may not always agree on a given issue. By participating fully in campus life, students develop the interpersonal, organizational, and collaborative leadership skills that enable them to work effectively with others toward a common goal. Such skills enable students to thrive as contributing members of the Brown community, and prepare students to lead purposeful lives once they graduate from Brown.
