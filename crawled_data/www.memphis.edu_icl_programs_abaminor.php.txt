This accelerated minor prepares students to apply for certification as a Registered Behavior Technician (RBT). This minor pairs well with majors in Teaching All Learners, Psychology, Social Work, and Child Development, as well as other majors that work with children and adults with autism, behavior delays, or social communication delays. Why Minor in Applied Behavior Analysis? The ABA program offers an accelerated online undergraduate course sequence for students and professionals with an interest in effective intervention for children with autism, behavior delays, or social communication delays or for those interested in becoming a Registered Behavior Technician (RBT). An RBT is a designation that can be obtained with a high school degree, appropriate coursework, and successful completion of a competency assessment. Most RBTs work under the supervision and guidance of a Board Certified Behavior Analyst Course Schedule The coursework meets the standards set forth by the Behavior Analyst Certification Board (BACB) for the RBT certification. Core classes MUST be taken in the ORDER listed below and completed within 1 academic year, or 180 days from start to finish, per BACB. Cohorts start each fall and again in spring. Importantly – this sequence does not lead towards becoming a Board Certified Behavior Analyst, BCBA. The BCBA credential is a graduate level certification. UofM offers the BCBA coursework at both the masters and doctoral level. Acquiring the minor in ABA is a great start towards a career in ABA.
