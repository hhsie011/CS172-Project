Tyler Painting majors are pushed to grow as artists and critical thinkers by a diverse faculty—all of whom are practicing artists themselves—with a broad range of expertise and a commitment to being engaged, passionate mentors. Students learn technique, theory and perhaps the most powerful tool of all: how to teach themselves to be self-critical. Tyler BFA students take full advantage of the school's location in Philadelphia, a vibrant art center, to explore museums and galleries, find internships, earn placements in competitive graduate programs and launch creative practices. When they graduate, they join an alumni community that includes some of the most influential artists, thought leaders and teachers of their time. Designed to complement the studio experience with tools to support a studio practice or pursue graduate studies, the Entrepreneurship coursework enhances students' career options. Graduates of this degree program will possess requisite business skills to support themselves as visual artists or entrepreneurs in art and related fields. Degree Requirements The Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Painting with Entrepreneurial Studies may be conferred upon a student by recommendation of the faculty and upon the satisfactory completion of a minimum of 126 semester hours of credit with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.00. All Painting with Entrepreneurial Studies majors must complete the General Education requirements. Students must earn a C- or better in Painting (ART 2501 or ART 2503) and Intermediate or Digital Drawing (ART 2502, ART 2504, ART 2507, ART 2508 or ART 3511) to enter the Painting with Entrepreneurial Studies major.

ART 2508 is offered in fall only. 3 Only three 2xxx level courses can be taken in any one subject area in order to count for sophomore studio credit. 4 Students completing a 3-credit Art History 2000+ elective must select a 4-credit open elective to reach the minimum 126 credits to earn the BFA degree. 5 Students taking a WI course from the list of Tyler entrepreneurship courses may take a non-WI Art History elective. 6 ART 3896 PDS Seminar can be taken either fall or spring semester. 7 These courses cannot fulfill both a requirement for the major and a requirement for this category. Please Note: An approved study abroad program waives the GenEd Global/World Society (GG) requirement; however, these credits must be made up with academic coursework taken outside of Tyler departments to be in compliance with BFA accreditation. BFA majors interested in studying abroad should consult with an academic advisor to determine if a semester (generally spring semester of second year) or a summer program would be the best option to remain on track for graduation.
