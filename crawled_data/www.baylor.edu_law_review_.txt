We have an excellent staff and strong faculty support that help us achieve this goal. Our staff of students spends countless hours ensuring that the journal and each author's work is polished and ready for publication. As students, it is a privilege to be able to contribute to lasting legal scholarship in this way. We pride ourselves on offering several different opportunities for Baylor Law students to join the Law Review. Students may grade on to the Law Review at the end of their first year or later as upper-quarters. We also host a Write-On Competition during the Fall and Spring quarters. Students also have the opportunity to write onto the Law Review by publication. For more information about joining the Baylor Law Review, click here.
