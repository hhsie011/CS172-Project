Need help with something else? Contact us using the form at the bottom of this page. Can anyone enroll their child/children at the Childrens Center? Priority is given to children of students at Cal State Fullerton. An additional twenty spaces are available for the children of CSUF faculty & staff. We sometimes have spaces for others after enrollment is complete. Because the Center runs on the campus academic year, and is closed for campus observed holidays, it is not always the best option for non-students. Enrollment applications are due four times per year. Once your child is accepted, well do our best to provide continuous care each semester. If your schedule is flexible and youre not looking for full time care, were often a good match for your needs. Is financial aid available? Yes, the Childrens Center offers state subsidized child care. Subsidy applications are available at the Childrens Center and can be picked up when an enrollment application is filled out. Is there a waiting list? Because the Childrens Center offers a flexible, hourly scheduled program, there is not a standard waiting list. Rather, we take names and information and keep them on our waiting list by date of inquiry. This date is entered on each specific term application that you submit. We then prioritize the applications by the waiting list dates. Returning parents have priority, and then we enroll new children in the remaining spaces. The days and times that you request will be a determining factor in being admitted.Waiting list names remain active for two years, reserving your place in line for child care. Referrals to alternate child care locations are available upon request. Why do applications have to be turned in every term? Student parents needs for child care vary as their class schedules change each semester which necessitates a need for updated applications for every semester that a parent is requesting child care.
