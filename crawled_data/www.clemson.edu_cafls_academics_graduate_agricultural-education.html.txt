Graduate Programs Current: Agricultural Education (MAgEd) Agricultural Education (MAgEd) The Master of Agricultural Education (MAGED) is a professional degree designed to provide excellent academic programs, timely outreach and service programs, and cutting-edge research programs in South Carolina to enhance Clemson University’s effort to reach a position of leadership among public universities in the United States. The MAGED is a completely online program with courses primarily being offered using an asynchronous format, allowing flexibility for working professionals interested in furthering their education. Agricultural Education is accountable for teaching, research, and service activities within the agricultural education system (i.e., school-based agricultural education, Extension education and outreach, private sector agricultural education and leadership) by preparing and maintaining professionals. This coincides with the University's mission “to establish a 'high seminary of learning’ through its land-grant responsibilities of teaching, research, and extended public services.” The program is an academic unit of professionals who discover, adapt, and disseminate knowledge and technologies to our students and community. The focus is to provide educational and leadership training for future agricultural leaders and teachers of science and agriculture for the agricultural education system nationwide. The program is committed to producing highly qualified graduates which is congruent with the Universities goals “to develop students’ communication and critical-thinking skills, ethical judgment, global awareness, and scientific and technological knowledge.” The program strives to lead the state and nation in addressing emerging challenges related to the development of current and future agricultural educators and supporting the needs and objectives of the educational system at Clemson University and the public across the country. Goal The agricultural education program prepares and provides continuing education for professionals who will build on their knowledgebase of learning and teaching, improve the basis of curriculum development, demonstrate effective delivery methodologies, assess program relevance and effectiveness, and project future educational needs of people who are involved in or affected by agricultural industries. The agricultural education program develops instructional materials and conducts research on innovative instruction methods and other relevant educational aspects in agricultural education and leadership. The agricultural education program also provides educational services, support, and leadership for secondary education curricula in agricultural education, the FFA, adult education programs, Cooperative Extension agents, and residents of South Carolina. The student learning outcomes are as follows: Students develop the essential skills to deliver effective agricultural education programs through school-based agricultural education, Extension education, and agricultural leadership. Students display advanced knowledge related to the theories and practices of adult education and the development and evaluation of inclusive agricultural education programs. Students effectively foster skills in systems for technology transfer and the foundations of digital media within agricultural education. Admission Requirements (in addition to Graduate School requirements) To apply to the MAGED program follow the instructions at www.grad.clemson.edu/admission/index.php and complete the online application. Applications should be completed by April 15 for the fall semester. Students who apply for the spring semester need to complete their applications no later than October 15. For admittance, students must have either: GRE Score: Combined scores of the two objective sections (verbal and quantitative) of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) must be 280 or above if taken on or after 8/1/2011. OR GPA: A cumulative grade point average of 2.75 from an undergraduate degree institution. TOEFL (international students): Because of the strong communication component of graduate degree programs, non-native speakers of English should have a minimum TOEFL score of 80. IELTS can be taken in lieu of TOEFL. The minimum score accepted on the IELTS is 6.5. Requirements for Degree A master’s degree program in Agricultural Education shall consist of a minimum of 30 semester hours of graduate credit. For the Master of Agricultural Education degree, at least one-half of the total graduate credit hours must be selected from courses numbered 8000 or above. Prerequisite and co-requisite courses do not count toward the 30 semester hours of graduate credit required for the degree. Prerequisite courses must be completed before admission as a graduate student, whereas co-requisite courses may be taken concurrently but must be completed before receipt of the master’s degree. Please visit the Master of Agricultural Education Graduate Student Handbook. Financial Information Students are self-funded. No Program-specific Fees apply to the Graduate Program. For more information on financial aid, please visit Student Financial Aid. Job Placement Graduates earning a Master’s in Agricultural Education are often hired into many facets of agricultural service and education nationwide. Those seeking a career in the Cooperative Extension Service are informed that a master’s degree is preferred and many of those decide to seek a Master’s in Agricultural Education. Our coursework at the graduate level aligns with many of the responsibilities of Cooperative Extension Agents, therefore, a Master’s in Agricultural Education has traditionally been favored by many. An overwhelming majority of those employed with Cooperative Extension completed their graduate work with Clemson’s agricultural education program. Agricultural Educators in secondary and post-secondary schools across the country are also strongly encouraged to complete a master’s degree. The Master’s program also impacts professional development for the secondary agriculture teachers as it increases their pay, keeping them in the profession. Agricultural professionals interested in furthering their knowledge related to formal and informal agricultural education are encouraged to explore the potential opportunities the online Master’s in Agricultural Education provides.
