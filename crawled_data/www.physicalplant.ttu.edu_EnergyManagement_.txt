Texas Tech University Directory Raiderlink A-Z Index Operations Division Menu Search TTU Operations Division Energy Savings Program Energy Use Index (EUI): Total energy (electricity, natural gas and imported steam) consumed by Texas Tech University (all facilities in Texas owned by TTU) expressed as thousands of British Thermal Units (BTUs) divided by the Occupied Square Foot for conditioned spaces only. All energy, interior and exterior, is aggregated in the numerator, but the square footage of only the occupied spaces are counted in the denominator. Practice Efficiency State Energy Savings Program Energy Raider, You Are In Control Here are some energy conservation measures which you, and only you, have control. Together, all of us can make Texas Tech the most energy efficient university in the Big 12. Reporting Speak up! Let us know when you identify energy waste or energy saving opportunities. Energy Management wants to hear your ideas. If you're hot or cold, or something doesn't seem to be working right in one of your building systems, please call Emergency Maintenance any time of the day or night. Computers Turn off monitors when not in use for more than 15 minutes. Screen savers don't save energy. Turn off computers at the end of the day or if you'll be away more than a day. Set computers to hibernate after 15 minutes of idle time. Print preview minimize wasted paper by using Print Preview before pushing the print button. Most printers have a hibernation mode and can be programmed to shut down when you turn off your computer. When these are not an option, use a power strip. Use power strips, especially on computers and peripherals, but also turn off your devices one at a time. Water Don't let it run. Besides saving our precious water resources, you'll also save treatment costs, pumping costs and energy to heat the water. Choose to keep showers less than 5 minutes, and keep the tap off while brushing your teeth or shaving. Fix the leak. A faucet leaking 1 drop per second will waste 400 gallons per year. Just let your building administrators know about it and we'll get it fixed. Appliances Spend green! Purchase Energy Star approved products and unplug them when not in use. Unplugging is better than switching off! Space Heaters and Fans Small personal fans are preferable to open windows. Space heaters are never acceptable, for safety reasons. Besides using a lot of energy, they interfere with room temperature controls. Fume Hoods Close the sash whenever you leave the room. A typical fume hood uses more energy in a year than a house. Closing the sash will take a huge chunk out of that energy cost. Windows Keep windows closed. The vast majority of your heating and cooling costs are due to allowing conditioned air to leave the building. Outside air must be brought in to replace it, and it costs a lot more to condition outside air than it does to recondition the inside air. Temperature Settings Get with the program. Our campus operates on a strategic temperature schedule which is designed to minimize energy costs: Fall Semester: 73° November thru Spring Semester: 69° Spring Break: 74° Summer: 76° Please support these temperature settings by informing Emergency Maintenance (806-742-4677) if you see thermostats that are not set according to this schedule. Dress for success. Dress in light, breathable fabrics during hot seasons. Wear layers during cold seasons and transitional seasons like spring and fall when temperatures vary widely during each day. Pull on a layer if you feel too cool, pull off a layer if you're too warm. Parasitic Loads Charge! Unplug your cell phone chargers and laptops when they have finished charging. Such devices use energy even when they are not doing anything. Lights Turn off the lights when you're not using them. This could save Texas Tech as much as $400,000 annually. New fluorescent lights use very little energy to turn back on, so turn them off even if you are gone for only a few minutes. Use task lighting. Use a small lamp in the immediate area you're working in, instead of lighting a large area with many large fixtures. Choose compact fluorescents whenever you replace a bulb. Compact fluorescents burn 75% less energy than incandescent.
