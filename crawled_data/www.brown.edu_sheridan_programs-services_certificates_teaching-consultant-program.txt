Building on the foundations of reflective teaching explored in the Sheridan Teaching Seminar (Certificate I), participants will continue to develop an understanding of evidence-based teaching practices, explore strategies for creating inclusive learning environments, facilitate workshops and micro-teaching sessions for the Sheridan Teaching Seminar (Certificate I), and write and revise a teaching statement for portfolios and/or the job market. Skills developed in the Teaching Consultant Program are broadly applicable to effective communication and facilitation in academic and professional careers. Graduate students who complete all requirements for the program within the Fall semester will receive a Sheridan Center Certificate and a notation on their graduate transcript. Teaching Consultants who successfully complete the Certificate may apply to return in following years as Experienced Teaching Consultants (ETCs). In this role, ETCs have the opportunity to continue their professional development by facilitating workshops, microteaching sessions, and peer portfolio feedback sessions. ETCs also conduct peer observations (as needed) and develop additional peer mentorship skills. ETCs perform additional support roles for the program, including serving as facilitator subs and facilitating additional microteaching sessions on an as-needed basis. In addition to the Certificate, Teaching Consultants receive a $400 award for successfully completing the program. Experienced TCs will receive a $500 award. Please note: the Sheridan Teaching Consultant program will be conducted online during Fall 2022.
