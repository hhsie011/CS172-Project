A Message from Jim Russell, Chairperson Dear Friends of DEEPS, I hope that you all are doing well in these challenging times. The Department of Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences just celebrated its graduating class of 2021, and I'm writing to share with you this yearbook of their highlights and accomplishments. Despite a very challenging final year, our students maintained a sense of community and optimism and had some outstanding experiences in the field, classrooms, and in their research. We have no doubt that great things lie ahead for our graduates. We thought you might enjoy reading about some of their most memorable moments and achievements. We hope to see you at upcoming DEEPS events and future graduation ceremonies! Best Wishes, Jim Please scroll to the bottom of the page to view the PDF Spring Break 2018 field trip to west Texas and New Mexico Our Department integrates teaching and research to investigate fundamental phenomena affecting the Earth and planets.
