Accreditation Process Baylor University has been accredited by SACSCOC since 1914, and was most recently reaffirmed by the SACSCOC Board of Trustees in December 2018.

Baylor's accreditation was most recently reaffirmed by the SACSCOC Board of Trustees in December 2018. For the most up-to-date information regarding Baylor's official status with SACSCOC, visit the SACSCOC Institutional Details page for Baylor University. If you need additional written documentation of our current status, you may contact the Office of Institutional Effectiveness at Ben_Cox@baylor.edu. In 2018, SACSCOC published a new edition of their Principles of Accreditation, which covers fourteen areas of institutional quality. Quality Enhancement Plan In each ten year period, institutions propose an area for strategic improvement for student learning and success through a Quality Enhancement Plan (QEP). In 2018, Baylor initiated the Global Baylor QEP, which creates opportunities for students to engage in courses and activities that enhance their global perspective and intercultural competence. Substantive Changes Times of organizational change are occasions where institutions can be vulnerable to negative impacts on students. This could include starting a new program, adding a new degree level, or initiating a new instructional location. Institutional accreditors and the United States Department of Education (USDE) require sufficient planning through the Substantive Change process to ensure quality educational services are provided to students. State Authorization As a private, not-for-profit postsecondary institution in Texas, Baylor University is authorized to grant degrees in Texas based upon its accreditation by SACSCOC and a provision in House Joint Resolution 130. If enrolled or prospective students wish to review documents about Baylor's status with the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, they can contact the Office of Institutional Effectiveness at Ben_Cox@baylor.edu.
