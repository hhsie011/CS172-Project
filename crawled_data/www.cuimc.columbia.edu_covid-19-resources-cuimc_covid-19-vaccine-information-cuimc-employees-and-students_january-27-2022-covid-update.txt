We are still seeing new cases so it is important that we all continue to be careful, and vigilant. New data from the United States support the effectiveness of boosters in protecting against Omicron-related serious illness, very similar to what was previously reported from South Africa and the United Kingdom. A CDC study from the nationwide VISION network, which includes Columbia University Irving Medical Center, demonstrated that during both Delta- and Omicron-predominant periods, receipt of a third vaccine dose was highly effective at preventing COVID-19-associated emergency department and urgent care encounters and preventing COVID-19-associated hospitalizations. Columbia has mandated Covid boosters for all faculty, staff, and students effective January 31, 2022. Information on where to get a booster dose and how to upload your documentation into the ReopenCU app is available here. Flu vaccines are required by February 11 for all faculty and staff working in NYP locations. Hereâ€™s where to get your flu shot. Thank you and stay safe!
