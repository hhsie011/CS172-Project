Computer Electrical & Computer Engineering Program Area The Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE) Program Area studies and creates many of today's exciting and emerging technologies—from self-powered sensors to electric cars, from autonomous vehicles to smart cities, and from wearable devices to cognitive medical imaging. ECE Program Area Lead: Kofi Odame On This Page The Student Experience Research Lab Spotlight Coursework Graduate Degrees Undergraduate Degrees The Student Experience As part of the ECE Program Area, students receive individualized guidance in both technical and career matters. We strive to help students develop communication skills and abilities as independent researchers. Our graduates are prepared to command a top salary in a research lab in either industry or academia, or, with our emphasis on entrepreneurship, to launch a tech startup of their own. Some PhD students choose the Innovation Program to supplement their engineering studies with formalized training in entrepreneurship. Research ECE faculty work to address key challenges with human-centered impact and are leaders in their research fields, which include: Computing systems and controls Electronic materials and devices Photonics and optics Power electronics Space science and engineering Learn more Lab Spotlight Dartmouth Engineering to Lead $2.7M DOE Grant to Revolutionize Quantum Computing Professor Geoffroy Hautier is leading a three-year, multi-institutional effort to identify qbits, a basic unit of quantum information, in order to transform and advance quantum computing. Learn more Coursework Students who choose the ECE Program Area need not limit their academic interests to ECE. Many of our students and faculty move comfortably between traditional disciplines, working at the intersection of ECE and biotechnology, mechanical engineering or applied mathematics, to name a few. Our flexible curriculum allows for a wide range of academic paths which students develop with guidance from their advisor to meet individual needs. Graduate Degrees Students interested in obtaining a PhD, MS, or MEng focused on ECE are encouraged to contact faculty lead Kofi Odame or other individual faculty in their areas of interest. Applicants are also invited to visit campus and meet with engineering students and faculty. PhD MS MEng Undergraduate Degrees Students interested in the AB/BE, or Dual-Degree program with a focus on ECE are encouraged to contact Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education Doug Van Citters. Applicants are also invited to visit campus and meet with engineering students and faculty.
