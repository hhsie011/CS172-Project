This program is designed to guide students as they transition from high school to the academic rigors of CEAT coursework through academic review, mock exams, orientation seminars and engineering design projects. Preparing students for calculus is a focus. Summer Bridge can potentially help students shorten time to graduation by a semester or by a full year depending on their level of math readiness at the start of the program. Additionally, the students will build relationships with peers, faculty and staff, and start the process of building strong study habits with the assistance of CEAT upperclassmen as mentors. Students will live on campus and experience this transition from high school to college.
