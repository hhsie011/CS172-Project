Full Text PubMed Research Research Overview The Shukla Lab for Designer Biomaterials at Brown University develops biomaterials for unmet needs in the areas of drug delivery and regenerative medicine. Our research focuses largely on treatments for bacterial and fungal infections. We aim to understand the relationship between the physicochemical properties of the materials we develop that span the nano- to macroscales and their functional behavior (e.g., enzymatic degradation, drug release kinetics).
