Do we have free will? Can machines think? What makes actions right or wrong? What is the nature of knowledge and what can we hope to know? What does justice require, politically and economically? Philosophy classes explore answers to deep questions such as these, encouraging each student to develop and rationally defend their own views. Philosophy offers a structured but flexible program to help students graduate on time while pursuing their interests. 200-level courses introduce students to essential questions and methods of philosophical thought. In 300-level courses, students engage in close examination of central topics in both contemporary thought and the history of philosophy. Seminars at the 400-level offer the opportunity to study topics in-depth alongside a committed team of faculty and students. Philosophy fosters skills of communication and critical thinking that are valuable across work, family, and civic life. The program equips students to logically analyze and develop new responses to the challenges faced by humanity. It also emphasizes clarity of thought and communication as part of rigorous engagement with both abstract and applied areas of thought. These skills of logical analysis, careful reading, original thought, and clear communication are in high demand across different fields of work and post-graduate study. Philosophy majors typically achieve some of the highest scores on standardized tests such as the LSAT and GRE, and have mid-career salaries higher than many other majors. Student Learning Outcomes Upon graduation, students should be able to: 1. Understand central problems in key areas of philosophy, such as metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, logic, political philosophy, philosophy of language, and the philosophy of science. 2. Explain the views of historically important philosophers and place them in the context of significant philosophical movements. 3. Identify and critically evaluate arguments by developing objections and replies. 4. Communicate ideas and arguments, both orally and in writing, with clarity and precision. 5. Engage with different points of view with open-mindedness, intellectual curiosity, and a willingness to learn from the ideas and arguments of others.

MINOR IN ETHICS The Department Philosophy and Religious Studies offers a minor in ethics. Ethics is the branch of human thought that addresses questions of human morality.

The minor must include at least 9 credits that are not used to meet any other department, college or university requirement.
