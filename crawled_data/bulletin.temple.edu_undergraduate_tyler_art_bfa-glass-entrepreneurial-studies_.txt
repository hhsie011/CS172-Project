Glass majors at Tyler join a welcoming, high-energy community of artists and educators who work in expansive studios that provide opportunities to learn the full range of glass processes: glassblowing, hot-casting, kiln-casting, flame-working, performance and more. In addition to learning traditional and innovative techniques, students learn how to think critically and solve problemsâ€”all while enjoying Tyler Glass traditions from Blow-a-thons to "Pumpkinferno." Tyler BFA students take full advantage of the school's location in Philadelphia, a vibrant art center with a strong glass art tradition, and its proximity to New York to find internships and jobs, explore museums and galleries, launch creative practices, start businesses and earn placements in the most competitive graduate programs. Designed to complement the studio experience with tools to support a studio practice or pursue graduate studies, the Entrepreneurship coursework enhances students' career options. Graduates of this degree program will possess requisite business skills to support themselves as visual artists or entrepreneurs in art and related fields. Degree Requirements The Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Glass with Entrepreneurial Studies may be conferred upon a student by recommendation of the faculty and upon the satisfactory completion of a minimum of 126 semester hours of credit with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.00. All Glass with Entrepreneurial Studies majors must complete the General Education requirements.

Please Note: An approved study abroad program waives the GenEd Global/World Society (GG) requirement; however, these credits must be made up with academic coursework taken outside of Tyler departments to be in compliance with BFA accreditation. BFA majors interested in studying abroad should consult with an academic advisor to determine if a semester (generally spring semester of second year) or a summer program would be the best option to remain on track for graduation.
