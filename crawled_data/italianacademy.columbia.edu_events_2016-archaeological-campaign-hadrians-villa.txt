This summer program—incubated by the Italian Academy and by H2CU at La Sapienza as the Advanced Program of Ancient History and Art, or APAHA—is a credit-bearing course for undergrads and graduate students at the compound, a UNESCO World Heritage site and the most important of Roman imperial villas. In the most intensive and productive digging season of all, summer 2016 brought over 80 participants from 15 universities and institutions across 8 countries; it not only yielded a wealth of new data but also raised unexpected scholarly questions. The excavation at the “Lararium” revealed a pre-Hadrianic channel running under the floor and provided further information on the Medieval phases of the complex. Continued exploration in the “Macchiozzo” segment brought to light new rooms with mosaics and painted walls and ceilings. The expansion of the excavation around the “Macchiozzo” building uncovered architectural remains last seen (and only-partially documented) by Piranesi in the 18th century.

Co-sponsors: H2CU at La Sapienza, Rome; and Columbia’s Classical Studies Graduate Program, Department of Art History and Archaeology, Center for the Ancient Mediterranean, and Italian Academy.
