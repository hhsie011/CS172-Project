Skip to main content Skip to main navigation Office of the Registrar Menu Baylor>Registrar>Transfer Credit Transfer Credit Baylor University has established a number of policies that are designed to ensure the quality of courses transferred to Baylor for credit, assist students as they decide which courses to take, and clarify for advisors which courses students should select at Baylor and elsewhere. The policies found at this link are divided into two sections: 1) general policies on transfer credit, and 2) policies specific to coursework transferred to Baylor post matriculation (meaning after a student has enrolled at Baylor). The policies are divided into two sections because some policies apply to students only after they have matriculated at Baylor. If students intend to take courses at another institution after matriculating at Baylor, they should select courses as similar as possible to what they would experience at Baylor. Students also should not defer basic required courses in the expectation of taking courses elsewhere. Students can best ensure that they will be prepared for subsequent courses at Baylor by completing foundational courses at Baylor as well. However, the university recognizes that there are times when Baylor students need to complete some courses elsewhere. To increase the likelihood that students will succeed in subsequent courses at Baylor and to ensure the quality of Baylor degrees, the university has established its transfer course policies. Transfer credit will only be granted for coursework taken at a regionally accredited institution. All coursework that a student completes at another college or university is evaluated for equivalent transfer credits, not necessarily for degree requirements. The student is responsible for working in conjunction with his or her advisor to determine if the equivalent course applies to a specific degree requirement. In addition to working with an advisor, the student should refer to the Baylor University Undergraduate Catalog and/or the academic dean within the appropriate college or school for additional information on degree requirements. Equivalent courses are determined based upon a review of the following course characteristics: course description, textbook, course objectives, assignments, number of credit hours, course prerequisites, and program quality (determined based on a process designed by Institutional Research and Testing in consultation with the relevant department chair and the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education). To determine which courses are considered to be equivalent to Baylor courses, students should use the Equivalent Course Tool (ECT). For a course not found using the Equivalent Course Tool, current Baylor students must submit an Equivalent Course Request (ECR) prior to enrolling in a course at another institution. Students are responsible for adhering to the university's transfer credit policies. If a student fails to abide by these policies, he or she risks losing the proposed transfer credit when an audit of the degree plan occurs. When the student has completed coursework at another institution, the student should request that institution to send an official transcript to the Office of the Registrar, Baylor University, Attn: Transfer Credit Evaluation, One Bear Place #97068, Waco, TX 76798, in order for transfer credit to be applied to the student's Baylor academic record. How to Determine Transfer Course Equivalencies To determine which courses from outside institutions are available for transfer, please use the Equivalent Course Tool (ECT). Current Baylor students: If the course you wish to take from another institution is not listed and you want it to be considered, you must submit an Equivalent Course Request (ECR). Click here, to view what is required to submit a ECR. Please note: to submit an ECR, the Equivalent Course Request link must be clicked and information submitted. Prospective Baylor students: If you do not see the institution or course of your choice, please visit the Office of Admission Services Frequently Asked Questions page.
