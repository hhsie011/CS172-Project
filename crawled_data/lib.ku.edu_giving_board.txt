Its members provide vital resources to promote and achieve the mission and vision of the libraries. Members work to develop and support strategies that increase a sense of pride, loyalty, and connection with the libraries among alumni networks and members of the community beyond the university. Perhaps most importantly, the group encourages alumni and friends to donate their time, talent and financial resources in support of the quality programs and services offered by KU Libraries.
