Winter Weather Safety During winter weather: Walk carefully on snowy or icy walkways. Limit your outdoor exposure to 15-minute intervals. Wear multiple insulating layers of clothing topped with a heavy coat. When outdoors, cover all exposed skin. Wear a warm hat, gloves, and waterproof footwear. Keep a blanket, water, and snacks in your vehicle. When leaving your residence, practice the “buddy system.” Bring along a companion, or let someone know your destination, your route, and when you expect to arrive. Watch for signs of frostbite (loss of feeling and whiteness or paleness in fingers, toes, ear lobes, tip of the nose or other extremities). If symptoms are detected, get medical help immediately. Watch for signs of hypothermia (uncontrollable shivering, memory loss, disorientation, incoherence, slurred speech, drowsiness, apparent exhaustion). If symptoms of hypothermia are detected, get to a warm location, remove wet clothing, warm the center of the body first and drink warm, non-alcoholic beverages. Get medical help as soon as possible. Those living off campus should let their faucets drip to avoid freezing pipes. More winter weather safety tips are available from OU Campus Safety and the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management and Homeland Security.
