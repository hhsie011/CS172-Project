Both plans cover the same range of services, but differ in cost depending on the plan you choose and the provider you see. Aetna Columbia Dental Plan: Choose from a broad range of dentists in three categories, including Columbia University College of Dental Medicine faculty and alumni—the “Columbia Preferred Dental Network”, or dentists in the national Aetna PPO network. You may also see an out-of-network dentist, although your cost may be significantly higher. Aetna Dental Maintenance Organization (DMO): Under this plan, monthly premiums are generally lower and there is no deductible, or annual or lifetime benefit maximums, for most major services. You must choose a primary care dentist from the Aetna DMO network. Referrals are needed for specialists and there is no out-of-network coverage. View the Aetna Dental Plan Comparison Chart Expand all Collapse all Using the Dental Plans Using the Aetna Plan Network If you see an Aetna-participating dentist, you will not be billed for any fees that exceed the Aetna negotiated amount. To locate an Aetna participating dentist, go to Vendor Contacts. Using the Columbia Preferred Dental Network When you use a dentist who participates in the Columbia University network, you receive a greater benefit for services. To locate a Columbia Preferred dentist, go to Vendor Contacts. Columbia Preferred dentists are located throughout the tristate area of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Columbia Preferred dentists accept reimbursement for services covered at 100% as payment in full. You are not responsible for paying any fees that exceed the network-negotiated fees. You also do not have to submit any claim forms when you use a network participating dentist.

To keep your dental care on track, consider selecting your primary care dentist (PCD) now, in advance of your regular checkup or whenever you next require dental care. If you have not registered on Aetna’s website, create a user account at aetna.com. After logging in, search for primary care dentists under “Find care and pricing”. Choose your primary care dentist online or by calling Aetna at 800-773-9326. If you have questions about your benefits enrollment, please contact the Columbia Benefits Service Center at [email protected] or 212-851-7000. A primary care dentist (PCD) helps guide your dental care. You and each family member must each choose a PCD from the Aetna DMO network (does not have to be the same PCD). If you go to a dentist other than your selected PCD, you could end up paying more. See your PCD for regular exams and to get referrals if you need specialty care. You can change your PCD once a month on your member website. Switch by the 15th day of the current month. The change will start the first day of the next month. Pay your share of the cost. This may be a copay, which is a set dollar amount. Or it may be coinsurance, which is a percentage of the dentist’s charge. Have a health savings account (HSA) or a flexible spending account (FSA)? You can use those funds to help with these costs. No deductible, no claims forms and no yearly dollar limits. To locate an Aetna DMO participating dentist, go to Vendor Contacts. Prior to January 1, 2022, the Aetna DMO is available in the following U.S. states: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Texas. The DMO is not available outside the U.S. Effective January 1, 2022, the Aetna DMO is available only within certain zip codes. If the DMO is not an available option for you on CUBES, it means that your home address is in a zip code where the DMO is not offered. The DMO is not available outside the US.
