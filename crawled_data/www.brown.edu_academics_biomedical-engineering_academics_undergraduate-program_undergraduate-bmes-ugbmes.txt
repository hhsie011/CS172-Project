Their mission is to promote and enhance knowledge and education in biomedical engineering and bioengineering worldwide and its utilization for the health and well being of humankind. BMES charters and supports over 100 BMES Student Chapters and Brown's local student chapter of the Biomedical Engineering Society is University funded but otherwise entirely student driven. Brown BMES is the primary entry-level professional society for Brown Biomedical Engineering Concentrators. Its activities range from the educational and career-focused activities as well as recruitment of potential concentrators among first and second year students. Contact ugBMES Join ugBMES Meet ugBMES Use the "ugBMES" filter on the Events page to find out about our upcoming events. Activities vary from year to year but in the past, Brown BMES has sponsored a professionals panel in the fall with presentations by biomedical engineers, Brown alumni and other notable researchers: The group also sponsors lab fairs in which undergraduates can meet and network with professors who share similar research interests. These fairs offer the opportunity to be recruited into one of Brown’s many research labs. On a more informal note, the group provides undergraduate biomedical engineers with opportunities to get to know their fellow students in both an academic and social setting. For example, Brown BMES holds other events such as a Donut Social during finals, annual welcome event for new concentrators and much more: Accreditation BMES Capstone Submit a Design Proposal Past Projects Concentration Advisors Concentration Requirements Current Requirements Electives Currently Offered FAQs Independent Study Honors in BME Careers Contact Center for Biomedical Engineering Brown University Box A-2 Arnold Lab 91 Waterman Street, Suite 211 Providence, RI 02912 +1-401-863-6778 [email protected] Quicklinks Apply Now Research Faculty Academics Give to CBME Giving to Brown Brown University Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA Phone: 401-863-1000 Maps & Directions / Contact Us © 2016 Brown University Connect: [email protected] Facebook Twitter YouTube Instagram iTunes U Google+ LinkedIn SnapChat
