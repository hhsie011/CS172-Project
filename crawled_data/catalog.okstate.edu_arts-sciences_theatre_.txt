The Department of Theatre offers the Bachelor of Arts in Theatre degree and minors in Theatre and Dance. The BA degree is a generalist degree, designed to provide a broad background in practical and theoretical areas while allowing students to develop an area of emphasis. The BA in Theatre is a comprehensive 48-hour degree with coursework in performance, technical theatre, directing, design, theatre history and dramatic literature. Students may elect an emphasis in performance, technical theatre, and design, or a combination of performance and design/tech. This degree program is ideally suited for students interested in several areas of performance and production and who desire a comprehensive education in every aspect of theatre. The size of the degree plan allows for students to pursue a double major or minor in another discipline. An active production program in two well-equipped theatre spaces augments coursework. The regular production schedule consists of four faculty-supported main stage productions each year and two to four studio productions that are primarily directed, designed, and performed by students. Students also have the opportunity to study with a variety of guest artists and scholars during each academic year. In addition to professional careers in acting and production, this major can lead to careers in arts management, teaching, law, counseling, or any career area where effective personal communication, team work, problem solving, and creativity are essential.

Over the course of the semester, we will examine the visual culture of social dance in order to gain insight into its historical functions as a tool for social cohesion, intercultural exchange, protest/activism, and identity formation, among other things. Through the practice of these dance forms, we will add an experiential component to our analysis of the roles that social dance has played in American culture over time. Same course as ART 2563.

Accepting only a limited number of students each year, the program affords a great deal of individual contact with faculty members and considerable latitude in developing the plan of study. Graduate candidates take a central core of graduate level courses in theatre history, theory, and directing, augmented by other courses available in the department and the university to develop and support their areas of special interest. Typically students accepted into this degree program pursue careers in professional theatre, become teachers in secondary schools or two-year colleges, or they prepare for the pursuit of advanced degree work in a Master of Fine Arts or Doctoral program. The Master of Arts degree may be achieved in accordance with any of the three plans described in the section "Master's Degree Programs" in the "Graduate College" section of the Catalog. A limited number of graduate teaching assistantships (GTA’s) are available to highly qualified students. Information and application information may be obtained from the department head. Undergraduate credentials should be referred to the department graduate program coordinator for evaluation to assist advisement and to determine any possible deficiencies that will affect the admission status.
