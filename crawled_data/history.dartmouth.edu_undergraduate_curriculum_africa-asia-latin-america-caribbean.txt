This class will begin with the regional and global contexts in which Islam emerged, examining the history of the Prophet Muhammad, the Qur'anic revelation, and the first community of believers. We will then look at the expansion of the "abode of Islam" over the course of several centuries, asking why so many people in so many different regions converted to Islam. We will also study philosophical, cultural, legal, political, and social trends in region now known as the Middle East and North Africa until the era of early European colonialism.

HIST 4.03; X-LIST: MES 2.03 Introduction to the Modern Middle East and North Africa The diverse nations and peoples that make up the Middle East and North Africa are of major significance in our contemporary world, at the same time that they are often misunderstood or given only superficial (albeit spectacular) popular attention. This lecture course is designed to give students a nuanced introductory overview of the modern histories of this region. Students will read a variety of primary and secondary materials designed to familiarize them with the historical, cultural, and social processes that have affected and transformed the region in question, and will learn to put these regional histories in a global framework. The course begins with a brief summary of the early modern Islamicate "Gunpowder" Empires—Mughal, Safavid/Qajar, Ottoman—and then moves through several topics of significance: the era of European colonialism; the establishment of the nation state; competing discourses of nationalism; the emergence of Third Worldist and anti-colonial movements; the Israeli- Palestinian conflict; debates over the politics of gender; the effects of the Cold War; the processes of decolonization and the establishment of post-colonial states; the rise of revolutionary Islamism; oil politics and policies; globalization and neoliberalism; 9/11, terrorism, and wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; the Arab uprisings of 2010-2011; and the region's uncertain present and future.

What are the origins of Korean national and cultural identities? How have Korean claims of cultural distinctiveness been manifested and modified over time? Tracing answers to these questions simultaneously helps us to consider how and why Korea has entered America's consciousness. As Korean matters to the US not simply as a fact but as a project, this course avoids portraying Korea through any generalized statements or uncritical categories. Rather, students are encouraged to explore and perspectives on Korea and thereby unravel their own prejudices and agendas. No prior acquaintance with the Korean language is required.

This course begins with the medieval Islamicate Empires — Mughal, Safavid, and Ottoman — and then moves through the end of empire, the colonial era, the establishment of the nation state, and the emergence of modern cultural, political, and religious movements. In doing so, we will situate the histories and social worlds of the region in a global frame, asking how global political and economic transformations have affected the region. At the same time that we attend closely to these histories, we will also examine the ways in which the category of "woman" has been mobilized in popular and political discourses in the 18th-21th centuries, paying particular attention to how Muslim and Middle Eastern women have been represented in various political discourses, as well as how they have represented themselves. Through close readings of both primary sources (in translation) and secondary literature — including historiographical, theoretical, and literary texts as well as film and music— we will also tackle the questions, controversies, and stereotypes that have animated debates in both scholarly and popular literature on such topics as the veil, feminism, revolution, human rights, LGBT issues, masculinity, and war.

By examining the desires and despair of peasants, slaves, rebels, entertainers, and religious minorities, thls course assesses the foundation of the state and the operation of society as manifested at the margins of society. How did the religious and intellectual heritage of Korea legitimize hereditary status, slave ownership, gender division, and regional discrimination? In what ways did ordinary people conform to or struggle against elite governing? Does the longevity of the Chason dynasty testify to the successful control of the status system by those at the top? Or does the stability elucidate social mobility and dynamic interactions across the status divisions? Focusing on various status groups illuminates the mechanisms of domination, compliance, and resistance carried out at the micro level. The experiences of the underrepresented shed light on the transition to modern Korea and present the complicated process of constructing Korean identity over time.

We will listen to capitalism's champions and critics, including state actors, the Church, non-governmental organizations, and organized social movements, and ask how the interplay between them has influenced economies, politics, and culture. Capitalist development and transformation involved elaborate cultural campaigns to win hearts, minds, and bodies to the project, and we will focus on how and why, for example, at its most extreme some people equated capitalism with sin while others found spiritual succor within its logics.

HIST 82.01; X-List: LACS 31 The Politics of Natural Disaster in Latin America In September 2017 two massive hurricanes, Irma and María, swept the Caribbean. As a result, Barbuda was left uninhabitable, Puerto Rico's unofficial death toll was estimated in the thousands, and Dominica resembled a war zone. Hundreds of thousands were left without electricity and potable water in a region that was already suffering from stagnating economies and humanitarian crises. These natural events and their unnatural consequences laid bare the region's legacy of colonialism, underdevelopment, and failing infrastructures. Things will never go back to the way they were before. Yet, these events are hardly unique in the Caribbean and Latin American experience. Latin America, and the Caribbean region within it, have not only been shaped by human development but also by natural events. Hurricanes and earthquakes—the two natural events this course focuses on—have transformed the region's landscape. This course seeks to answer the question of what can the history of natural disasters teach us about political structures, national projects, and social relations. Through interdisciplinary readings, students will use secondary and primary materials, including chronicles, art, and news reports to explore how natural events have shaped human societies.

Covering more than a two hundred year stretch, we will move across an expansive geography encompassing North Africa, the Levant, the Arabian Peninsula, and parts of Central Asia. Throughout this journey, particular attention will be paid to five important themes: imperialism, modernization, nationalism, Islam, and revolution. In the process of navigating these seminal topics, we will develop a more nuanced understanding of the modern Middle East and a greater p;appreciation for the insights offered by primary sources, from poems and national speeches to songs and motion-pictures, into the region's dynamic past. We will begin with a basic question – what and where is the Middle East? – prior to exploring the impact, importance, and mechanics of empires (Ottoman, French, British). Once elucidating this imperial backdrop, we will study sweeping reforms, struggles for independence, and the fashioning of nation-states, before examining a series of revolutionary moments, America's presence in the Middle East, and the "Arab Spring" and its aftermath. Whenever possible, we will strive to illuminate ordinary people, as opposed to only elite actors, who contributed to the making of the modern Middle East. Dist: INT or SOC; WCult: NW.

By employing a range of discussions of China's nationalist discourse, we will encounter and construe the voices of various groups of people for whom the rhetoric and ideology of nationalism emerged as a question or dilemma, developed as a motivating force, and fermented as a problem. The course proceeds chronologically, beginning in the late nineteenth century and moving to the present. Each week's readings, including primary and secondary texts, also discuss particular aspects of nationalism and its connection to China's revolutionary agenda. Focusing on China and its Asian surroundings, this course will explore major historical themes, including reform versus revolution, intellectuals and society, center and locality, ethnicity and identity, violence and confrontation, foreign relations and national strategies, charisma and mass movements, and nation-building and propaganda.

HIST 92.07; X-LIST: AAAS 61.05, LACS 39 Black Agrarian Democracy: Haitian History from Revolution to the Fall of the Duvalier Dictatorship The course explores the historical struggle between democracy and authoritarianism in Haiti throughout its two hundred seventeen years of independence as a free black nation, which also makes the island one of the oldest sovereign countries in the Western Hemisphere. To understand the island's history, students are expected to read what historians and writers have written about Haiti; and to read the primary letters of frantic French planters, rebellious African slaves, egalitarian peasants, entreprenurial market women, conscientious revolutionaries, exuberant military generals, loquacious politicians, feared dictators, and dreaded militias through time. The course will, indeed, move through four important, though overlapping, historical moments. First, we begin with an examination of the 1791-1804 Haitian Revolution when enslaved Africans revolted against the French colonial planters to successfully abolish slavery and to achieve national independence. Second, we read through the formation of grassroots and institutional democratic traditions in the nineteenth century and how they were undone during the 1915-1934 US Occupation of Haiti, where US President Woodrow Wilson ordered the American military to invade Haiti and control the island for almost two decades. Third, we will explore how the undoing of democracy led to the rise of the François and Jean-Claude Duvalier dictatorship (1957-1971) and its dreaded militia called the tonton macout militia (often spelled in the following French orthography: tonton macoutes). Finally, we will conclude the class by looking at how and why the Haitian peasantry overthrew the dictatorship to replace it with the democratically elected President Jean-Bertrand Arisitide (1991).

S. occupation of Japan has generated intense scholarly interest and debate. The debate has centered on the effects of the American-directed reform program and the so-called "reverse course" in Occupation policy. Just how significant was the Occupation for the postwar development of Japan? Did it cause a sharp break in modern Japanese history? And to what extent did the United States remake Japan in its own image? Major Distributive (Class of 2023 and Before): AALAC. Major Distributives (Class of 2024 and Beyond): Asia, modern. HIST 96.23 Seminar: West Africa and the Cold War This advanced seminar deals with the history of West Africa and its relationships with global powers in the decades following WWII. This course will trace the socio- cultural, political, and economic struggles, aspirations, and livelihoods of West African nations, their leaders and citizens, as they negotiated global Cold War dynamics during the postwar-era through the contemporary period. We will also consider the legacies of the global Cold War in West Africa. Dist: INT; WCult: NW. Class of 2023 and Before distributives: AALAC.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of History Undergraduate Overview History FAQs for First Year and Transfer Students How to Declare a Major or Minor in History Major Modified Major Minor Transfer Credit Policy Course Descriptions First-Year Seminars Introductory Africa, Asia, Latin America & The Caribbean (AALAC) Europe (EUR) Interregional & Comparative (INTER) United States (US) Seminars & Colloquia Independent Study & Honors Course Schedule 2021-2022 Schedule 2022-2023 Schedule 2023-2024 Schedule Course Syllabi Honors Thesis Program General Timeline Guidelines for the Class of 2022 Guidelines for the Class of 2023 Honors Theses By Year Phi Alpha Theta Honors Society Prizes After Graduation Alumni Update Research Overview Faculty Research Initiatives Dartmouth History Institute Student Research Initiatives and Resources The Dartmouth Vietnam Project History Librarian Research Funding Resources Undergraduate Research Database Student Class Projects Foreign Study News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
