John the Baptist is shown holding Jesus in the Jordan River. Interpreted as the 12 Apostles watch from the bank while two pairs of angels on clouds flank the top corners. A sun with mirrored Hebrew lettering (Tetragrammaton) from which two rays of light emanate, a dove on left and on right the words “This is my beloved Son –hear ye him”, or scripture Luke 9:35 from the Christian Holy Bible. There are 5 known original prints of this plate. Found inside a medical book at Brown University in 2012, the rare illustration was part of a donation by physician Solomon Drowne, Brown class of 1773. Among the surviving engravings, paper and sheet size vary; the Brown University Library copy on laid paper demonstrates the plate print slightly askew.
