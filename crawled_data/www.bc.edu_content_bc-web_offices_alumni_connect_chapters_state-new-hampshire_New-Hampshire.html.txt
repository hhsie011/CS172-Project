Classes, activities, sports, faith, friends, opportunities, abroad experience, environment...all of it contributed to the countless memories that will last a lifetime. Why did you get involved?: After graduation, friends invited me to join the (then called) Boston College Young Alumni Club. I served as Membership Director for three years and remained active until that group merged with the overarching BC Alumni Club. I continued on as a BC Alumni Club member and took on the role of VP for the Western Massachusetts Chapter. I'm now in New Hampshire, where I serve as Chapter Leader. What are your local favorites?: The greater Manchester, New Hampshire area offers so much for those of any age. Lots of free space, sports outlets, lakes/parks/trails, great restaurants, art, history, music...and is a fantastic gateway to the rest of New England. Fun Fact: Happily married to a BC classmate and currently raising four future Eagles! #WeAreBC Alumni Staff Liaison Name: Maria D'Alessandro '11, CGSOM'18 Contact: knoerrm@bc.edu Events ENGAGE WITH US ON EAGLE EXCHANGE!
