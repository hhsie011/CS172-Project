Residents in the apartment units are not required to purchase a meal plan. In addition, the UC has traditional-style student housing, with quad semi-suites in which students are two to a room and four to a bathroom, and semi-suite deluxes, in which two students share a room and a bathroom. Residents in these units, which have no kitchen, are assigned a UC meal plan. The required meal plan can only be used in the UC building, but students can also purchase additional DePaul meal plans for use in DePaul campus buildings. All residents are provided with a bed, desk and compartmentalized closet, with additional furniture where space permits. The UC features a laundry room, air-conditioning and a dining services area, as well as a fitness center and a covered rooftop terrace garden located on the third floor. UC residents have access to meeting rooms, music practice rooms and an art studio. For 2021–2022 rates, visit the UC Web page or call (877) 482-2463. Dining Plan Guidelines and Rates Lincoln Park meal plans provide students a set number of meal allotments per quarter, which vary depending on the plan type and are for personal use only. All meal plans are granted three guest meals for the full academic year. Meal plans also provide students with Flex dollars. Flex dollars can be used for purchases outside of the main dining areas (such as campus cafes) and can be used when classes are not in session (such as spring break). Flex dollars are made available on the first day of each quarter and do roll over from quarter to quarter, but not from year to year. Any Flex dollars remaining at the end of spring quarter will be forfeited. How does my meal plan work? Meal plan account information is encoded directly onto your DePaul ID Card. Simply present your DePaul ID to the cashier and enjoy all-you-care-to-eat dining. Learn more about our Dining Options and Rates.
