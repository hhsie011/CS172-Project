Columbia-China Musculoskeletal Genetic Project The Musculoskeletal Genetics Conference is an important part of the Columbia-China Musculoskeletal Genetic Project, the awardee of the President's Global Innovation Fund - Round 7 at Columbia University. The Project has the long-term aim to establish a joint Columbia-China Musculoskeletal Genetic Center (CCMGC) both at Columbia University and in China. CCMGC have established connections and collaborations with South University of Science and Technology and its Department of Biomedical Engineering, as well as Fudan University Human Phenome Institute (HuPI) directed by Professor Li Jin, Vice President of Fudan University. The Columbia-China Musculoskeletal Project (Center) will focus on measurements and issues in musculoskeletal disorders and envision an open-door policy for multidisciplinary researchers. Researcher in other fields are welcome to bring their equipment and techniques to work side-by-side with our team. The aim of CCMGC is to work with established collaborators to (1) expand research base by including more collaborators and collaborating institutions, (2) to establish an appropriate international collaboration platform in China with mutually agreeable and beneficial guidelines and regulations, and (3) to start scientific exchange programs to rigorously train researchers from both U.S. and China. Principal Investigator X. Edward Guo X. Edward Guo is an expert in bone biomechanics and bioengineering research. As director of Columbia’s Bone Bioengineering Laboratory, he and his team have two major research thrusts. The first focus of their research is developing innovative three-dimensional imaging and modeling techniques for bone microstructure, such as individual trabecula segmentation and plate-rod finite element modeling methods. These novel techniques have been widely used by engineers and clinicians in studying osteoporosis and other metabolic bone diseases. In addition, these techniques have revealed genetic traits in bone microstructure among various racial groups such as Chinese, Caucasians, and African Americans. They are currently assembling teams to study genetic variations in various ethnic groups across China and Asia. More recently, the individual trabecula segmentation technique has discovered early changes in bone microstructure in osteoarthritis, a major disease without therapeutic interventions. The second line of research of Guo’s group is mechanobiology of the skeleton. Using innovative single cell, in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo approaches, they have developed innovative technologies to study cell responses to mechanical Loading and began to reveal the mystery of century old Wolff’s law. Guo joined Columbia in 1996. He holds a BS in applied mechanics/biomechanics from Peking University, 1984, and received his MS in engineering science from Harvard University in 1990. He earned his PhD in medical physics and medical engineering from Harvard-Massachusetts Institute of Technology Division of Health Sciences and Technology in 1994, and did post-doctoral training at the University of Michigan.
