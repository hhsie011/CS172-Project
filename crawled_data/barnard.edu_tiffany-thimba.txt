The liberal arts environment has grown to be a comfortable and familiar community for me through my alma mater so having the opportunity to connect students with that experience is truly rewarding. Plus being in my favorite city, it's clear that Barnard is the perfect place for me! What is your favorite book? The Source of Self-Regard by Toni Morrison -- a graduation gift from my alma mater’s African American Studies department, and one of Morrison’s last published books. Highly recommend! What is your favorite thing to do in NYC? Sit in on live tapings for all my favorite late-night talk shows! What is your favorite place on campus? Definitely the Diana Center, the views from the upper floors are beautiful. What is a random fun fact about yourself? With my high school marching band, I performed in the XLVIII Super Bowl halftime show with Bruno Mars and the Red Hot Chili Peppers! We were field performers for the LED light show!
