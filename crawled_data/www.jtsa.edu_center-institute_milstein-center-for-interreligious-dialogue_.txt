The center focuses particularly on fostering Jewish-Christian and Jewish-Muslim understanding and partnership, and has been a trailblazer in each of these areas. Among its many programs, the MCID cosponsored a major celebration of Jewish-Catholic relations on the 50th anniversary of Nostra Aetate, featuring Archbishop Timothy Dolan. Under a Carnegie Corporation grant it ran three years of workshops on “Judaism and Islam in America,” in collaboration with the Hartford Seminary and the Islamic Society of North America. And it hosted a series of Jewish-Christian-Muslim dialogues around the 10th anniversary of 9/11. The MCID recently published Sharing the Well: A Resource Guide to Jewish-Muslim Engagement, and copublished A Dialogue of Life: Towards the Encounter of Jews and Christians. In addition to interreligious programming, the MCID supports student-driven interreligious activities and engages in a broad range of dialogue beyond JTS, in places such as Rome, Madrid, Doha, Qatar, and Muskat, Oman.
