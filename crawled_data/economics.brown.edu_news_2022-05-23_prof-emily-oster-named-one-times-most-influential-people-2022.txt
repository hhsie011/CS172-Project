Congratulations to Emily Oster, Royce Family Professor of Teaching Excellence and Professor of Economics (and current Economics DGS), who was recently named one of Time Magazine's 100 Most Influential People of 2022! Steven Pinker writes, "A savior for whipsawed mothers is Emily Oster, a professor at Brown—not of pediatrics or psychology but economics. In best-selling books (Expecting Better, Cribsheet, and most recently The Family Firm), her popular newsletter, and social media, Oster weighs trade-offs, distinguishes trivial from substantial risks, and evaluates evidence for causation in a messy world. Enriching this analytical brilliance is the common sense and empathy that come from being a mother herself." More information about Emily and her work can be found on Time.com.
