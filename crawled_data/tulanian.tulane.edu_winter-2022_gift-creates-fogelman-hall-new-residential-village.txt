A gift from real estate magnate Avron B. Fogelman (A&S ’62) and his wife, Wendy (NC ’63), will propel the construction of Fogelman Hall, one of five new buildings in a residential village. Avron B. (A&S ’62) and Wendy Fogelman (NC ’63) have pledged a gift that will propel the construction of Fogelman Hall. Tulane helped prepare Avron Fogelman for a successful career not only in real estate but in professional sports management. Under his co-ownership, the Kansas City Royals baseball team won the 1985 World Series. “The naming of Fogelman Hall in honor of Wendy and me is very meaningful,” Avron Fogelman said. “We both are products of the Tulane residence halls and know how important a freshman dorm is to an incoming student. It is where they live independently for the first time, where they meet lifelong friends, and helps mold the rest of their lives.” Fogelman Hall will house more than 280 residents and will feature a classroom and other amenities that foster round-the-clock academic enrichment. Construction begins this year. Avron Fogelman, his family, and the Wendy and Avron B. Fogelman Foundation have made numerous donations to Tulane through the years, most notably in 1988 with a $1 million pledge that created the Avron B. Fogelman Arena. In 2018 the Fogelmans gave $1 million to establish the Fogelman Life Preparation Program. He served on both the President’s Council and the Board of Tulane in the 1980s. The Fogelmans are also members of the Paul Tulane Society. They have three sons, Rick, Mark (B ’92) and Hal, and two grandchildren who are current Tulane students.
