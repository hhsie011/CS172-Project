The three sections of the emblem denote the three key dimensions of the educational experience at the Hankamer School of Business: Rigorous classroom learning Hands-on, real-world experience A foundation of ethical values The round formation denotes global perspective. Guidelines The Business School logo will be used for all organizations within the Hankamer School of Business. Use the Business Schools logo in conjunction with Baylor Universitys institutional mark. There are two acceptable versions of the logo. One is horizontal. The other is stacked. The combination of the emblem (the three-part circle) and the wordmark (the type treatment of BaylorBusiness) comprise the logo. Do not try to re-create the logo to change the relationship of the wordmark and emblem. Always use the art file. Never distort the proportions of the logo. Stationery and business cards are ordered through Baylors Printing Procurement Office. When ordering, indicate that the Baylor Business logo should also be used (it will be used in conjunction with Baylor Universitys institutional mark). For any other usage, or to request digital files, please contact the Communications & Marketing Department at the Hankamer School of Business, x3495.
