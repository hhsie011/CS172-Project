Advent Reflections During the four weeks of Advent, we prepare for the celebration of Christ's birth through prayer and reflection. We contemplate the First Coming of Jesus as Savior and anticipate his promised Second Coming. And amid the flurry of Christmas preparations, we look for practical ways to observe the holiness of the season in our everyday lives. Read Advent Reflections Lenten Reflections Lent is a season of repentance and renewal. We turn away from our sinfulness and recommit ourselves to following Jesus. Ignatian contemplation and reflective prayer encourage us in the season of Lent. Throughout the season of Lent, a member of the BC community shares his or her thoughts on the season and the importance of passing on the faith. A new reflection is posted on Friday for each week of Lent.
