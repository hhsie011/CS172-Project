Contact Us Big Red Auction 19 Bid big and be a winner in this year's Big Red One-day Online Auction for the United Way. All proceeds from the auction go towards the Cornell United Way Campaign, which means they go directly to help people in need. Bidding starts at 12:01 a.m. and ends at 11:59 p.m. on Friday, March 8. Anyone can view auction items but in order to bid, you will need to set up an account. The process is quick and very little information is required. The Extended Bidding option automatically extends the end time of an item by 3 minutes when it receives a bid during the final 3 minutes. This process repeats until no new bids are received during the final 3 minutes of the item bidding window or the auction has been extended for a maximum of 30 minutes beyond the original end time. When an auction is extended, you will see Extended Bidding messages displayed throughout the auction with a link for easily viewing all of the extended items. Contact Susan Riley at sfr4@cornell.edu if you have auction questions. ***Come visit often, as items are being added daily.*** About Cornell United Way Campaign This year’s United Way campaign theme of “New Possibilities” is an important reminder that together we can help families and individuals throughout Tompkins and neighboring counties.
