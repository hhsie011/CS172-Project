Please note: Students with one year of eligible transferrable course units may enter as sophomores; students with two years of transferrable course units may enter as juniors.* Students with the equivalent of one full-time year or more of postsecondary education by the time of enrollment should apply as transfer students. Students with less than one full-time year by the time of enrollment are encouraged to apply as first-year students. No course credit can be transferred through the first-year admission process. Students may not transfer for higher standing than fall of junior year entry. Students who are dual-enrolled in both a high school and college program should apply as first-year students. Students who have earned college credits before completing high school cannot transfer those college credits to a Princeton undergraduate degree. Students who have already attained an undergraduate bachelor’s degree or its equivalent are not eligible to apply for transfer admission, or for first-year admission, as Princeton does not grant second bachelor's degrees. However, students are eligible to apply for transfer admission if they have attained an associate’s degree. * In all cases, eligible transferrable course units and year of entry are determined by Princeton faculty and the college deans. Credit Transfer To be eligible to transfer for credit, a course must be completed at an accredited postsecondary institution. The fulfillment of Princeton’s general education requirements is prioritized in awarding transfer credit. Generally, departmental requirements for majors and certificate programs may not be fulfilled through transfer credit. To learn more about what types of courses may fulfill our general education requirements, please review the Undergraduate Announcement.
