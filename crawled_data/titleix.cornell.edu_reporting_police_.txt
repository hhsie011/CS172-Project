Police have a unique legal authority to seek and execute search warrants, to collect forensic evidence that may have been left at relevant locations, and to make an arrest when there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed. Individuals have the right to make a report to Cornell University Police, local law enforcement, and/or state police or choose not to report; or to report to Cornell. An individual may pursue either, both, or neither of these options. Reports to the university and law enforcement may be made simultaneously. Individuals may contact the Police directly. Alternatively, students may seek assistance from a Title IX Coordinator when notifying the police. A Title IX Coordinator can assist in setting up an initial meeting with the police. Questions about whether the reported prohibited conduct constitutes a penal law violation should be addressed to law enforcement. Reporting to Law Enforcement Law Enforcement can be reached at any time by calling “911” for emergencies or one of the numbers listed below.

New York State Penal Law: Sexual offenses (including rape and sexual abuse), family offenses, and stalking are crimes in New York State. Under the New York State penal code, lack of consent results from (a) forcible compulsion, (b) incapacity to consent, (c) no express or implied acquiescence, where the offense charged is sexual abuse or forcible touching, or (d) clear expression of non-consent, where the offense charged is rape. New York State law states that a person in incapable of consent when he or she is (a) under the age of 17, (b) mentally disabled, (c) mentally incapacitated, (d) physically helpless, or (e) committed to the care of the state. In New York State, “family offenses” are certain violations of the penal code, including but not limited to harassment, sexual abuse, stalking, and menacing, committed by a family member or intimate partner that have created a substantial risk of physical or emotional harm to a person or a person’s child. Under the New York State penal code, stalking is an intentional course of conduct directed at a specific person who causes harm to the mental or emotional distress of that person, fear for their health, safety or property, or the health, safety or property of their family or acquaintances, or fear that their employment, business or career is threatened.
