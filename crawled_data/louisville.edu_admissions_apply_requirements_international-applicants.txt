Graduate applicants are eligible to apply directly to their major department for consideration for competitive teaching or research assistantships. Every applicant must submit appropriate official financial documents. If you are submitting proof of personal funds, please attach an original bank official's letter verifying that you or your family has the total necessary funds on deposit. For government, agency or employer financial support, please provide an original letter from the sponsor stating the amount and duration of the scholarship and validity for attendance at the University of Louisville. If you will have a U.S. sponsor, they should complete the Affidavit of Support I-134 form and provide the necessary documents. This can be obtained from the immigration website. Notification of admission decision: When you have submitted all credentials, undergraduate applicants will be reviewed by the Office of Admissions, and graduate applicants will be reviewed by the departmental admissions advisers. The respective office and personnel will make a decision, and you will be notified. Please do not make arrangements for travel to the U.S. until you receive a written offer of admission from UofL and approval of your I-20 or DS 2019 form. If you are currently an F1/J1 student in the U.S. Please obtain a Transfer Recommendation Form from the International Center. Send a copy of your current I-20 or DS2019, visa page and I-94 card to the International Center-UofL. The form I-20 or DS2019 from UofL cannot be issued until the Recommendation Form; I-20, visa page and I-94 card copies have been received. You will also need to be transferred electronically in SEVIS by your current school. Admission to UofL is for a specific level of study in a particular school. Admission for one level of study in a given subject does not mean that admission to a higher level, or to another subject, will follow. Admission as a nondegree, special, or conditional student does not imply that candidacy for a degree will result later; nor does study in pre-professional or undergraduate classes assure admission to a professional or graduate program. Successful completion of the Intensive English as a Second Language (IESL) Program does not guarantee admission to an academic program unless such a written commitment has been made to you. NOTE: UofL does not usually admit international applicants as non-degree or special students. When you have met all requirements of the Office of Admissions and the International Center, UofL will issue the Certificate of Eligibility (Form I-20 for Student F1 Visa or DS 2019 for Exchange Visitor J1). This certificate is necessary to obtain a U.S. visa. The form will verify your eligibility for admission as determined by your academic qualifications, level of English proficiency, and confirmation of financial support. The estimated cost of one academic year's study will also be included. You will need to pay the SEVIS fee prior to making a visa interview appointment. The certificate, along with a valid passport, proof of sufficient financial support for your studies, and receipt showing payment of the SEVIS fee should be taken to the U.S. Consulate or Embassy in your home country at the time of your visa interview. Questions concerning the I-20 or DS 2019 may be e-mailed to the International Center Your decision to study in the U.S. will require thoughtful planning. We recommend that you contact the local U.S. Consulate/ Embassy for advice and reference materials about U.S. colleges and universities. You may address all inquires to: Office of Admissions, Dept.
