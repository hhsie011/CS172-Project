Eligibility To be eligible to participate in Intramural Sports programming, participants must have an active Wellness and Recreation membership. Users with guest passes and family recreation memberships are not eligible for intramural sports. For membership information, please click here. Default Form As a courtesy to opponents and to avoid being charged with a forfeit fee, teams may default a scheduled game through the MyWellRec Portal, if they are unable to attend. All defaults must be made known to the Sports Programs office by 3 p.m. on the game day. For games scheduled on Saturday or Sunday, the notification must be made by 3 p.m. on Friday. Playoff Reschedule Requests Due to facility space and time limitations, playoff games through the Round of 16 will not be rescheduled. For quarterfinal, semifinal, and championship games, team captains will have the opportunity to fill out the Intramural Sports Playoff Reschedule Request Form at least 48 hours before your scheduled game. Sports Programs staff will review these requests, but it is not guaranteed conflicts can be avoided.
