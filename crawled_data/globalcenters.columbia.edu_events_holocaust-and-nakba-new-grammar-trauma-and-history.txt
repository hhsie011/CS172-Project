8:00 PM Columbia Global Centers | Amman Following the publication of his recent co-edited book, The Holocaust and the Nakba: A New Grammar of Trauma and History, Bashir's talk will examine how and why the Holocaust and the Nakba are interlinked without blurring fundamental differences between them. While these two foundational tragedies are often discussed separately and in abstraction from the constitutive historical global contexts of nationalism and colonialism, his talk will explore the historical, political, and cultural intersections between them. Bashir will argue that these intersections are embedded in cultural imaginations, colonial and asymmetrical power relations, realities, and structures. Critically investigating these intersections, he will claim, paves the way for a new political, historical, and moral grammar that enables decolonization in Palestine. Bashir Bashir is a Palestinian political theorist based in Jerusalem. He is a senior research fellow at the Van Leer Jerusalem Institute. His primary research interests are nationalism and citizenship studies, democratic theory, liberalism, decolonization, and the politics of reconciliation. Bashir is co-editor of The Politics of Reconciliation in Multicultural Societies (Oxford University Press, 2008) and The Holocaust and the Nakba: A New Grammar of Trauma and History (Columbia University Press, 2018). Auditorium seats are assigned to ticket holders on a first-come, first-serve basis. If you arrive after the auditorium has reached full capacity, you will be seated in an adjacent live-streaming room. Thank you for understanding.
