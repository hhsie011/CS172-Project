In preparation for this meeting, you will need to complete your self-appraisal. The self-appraisal gives you an opportunity to promote your contributions and achievements this fiscal year and discuss your professional development needs. Please use the Online Performance Appraisal System to complete your self-appraisal. If you need assistance with the system, there is also an online training module. You should consult with your supervisor about the deadline for completing your self-appraisal online. If you have any questions about the Performance Appraisal process or using the Online Performance Appraisal System, please contact either Ufuoma Pela (x3-5294, upela@upenn.edu) or Jalil Shafi (x8-7568, jshafi@upenn.edu). Merit Increase Program Penn’s merit increase program recognizes and rewards the contributions of our faculty and staff. Each year, the University establishes a salary increase pool based on market trends and economic conditions. Schools and centers use this pool to provide salary increases as merited by performance. Performance appraisals must be completed for all eligible staff to support the merit increases. Please click here for information on merit increase guidelines, timeline, and eligibility information. 122 College Hall University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia, PA 19104 215-898-5000 provost@upenn.edu ©2022 University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104 Footer Menu University of Pennsylvania Penn Directory Site Credits
