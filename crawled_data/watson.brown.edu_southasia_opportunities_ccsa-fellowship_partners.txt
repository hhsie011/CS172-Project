The term 'quality of life' as defined by Janaagraha has two distinct and inter-related aspects. The first aspect concerns the 'quality of urban infrastructure and services'. The second aspect accounts for the 'quality of citizenship' - the role that urban residents play by participating in civic issues. Founded in 2001 by Ramesh and Swati Ramanathan, Janaagraha started as a movement to enable citizen participation in public governance. It has now evolved into a robust institution for Citizenship and Democracy. For more information, see www.janaagraha.org.
