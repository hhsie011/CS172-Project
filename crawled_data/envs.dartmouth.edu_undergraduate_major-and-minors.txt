We also offer a minor in environmental science and a minor in environmental studies, including a specific sustainability track within the environmental studies minor. Undergraduates may also use our courses to modify a major in a discipline such as biology, geography, government, economics, and earth sciences. The Major The major in environmental studies requires introductory courses, core courses, elective focus courses, and the culminating experience course (see ENVS major worksheet below). We believe the interdisciplinary nature of environmental studies requires this number of courses to ensure students gain fundamental skills in the areas of environmental science and studies before they move into elective focus courses. The prerequisites ensure that students have an introduction to a physical science lab science, an understanding of the economic system (since all environmental problems include economic considerations) and calculus so students will have basic quantitative skills used in more advanced environmental studies courses. The core courses cover a body of knowledge considered fundamental to understanding the relationships between people and their environment, namely, global environmental science, environmental decision making and risk, environmental ethics and the legal system, and political institutions and their role in environmental issues. This core of intermediate level courses provides a unifying set of concepts and principles related to the analysis of complex environmental issues. The elective focus courses give each student the opportunity to develop an area of emphasis around a theme of their choosing. These courses must be approved as part of the Student Major Plan which must include the rationale for the elective courses. The culminating experience in the major is fulfilled by ENVS 50, 84, 85 or 91. Major and Minor Advising The best source of advice is from a member of the ENVS faculty. This is important because the ENVS major is wide-ranging and flexible. Engaging with a faculty advisor as early as possible can therefore be instrumental in designing a curriculum that best meets your needs. To get things started, students should meet with the ENVS program administrator, Kim Wind, to review the major worksheet along with the general structure and requirements of the major. Please feel free to email Kim at Kim.Wind@Dartmouth.edu to set up an appointment or stop by her office in 112 Steele Hall.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Environmental Studies Undergraduate Overview Major and Minors Culminating Experience ENVS 50 Archive Minor Tracks Courses Sample Syllabi Waitlists and Applications Transfer Term Credit Honors Recent Honors Theses Learning Outcomes Graduate Foreign Study Overview Africa FSP Syllabi and Documents Paulson Fellowships Research Overview Student Research and Internships Faculty Research Fields Hornig Library of Environmental Studies Community Overview Careers Alumni Stories Office of Sustainability Dartmouth Organic Farm Sustainability Solutions Café Past Café Events News & Events News & Events Past Events Archive People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
