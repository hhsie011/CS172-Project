Gisela Winckler I am a physicist and isotope geochemist interested in climate and biogeochemistry at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, a key component of the Earth Institute at Columbia University WHAT’s NEW? May 16, 2016 Ocean dynamics, not dust, have controlled equatorial Pacific productivity over the past 500,000 years Our new paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences presents paired records of dust flux and export production from three sites across the equatorial Pacific and shows that ocean dynamics, rather than dust input, control biological productivity over the past five ice age cycles. We take advantage of Earth’s own repeated natural iron fertilization experiments over the past 500,000 years to conclude that dust-born iron was not a key player in driving the carbon cycle in the tropical Pacific. Purposefully adding iron to the tropical Pacific, one of the proposed geoengineering efforts, will not work to mitigate the anthropogenic increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide.

We dated the surfaces of huge boulders (the size of a delivery truck), deposited by a massive wave up on a plateau on the Island of Santiago, about 50km away from Fogo: the dates of these boulders (~ 73,000 years) are consistent and match the timing of the Fogo flank collapse.

I was awarded the ‘Excellence in Mentoring’ Award (with Natalie Boelman). I am humbled and thrilled. Thank you all!

January 26, 2015 Fire and Ice: Exploring Connections on Land and at Sea Ice ages have waxed and waned for millions of years. So have volcanic eruptions, maybe, on roughly the same scale. Could the two processes be related? A team of Lamont-Doherty scientists traveled to the Pacific Northwest last fall to find out in an oceanographic expedition aboard the R/V Atlantis. They collected deep-sea sediments and sub-surface lava deposits and mapped the seafloor with seismic techniques under the Volcanoes, Ocean Ice and Carbon Experiments (VOICE) project.

Dust deposition during glacial periods was 3 times greater than during interglacials.

YAY! Congratulations, Ale. ***************************************************************************************************************** Michael Kaplan (L-DEO), Kathy Licht (IUPUI) and I have recently started a new project, funded by the National Science Foundation, to study the timing and extent of advances of the East Antarctic ice sheet in the past. Integrating field work, geochemical analyses and cutting-edge isotope-based dating tools we aim to develop a record of fluctuations in the East Antarctic ice sheet and to identify past changes in both ice sheet flow direction and bedrock composition.

The goal is to improve our global compilation of dust records, over the past glacial cycle (~130kyr), such that we can understand how and why dust properties and fluxes change, and the impacts of these changes on climate and biogeochemistry For a recent blog about the DUSTSPEC workshop, please click here March 2010 Our new paper, published in Geophysical Research Letters in March 2010, presents the first observation of mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal activity in the Southern Ocean. Image of a black smoker from the East Pacific Rise Compilation of known vent sites (German and van Damm, 2003). So far, no vent sites were known in the South Pacific South of 38S. Our results indicate hydrothermal activity along the Pacific Antarctic Ridge (blue square) Analyzing a large tracer data set, collected as part of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment for ocean circulation studies, we identify a previously unobserved locus of hydrothermal venting into the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. Combining the geochemical information provided by the helium isotope anomaly (Helium-3 is highly enriched in mantle-derived vent fluids) with independent hydrographic information from the Southern Ocean Database we could trace the source of the hydrothermal input to the Pacific Antarctic Ridge, one of the major global mid-ocean ridge systems, which has until now been a ‘blank spot’ on the global map of hydrothermal venting. Beyond being interesting from a geochemical view point, our results have important oceanographic and climatic implications.
