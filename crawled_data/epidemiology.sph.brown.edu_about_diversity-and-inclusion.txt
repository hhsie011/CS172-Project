The scope for consideration includes hiring and advancement of faculty and staff, recruitment and support of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, the content of the curriculum, and the climate of the Department as a community. By engaging faculty, staff, students, and postdocs and pursuing this agenda on multiple fronts, the long-term goal is to effect change that is consequential and sustainable, fully integrating these goals into the departmental processes.
