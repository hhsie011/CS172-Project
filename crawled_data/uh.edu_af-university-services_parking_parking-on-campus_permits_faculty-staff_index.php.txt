Disability Permits University employees and/or students who have a permanent disability and require a university disability parking permit may either submit the required documents in person at the Welcome Center Parking Garage, or via email to parking@uh.edu. Applicants must complete an Authorization for Accessible Parking form and present a copy of the state placard or a copy of the TX DOT D-12 form with a doctor’s signature or a license plate verification receipt, along with a current driver’s license and Cougar One Card. Disability parking authorization will be valid for the time remaining on the state-issued disabled parking placard or license plate. Re-authorization will be required upon receipt of a new state- issued disabled parking placard or license plate. University permanent disability parking permits must be renewed annually. Faculty/staff and students wishing to renew their UH disability parking permit may do so online through myParking Account at AccessUH, if a copy of their Disability Parking Authorization form is on file. Renewing students may charge the parking fee to their student account and pay it along with their other university charges, or pay via credit card online. Faculty/staff may authorize payroll deduction or pay via credit card online. Permit Placement and Replacement The UH parking permit should be displayed from the vehicle’s rearview mirror, or in some cases, on the front windshield, above the registration sticker, while parked on campus. Any vehicle displaying an open air permit that is not affixed directly to the vehicle will be in violation and subjected to citation. Lost, stolen, or damaged decals/permits must be reported to PTS. The replacement fee for the first lost/stolen permit is $50. Subsequent replacements in the same permit year will be at market rate. Damaged permits will be replaced at no charge provided the recognizable remnants of the old decal are returned. The use of lost, stolen, altered, or forged permit may result in a $100 fine plus the cost of the permit and is subject to tow. Motorcycle and moped operators must display the decal in a location that allows it to be visible at all times. Suggested locations are front or rear fender. Motorcycles and mopeds must parked in areas designated for their use. Faculty/Staff Gated Permits Each year incumbents have first option of renewal.
