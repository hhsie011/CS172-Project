You can find basic information on how the Division partners with students on this page, however we would also encourage you to review information on the Georgia Tech Parent & Family Programs web site for more engagement opportunities. Hospitalizations and Emergencies In the case of a student hospitalization or emergency, a parent or designated emergency contact will be contacted by the Office of the Vice President for Student Life and Dean of Students. During this phone call information might be limited, however the staff member will provide a general account of the incident, the hospital where the student was taken, and the information for the hospital (phone number, address, web site). Our staff will remain in contact with you to gather details and coordinate Institute resources as necessary. Emergency Contact Information Each student is required to register emergency contact information with the Institute through the web portal "BuzzPort." As parents and family members you are unable to access or update this information. Therefore, we ask that you work with your student to assure that the emergency contact information listed is accurate. Contacting the Office of the Vice President for Student Life and Dean of Students The Office of the Vice President for Student Life and Dean of Students should be contacted when your student does not sound like themselves, this can include, but is not limited to times of extreme stress, academic trouble, issues within a family affecting a student in their academic endeavors, or in the case of health problems or an incident which would impede their success at Tech. The Office of the Vice President for Student Life and Dean of Students can be contacted Monday - Friday, 8:00- 5:00 pm at (404) 894-2564. Outside of these hours, contact the Georgia Tech Police Department at (404) 894-2500. When contacting the Office of the Vice President for Student Life and Dean of Students keep in mind that the Office does comply with FERPA regulations to protect student privacy. Parental Notification Policy for Alcohol and Other Drugs Parents/guardians of students under the age of twenty-one may be notified when a student is found responsible for violating the Georgia Tech Student Policy on Alcohol and Other Drugs when any of the following occur: Students endanger themselves or other students while under the influence of alcohol or other substances. Specific instances include DUI, fighting, alcohol poisoning, and hospitalization. When the Dean of Students determines that any future violations of the Institute's policy will most likely result in suspension from Georgia Tech.
