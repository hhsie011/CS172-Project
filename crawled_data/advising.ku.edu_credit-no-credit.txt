Always check the deadlines on the KU Academic Calendar. What is Credit/No Credit? Credit/No Credit (CR/NC) is a policy that allows you to take courses without receiving final grades that factor into your GPA calculations. If you are enrolled an CR/NC course: Credit (CR) is earned if you receive a grade of A through C-. CR fulfills degree requirements and allows you to move forward in course sequencing. No Credit (NC) is earned if you receive a grade D+ through F for a course. NC does not fulfill degree requirements. This option is usually available for a limited time at the beginning of a semester, between the 21st and 30th instructional day. Read the full Credit/No Credit policy. Who should I consult with before electing to take a class for CR/NC? Your academic advisor - listed in Jayhawk GPS within "Your Success Team" Your major, minor, or future major department when considering electing CR/NC for a class that will count towards degree requirements. Notice: CR/NC allowance is up to the major/minor department or professional school you plan on graduating from, not the department in which you are taking the course. Example: Pre-Business students should consult with the School of Business before taking any degree requirements for CR/NC for MATH 115, ACCT 200, etc. Check on your current grade and points left possible in a class before electing to take it for CR/NC. It may be helpful to calculate your GPA and/or consult with the Office of Financial Aid & Scholarships for assistance. Why might I opt-in to Credit/No Credit? Some students choose this option if they want to prevent a low grade in a class from damaging a GPA but still need to earn credit and complete the class. (CR) Credit - fulfills degree requirements, and allows you to move forward in course sequencing. (NC) No Credit - does not fulfill degree requirements. Receiving NC for a course can often lead to a student having to repeat the course if it is still needed to graduate. What courses are eligible? This varies greatly per class. It's important to consider why you are taking a course. Is it a KU Core requirement? Is it a class you are taking for admission into a Professional School or Graduate level program? Is it a class that is required for your major? Is it a class that is needed for licensure? These are all questions academic units consider. Typically, CR/NC may not be used for classes in your major or minor. There are also courses that require a final grade due to licensure requirements. Some programs use "default" grades for students who take classes as CR/NC when it comes to calculating GPA for admission purposes. How do I opt-in? Fill out the online Credit/No Credit Election form for spring and/or fall. You can also access the forms in your Enroll & Pay account. To reverse any CR/NC decisions you have made, complete the Rescind Credit/No Credit form. You will need to use your KU online ID and password to log in. Have a question?
