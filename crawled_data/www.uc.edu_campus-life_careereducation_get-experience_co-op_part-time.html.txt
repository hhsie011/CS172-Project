For example, many non-profit organizations and start-ups not only employ students but also partner with our faculty to create academic courses in which students work on real-world problems and come up with real-world solutions. In addition, we are working with employers to develop more project work and remote work for students. Such flexibility will make quality, supervised, major-related, compensated work experiences more accessible to all UC students, including those who must maintain part-time jobs, those who take courses while working to stay on track academically, and those who have had little to no professional preparation or work experience prior to starting at UC. What does this mean for me? By integrating quality work experiences into your education, you can: gain professional, major-related work experience while still a student develop cross-cutting skills (also called transferable skills) that are valued by every employer, and learn how to talk about those skills confidently in an interview evaluate potential career options expand your professional network enhance your resume earn income On-Campus Co-op In addition to the benefits to be gained from any co-op experience, an on-campus co-op is conveniently located right on campus and can fit easily into your schedule at only five to 20 hours per week.
