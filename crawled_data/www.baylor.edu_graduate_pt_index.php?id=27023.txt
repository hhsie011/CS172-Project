Our program also selects applicants from within the active duty and reserve forces to transfer into our program from other military occupational specialties. Following basic officer initial entry training, these officers engage in 30 months of entry-level physical therapy training to receive the doctorate of physical therapy degree (DPT). Upon graduation, our graduates are well-prepared to serve in two unique professions - as an active-duty officer and as a military physical therapist. This military physical therapy program is located at the historic Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas and is the Home of Military Medicine.
