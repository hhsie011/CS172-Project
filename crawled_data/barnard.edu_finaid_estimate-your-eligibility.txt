Financial Aid Calculators MyinTuition Quick College Cost Estimator The MyinTuition Quick College Cost Estimator asks six basic financial questions and will provide your family with an estimated range of your financial aid eligibility. Net Price Calculator The College Board’s Net Price Calculator requires more in-depth financial information to provide a more detailed estimate of your family contribution and awards. You will need a copy of your parents’ 2020 federal tax return and W-2 forms, as well as information related to parent and student assets, to use this tool. Circumstances that may impact your estimated eligibility The following circumstances may impact the results of the calculators: Number of siblings in college (Barnard considers siblings enrolled full-time in an undergraduate program only. Siblings in graduate school, medical school, law school, or other graduate or certificate programs are not included in our formula.) Family businesses, corporations, and partnerships Families with divorced or separated parents (Barnard suggests completing the calculator separately for each parent and combining the results.) If you have questions about the accuracy of the calculators, please feel free to email our office at finaid@barnard.edu. Please Note: The calculators will be updated in October of 2021 to provide estimates for those applying in the fall/spring of 2022/2023. As you use the calculators, please keep in mind: The calculators are intended for U.S. citizens and permanent residents only. The estimated results will only be as reliable as the data you provide. This is not an application for admission or financial aid. The cost of attendance, estimated family contribution (EFC), and estimated awards are based on Barnard’s financial aid policies for the 2021-2022 academic year. The policies may change and could affect the EFC and award at the time of admission. The budget for 2022-2023 will be updated in the spring of 2022. If the applicant’s parents are divorced or separated, the calculator should be completed by the custodial and noncustodial parents individually. The separate parent contributions should then be added together for the final family contribution.
