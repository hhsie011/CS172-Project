We augment standard approaches, which may miss interaction effects, with machine learning and systems-level network models of integrated data. We are particularly interested in developing systems/network models of human immune response to vaccines and neuropsychiatric disorders. Our data-driven algorithms draw from the fields of machine learning, information theory, network theory, mathematical modeling, physics, and statistical learning. We develop algorithms to integrate static and time-course data, next-generation sequence, transcriptomic, structural and functional MRI, and genome-wide association data into mechanistic models for disease susceptibility prediction and identification of therapeutic targets.
