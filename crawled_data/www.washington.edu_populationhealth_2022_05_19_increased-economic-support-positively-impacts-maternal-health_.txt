They found an inverse correlation between more generous EITC payments and the risks in question, highlighting the benefits of anti-poverty policies on health issues. Federal EITC subsidies are provided to low-income working families in the U.S., and supplemental EITC programs vary across states. The team analyzed these disparities across states, focusing on mothers who had given birth in the previous two to four months across all income levels. Researchers collected data from these mothers before and after giving birth regarding their alcohol consumption and symptoms of depression. Sociodemographic data and factors such as level of education were also considered in drawing conclusions. The data overall showed lower percentages of these risks in states that offered more generous supplemental EITC payments. The study ultimately reflects the importance of examining policies across issues and disciplines to target health-specific challenges. Learn More > What is population health?
