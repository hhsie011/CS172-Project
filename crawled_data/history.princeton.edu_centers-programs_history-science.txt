The Program in History of Science at Princeton University trains students to analyze science, medicine, and technology in both historical and cultural context. History of Science at Princeton is rooted in our tradition of analyzing the technical and conceptual dimensions of scientific knowledge, whether that knowledge emcompasses chemistry, psychoanalysis, or evolutionary theory. Yet even as we investigate the minutiae of such knowledge, students are encouraged to consider scientific ideas and practices in the widest possible context.
