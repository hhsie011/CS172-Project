TI:GER (Technology Innovation: Generating Economic Results) is a unique, transdisciplinary program that has prepared MBA students for careers in technology innovation since 2002. TI:GER combines classroom instruction, innovation projects, group activities, and real-world experience into a total, immersive, practical education throughout three terms of the MBA program. For students whose objective is to become technology innovators – in early-stage high-growth ventures, in consultancies, or in corporate positions in finance, marketing, operations, or strategy – the TI:GER experience provides essential skills, tacit knowledge, and networks for success. MBA students in the TI:GER program work with PhD students from Georgia Tech’s engineering, computing, and science colleges to translate ideas into successful technology innovations. Students learn from faculty, a vast network of industry mentors – including more than 700 TI:GER alumni – and other experts while working on technology-innovation projects. TI:GER is the educational program for the Creative Destruction Lab (CDL-Atlanta), which is a global milestone-based mentoring program for massively-scalable science-based startups. CDL-Atlanta is directed and operated from the Strategy and Innovation academic area at Scheller College. CDL-Atlanta currently offers the Commerce stream, which brings venture founders together with mentors and advisors who are experienced, exited entrepreneurs, leading scientists, and active investors. They help founders scale ventures whose technologies support the transformation of retail industries, including consumer packaged goods and commercial-exchange markets. The curriculum in the TI:GER program prepares Georgia Tech MBA and PhD students to work with CDL-Atlanta startups. For MBA and PhD students who want to work with CDL ventures, gaining admission to the TI:GER program and successfully completing the TI:GER courses in the first spring term are prerequisites to CDL-Atlanta participation in the second and third terms of the TI:GER program. TI:GER students have benefitted from: A competitive advantage in getting jobs and advancing their careers.
