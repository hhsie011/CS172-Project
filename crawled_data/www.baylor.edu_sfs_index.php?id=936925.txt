These students will automatically be placed on the All Access 5 Days per Week meal plan if no meal plan is selected. Your Fall selection will carry forward to the Spring semester unless you request a change. Who is a Freshman? For meal plan purposes, "Freshmen" are high school graduates who have not attended higher education for either a Fall or Spring semester after their high school graduation. This classification covers the first academic year the student is enrolled at Baylor. Students who complete college hours during high school, and/or attend another university during the summer, and matriculate at Baylor in the Fall are deemed "Freshmen" for the Fall and Spring semesters. Students graduating from high school in December and matriculating at Baylor in the Spring are considered "Freshmen" for only the Spring semester. Brooks and Teal residents selecting the All Access 5 Days per Week meal plan will have access Sunday dinner through Friday lunch. Voluntary Residents and Commuters can choose from any of the meal plans above. All weekly meal plans (All Access 7 Days per Week and all Block Plans) are Saturday breakfast through Friday dinner. All meal plans include 5 guest passes per semester. Prices include 8.25% sales tax. Adding, Changing, or Dropping Pricing and Processing You can request meal plan changes in BearWeb --> Student Financial Services --> Student Account --> Meal Plans Add/Change. Meal Plan prices are valid through the first day of class. Reductions & Meal Plan Drops: Reductions or Meal Plan drops may only be made through Friday of the second week of classes. During the first two weeks of classes, any refunds or changes are calculated on a prorated daily rate and will be applied to any outstanding balance on your student account. After the second week of classes, you may only request a Meal Plan be added or increased. Meal Plan Additions or Increases: Meal Plans may be added or increased at any time during the semester. Block Meal Plans IMPORTANT! Block Meal Plans are charged on a per semester basis, regardless of the date the plan is added. Adding a Block Meal Plan at any time during the semester will be charged at the price per semester and will not be prorated based on the date added. Credits will not be refunded based on the number of meals used. Adding Dining Dollars We recently added the option to purchase additional Dining Dollars separately on the student account.
