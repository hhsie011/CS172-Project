A BSE degree is the degree for a student who wishes to practice engineering after graduation or who is interested in more technical coursework relating to the engineering field. The BAS program is designed for the student who does not plan to work as a professional engineer, but rather wants a customized education that combines other interests and technology in a manner unique to his/her career goals.
