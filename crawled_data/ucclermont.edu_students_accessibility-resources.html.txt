Accessibility Resources office at the University of Cincinnati Clermont College is to give students with disabilities the opportunity to achieve their academic goals. Starting on March 17, 2020, the office of Testing Services will not be proctoring in-person exams until further notice. During this unprecedented time we will work diligently each day to reduce potential impacts on you, your family, and our community while continuing in our educational mission. Currently enrolled UC Clermont students that require Testing Accommodations will continue to receive support in coordination with the office of Accessible Resources. See "Student Resources" below for UC Clermont Remote Testing Accommodation FAQs. To initiate these specialized services, students need to self-identify and have the proper documentation sent to the program coordinator of Accessibility Resources. The program coordinator also acts as a liaison with other college officers and departments including faculty, advising/scheduling, bookstore and any other referrals. The most appropriate academic assistance in the classroom and/or at the college will be developed to the mutual satisfaction of the student, faculty and the director of Accessibility Resources. All UC Clermont College students who require academic accommodations or other specialized services due to disabilities should refer to the following information or contact the program coordinator of Accessibility Resources to access these services. Mission Statement right arrow down arrow The mission of the University of Cincinnati Clermont College Accessibility Resources office is threefold: It seeks to ensure that all students with disabilities can freely and actively participate in all facets of college life. Through this effort, it hopes to provide and coordinate support services to maximize students' educational potential and develop their independence to the fullest extent possible by providing and coordinating support services. Finally, this program strives to increase the level of awareness among the UC Clermont College community so that students with disabilities are able to perform at a level limited only by their abilities, not their disabilities. Upon receipt of necessary documentation, appropriate academic assistance and support services are provided based on individual need. With a goal of equal educational access in mind, Accessibility Resources creates opportunities for and promotes educational experiences, services and enrichment to persons with disabilities. See UC's Access to Education Policy page for more information.

Accommodated Testing Procedures Accommodation Form Purpose and Explanation Remote Testing Accommodations FAQs right arrow down arrow Can I still use my testing accommodations in the virtual/online classroom setting? Yes, your testing accommodations can be requested and utilized in an online setting. Students are responsible for contacting their professors and making their accommodation requests for each test, quiz, exam, final exam, etc. they wish to use accommodations on (find the example later on this page). How do I make a request to use my testing accommodations? Extended Time on Tests (Time & ½ or Double Time) Students should contact their faculty members directly to request their Extended Time on Tests accommodations. Faculty members will adjust times appropriately in Canvas, Blackboard and other testing platforms. To ensure that your accommodation is in place at the time of your test, it is highly recommended that you send your email communication at least 72 hours before the time of your test. Students must request their accommodations for each test they wish to use accommodations on. Email communication should include: The accommodation you are requesting for the upcoming test, quiz, exam, etc. What specific test you are requesting the accommodation for. The date of the test. Example Email: Dear Professor, I’m writing to request my accommodation of Extended Time on Tests: Time & ½ for the Chapter 5 Test on Wednesday, March 25.  Thank you for your assistance. If you have any questions please contact me or Accessibility Resources,  accessresources@uc.edu.  Quiet Room or Individual Room Students can take their online exams in an environment that best meets their needs. You do not need to make a formal request for a distraction reduced environment to your faculty members.  Reader Students who utilize a reader accommodation will be able to use Assistive Technology, such as Read & Write Gold or their computer’s built in screen reader, to facilitate a reader accommodation. Students can download Read & Write Gold for free on  Accessibility Resources Assistive Technology website. Windows users can also utilize  Narrator,  while Mac users can use the  Speech  features. If Assistive Technology is not a viable option, students should contact the Accessibility Resources Office to determine an appropriate plan of action. Students who need a scribe accommodation can utilize dictation features built-in to both  Mac  and  Windows  computers. If Assistive Technology is not a viable option, students should contact the Accessibility Resources office to determine an appropriate plan of action. What should I do if I need additional assistance with my testing accommodations? Any student requiring assistance with their testing accommodations should contact the Accessibility Resources Office. The director will work with you and faculty to determine the best course of action to provide your accommodation.
