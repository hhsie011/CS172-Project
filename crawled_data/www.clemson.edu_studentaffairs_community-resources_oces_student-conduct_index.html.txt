Community Resources Community and Ethical Standards Current: Student Conduct Integrity, Honesty, Respect: Your Responsibilities as a Clemson Student Welcome to the OCES tutorial Integrity, Honesty, and Respect: Understanding Your Responsibilities as a Clemson Student. This tutorial is designed to help you as an incoming student understand the policies, student regulations, and other important details from the Clemson University Student Code of Conduct. While your participation in this tutorial is required as part of your transition to Clemson, we hope that you continue to learn more about your responsibilities as a Clemson University student. While you are a student here at Clemson University, it is our expectation that you uphold the standards and core values of the Clemson University Community. We have defined our core values as Integrity, Honesty, and Respect. As a new student, whether you are an incoming freshman, transferring from another institution, or a new graduate student, Clemson University expects you to adopt these core values as your own. Also, the standards of our community can be found in the Student Code of Conduct. This tutorial will help you learn more about these standards. *Note: This is a University requirement which is apart of CU1000. The Code of Conduct Tutorial is to be completed by Feb. 15, 2020.
