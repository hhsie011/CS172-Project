Contact UW-IT About UW-IT IT Standards Information Technology standards set by UW Information Technology as permitted by APS 2.3 will be added to this space as they are developed. Why UW-IT is developing IT standards Aid in decision making by reducing the number of choices made in IT development and accelerate decision making where the answer is obvious. Reduce complexity and technical debt by using one tool to solve the same problem rather than using and managing many tools. Leverage investment that has already been made in both in technology and staff / training Improve security and resiliency through managing one solution rather than many solutions. How the IT Standards will be developed Based on best practices High level approaches to technology, applications, data, and business architecture From experience in higher education, IT, and related industries Community sourced Developed by contributors at the UW Grounded in existing practices and feasible goals Facilitated by the EA team Last reviewed December 23, 2021 See a problem on this page?
