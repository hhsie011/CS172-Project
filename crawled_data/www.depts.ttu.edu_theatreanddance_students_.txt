From their first semester on campus, our students direct, devise, design, dance, act, critique, dramaturg, and produce raw and fully designed events. We offer students experience in a breadth of programs, and we balance that experience with the highest standards of scholarship and professionalism to prepare them for careers in both practice and pedagogy. Our experiential education programs like the WildWind Performance Lab and The Marfa Intensive encourage transformation. However, we can only shape art if we understand and embrace the community around us. Our students learn to be global leaders, dedicating their time and efforts to first understand and then to better the world around them. We encourage students to break the silos and work between disciplines to contribute to a pluralistic society as leaders in their profession. Undergraduate graduate signature experiences School Highlights We provide the opportunities and experience students need to grow as artists and distinguish themselves regionally, nationally, and internationally.
