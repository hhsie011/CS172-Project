J.D. / M.B.A. J.D. / MSW J.D. / LL.M. in Transnational Law J.D. / LL.M. in Taxation Temple Law has always taken great pride in providing an excellent legal education which prepares its graduates for the challenges they will meet in practice. But globalization has significantly changed the nature of these challenges. Advances in telecommunications and transportation have created a demand for lawyers who can practice in a global environment. Multinational corporations have become the rule, rather than the exception, and the practice of law is no longer limited by national borders. Moreover, many of the most rapidly expanding areas of practice including the law of cyberspace, intellectual property and environmental law are inherently transnational. For all of these reasons, Temple’s faculty designed the Transnational Law curriculum to ensure that our graduates will have the skills and knowledge to compete successfully in the twenty-first century. Our graduates will be knowledgeable about international legal doctrines, adept at dealing with multiple legal systems, and familiar with other cultures. This is not a concurrent degree, but J.D. students can earn partial credit towards the LL.M. Welcome from the Director Thank you for your interest in Temple’s Master of Laws (LL.M.) Degree in Transnational Law. I am confident that you will find the LL.M. in Transnational Law a dynamic and intellectually stimulating program. Let me suggest three reasons why our program is particularly attractive. First, we have an outstanding faculty. Nearly half of our faculty has either taught or worked overseas, and the faculty has a broad commitment to international and comparative law. Moreover, while we have strengths in a number of traditional substantive areas, Temple has unique strengths in emerging areas like intellectual property, cyberspace and electronic commerce. Members of our faculty are acknowledged leaders in these cutting edge fields. Just as importantly, the faculty is committed to our students. We pride ourselves on our availability to students, and you will find open doors to faculty offices and ample opportunity for interaction with faculty outside of class. Second, our LL.M. program is structured to require a truly international legal education. To graduate, students must complete a term of study abroad. Temple is the only U.S. law school to offer a semester-long program in Japan as well as a long-standing summer program in Rome. Thus, we offer a tremendously rich range of experiences for those interested in international and comparative law. Finally, at Temple, you will be joining an intellectually vibrant community of students and faculty interested in international law. Temple Law’s new Institute for International Law and Public Policy provides numerous opportunities for Temple students to interact with leading international law practitioners and scholars from around the globe. In addition, several student organizations, including the International Law Society and the Japan America Law Student Alliance, arrange a lively series of speakers and other events. Moreover, with a separate LL.M. program for foreign-trained attorneys and J.D. students from many nations, you will be enriched by a number of talented peers who share your interests. In short, our students find a community where they can develop lasting personal and professional relationships that transcend national boundaries. I hope that you decide to enroll at Temple. If you have any questions about the LL.M. program, feel free to contact me. I look forward to seeing you at Temple Law.
