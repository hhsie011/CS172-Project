Albert Einstein’s Theory of Relativity Working as a clerk in a Swiss patent office, Albert Einstein produced four groundbreaking papers in 1905 that challenged traditional conceptions of matter, time, and space. On display are his personal copies of two of these papers, in which he works out his famous equation E=mc2, as well as an autograph manuscript explaining the experimental confirmation of his theory. The History of Ideas case was created in recognition of a generous gift for the renovation of Houghton Library's Reading Room by alumni donors who wish to remain anonymous. The case hosts exhibits of items from the collections of the donor and the library that change three times a year. Planning to visit? The lobby gallery exhibitions are open to all visitors with proof of vaccination and booster; face coverings are recommended.
