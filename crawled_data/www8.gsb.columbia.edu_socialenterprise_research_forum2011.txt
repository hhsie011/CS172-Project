However, this law's impact on key stakeholders — from service providers, to insurers, to the legions of currently uninsured — depends critically on how the law's high-level principles are translated into actual healthcare policy and practice. What is the future of Medicare and Medicaid? How will reforms affect the returns of healthcare investors? How will national reforms play out locally — in New York and around the country? Understanding the local implications of healthcare reform here in New York is critical to planning for a future that is already unfolding in markets across the country.
