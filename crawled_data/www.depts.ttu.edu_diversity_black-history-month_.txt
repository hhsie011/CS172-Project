This year's theme is “Celebrating Black Culture and Community”. This committee chose the Sankofa bird as a symbolic figure to represent the month's theme. Sankofa is often associated with the African proverb, “Se wo were fi na wosankofa a yenkyi,” which translates to, “It is not wrong (taboo) to go back and fetch what you forgot.” We've chosen the Sankofa bird since it symbolizes wisdom and knowledge gained from the past and a hope for a strong future. Join us as we embrace our past to have a powerful future and to celebrate Black culture and communities.

Sponsored by Black Graduate Student Association Ranky Tanky February 25, 2022 7:00 p.m. - 8:30 p.m. Allen Theatre in the TTU Student Union Building (15th and Akron Ave / 2625 15th Str) Tickets: $20 by calling Select-A-Seat at 806.770.2000 or SelectASeatLubbock.com or presidentialseries.ttu.edu. ** TTU students receive a free ticket/valid student ID at the east info desk at the Texas Tech University Allen Theater in the Student Union Building.** Ranky Tanky released their eponymous debut on Oct. 20th, 2017. By December of that year, the group had been profiled on NPR's Fresh Air with Terry Gross and their album soared to the #1 position on the Billboard, i-Tunes and Amazon Jazz Charts. “Gullah” comes from West African language and means “a people blessed by God.” “Ranky Tanky” translates loosely as “Work It” or “Get Funky!” In this spirit, the Charleston, South Carolina-based quintet performs timeless music of Gullah culture born in the southeastern Sea Island region of the United States. From playful game songs to ecstatic shouts, from heartbreaking spirituals to delicate lullabies, the musical roots of Charleston are “rank” and fertile ground from which these contemporary artists are grateful to have grown. The soulful songs of the Gullah culture are brought to life by this band of native South Carolinians who mix the low country traditions with large doses of jazz, gospel, funk and R&B.
