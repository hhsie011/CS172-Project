BEO focuses on the formation, growth, and organization of new ventures, innovation in commercial applications, financial markets and the marketplace, and management and organizational theory. Concentrators seek to understand the basic principles, approaches and vocabulary relevant to the study of entrepreneurship from the disciplines of economics, organizational sociology and engineering. Building on this multidisciplinary base, students develop specialized expertise in one of the three disciplinary approaches, with special emphasis on critical reasoning and quantitative research methods. In senior year capstone projects, students apply and integrate multi-disciplinary learning by working in groups on real world projects, including the creation of new ventures. BEO students interested in the theory and practice of addressing social challenges might consider the Engaged Scholars Program. Here's what concentrators from the classes of 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020, reported they were doing in their first year after graduation. 2020 Employment ART Associate, Artisan Partners Account Executive, pMD Analyst, Morgan Stanley Associate, EY-Parthenon Associates Success Guide, Salesforce Business Development Associate, Konnecto Business Development Representative, NetSuite Business Services Trainee, Latham & Watkins LLP Capital Markets Associate, Boston Realty Advisors Chef, Katrina's Table Consultant, Prime Clerk Consultant, Prime Clerk Educational Tour Consultant, EF Education First Engagement Marketing Associate, Dow Jones Executive Assistant for Programming and Production, ITV America Financial Representative, Thrivent Growth Analyst, Lunar Solar Group International Sales and Marketing Specialist, SharkNinja Inventory Planning Analyst, Banana Republic Investment Banking Analyst, Perella Weinberg Partners Investment Operations Analyst, Loomis, Sayles & Company Life Coach, Private Family Logistics Intern, Consolidated Shipping Agency Markets Analyst, Citi Mathematics Tutor, Wyzant Operations Manager, Impello Biosciences Portfolio services associate, Wellington Management Presidential Intern, Brown Univeristy Private Equity Analyst, New Standard Holdings, Inc.
