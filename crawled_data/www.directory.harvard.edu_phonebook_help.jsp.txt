Search Tips Wildcard search: Partial searches are available using the asterisk (*). For example, johnst* returns Johnston and Johnstone. Multi-field search: To narrow your search, enter criteria in more than one field. This may be helpful when searching for an individual with a common last name. Searchable phone number formats: Phone numbers should be entered without dashes, spaces or other characters. For example: 6174951000. If you do not know all 10 digits of the phone number, use the wildcard. For example: *51000. Invalid search characters: Special characters, by and large, should not be submitted as part of the search criteria. Allowed special characters vary by the search criteria: Last & First Name: period (.), dash (-), underscore (_), asterisk (*), apostrophe (') Email: period (.), dash (-), underscore (_), asterisk (*), at sign (@) Phone number: period (.), dash (-), underscore (_), asterisk (*), open parentheses ((), closed parentheses ()), plus (+) Error messages: "Too many results to display. Please refine your search." If you receive this message, enter additional information to narrow your search. For example, if you have searched by last name only, search by last name and first initial followed by the asterisk (*), or any other piece of information you may have. "No matches to your query. Please try again." If you receive this message, check your spelling or number format and try again. If you still do not receive a match, no information is available. "You have exceeded the maximum number of daily queries. No results are available." To discourage directory compilation, each user is allowed a maximum number of queries per day. If you have reached your max, you may try again tomorrow. If you absolutely need to find an individual's contact information today, call the Harvard operators at 617-495-1000. If you are a Harvard administrator and need assistance with looking up a number of people, contact the HUIT Helpdesk. "An invalid special character was submitted. Please revise your search." If you receive this message, please remove the special characters submitted and try again. If you believe there is a disallowed special character in the desired return, you may try using the wild card search or you may wish to try a different search criteria combination. See above Invalid search characters for a list of the allowed special characters. Frequently Asked Questions Q: Why can't I find the person I'm looking for?
