A critical mass of graduate students is required to sustain Stanford’s academic vitality. These young scholars push their disciplines in new directions by challenging existing beliefs and encouraging the flow of ideas. They mentor and teach undergraduates, and play a key role in retaining top faculty. Graduate fellowships are an important reason students—and their professors—come to and stay at Stanford. Fellowships support the next generation of innovators and leaders whose ideas can change the world. Fellowships are particularly critical in the natural sciences, where research is time-consuming and expensive. Graduate students pursuing innovative research across traditional disciplines face growing challenges in securing support. The unpredictability of government funding makes support for these fellowships more important than ever.
