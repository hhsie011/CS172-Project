UC Scholarships The UC Global Scholarship awards between $1,000 and $12,000 per year to qualifying students. University Graduate Scholarships are available in many graduate programs. Scholarship levels vary by academic program and may include a living stipend. External Scholarships Take a look at our online scholarship listing for a description of some opportunities available to international students. You can also use one of the online databases below to search for more scholarships: International Education Financial Aid (IEFA) InternationalScholarships.com Both provide a searchable database of financial aid, college scholarships, student loans, and grant information for international students. Loans Loans are typically very difficult for international students to receive in the US. Very few lenders offer student loans to international students, and if they do, they often require that a US citizen co-signs the loan with you. The Financial Aid Office has a resource for UC students that allows you to populate a list of possible loan vendors.
