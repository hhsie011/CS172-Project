That is why the Stanford MBA Program empowers you to combine studies. This flexibility offers a rich and valuable academic experience. Generally, about 20 percent of Stanford MBA students take advantage of a joint or dual degree to complement their MBA. As a student, you may also take courses in any department or graduate school at Stanford University. Joint Degrees Your Stanford joint degrees must be conferred simultaneously upon completion of degree requirements for both programs. While in the Stanford MBA Program, you may not pursue concurrently more than one additional degree. JD/MBA The JD/MBA joint degree program with Stanford Law School is designed for individuals considering: A career in law or public service, who wish to acquire the skills of a general manager A career in management, who wish to acquire the skills and competencies of a lawyer Degree Requirements You must fulfill the degree requirements for the joint degree program as outlined in the academic policies from each school for the year in which you began the required curriculum. MBA Units 84 JD Units 80 Total Units 164 Time to Complete 11 to 12 quarters (4 years) Stanford GSB Residency In addition to satisfying the SLS residency requirement, you must complete five quarters of residency, i.e. full-tuition study, at Stanford GSB. Residency starts accruing when you begin the core coursework in the autumn quarter. Paths to Completing the Program Option 1 — Complete your first two years of law school, then your first year of business school, followed by courses primarily at the business school in your final year. Option 2 — Complete your first year of law school, then your first year of business school, followed by a variety of courses at both schools in your remaining two years. If you intend to complete the JD/MBA program in 11 quarters, you may elect to go on leave during the winter quarter of your fourth year to prepare for the bar exam, and return to classes in spring quarter. MA Education/MBA The MA Education/MBA joint degree program with Stanford Graduate School of Education is designed for individuals with a wide variety of interests in education (both K–12 and higher education, for-profit education, etc.), including: Education policy Education management The application of technology to education Teaching and learning Degree Requirements MBA Units 84 MA Education Units 35 Total Units 109-119* Time to Complete 6 quarters (two years) *Dependent upon the number of cross-listed courses taken. In this program, you will spend most of your first year taking MBA courses, and a mix of business and education courses thereafter. You have the flexibility to take a variety of electives at both schools. MPP/MBA The MPP/MBA joint degree program allows you to simultaneously pursue an MBA from Stanford GSB and an MPP degree from the Public Policy Program at Stanford School of Humanities and Sciences. You may be interested in this degree if you wish to pursue a career in public policy or at the intersection of business and government. Degree Requirements MBA Units 84 MPP Units 90 (of which up to 29 units can be credited toward both programs) Total Units 145 Time to Complete 9 quarters (3 years) You will spend most of your first year taking MBA courses; you may take MPP courses once you begin your second year. During autumn and winter quarters of the third year, you will participate in the MPP’s two-quarter practicum course, in which interdisciplinary teams of the MPP cohort analyze and report on real-world policy issues for an outside client. MS Computer Science/MBA The MS Computer Science/MBA joint degree program links two of Stanford University’s world-class programs: Stanford Graduate School of Business and the Stanford University Computer Science Department.

MS Environment and Resources (E-IPER)/MBA The MS Environment and Resources (E-IPER)/MBA joint degree program with the Stanford School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences offers you the opportunity to develop a background in the science, engineering, and technology that underlie environmental problems. You’ll integrate that knowledge with your MBA curriculum to become an influential and innovative leader addressing environmental issues — either directly or peripherally. Degree Requirements MBA Units 84 E-IPER MS Units 45* Total Units 129 Time to Complete 7 to 9 quarters (3 years) In this program, you will spend most of your first year taking MBA courses, while your second year will be a mix of business and E-IPER courses.

In one of your final quarters, you will complete a capstone project that allows you to demonstrate your ability to integrate business, science, and engineering knowledge. *May include courses offered by other schools within the university, but must be science-related coursework approved by the School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences Hilary Bartlett MBA 2019 “It is not at all an overstatement to say that my four years in the joint JD/MBA program at Stanford have been life-changing. Committed professors and inspiring peers have challenged me to expand my vision of what is possible for myself and for the world. I am graduating with greater confidence, a clearer sense of self, and an excitement for what the future holds. Not only do I dream bigger as a result of my time at Stanford, but my dreams feel more attainable. I am leaving Stanford with so much more than the foundational skill set I was seeking.” Show More Owen Wurzbacher MBA 2019 “The GSB’s joint degree program allowed me to explore the intersection of two passions: investing and education. It provided the flexibility to study both fields and illustrated the opportunities for applying business skills to education in an informed way. Using tools developed and relationships built, I look forward to influencing the education field and inspiring a love of learning in young people during my career.” Show More Dual Degrees Interested in an additional discipline that is not represented in our joint degree programs? You can pursue a master's degree from another Stanford program along with your MBA. While in the Stanford MBA program, you may not pursue concurrently more than one additional degree. MD/MBA Dual Degree The MD/MBA dual degree program allows you to pursue an MBA at Stanford GSB and an MD from the Stanford School of Medicine in five academic years of residence. Degree Requirements You must fulfill the degree requirements for the dual degree program as outlined in the academic policies from each school for the year in which you began the required curriculum. MBA Units 90 MD Units A minimum of 235 and completion of all MD graduation requirements Time to Complete 17 quarters (5 years) Preferred Path to Completion Year School Coursework One School of Medicine Pre-clerkship/scholarly concentration Two School of Medicine Pre-clerkship/scholarly concentration Three School of Medicine Core clinical rotations, including surgery and medicine plus selective subjects Four* Stanford GSB Five (Fall Quarter) School of Medicine Clinics, core, and electives Five (Winter & Spring Quarters) Stanford GSB *Per Stanford School of Medicine policy, MD students should be in good academic standing at the School of Medicine. MD students should follow School of Medicine dual degree policies to receive approval to matriculate in the MBA Program. Students also must receive an overall pass on Step 1 of the USMLE within twelve months of the start of clinical clerkships. It is highly recommended that MD/MBAs take their Step 1 exam prior to starting at Stanford GSB. Other Dual Degrees You may pursue a dual degree with any graduate program at Stanford University. Candidates must apply to and be accepted by the other program separately, and then notify Stanford GSB. You may apply concurrently to both programs or apply to the dual degree program during your first year as an MBA student. As with joint degrees, you may only pursue one additional degree while in the MBA program. Justin Norden MBA 2019 “After starting medical school at Stanford, I decided to pursue an MBA at the GSB to develop the skills to become a leader at the intersection of health care, technology, and medicine. Business school has not only taught me many valuable leadership skills, but also opened my eyes to think about problems in completely new ways. The best part about the GSB, however, has been getting to know and learn from so many wonderful classmates.” Show More Study Opportunities Outside Stanford Stanford MBA students may also pursue degrees with certain professional schools at other universities. Check with each school regarding its policy and timeline.
