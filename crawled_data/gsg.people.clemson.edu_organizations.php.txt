Being a member of a student organization can be an important factor in the success and enjoyment of your college experience. While academic learning is the primary goal of college, extracurricular activities help you learn and grow beyond the walls of the classroom and can provide you with hands-on training to better prepare you for your future career. Participation in student organizations offers you opportunities for fellowship, leadership, recreation, and meaningful interaction with faculty, staff, and students. The good friends and times encountered through being actively involved on campus can help transform what is sometimes a large and overwhelming institution into a place you can call "home." There are a variety of organizations to choose from. Areas of student organizations include: Creative and Performing Arts, Cultural and International, Honorary, Media, Political Activism, Professional, Academic and Departmental, Religious and Faith, Service and Advocacy, and Special Interests.
