Program Rules GPA – Students must achieve a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.0 to graduate, and no course grades below C will be allowed to count toward graduation. All grades labeled below as core and elective courses within your specialization must be B or better. No graduate credit will be given for CS courses with a number lower than 4140. A maximum of 6 hours may be taken at the 4000-level and/or with a subject code other than CS or CSE. Pass-Fail and Audit – All courses applied to the M.S. CS degree must be taken for letter grade. The maximum total credit hours of Special Problems (CS or CSE 89xx) that may be applied toward the M.S. CS degree is 3. These courses must be within the CoC. There is no maximum number of Special Topics (CS or CSE 88xx) courses that may be used towards the degree. Each student must complete the requirements for one specialization.
