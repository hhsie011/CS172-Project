While HSI status is determined based on an undergraduate student body that is above 25% Hispanic, Texas Tech offers a comprehensive series of programs, services, initiatives, and organizations to underrepresented students, students of color, and first-generation students, many of whom are Hispanic. One such initiative is the first Hispanic Serving Institution Week that will be hosted by Texas Tech this fall. This week, September 13th – September 17th, will include events and discussions to foster and promote inclusive conversations about the Hispanic culture and the benefits of being a Hispanic Serving Institution.
