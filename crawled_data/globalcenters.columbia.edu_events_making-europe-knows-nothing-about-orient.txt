About the Book A century before the publication of Edward Said’s Orientalism, a passionate discourse emerged in the Ottoman Empire, rebutting politicized Western representations of the East. Until the 1930s, Ottoman and early Turkish Republican intellectuals, well acquainted with the European political and cultural scene and charged with their own ideological agendas, deconstructed tired clichés about “the Orient.” In this book, Zeynep Çelik recontextualizes Eurocentric studies, unearthing an important episode in modern Middle Eastern intellectual history and curating a selection of primary texts illustrating the debates. Speakers Aron Aji, a native of Turkey, Aji’s translations include three book-length works by Bilge Karasu: Death in Troy; The Garden of Departed Cats (NTA, 2004); and A Long Day’s Evening, (NEA Literature Fellowship; short-listed for the 2013 PEN Translation Prize).
