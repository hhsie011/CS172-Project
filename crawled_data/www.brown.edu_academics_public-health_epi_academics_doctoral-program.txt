We prepare students to become leading, independent investigators. Our graduates excel in academia, industry, government and public health practice. The Doctoral Program in Epidemiology’s mission is to prepare students to become leading, independent investigators with rigorous training in epidemiologic methods, able to excel in academia, industry, government or public health practice. Using sophisticated study designs, statistical analyses, field investigations, and laboratory techniques, epidemiology students investigate the cause of a disease, its distribution (geographic, ecological, and social), method of transmission, and measures for control and prevention. All students in the Doctoral Program in Epidemiology are required to demonstrate mastery of advanced epidemiologic methods, which is assessed via coursework and examinations. 1 of 3 Courtney Choy, pictured answering questions about her Public Health Research Day poster, conducts data collection for the Ola Tuputupua’e study and supports the research efforts of the Obesity Lifestyle and Genetic Adaptation (OLaGA) group in Samoa. 2 of 3 Professor Eric Loucks, Director of the Mindfulness Center at Brown, studies the impacts of mindfulness and early life adversity on adulthood well-being. 3 of 3 The doctoral dissertation defense is the culmination of at least four years of study and research. A major academic and career milestone presented before a live audience, successful PhD defenses are celebrated with colleagues, friends, family, and a champagne toast. Program Highlights Program Proficiencies Coursework Diversity and Respect Program Highlights Faculty who are leaders in the field Outstanding student to faculty ratio Numerous research possibilities Emphasis on teaching Training in grant writing (more than half of our recent F31s submitted received funding in their first round) Guaranteed funding Opportunities to work on applied projects at RI State Department of Health; nearby RI hospitals Program Proficiencies Upon completion of the PhD program, students are expected to have proficiency in the following areas: Develop a strong foundation in contemporary approaches to epidemiologic methods, and major observational study designs Design a research study that can appropriately and efficiently examine an epidemiologic research question of interest; write and submit a proposal to support this research Use causal diagrams to identify threats to study validity and potential approaches to mitigating such threats Conduct appropriate analyses of epidemiologic data using standard regression models in SAS or R Distinguish between association and causation based on counterfactual theory to make causal inference using data obtained from observational studies Represent a priori subject- matter knowledge and hypotheses with causal diagrams Understand the difference between effect modification and interaction Learn to interpret and integrate multiple lines of scientific evidence concerning a particular topic of importance to the field of epidemiology Effective communication of scientific findings Demonstrate a basic understanding of human physiology and pathophysiology Demonstrate mastery of a substantive area Review, critically analyze and synthesize existing epidemiologic literature to identify meaningful gaps in current knowledge and formulate research objectives Strong understanding of what scientific misconduct is and the impact unethical conduct can cause within and outside of the research community. Coursework All students in the PhD program in Epidemiology are required to take 13 courses for credit, including 8 core courses, 2 or 3 more methods selective courses, and 2 or 3 more substantive selective courses. Each of these courses must be taken for credit and for a grade. PhD students are also required to: a) take PHP1001, an online, noncredit introductory course b) take a noncredit online introductory course on SAS data management, c) participate in the journal club series (course credit optional), and d) take the noncredit Responsible Conduct in Research (RCR) course. Core Courses: PHP 2150 – Foundations in Epidemiologic Research Methods PHP 2200 – Intermediate Methods in Epidemiologic Research PHP 2250 – Advanced Quantitative Methods for Epidemiologic Research PHP 2180 – Interpretation and Application of Epidemiology PHP 2510 – Principles of Biostatistics and Data Analysis PHP 2511 – Applied Regression Analysis PHP 2090 – Research Grant Writing for Public Health PHP 2130 – Human Biology for Epidemiology Diversity and Respect Our Commitment to Program Diversity and a Culture of Respect The Brown University Department of Epidemiology is committed to ensuring that we admit students from diverse socioeconomic, cultural, racial, and ethnic backgrounds. The Department of Epidemiology is committed to creating an inclusive, collaborative climate centered on mutual respect, with the goal of cultivating a productive work and learning environment. Ph.D. funding As a result of Brown's commitment to high quality education, all students admitted into the PhD program receive full scholarships that include tuition, healthcare and a research-assistant-based stipend for five years of graduate study.
