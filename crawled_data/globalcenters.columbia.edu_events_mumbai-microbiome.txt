October 1, 2019 3:00 PM - 11:00 AM Hilton Shillim, Village Shilimb, Pawana Nagar, Taluka Maval, Pune - 410406 Columbia Global Centers | Mumbai, in partnership with the Shillim Institute, is hosting an expert workshop at the Hilton Shillim to explore the gut microbiome as a critical area of focus in health and wellness in India. Microbial matter in the gut has been linked to a host of conditions and diseases, including diabetes, cancer, anxiety disorders, and infectious diseases. It also impacts individual and community responses to medications and treatment interventions. The number of global data banks to study hitherto neglected aspects of the gut microbiome is growing exponentially. Yet while India has made some strides in understanding the field, there remain huge data gaps. India offers an opportunity to study microbes in various ecological niches and diverse ethnic groups but more research and diagnostic work is needed to understand the complex landscape that the country presents. Furthermore, the stakeholders engaged in the study and treatment of the gut are isolated in different fields and practices, limiting effective measures for improving health. This interdisciplinary workshop brings together researchers and practitioners in the fields of microbiology, medicine, nutrition, ecology, and the social sciences to share knowledge about latest trends and initiatives in microbiome research and application, and to create a road map for future collaborations. The long-term goal is to improve health outcomes through integrated interventions linking prevention and cure. This event is by invitation only.
