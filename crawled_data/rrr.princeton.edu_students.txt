Students and the University 2021 2.1 Rights and Responsibilities of Students 2.2 Regulations Concerning Specific Aspects of Student Life 2.3 The Undergraduate Honor System 2.4 Academic Regulations 2.5 University Discipline 2.6 The Graduate School 2.7 Student Privacy Rights under Federal Law 2.1 Rights and Responsibilities of Students The following statement is excerpted from a longer document adopted by the faculty, October 7, 1968, to clarify the rights and responsibilities of students in the University. The purpose of this statement is to affirm those basic principles that underlie, and to state those policies and procedures that define, the rights and responsibilities of the student in the University. These principles hold with equal force for undergraduate and graduate students, although their application may lead to different administrative arrangements reflecting differences in these two groups. As constituents of the academic community, students are expected, individually and collectively, to express their views on issues of institutional policy and on matters of general interest to the student body. As expressed through informal consultation with the president, other officers of the University, and members of the faculty, student views are especially valuable and will always play an essential role in the formulation of policies affecting student interests. These officers of the University are also available to discuss any matters of importance with any student organization. In addition to these important channels of communication it now seems appropriate to provide other means through which students can make useful contributions to decisions that are of special interest and relevance to their academic, cultural, and social life at Princeton. Several purposes are served by student participation in processes by which decisions are reached in the University. Their assessment of academic needs and interests and their suggestions for strengthening the academic program contribute to the continuing efforts of the trustees, administration, and faculty to improve the effectiveness of a Princeton education. By drawing on the ideas and talents of students to a greater extent, the cultural and intellectual life of the campus outside the classroom can be stimulated and these activities made more responsive to their perceived needs. And although students now bear substantial responsibility for determining and applying rules of social conduct, there is reason to believe that they can make further contributions that will enhance the conditions of individual and social life at Princeton. Finally, the availability to students of wider opportunities for sharing in appropriate decision-making functions will have a significant educational value in enlisting their mature and responsible attention to problems that necessarily have counterparts in the wider world community. For these several reasons, the University community will continue to seek clearly defined means for the student body to participate in the formulation and application of institutional policy affecting academic and student affairs. 2.1.1 Faculty Procedures of Concern to Students The following paragraphs are excerpted from Rules and Procedures of the Faculty, 2021. Attendance at Faculty Meetings Meetings of the faculty shall normally be open for attendance as observers to representatives of the campus press; to members of the Executive Committee of the Undergraduate Student Government; to members of the Executive Committee of the Graduate Student Government; to members of the Council of the Princeton University Community; to the Officers of the Corporation; and to the deputy, associate and assistant deans of the Faculty, Graduate School, college, and of Student Life. Observers shall not attempt by word or deed to influence the proceedings. Meetings may be broadcast on campus radio, subject to the conditions of confidentiality specified below. Members of University or faculty committees who have been invited to appear in connection with a committee report and other guests who have been invited by the President shall normally be free to remain during the whole session to which they have been invited. All in attendance shall be bound to preserve the confidentiality of any portion of a meeting that has been designated confidential by a motion to that effect, duly approved; and, any session may be declared closed to observers, in whole or in part, on the vote of a two-thirds majority of the Faculty Advisory Committee on Policy or on the request of one-third of the members of the faculty present and voting. Faculty Reconsideration of Proposals Regarding Undergraduate Curriculum The faculty shall consider a second vote on any action taken on a proposal regarding the undergraduate curriculum when a second vote has been requested by the Caucus of the Undergraduate Student Government. In any particular academic year, the faculty commits itself to a second vote on any action on a proposal regarding the undergraduate curriculum when, within 30 days exclusive of vacations after such action, a second vote has been requested by a two-thirds majority of the Caucus of the Undergraduate Student Government. In requesting reconsideration, the Caucus of the Undergraduate Student Government shall normally ask that the Faculty Committee on the Course of Study, meeting jointly with the Academic Committee of the Caucus of the Undergraduate Student Government, review their proposal. The faculty would then reconsider its original action and any amendments or alternative proposals recommended. The Undergraduate Student Government may also return the proposal directly to the faculty, which may reconsider the proposal immediately or may request review of the proposal by the Committee on the Course of Study prior to reconsideration. If the action to be reconsidered is on a proposal that the faculty has rejected, a majority vote of the faculty shall reverse the previous decision. If the action to be reconsidered is on a proposal that has been adopted by the faculty, a two-thirds vote of the faculty shall be necessary to affirm the previous decision. The faculty shall not be requested to reconsider the same action more than once in any academic year. Graduate Student Departmental Committees The following are to be established policies in the making of decisions with regard to the graduate courses of study, and departmental chairs shall be responsible for so informing the graduate students of their departments at the beginning of each academic year. However, any of these policies may be modified by agreement of the faculty and graduate students of a department, these modifications to remain in effect until changed by similar procedure. Each department shall establish a departmental committee of graduate students, to act as a liaison between the faculty and the graduate student body of the department. Each committee should normally meet with the committee of the departmental faculty concerned with graduate studies, if one exists. The committee of graduate students shall have the right to initiate discussion of any proposals relating to the departmental graduate program, shall encourage students to participate in departmental affairs of special interest and relevance to them, and shall have the following additional rights. The right to attach comments to all proposals forwarded to the Committee on the Graduate School by departmental faculty. The right, in certain circumstances, to secure a departmental faculty's reconsideration of action taken on proposals regarding the graduate curriculum. Departments should seriously consider a second vote on any measures regarding the department's graduate program when it is requested by the student committee. In any particular academic year departmental faculties should commit themselves to a second vote on such measures if a second vote is requested within one month by the student departmental committee in a petition endorsed by two-thirds of the department's graduate students. If the action being reconsidered is on a proposal that the departmental faculty has rejected, a majority vote of the departmental faculty should reverse the previous decision. If the action being reconsidered is on a proposal that has been adopted by the departmental faculty, a two-thirds vote of the departmental faculty should be required to affirm the previous decision. Departmental faculties should not be bound to reconsider the same action more than once in the same academic year. Student departmental committees shall be provided with a reasonable amount of administrative assistance in preparing proposals, communicating with departmental students, and conducting elections. Each departmental chair shall be responsible for: Referring all proposals for major changes in the department's graduate program to the departmental graduate student committee before action on such proposals by the faculty of the department. Inviting student committee members to discuss proposals for major changes in the graduate course of study with the faculty of the department at or before any meetings in which the departmental faculty proposes to take action on such proposals. Scheduling at least two meetings each academic year with the graduate student committee of the department, one early in the fall term to work out plans for later consultation, and one in late spring to review the department's graduate offerings so that chairs may take student views into account in preparing requests for new staff. Interaction of Undergraduate Student Government Committees and Faculty Committees Whenever the Undergraduate Student Government shall establish a committee parallel to a faculty committee, the parallel committees shall at least once a year meet in joint session. In addition, the chair and one additional member of such committees of the Undergraduate Student Government shall meet with those faculty committees which the president of the University and the officers of the Undergraduate Student Government believe would benefit from such participation. The student representatives on faculty committees shall join freely in committee discussions of matters of concern to students, and shall be responsible for presenting the views of the student committee and the Undergraduate Student Government, when those views are known. Any student participating in the deliberations of a faculty committee is bound by the same rules as the faculty regarding the confidential nature of the proceedings. Within the bounds of this restriction, the student may discuss the matters under consideration with the Undergraduate Student Government or with other students. Either committee may meet without the participation of members of the parallel committee. Before any final recommendation is made on any matter of general policy concerning students, there will be an opportunity for the student committee to meet jointly with the faculty committee involved. Views of the student committees may be brought to the attention of the full faculty and the University community. Individual Student Appeal from Decisions of Faculty Committees A student desiring to appeal an action of a faculty committee taken on academic grounds which affects directly academic standing and for which appeal is not otherwise provided, should notify the dean of the faculty in writing to that effect, specifying the grounds of appeal. Notification must be made no later than seven days after receipt of the written notice of the decision which the student wishes to appeal. The dean of the faculty shall transmit the student's written statement and any other relevant material directly to the Advisory Committee on Policy. In deciding appeals, the Advisory Committee on Policy will consider whether other committees have followed established procedures and reached decisions consistent with University rules and practices. In all cases the decision of the Advisory Committee on Policy shall be final. If an appealed action is judged to have been arbitrary or based on improper or unfair procedures, the appeal will be sustained. In such a case the Advisory Committee on Policy will determine a course of action to insure an impartial final determination of the merits of the case based on proper and fair procedures. Coordination Between Faculty and Students on Matters Affecting Student Life The University Student Life Committee. The University Student Life Committee consists of six members of the faculty, including at least two who are nontenured and one residential college head. The following also serve on the committee: the vice president for campus life as chair, the dean of the college, the dean of the Graduate School, the director of athletics, the executive director of University Health Services, the dean of undergraduate students, and the vice president for University Services. The University Student Life Committee is concerned with fostering relationships among academic, residential, and social experiences of undergraduates and graduate students and more generally with the tone and character of University student life. In conjunction with the Council of College Heads, which oversees such matters in the residential colleges, the committee reviews policies affecting residential and extracurricular life for all undergraduate and graduate students. The committee may advise the dean of undergraduate students, the dean of the Graduate School, the dean of the college, the vice president for campus life and the president concerning matters under its purview and may, periodically, report and make recommendations to the faculty. Normally, the committee shall include in its deliberations, and in the work of any subcommittees which may develop, student members of the University Student Life Committee of the Undergraduate and Graduate Student Governments. The Council of College Heads. The Council of College Heads is concerned with creating and maintaining an environment in the undergraduate residential colleges which supports and enhances the educational mission of the University. In carrying out these responsibilities, the Council of College Heads sets policy for the residential and dining facilities for which it has general oversight and may advise the dean of undergraduate students, the dean of the college, the vice president for campus life, and the president on matters of general concern. The council works in conjunction with, and makes recommendations to, regular standing committees of the faculty, especially the Committee on the Course of Study and the Committee on University Student Life. The heads of the six undergraduate residential colleges are appointed to four-year terms by the president on the recommendation of the dean of the college and the dean of undergraduate students. The members of the council, in addition to the heads of the residential colleges, include the dean of the college (chair), the dean of undergraduate students, the vice president for campus life, and the associate dean of the college. Undergraduate Departmental Committees To make possible continuing contacts between the departmental chairs, faculty of the department, and students, an undergraduate departmental committee shall be established in each department. In the election of student departmental committees, such committees and departmental chairs shall be jointly responsible for adopting procedures that have these objectives: It should be convenient for the students of the department to vote. There should be an opportunity for any departmental student to place names in nomination. It should be easy for relatively small groups of students to have a representative on their department's committee and difficult for an organized minority to capture a disproportionate share of committee positions. There should be reasonable precautions against multiple balloting and reasonable measures to ensure a fair count of the vote. Student departmental committees shall be provided with a reasonable amount of secretarial assistance in preparing proposals, communicating with departmental majors, and conducting elections. Departmental chairs shall be responsible for: Referring all proposals for major changes in departmental undergraduate programs to their student committees before action on such proposals is taken by departmental faculties. Inviting members of student committees to discuss proposals for major changes in departmental undergraduate programs with departmental faculties at or before any meetings in which departmental faculties take action on such proposals. Scheduling at least two meetings each academic year with their student committees, one early in the fall term to work out plans for later consultation, and one in late spring to review departmental undergraduate offerings so that chairs may take student views into account in preparing requests for new staff. Student committees and faculty departmental committees concerned with the undergraduate program (in departments in which the latter sort of committee exists) shall normally meet jointly. Student departmental committees have the following additional rights: The right to attach comments, favorable or unfavorable, to all proposals forwarded by the faculties of their departments to the Committee on the Course of Study. The right in certain circumstances to secure a departmental faculty's reconsideration of action taken on proposals regarding the course of study for undergraduate students. Specifically: departmental faculties should seriously consider a second vote on any measure regarding the department's undergraduate program, when a second vote is requested by the student committee of the department. In any particular academic year departmental faculties should commit themselves to a second vote on such measures if a second vote is requested within one month by the student committee in a petition endorsed by two thirds of the department's majors. If the action being reconsidered is on a proposal that the departmental faculty has rejected, a majority vote of the departmental faculty should reverse the previous decision. If the action being reconsidered is on a proposal that has been adopted by the departmental faculty, a two-thirds vote of the departmental faculty should be required to affirm the previous decision. 2.1.2 Undergraduate Student Government Introduction The Undergraduate Student Government (USG) plays an important role in many areas of direct concern to undergraduates, including participating in the formulation of various University policies and the sponsorship of a wide variety of programs and activities. The USG encourages all undergraduates to read the Senate Constitution and Class Government Constitution, both of which can be found on the USG website (usg.princeton.edu). The USG also invites all undergraduates to contact current senate members with concerns they have about University policy and to contact their Class Officers with ideas they have about class activities and programming. The following is for informational purposes only. Please consult the updated editions of the USG Senate Constitution and Class Government Constitution for current provisions. Objects of the USG Senate As stated in the USG Senate Constitution, the objects of the USG Senate are as follows: Represent the undergraduates to the faculty, administration, Board of Trustees, and individuals or groups outside of the University whenever such representation is necessary. Exercise leadership in any activity affecting undergraduate life. Provide services for the University and members of the University community. Discuss, deliberate, and take an official position on a question relating to or affecting undergraduate life, or any other question of interest to the undergraduates. Members of the USG Senate The voting members of the USG Senate are as follows: The president, vice president, and treasurer, elected in November or December. The chairs of the University Student Life Committee, Academics Committee, Social Committee, Sustainability Committee, and Campus and Community Affairs Committee, elected in November or December. The 10 undergraduate members (U-Councilors) of the Council of the Princeton University Community, elected in April. Six class senators, two from three classes. First-year students, sophomores, and juniors elect senators in November or December. In addition, the USG Senate has nonvoting members who assist with specific duties, including communicating with the campus community and other institutions, maintaining senate records, and updating the USG website. Committees of the USG Senate Members of the University Student Life Committee meet monthly with the vice president for campus life and the faculty University Student Life Committee to review policies and make recommendations regarding nonacademic life. The Academics Committee meets regularly with administrators and faculty committees to review policies and make recommendations regarding academic affairs. The Social Committee sponsors a wide variety of social events for undergraduates. The Sustainability Committee advocates for sustainability awareness, action, and policies on campus, collaborates with sustainability groups, and promotes sustainable practices within USG. The Campus and Community Affairs Committee organizes events and fosters relationships that connect members of the Princeton University campus with one another and the greater community. The Projects Board makes grants each semester to University-recognized undergraduate student organizations. The Student Groups Recognition Committee recognizes undergraduate student organizations by facilitating a group leadership structure and approving groups for University recognition. The Movies Committee organizes film opportunities on and off campus. A variety of standing and ad hoc committees work, such as the Alumni Affairs Committee and the Diversity and Equity Committee, to improve undergraduate life in specific areas. Objects of Class Government As stated in the Class Government Constitution, the objects of each class government are as follows: Create substantive and class-specific programs that contribute broadly to the University, local, and national communities on behalf of and to the direct benefit of the class. Plan social events designed to foster class unity and spirit. Design, order, and distribute class gear to promote class identity. Foster relationships with the parent and grandparent alumni classes. Establish distinct class identity and unity throughout and beyond the undergraduate years at the University. In addition to the above objects, the objects of the Senior Class Government include the following: Organize Class Day, Senior Prom, Senior Check Out, Step Sing, and other events and activities relating to Commencement. Regularly solicit input from the senior class when making decisions relating to Commencement. Class Officers In April, each class elects a president, vice president, treasurer, secretary, and social chair. They are responsible for fulfilling the objectives of Class Government. In October, the first-year class elects a class council composed of five members of equal responsibility. Referenda The methods of calling for a referendum are as follows: General referenda. Following a one-third vote of the entire voting senate membership or upon petition of 10 percent of undergraduates, a referendum question will be placed on the ballot of the nearest upcoming USG election—winter or spring—barring a vote of the senate as explained in (c). In order for a referendum to be successful, at least one-third of the student body must vote on the referendum, and of that group, a majority (more than 50 percent) must vote in favor of it. If either provision is not met, the referendum will be automatically defeated. Referenda regarding amendments to the Honor Constitution. Following a petition of 200 undergraduates, a referendum question will be placed on the ballot of the nearest upcoming USG election—winter or spring—barring a vote of the senate as explained in (c). Frivolous referenda. If either (a) or (b) has been fulfilled, the referendum may be brought up for review at a Senate meeting. By a five-sixths vote at a regular meeting, the Senate may determine the referendum question to be frivolous, and thereby prevent the referendum from occurring. In this case, a petition of one-fourth of regularly enrolled undergraduates received within five days after that determination will place the referendum on the ballot within 21 days (excluding vacations). Any undergraduate wishing to petition for a referendum shall notify in writing the USG Vice President or designee of this intention. The Senate prescribes the proper form and style of a referendum petition in the USG election rules. Other rules relating to referenda are also contained in the USG election rules. The following are the thresholds for referendum results to take effect: In general. Except as otherwise provided in (b) and (c), the USG Senate shall be bound by the result of the referendum if at least one-third of regularly enrolled undergraduates vote in the referendum and a majority of votes cast are in the affirmative. Referenda regarding amendments to certain documents. If the proposal contained in the referendum amends the Senate Constitution, Class Government Constitution, or the Projects Board Charter, then the amendment shall be considered adopted if at least one-third of regularly enrolled undergraduates vote in the referendum and three-fifths of the votes cast are in the affirmative. Referenda regarding amendments to the Constitution of the Honor System. If the referendum measure proposes an amendment to the Constitution of the Honor System, then the referendum is adopted if at least one-third of regularly enrolled undergraduates vote in the referendum and three-fourths of the votes cast are in the affirmative, in accordance with Article VI of the Constitution of the Honor System (see section 2.3). 2.1.3 Campus Associations and Activities Students engaging in extracurricular activities on campus are free to form organizations devoted to a wide variety of objectives, and, as individuals or members of organizations, to express their views on issues of University and public interest. In these matters the University policy is to encourage free and responsible behavior of students, to hold to a minimum those regulations essential to the orderly conduct of extracurricular activities, and to seek in all ways to maintain the freedom enjoyed by students as participants in the life of the Princeton University community. When students fail to abide by agreed-upon regulations, they may be referred for disciplinary action. University recognition will not be withheld from any group pursuing lawful objectives merely because its aims may seem unorthodox. Student organizations may invite outside speakers of their choice, and are free to hold meetings and in other ways to express their views, subject only to prudent conditions regarding the protection of people and property and to reasonable regulations concerning time, place, and notice of meetings and other public exercises. Demonstrations and the distribution of leaflets, statements, or petitions are permitted on the campus unless, or until, they disrupt the regular and essential operations of the University or significantly infringe upon the rights of others. If it becomes necessary to prevent a demonstration from exceeding these guidelines, the University will first attempt to use persuasion; the University will then, if necessary, use its own personnel from the Department of Public Safety, and will call in outside law enforcement officials only when appropriate as a last resort. These policies are intended to safeguard the rights of students and student organizations to freedom of association. At the same time, candor and openness must be recognized as fundamental in an academic community, and the University does not look with favor on clandestine organizations. Furthermore, the activities of student organizations inevitably involve the University, which has, on occasion, been called upon to help to ensure that they meet financial and other obligations. For these several reasons, the University must ask student organizations which expect recognition by the University, identification through the use of the name of the University, and normal use of University facilities, to register the names of their officers and their basic objectives or purposes. Students do not have the authority to bind the University under any contract or obligation and may be held personally liable if they do so. Upon filing a request with the appropriate University official, campus-based organizations will usually be granted permission to distribute literature, solicit donations, and seek customers on campus, subject to the general University regulations prohibiting obstruction of University activities or interference with individual rights. Authorization for such activities must be obtained from the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students in the case of buildings and grounds on the main campus; the Office of the Dean of the Graduate School in the case of the Graduate College; or the Office of the Director of the Plasma Physics Laboratory in the case of the buildings and grounds on the Forrestal Campus. Authorization to solicit in academic buildings or University offices will be granted only after consultation with the responsible academic and administrative officers. In the case of profit-making activities, regulations governing student agencies will apply. Detailed guidelines and policies for undergraduate organizations are available at the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students. Guidelines for graduate students are available from the Office of the Dean of the Graduate School. 2.1.4 Student Publications Student publications and broadcasting organizations are a valuable aid in establishing and maintaining an atmosphere of free and responsible discussion and of intellectual exploration on the campus. They are a means of bringing student concerns to the attention of the faculty and administration and of formulating student opinion on various issues on the campus and in the world at large. In pursuit of these goals, student publications enjoy the freedom of the press. At the same time, the editorial freedom of student editors and managers entails a corollary obligation to be governed by the canons of responsible journalism. 2.1.5 Students with Disabilities and Requests for Reasonable Accommodation The University is committed to providing students with disabilities equal access to the educational opportunities and programs available at Princeton. Princeton’s Policy on Disability and Accessibility is implemented in the context of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 as amended, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504), and the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination, which prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability. The term "disability" may include learning, physical, sensory, psychological, and certain temporary disabilities. The University provides students with reasonable accommodations in accordance with the ADA/Section 504 and applicable state law. Students with disabilities may request academic accommodations; housing and dining accommodations; modifications to University policies, rules, and regulations; environmental adjustments such as the removal of architectural, communication, or transportation barriers; and auxiliary aids and services. Students should submit all accommodation requests to the Office of Disability Services (ODS). Students requesting accommodations should review the guidance provided by ODS on requirements for documentation, but generally must submit documentation that clearly demonstrates that (1) the student has a physical or mental impairment, and (2) the impairment prevents the normal exercise of any bodily or mental functions (or can be shown to exist through accepted clinical or laboratory diagnostic tests), as compared to most people in the general population. A diagnosis of a disorder, or submission of an evaluation, does not automatically qualify an individual for accommodations. Appropriate documentation must be provided by a qualified professional, meet currency requirements, include diagnosis information as well as information about the functional limitations caused by the impairment, and support the request for specific accommodations. In some cases, the ODS evaluation may include review of documentation by an outside consultant engaged by Princeton. Accommodations are determined through an interactive process that includes an intake interview. The full text of the Policy on Disability and Accessibility can be viewed online at: http://inclusive.princeton.edu/addressing-concerns/policies/policy-disability-and-accessibility. Other relevant policies and procedures can be found at http://inclusive.princeton.edu/addressing-concerns/disability-accessibility and http://ods.princeton.edu/student-services/student-services-process. Members of the University community are expected to be familiar with and adhere to the regulations set forth in the Policy on Disability and Accessibility. 2.2 Regulations Concerning Specific Aspects of Student Life 2.2.1 Dormitory Regulations A student resident in a University dormitory agrees to the terms and conditions outlined in the University room contract. In general, dormitory residents themselves have authority to make their own social rules, so long as those rules conform to the general guidelines defined in the following paragraphs, as well as to the University's general conduct regulations. Note: there are a companion set of regulations available for graduate student apartments. Undergraduate students who choose gender inclusive housing may be assigned to the same room regardless of gender. In graduate dormitory housing, students of different genders generally may not share the same room or suite, but they may share the same bathroom. However, specifically designated rooms, bathrooms, or suites in graduate dormitories may be made available for shared occupancy or use as gender-neutral housing. Space in University dormitories is made available to regularly enrolled students of Princeton for their personal use, and use of such space cannot be transferred to any other individual. While students are permitted to have guests (including Princeton students staying in a room for which they do not have a housing contract) for short periods of time, extended visits are not permitted. Where applicable, the privilege of having overnight guests is subject to the approval of all roommates. Students are responsible for ensuring that they and their guests abide by all University conduct regulations within their assigned room or suite. Generally, students will be subject to disciplinary action for any violation of University policy that takes place within their assigned room or suite, unless they neither knew about nor consented to the behavior or activity in question, or could not reasonably have been expected to foresee that a violation would ensue. Members of the dormitory community are expected to act with a considerate regard for the rights, privileges, and sensibilities of others. Dormitory residents should respect the desire of all members of the community for a reasonable degree of privacy. It is expected that residents will show consideration for the property of their peers and of the University. The student is responsible for loss or damage to University property (including the furniture, life safety and security devices, and the accommodations) provided for the use of the student. In the event of loss or damage, the student using the accommodations will be charged for necessary repairs or replacements. In addition, students who damage private property or University property will be subject to University disciplinary action. Students may be held liable for all losses or damages resulting from negligent and/or purposeful acts and may also be liable for any loss or damage incurred by their guests who are non-University members. Students may not appropriate University furniture from common spaces for use in a dorm room, nor remove from a dorm room the University furniture assigned to that room except as noted on the Housing and Real Estate Services website. Additionally, students my not remove furniture from furnished apartments. Failure to fully vacate a dormitory room by the date required in the dormitory contract is considered an unauthorized occupancy of a residential unit (see section 1.4.7). The faculty retains general oversight of undergraduate dormitories. The University Student Life Committee is responsible for making policy recommendations to the vice president for campus life and the director of housing and real estate services. Violations of dormitory regulations are adjudicated by the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students, the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline, the Residential College Disciplinary Board, the Office of the Dean of the Graduate School, or the Housing and Real Estate Services Office. Housing policies, regulations, and services are outlined on the Housing and Real Estate Services website. Undergraduate students and graduate students living in the undergraduate dormitories, Graduate College and Annexes or in University rentals: https://hres.princeton.edu/policies Noise Every Princeton student residing on campus has the right to a reasonably quiet environment in which to study and to pursue other interests. The University expects all students to respect this right and to be aware of the impact of their activities on their neighbors. Audio speakers, for example, should be placed in such a way as not to interfere with the activities of others. Normally, audio equipment should be placed away from doors and open windows. While social gatherings are an essential part of campus life, students responsible for hosting parties are urged to be considerate of their neighbors. Throughout the academic year, including reading period and exam times, if the Department of Public Safety receives complaints about a loud party or other noisemaking activity prior to midnight on weeknights or 2 a.m. on weekends (Friday–Saturday and Saturday–Sunday nights only), the public safety officers will ask the hosts to reduce the noise level. After the curfew hour, or at any time after a second call for a noise violation at the same location, the public safety officers are authorized to end the activity in question. Dormitory residents concerned about excessive noise should feel free, at any time, to call the public safety officers for assistance. All noise complaints are noted by the Department of Public Safety. Violations of this noise policy may result in disciplinary action by the Office of the Dean of the Graduate School or the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students. Animals in Housing The only pets that may be kept in dormitory rooms are fish contained in tanks that do not exceed 10 gallons. Students requesting an assistance animal due to a documented disability may do so through our Housing Accommodation processes. Graduate students and incoming undergraduates submit requests to the Office of Disability Services. All other undergraduate students must apply through the Housing Accommodation process sponsored by the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students or register with the Office of Disability Services at any time. Information on the University's Service and Assistance Animals policy can be found at: https://inclusive.princeton.edu/addressing-concerns/policies/service-and-assistance-animals-policy. Requests for Assistance Animals will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Students seeking to have a service animal in housing should contact the Office of Disability Services. Posting of Notices Posters or notices of any kind may be affixed only to bulletin boards in dormitory entryways, food service units, academic and administration buildings, and outdoor kiosks, lampposts, and bulletin boards. Individuals are encouraged to remove outdated material from kiosks and bulletin boards rather than postering over existing notices. (See also section 1.2.4.) Smoking Princeton University is committed to providing a healthy, smoke-free living environment for all its students. Further, New Jersey law prohibits smoking in all dormitories/annexes, including private student rooms and common areas. In accordance with the University's smoking policy, smoking is not permitted anywhere within Princeton University dormitories/annexes or graduate student apartment buildings or units. More information on the University's smoking policy can be found at: https://ehs.princeton.edu/health-safety-the-campus-community/smoking-campus. Fire Safety Policy Students are required to comply with all policies governing fire safety. These policies are intended to create a safe environment for members of the University community and to minimize potential fire and life safety hazards. Students are expected to evacuate dormitories and all other University buildings when a fire alarm activates or when instructed to do so by public safety or other University staff. For more information, students should consult the Fire Safety Policies on the Housing and Real Estate Services website at: Undergraduate students and graduate students living in the undergraduate dormitories, Graduate College, and annexes: https://hres.princeton.edu/policies/fire-safety Candle/Flammable Liquid/Incense/Fireworks Policy The University candle/incense ban is a total ban in all dormitories and annexes. Candles/incense do not have to show signs of use and/or be out of manufacturer's wrapping. All candles/incense will be confiscated and immediately disposed of. A $100 fine will be issued along with possible disciplinary action by the dean's office for lit or unlit candles/incense. If damage occurs to a room due to candles/incense, the student will be held liable for charges to restore the room to its original condition. Storage Storage space is extremely limited in the dormitories. During the academic year, therefore, students may store their possessions only in their suites or in designated storage areas. Possessions found in other areas will be treated as abandoned goods, and will be disposed of by the University at its sole discretion. During the summer vacation, all personal possessions must be removed from dormitory rooms. Lofts Lofts which conform to University standards and that incorporate the bed frames and mattress are permitted in dormitory rooms. Please consult the Housing Office for information regarding appropriate specifications. Privacy and Right of Re-entry The University respects the privacy of the student but reserves the right to re-enter and take possession of the accommodations upon breach of any term of this agreement. The University may enter the accommodations during reasonable hours to provide efficient service and maintenance. The University may enter the accommodations without notice for the purposes of emergency service, safety and room condition inspections, or if there is reason to believe that any term or condition of this agreement or any University policy is being violated. When entering accommodations, the University may be accompanied by an outside party, such as a municipal fire inspector. Search of Dormitory Rooms An administrative search of dormitory rooms (excluding safety inspections) will be carried out only with adequate cause, and with the explicit authorization of the dean of undergraduate students, the dean of the Graduate School, or some other senior administrative officer. Such a search may be conducted, for example, where there is reason to believe that the health and safety of an individual (or the campus community) is at stake or a term or condition of this agreement or a University policy is being violated. Should such a search be necessary, every effort will be made to have the resident present at the time of the search. If it is impossible to arrange to have the resident present, the resident will be informed of the action as soon as possible following the search. 2.2.2 Other Building and Safety Regulations Entering mechanical areas (rooms, steam, and utility tunnels, etc.), construction sites, or other restricted areas is prohibited. Entering upon exterior elevated surfaces of campus buildings (roofs, fire escapes, terraces, balconies, parapets, or ledges above the first floor) is prohibited except in emergencies or in the circumstances described below: Authorized persons may, for purposes of research, enter upon the following elevated areas constructed especially for such research: the roof of Jadwin Laboratory, the terrace of the Engineering Research Laboratory, the Butler College rooftop garden, Sherrerd Hall rooftop garden, and the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment rooftop garden. Entrance upon these areas may be authorized at the discretion of the responsible faculty departmental chairs. In addition, members of the faculty and staff may, for purposes of research, request authorization to enter upon elevated surfaces other than those specified above. Such requests will be reviewed by the Office of Environmental Health and Safety in conjunction with the Department of Facilities. Student requests must be sponsored by a faculty or staff member. Any persons may enter upon the following terraces clearly designed for foot traffic and gatherings: Jadwin Plaza, 87 Prospect Avenue Terrace, McCormick Terrace, Simpson International Building balcony, and the Lewis Center for the Arts Terrace (requires prox access). University employees or contractor personnel are authorized to enter upon any elevated surfaces in the performance of official functions. These regulations are intended to prevent injuries to members of the University community, and to prevent physical damage to surfaces, areas, or equipment not designed for traffic or public use. This policy specifically prohibits buildering on any elevated surface on the campus. The policy also prohibits entering upon any dormitory exterior areas above the first floor. (While some exterior elevated areas of the dormitories may appear to have been designed for foot traffic or gatherings, all such spaces are to be used only as a second means of egress in case of fire.) No items, including antennas and wire, lights, flags, banners, etc., may be placed on or affixed to the outside of any building. No items may be placed on fire escapes at any time, under any circumstances. Because of the seriousness of the regulations regarding fire safety and use of steam and utility tunnels and exterior elevated surfaces of campus buildings, the University will take disciplinary action on a first offense. Such action may include the imposition of a fine by the Housing Office. Undergraduate students and graduate students should refer to the applicable fire safety policies on the Housing and Real Estate Services website for specific information regarding such fines at: Undergraduate students and graduate students living in the undergraduate dormitories, Graduate College and Annexes: https://hres.princeton.edu/policies/fire-safety-policies. Graduate students and undergraduate students living in rental units: https://hres.princeton.edu/policies/apartment-living. The University has the right, moreover, to require students who have violated these safety rules (or any other dormitory regulations) to vacate their accommodations with no financial credit for the remainder of the semester. In order to ensure the safety of students engaged in certain academic, research, and extracurricular activities, the University has established policies governing safety practices in research facilities and machine shops. These regulations are explained during safety training required of all participants and students are expected to adhere to all regulations and lab and shop safety postings. Failure to do so may result in disciplinary action. For clarification of the above safety regulations, please consult the Housing Office, Office of Environmental Health and Safety, the University Fire Marshal's Office, or the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students. 2.2.3 Campus Dining Regulations All individuals living in a residential college, regardless of class year, are required to sign a Campus Dining contract for one of the specified meal plans. Students requesting accommodations for medical reasons should contact the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students or the Office of Disability Services. Detailed terms of dining contracts are available at https://dining.princeton.edu/meal-plans. 2.2.4 Health Regulations Health Services offerings and services are outlined on the University Health Services website at uhs.princeton.edu. University Health Services has policies and procedures governing the confidentiality of student health records and the extent to which information may or may not be released. Specific immunizations are required for enrolled students by the University and the state of New Jersey. An up-to-date list of immunizations that are required can be found at uhs.princeton.edu/medical-services/immunizations-allergy-shots/required-recommended-immunizations. For further information, contact University Health Services. 2.2.5 Disorderly Conduct and Disrespectful Conduct Students are expected to conduct themselves in accordance with the law and commonly accepted standards of behavior. Unauthorized entry into restricted spaces, combative or disruptive conduct with local or University medical, law enforcement, fire, emergency or other personnel, excessive noise, public nudity, public urination, disrespect for spaces that requires cleanup by University staff members, or other behaviors that clearly disrupt and disrespect the working and/or living conditions of others, may be met with disciplinary sanctions. 2.2.6 University Ban on the Nude Olympics For a number of years undergraduates, predominantly members of the sophomore class, gathered as a group in Holder Courtyard on the night of the first snowfall, virtually naked, and in an environment that included student alcohol abuse, underage drinking, lack of concern for the welfare of fellow students, and risk of harm to themselves, to other people, and to property. This gathering came to be known as the "Nude Olympics." In the spring of 1999, the president of the University and the Board of Trustees accepted the recommendation of the committee on the Nude Olympics that this activity be banned, effective immediately, because of the severe health and safety risks posed by the event. The undergraduate student body is advised that they may not attempt to organize or engage in any activity that is perceived to perpetuate gatherings or events that contain or encourage some or all of the behaviors that have been associated with past Nude Olympics. These prohibitions apply to the campus, as well as to public and private property in the surrounding communities. Any undergraduate engaging in activity that, in the judgment of the dean of undergraduate students or a designee, could reasonably appear to others to perpetuate gatherings or events that contain or encourage such behaviors is subject to suspension from the University for a period of at least one year. The penalty will be increased for aggravating behaviors, such as committing acts of vandalism, harassment, or avoiding apprehension by campus public safety officers or municipal police. Normal disciplinary procedures will apply, except that (1) the dean of undergraduate students, or a designee, will hear the case and assign the penalty, and (2) appeals will be brought to a subcommittee of the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline. The president and board ask members of the University community to report information they have regarding possible violations of this policy to the Department of Public Safety or the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students. 2.2.7 Hazing New Jersey Law In compliance with New Jersey statute, Princeton University is required to notify all students of their rights under law. A person is guilty of hazing, a disorderly persons offense, if, in connection with the initiation of applicants to or members of a student or fraternal organization, that person knowingly or recklessly organizes, promotes, facilitates, or engages in any conduct, other than competitive athletic events, which places or may place another person in danger of bodily injury. A person is guilty of aggravated hazing, a crime of the fourth degree, if that person commits an act which results in serious bodily injury to another person. Consent shall not be available as a defense to a prosecution under law. Conduct constituting an offense under the law may be prosecuted under any applicable provision of Title 2C:40 of the New Jersey Statutes. University Prohibition on Hazing Any student shall have the right to be free of all activities which might constitute hazing, while attempting to become a member of, or maintain membership in, a fraternity, sorority, athletic team, student organization, eating club, or other organization. Organizations, their members, and their prospective members are prohibited from engaging in or encouraging others to engage in activities that are defined as hazing. Hazing encompasses a broad range of behaviors that (a) may place another person in danger of bodily injury, or (b) that demonstrates indifference or disregard for another person's dignity or well-being. Examples of hazing include but are not limited to the following: Ingestion of alcohol, food, drugs, or any undesirable substance. Participation in sexual rituals or assaults. Emotionally or psychologically abusive or demeaning behavior. Acts that could result in physical, psychological, or emotional deprivation or harm. Physical abuse, e.g., whipping, paddling, beating, tattooing, branding, and exposure to the elements, or the threat of such behaviors. Participation in illegal activities or activities prohibited by University policy. Where an activity amounts to hazing, a person’s consent to the activity is not a defense. In order to encourage students who may hesitate to report incidents of hazing for fear of revealing other policy violations, the University may offer leniency to a reporting student with respect to the behavior reported, depending on the circumstances involved. Acceptable Behavior Any new member initiation process should be conducted in a manner that respects the dignity of new members and protects their mental and physical well-being. Examples of acceptable behavior include the promotion of scholarship or service, the development of leadership or social skills or of career goals, involvement with alumni, building an awareness of organizational history, development of a sense of solidarity with other organization members, or activities that otherwise promote the mission of the organization or of the University. For additional information, see https://odus.princeton.edu/community-standards/hazing. 2.2.8 Fraternities and Sororities The University does not recognize fraternities and sororities because, in general, they do not add in positive ways to the overall residential experience on the campus. These organizations can contribute to a sense of social exclusiveness and often place an excessive emphasis on alcohol. Students are discouraged from participating in these organizations. Sororities and fraternities are not permitted to use any University resources or participate in University-sponsored events (e.g., Student Activities Fair, Princeton Preview Program, etc.). Prohibited Activities First-year students may not affiliate with a fraternity or sorority. Affiliation includes but is not limited to: membership; "pledging" (i.e., participating in new member programming); participating in "rush" (i.e., formal recruitment); attending or participating in any activity sponsored by a fraternity or sorority; or contributing funds to a fraternity or sorority. Students may not solicit the participation of any first-year students in a fraternity or sorority, including by electronic means. Solicitation includes but is not limited to: conferring membership on a first-year student; inviting a first-year student to pledge or participate in new member programming; including a first-year student in rush or formal recruitment; inviting a first-year student to attend or participate in any activity sponsored by a fraternity or sorority; organizing a sponsored event to which first-year students are invited; or soliciting or accepting funds from a first-year student on behalf of a fraternity or sorority. Indications that an activity is "sponsored" by a fraternity or sorority may include but are not limited to: an invitation to participants on behalf of a fraternity or sorority; the use of fraternity or sorority funds to support the activity; or an announcement or other explicit identification of fraternity or sorority sponsorship. The presence of individuals who are members of the fraternity or sorority is not, alone, evidence of sponsorship. This policy applies to activities that occur both on and off campus. Students Covered by This Policy A student will only be held responsible for actions which a reasonable person in that student's position would have known were contrary to this policy. A student who is not a member of a fraternity or sorority will not be held responsible for solicitation unless there is clear and persuasive evidence that the student acted on behalf of or actively and intentionally enabled members of a fraternity/sorority in violating the policy. For the purposes of this policy, Bridge Year Program participants and students who have been admitted to Princeton but who have not yet matriculated are considered first-year students. Students are considered first-year students until the end of the final examination period of their second semester at Princeton. Definition of a Fraternity or Sorority For the purposes of this policy, a fraternity or sorority is a student organization (i.e., an entity with a leadership or financial structure that has or intends to have a persisting identity over time) is not recognized by the University, and either has Greek letters in its name and an affiliation with a national organization or has a primarily social purpose and an exclusive membership. This policy does not apply to the eating clubs or to any organization whose membership is not open to any Princeton student. Consequences Any violation of this policy will be regarded as a serious matter. A student who engages in solicitation, as defined above, should expect to be suspended. A first-year student who joins, pledges, or rushes a fraternity or sorority should expect to be suspended. A first-year student who attends or participates in any other activity or event sponsored by a fraternity or sorority may be subject to a lesser penalty (e.g., disciplinary probation). All relevant facts and circumstances will be taken into account in determining the appropriate penalty. The University may offer leniency to a student who has been extraordinarily forthcoming during an investigation under this policy where that student might otherwise have been implicated in an infraction. 2.2.9 Alcohol Policy Students at Princeton University are responsible for knowing and abiding by both state and University regulations regarding the consumption of alcohol. The University provides educational programs and information on alcohol and drug abuse as well as counseling services related to alcohol and other drug use. Students are expected and encouraged to be aware of the social, physiological, and psychological consequences and personal risks of excessive drinking in order to make responsible and informed decisions about the serving and consumption of alcohol. Students who take prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, or herbal or other supplements are expected to be aware of the consequences of drinking alcohol in combination with those medications. The University alcoholic beverage policy is consistent with the laws of the state of New Jersey that, in general, prohibit the consumption and serving of alcoholic beverages by and to persons under 21 years of age. Students will be deemed to have served alcohol when they have made alcohol available to others, regardless of whether any alcohol is actually consumed. Students' responsibility for violations of University policy that take place within their assigned room or suite is described in section 2.2.1. Students are responsible for their behavior, whether or not they are under the influence of alcohol. The consumption of alcohol does not constitute a mitigating circumstance when it contributes to the violation of University regulations. The policy affirms the need for mutual respect and personal responsibility within a diverse community. The University respects the right to privacy, and its representatives will not enter dormitory rooms without substantive cause (e.g., without reasonable suspicion that University policies or regulations have been violated, or that someone's safety is in jeopardy). However, those whose behavior infringes on the rights of others have, in essence, forfeited that privacy. What Are the Responsibilities of Princeton University Students? Alcoholic beverages normally will not be provided at events where persons under the legal drinking age for consumption of alcoholic beverages are present, including those sponsored by the University, the residential colleges, the University centers, the Undergraduate Student Government, and the classes. Those who are of legal drinking age and who wish to host a gathering with alcohol must obtain approval from and comply with the guidelines established by the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students (see http://odusapps.princeton.edu/Alcohol) or the Office of the Dean of the Graduate School. Availability of alcoholic beverages shall not be the primary focus of advertising for campus social events. Those given approval to serve alcoholic beverages are responsible for ensuring that only those of legal drinking age are served, that alcohol is consumed—if at all—in a legal, healthy, and responsible way, and that no intoxicated individuals are served. It is the immediate obligation of those in the presence of a severely intoxicated person to contact appropriate University or local medical or safety personnel (such as the Department of Public Safety, University Health Services (UHS) staff, local hospital staff, or local police or members of the rescue squad). Neither intoxication nor admission to UHS for intoxication will be grounds for disciplinary action. Contacting the Department of Public Safety for assistance in transporting a student in need of medical attention will not, in itself, lead to disciplinary action. Disciplinary action will occur only if other circumstances indicating a violation of University policy are observed. In such an instance, failure to call for assistance will be considered an especially serious violation of policy. In order to encourage calls for assistance, the University may offer leniency with respect to other violations which may come to light as a result of such calls, depending on the circumstances involved. When Will the Department of Public Safety or Other University Administrators Intervene? Public Safety (or another University administrator) may enter a room whenever there is reasonable cause to believe that someone's safety may be in jeopardy or that a violation of the alcohol policy is taking place. Public Safety will investigate possible alcohol violations when indicators of alcohol provision are observed. Such indicators may include—but are not limited to—kegs, bottles, cans, spilled alcohol, an individual leaving a room in possession of alcohol, or intoxicated behavior. Alcohol, kegs, and/or taps used in violation of the University’s alcohol regulations will be confiscated. In the event of a noise complaint, Public Safety will go to the room and knock on the door. If no one answers, Public Safety may enter the room and instruct the residents of the room to control the noise. Regardless, Public Safety may enter the room where there is cause to investigate further, as described above. When Are Princeton University Students in Violation of the Alcohol Policy? On campus, students are in violation of the University alcohol policy under any or all of the following circumstances, and alcohol, kegs, and/or taps used in violation of the below regulations will be confiscated: When participating in or organizing an activity that encourages excessive drinking (e.g., drinking games, pre-gaming with hard alcohol, initiation activities, hazing), as these acts can endanger the individual being served. These are especially serious violations. When the serving or consumption of alcohol contributes to behavior that (i) intimidates or harasses others; (ii) injures or threatens to injure others (e.g., driving under the influence of alcohol, assault); (iii) leads to the destruction of property; or (iv) infringes on the peace and privacy of others. These are especially serious violations. In keeping with state law, when a student has been detained by Public Safety or local law enforcement officials on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol, the refusal to submit to the taking of breath samples for the purpose of determining blood alcohol content will be taken as conclusive evidence that the student was driving under the influence of alcohol. Violations of local ordinances or state laws by students may also be grounds for University disciplinary action, regardless of where such violations occur, if they clearly violate University standards of conduct. Additional state and federal laws can be found at https://odus.princeton.edu/community-standards. Failure to immediately contact appropriate University or local medical or safety personnel (such as the Department of Public Safety, University Health Services (UHS) staff, local hospital staff, or local police or members of the local rescue squad) on behalf of a severely intoxicated person. On campus, students are in violation of the University alcohol policy under any or all of the following circumstances, and alcohol, kegs, and/or taps used in violation of the below regulations will be confiscated. When carrying or possessing an open container of alcohol (defined as any container not sealed by the manufacturer) in or across common spaces (lounges, game rooms, courtyards, dining areas, hallways, etc.). When in possession of a keg and/or tap or other evidence of intent to serve alcohol, including alcohol delivered in large quantities to the University Mailroom (unless permission has been granted by the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students or the Office of the Dean of the Graduate School). When, under the age of 21, in possession of any container of alcohol in common spaces of the University, including alcohol delivered to the University Mailroom. When alcohol is served, provided, or made available by or to persons under the age of 21. Violations involving juveniles, such as high school applicants or visitors to the University, will be deemed particularly serious. When alcohol is served, provided, or made available to any person, regardless of age, without prior approval from the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students or the Office of the Dean of the Graduate School. When procuring alcohol for persons under the age of 21 or by using false identification or falsifying identification. What Are the Consequences of Violating the Alcohol Policy? Students who are in violation of the alcohol policy are subject to a range of University sanctions: warning, reprimand, disciplinary probation (including housing, and/or campus service sanctions), withholding of degree, suspension, suspension with conditions, expulsion, and censure. In keeping with the University's particular concern about high-risk alcohol use, the consequences for violations of the alcohol policy will reflect the level of risk represented by the behavior as well as the impact of the behavior upon the community. In general, first instance lower-risk violations will result in a dean's warning or reprimand; subsequent violations will result in, at a minimum, disciplinary probation. Examples of lower-risk alcohol violations include, but are not necessarily limited to, situations where: Only low-proof alcohol (under 30 proof) is present; A modest amount of alcohol is available, appropriate to the number of persons present; No high-risk drinking, including drinking games, is occurring; No "common sources" of alcohol, such as kegs or alcoholic punch, are present; Neither the serving nor the consumption of alcohol has contributed to behavior that infringes on the peace and privacy of others (e.g., disorderly conduct, harassment, vandalism or property damage, injuring or threatening to injure others, or driving under the influence of alcohol). The University regards higher-risk violations of the alcohol policy as more serious than lower-risk violations. In general, a student who commits a first higher-risk alcohol violation is placed on disciplinary probation. Discipline for a second higher-risk offense will be more serious and may involve a long term of disciplinary probation, campus service, and/or revocation of on-campus residential privileges. Students should expect to be suspended for a third higher-risk alcohol or alcohol-related offense or for any particularly egregious first or second offense. Higher-risk alcohol violations include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: The serving, providing, or making available of hard alcohol (in any quantity); The possession of hard alcohol by underage persons in common spaces of the University; The possession of kegs or other common sources of alcohol; Drinking games, including those where some participants are playing with non-alcoholic beverages; The possession of any large quantity of alcohol (of any kind) relative to the number of people present; Violations that result from intoxication, such as assault, harassment, disorderly conduct, vandalism, or property damage. Failing to immediately contact appropriate University or local medical or safety personnel on behalf of a severely intoxicated person. Deans and directors of student life may notify a student's parents following any significant incident of drug/alcohol-related misconduct. Alcohol, kegs, and/or taps used in violation of the above regulations will be confiscated. Students who violate the University's alcohol or drug policies are encouraged to avail themselves of the services of the Alcohol and Other Drug Program offered by the University Office of Counseling and Psychological Services. When appropriate, deans and directors of student life may require an alcohol/drug evaluation by University Health Services staff (UHS). 2.2.10 Drug Policy Princeton University does not condone the possession, use, manufacture, or distribution of illegal substances, marijuana, cannabis or drug paraphernalia of any kind in any amount, or the possession, use, manufacture, or distribution of prescription drugs without a prescription. This prohibition applies on-campus and to participation in University activities off-campus, including but not limited to work-study programs, off-campus events, and off-campus research projects. Students in violation of this policy may be jeopardizing their own well-being as well as the well-being of the University community. In general, a student who violates this policy for the first time will be issued a reprimand or placed on probation, depending on the substance and the circumstances. Discipline for a second offense will be more serious and may involve lengthening the probation, campus service, and/or revocation of on-campus residential privileges. Students should expect to be suspended for a third offense. Students involved in such cases, when their conduct is in violation of the law, cannot be guaranteed immunity from either arrest or prosecution. Among those violations considered to be most serious are the manufacture, sale, or distribution of illegal drugs or prescription drugs without a prescription; any involvement in illegal drug use or traffic with minors, particularly from the local area; and possession or use of the more dangerous or highly addictive drugs. Students engaged in activities described in this paragraph should expect a lengthy separation or expulsion from the University upon a first offense. Students possessing, using, selling, or manufacturing illegal substances may also be subject to mandatory penalties prescribed by the state. It is the immediate obligation of those in the presence of a person suffering adverse consequences of using drugs to contact appropriate University or local medical or safety personnel (such as the Department of Public Safety, University Health Services staff (UHS), local hospital staff, or local police or members of the rescue squad). In order to encourage calls for assistance, the University may offer leniency with respect to violations which may come to light as a result of such calls, depending on the circumstances involved. The Department of Public Safety (or another University administrator) may enter a room whenever there is reasonable cause to believe that someone's safety may be in jeopardy or that a violation of the drug policy is taking place, unless otherwise prohibited by law. 2.2.11 Conduct at Prospect Avenue Clubs Standards of behavior by University students in the independent Prospect Avenue clubs are to conform with established standards in the University as a whole. In particular, club members are to act with considerate regard for the rights, privileges, and sensibilities of others. It is expected that they will show due consideration for the property of their fellow members and guests, as well as for the property of the club itself. Physical violence, intimidation of others, or offensive and disorderly behavior will not be tolerated in any club or on the walks and streets outside clubs. It is also the immediate obligation of those in the presence of a severely intoxicated person to contact appropriate University or local medical or safety personnel (see section 2.2.9). University policy in cases in which misconduct is alleged to have taken place in the clubs is governed by the provisions set forth concerning off-campus activities (see section 1.4.2). 2.2.12 Transportation and Parking Services Undergraduate Student Parking Policy All students must be familiar with the Princeton University parking regulations since students are responsible for their own and their guests' vehicles. Frequent violations of the parking rules and regulations will result in the revocation of parking privileges and/or may result in disciplinary action. Detailed regulations and campus maps are available online at transportation.princeton.edu. Undergraduate Student Parking Princeton University is a pedestrian campus; students are expected to walk, bike, or ride TigerTransit to classes, eating clubs, and athletic practices and events. Undergraduate students are generally not permitted to bring a vehicle to campus. For alternate transportation options, please visit transportation.princeton.edu. Transportation and Parking Services (TPS) has an exemption process available to those undergraduates with a compelling need for a parking permit. A compelling need will be defined as a need that cannot be reasonably accommodated by University, commercial, regional transit or transportation options, or, would therefore cause a hardship. Requests for exemptions, together with supporting documentation, should be submitted to Transportation and Parking Services through the process outlined on the TPS website at transportation.princeton.edu. The Parking Committee will review all requests. Medical exemption requests must have supporting documentation from a physician and will be reviewed by University Health Services. The committee, at its discretion, may request additional information. Students will be notified in a timely manner. If approved, students will need to register and pay a fee in order to obtain a permit for campus parking. A current state-issued vehicle registration card and a valid TigerCard is necessary to purchase a parking permit. With the purchase of a valid Princeton University parking permit, students are permitted day and overnight parking in lots designated lots as determined by TPS. Repeated violations of the parking policy will result in the revocation of the parking permit. Any student who seeks to register a vehicle on behalf of another student, non-student, or student who is not currently enrolled, will be reported for disciplinary action. Parking in the numbered faculty/staff parking lots is permitted only after staff working hours at 5 p.m. and vehicles must be removed by 2 a.m. Please note that lots 8, 9, 18 and 21 are restricted at all times. Parking in these lots will result in an immediate boot or tow. Parking in areas next to buildings (e.g., Bloomberg, Scully, Frist, etc.) is restricted at all times. Parking in these areas will result in towing without prior warning or citation. Students who continuously violate the parking rules and regulations will be reported for disciplinary action and revocation of future parking privileges. Guests Parking arrangements for guests are the responsibility of the inviting party. To avoid unwanted citations and possible towing of a vehicle, students must make parking arrangements through Transportation and Parking Services for their guests. For a fee, temporary parking permits will be issued to guests who require parking from Monday, 8 a.m., through Friday, 5 p.m. On weekends, from Friday, 5 p.m., through Monday, 2 a.m., guests may park free in designated lots as listed on the TPS website at transportation.princeton.edu. 2.2.13 Legal Assistance The Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students and the Office of the Dean of the Graduate School are authorized to provide specific kinds of aid to students who have been charged with violations of the law or who are actually under arrest. In such cases, University officials may: Provide the student with the names of a few local attorneys; the student may or may not choose to consult with persons from this list. Help to arrange bail, if the student or parents cannot provide immediate funds for bail. In special circumstances, the University may make a loan for the amount of bail (or of a bondsman's fee) if the student and/or parent so authorizes. In all instances, the cost of bail, as well as the cost of legal counsel, are the full responsibility of the student and the student's family. The University's actions in such cases are undertaken in an effort to ensure the protection of the student's rights and safety, and are not to be construed as efforts to afford the student special treatment in respect to the law. 2.2.14 Financial Regulations Students are responsible for satisfying all student account obligations by the due date on the student bill. A student who fails to meet all financial obligations may be subject to one or more of the following: (a) prohibited from course selection and/or course changes, (b) placed on leave of absence until all financial obligations are met, (c) prohibited from enrolling or being readmitted to the University, (d) refused a transcript, (e) denied a diploma document at graduation, and (f) payment of all reasonable collection agency fees, attorney charges, and legal fees necessary for the collection of outstanding indebtedness. Additional financial information regarding tuition and terms of payment is available online at www.princeton.edu/studentaccounts. 2.2.15 Use of University Monies (Including Student Fees) University funds, including fees collected by the University from all students (or their parents) as a condition of enrollment in the University, can be used only for purposes integrally related to student activities at the University. Such funds should not be used to make grants to organizations outside the University, thus rendering the University, in effect, a conduit for the transfer of funds. An annual fee is assessed to all enrolled graduate students in residence in order to fund activities of the Graduate Student Government, and at the discretion of the Graduate Student Government, to support other organizations and events. Undergraduate activity monies can be allocated through the Undergraduate Student Government for the support of the on-campus activities of campus groups, including provision of funds to assist in fund-raising efforts, in educational and informational campaigns, and the like. University policy stipulates, however, that each of the many causes that compete for student attention should make its own case to potential sources of funds on campus and should solicit from individuals voluntary contributions specifically for the particular purposes of that organization. 2.3 The Undergraduate Honor System 2.3.1 Jurisdiction over Undergraduates for Violations of Academic Rules and Regulations Jurisdiction over violations of academic rules and regulations rests with two distinct committees at Princeton. All written examinations, tests, and quizzes that take place in class are conducted under the honor system. All violations of the honor system are the concern of the Undergraduate Honor Committee. Violations of rules and regulations pertaining to all other academic work, including essays, term papers, laboratory reports, and take-home examinations fall under the jurisdiction of the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline. Should there be any uncertainty regarding which body is responsible for the adjudication of a particular case, clarification should be requested from the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students and the chair of the Honor Committee. 2.3.2 Introduction Princeton's honor system was established by the undergraduates in 1893 and has been in effect without interruption since that time. It has been successful because generations of undergraduates have respected it, and by common agreement, have given it highest place among their obligations as Princeton students. Student Obligation to the Honor Code At Princeton all in-class written examinations, tests, and quizzes are conducted under the honor system. Its constitution is printed in full below. A letter from the chair of the Honor Committee explaining the honor system is included in the online matriculation website. Newly admitted students then signify by submitting the Honor Code statement that they understand and will abide by the conditions under which the honor system is conducted. Final entrance to the University is contingent upon the committee's receipt of this submission. Status as a student "in good standing" and graduation from the University are contingent upon continued participation in the honor system. All students acknowledge the obligation to report any suspected violation of the honor system that they have observed. It is the common understanding among Princeton students that, where the honor system is concerned, an individual's obligation to the undergraduate student body as a whole transcends any reluctance to report another student. Thus, under the honor system, students have a twofold obligation: individually, they must not violate the code, and as a community, they are responsible to see that suspected violations are reported. Examination Procedures Set by Faculty Procedures during the course of an examination are determined by the faculty member present. Students may not leave the examination room without the specific permission of the faculty member. Such permission must be granted uniformly; that is, if one student is allowed to leave the room, no other may be denied such permission upon request. Students may not take their examinations with them outside of the examination room. Students are advised to sit one seat apart from other students, to refrain from bringing notes and books into the examination room, and if possible, to avoid sitting near those with whom they have studied. Laptop computers as well as handheld electronic communication devices (e.g., cell phones, BlackBerry devices, etc.) are forbidden in final examination rooms. Additionally, students may not wear headphones attached to audio devices during examinations. The faculty member, who is present only briefly to answer questions and to pick up the completed examinations, has the responsibility to make sure the examinations are turned in by students at the appropriate time. Under the honor system, the students assume full responsibility for honesty in written examinations. Examinations are not supervised. The instructor in charge distributes the examination papers, waits for a short time for any questions, and then leaves the room, returning at the end of the stated period to collect the answer books. On each examination paper, the student writes out and signs the following statement: "I pledge my honor that I have not violated the Honor Code during this examination." Role of Honor Committee The Honor Committee consists of one member of class government from the sophomore, junior, and senior classes. and undergraduates selected by application from the student body at large. Violations of the honor system are the concern of the Undergraduate Honor Committee. When a report of a suspected violation of the honor system is received, the Honor Committee immediately conducts an investigation. If the investigation indicates that it is warranted, the full Honor Committee is convened and a confidential hearing is held. If the student in question is found not responsible, all records of the hearing are destroyed. If a student is found responsible, the committee recommends an appropriate penalty to the dean of undergraduate students. A student found responsible for violating the Honor Code can be given a reprimand, placed on disciplinary probation for a set period of time, or suspended from the University for one semester or one, two, or three years. A second offense can result in expulsion. Censure may be added to all penalties to underscore the seriousness of the violation. 2.3.3 Current Procedure Much of the internal organization and virtually all of the operating procedures of the Honor Committee are determined by the committee itself. The tone and style of each year's committee may vary, but there is continuity in procedure from year to year. Generally there are at least three members on the committee who have served previously. All cases are conducted in accordance to the procedure outlined in the Honor Code Constitution. A typical case would be conducted as follows: Report and Investigation of a Suspected Violation A suspected violation of the honor system is usually brought to the attention of the Honor Committee by a reporting witness. The reporting witness is typically a faculty member, a student, or the violator. After receiving the report, the chair of the committee will assign members of the committee and investigators from the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students to conduct a thorough investigation of the allegation. If necessary, the investigators will meet with the student in question. The meeting in which investigators notify the student in question of the alleged violation will be recorded to ensure fairness. The student in question may also have a witness present during the meeting with the investigators. If the chair and investigators jointly determine that the facts of the case should be evaluated by the entire committee, a hearing will be scheduled. A representative from the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students will serve as a procedural adviser for the student in question. The investigators and/or the chair will inform the student in question that the case will proceed to a hearing, and the student will be given at least 24 hours notice. The committee may also ask potential witnesses to appear at the hearing. As much confidentiality as possible is maintained during the investigation in order to protect the principals from rumor. Hearing In the hearing, witnesses provide information about the possible violation that has been observed and are questioned by the committee. Next, the student in question is given the opportunity to respond to the allegation of a possible violation. The student in question is urged to choose a peer representative who will be present throughout the hearing. Only a current undergraduate member of the University community who is not a member of the Honor Committee may serve as the peer representative. The peer representative may ask questions of all witnesses. Investigators do not participate in deliberations or hearings, but only serve to corroborate information pertaining to the investigation following each witness' testimony. Before the committee begins deliberations on guilt or innocence, the peer representative and the student in question will have the opportunity to make any final remarks. The identities of the student in question, student reporting witnesses and any other student witnesses are kept completely confidential. This helps to ensure that Honor Code-related cases will not lead to prejudice outside the hearing room. Evidence for the hearing usually includes the examination(s) in question and any other relevant material which are duplicated, if necessary, for use by the individual members of the committee during the hearing. If a faculty member reports the alleged violation, or if consultation with the professor administering the examination or the preceptor or section leader of the student in question seems helpful, the committee may call that person or persons to the actual hearing to discuss the facts as then known. The committee may also have present, during the hearing, a student or faculty member who is knowledgeable in the field of the examination in question. After a report of a suspected violation is received, the chair consults with the dean of undergraduate students or the dean's designee concerning the general character of the suspected violation, the nature of the investigation in progress, and any questions that may arise during the course of the investigation. The chair may also, if the chair deems it necessary, consult with the dean during the course of the hearing. The chair also informs an associate dean of undergraduate students of the name of the person under investigation. The associate dean of undergraduate students provides the chair and the investigators, prior to any scheduled hearing, whatever information is determined appropriate concerning the student in question for consideration by the committee. This might include any special or extraordinary circumstances affecting the student. While an investigation or hearing is underway, an administrative hold may, in situations where necessary, be placed on the transcript of the student in question. The only adequate defense for a student accused of an Honor Code violation is that the actions did not, in fact, constitute a violation. In determining whether an Honor Code violation has occurred or the severity of such a violation, the committee will take into account whether the student should have reasonably understood that the actions were in violation of University policy and/or exam room procedures. Neither the defense that the student was ignorant of the regulations concerning the exam nor the defense that the student was under pressure at the time the violation was committed is considered an adequate defense. Decision and Results The principals and witnesses may be called for testimony several times before the committee renders a judgment. The committee deliberates in private and arrives at a decision by individual vote. If the student is found to have intentionally misled the committee during the course of the hearing, the committee may take that fact into account in reaching a conclusion and assigning a penalty. When a decision is reached, the student in question is called and informed of the judgment. Then the reporting witness is informed of the judgment, thanked for the exercise of a responsibility that is difficult but necessary, and cautioned against discussion of the case. Finding of Not Responsible If the student in question is found not responsible, all written record of the student's involvement in the case is destroyed. Finding of Responsibility and Consequences If a student is found responsible, the student is informed of the penalty, which is, at the committee's discretion, a reprimand, disciplinary probation, a suspension for one semester or one, two, or three years, a suspension with conditions, or in the case of a second offense, permanent expulsion. Only the dean of the college may review the final penalty. Appeal An appeal of a decision of the Honor Committee should be directed to the Office of the Dean of the College within one week of the committee's decision. Such appeals can only be made on the grounds of procedural unfairness or harmful bias. The penalty levied by the Honor Committee may not be increased upon appeal. If the dean of the college determines that a penalty of the Honor Committee should be reduced, the dean will make a recommendation to the president, describing the reasons for the proposed modification, and the president will decide whether or not to implement the recommendation. 2.3.4 Constitution of the Honor System Adopted by the Undergraduates in 1893. Amended in 2012, 2014, 2015, 2017, and 2018. Revised in 2015. Article I. Charter and Composition of the Honor Committee A. Charter The Honor Committee consists of 15 members who will represent the student body and address all suspected violations of the Honor Code. B. Composition The members of this committee will be the presidents of the sophomore and junior classes, former sophomore and junior class presidents, two members of the first-year class, and members to be appointed from the student body at large until the committee consists of fifteen members. Appointed members. The first-year class members will be appointed in the fall semester by a subcommittee comprising the Honor Committee chair, the Honor Committee clerk, an additional senior class member of the Honor Committee, one to three voting members of the Undergraduate Student Government Executive Committee as selected by the Undergraduate Student Government president and academics chair, and one or two elected student representatives on the Honor Committee. In the case that one or more of the elected student representatives on the Honor Committee is unable to serve on the subcommittee, two other positions shall be allocated corresponding to an additional member of the Honor Committee and an additional voting member of the Undergraduate Student Government Executive Committee. Under these circumstances, the additional member of the Honor Committee should be a senior class member if at all possible. In the case that a senior class member is unable to serve on the subcommittee, the Honor Committee chair shall select another member of the Honor Committee. Following spring Undergraduate Student Government elections, the Honor Committee will solicit applications from the student body at large. The same subcommittee that selects first-year class members will select the other appointed members as well. Appointed members will serve one-year terms, but may seek reappointment thereafter. Committee members seeking reappointment may not participate in the selection process. All members of the committee excluding the members up for reappointment will reach consensus on whether to retain appointed members or to replace them with a new applicant. All appointments are subject to approval by the Undergraduate Student Government. Ex officio members. The newly elected sophomore and junior class presidents and the newly appointed members will normally become members of the committee at the beginning of the fall term following their election/appointment, but, if needed, can serve on the committee immediately after their election. C. Dismissal and Replacement of Members The committee may dismiss a member for neglect of duty. A vote of 12 of the 14 other members is required for such a dismissal. If any member becomes unable to serve for any reason, or is dismissed, a new member will be appointed by the Honor Committee as explained in Article 1, Section B, subject to approval by the Undergraduate Student Government. Any member who becomes unable to serve or is dismissed for neglect of duty must go through the same selection process as a new applicant if they wish to rejoin the committee. D. Clerk, Chair, and Chair Emeritus Clerk. Every academic year, after the first of December, a subcommittee comprising the Honor Committee chair, Honor Committee clerk, two voting members of the Undergraduate Student Government Executive Committee as selected by the Undergraduate Student Government president and academics chair, and the two longest-serving elected student representatives on the Honor Committee will select a sophomore member of the committee to serve as clerk of the Honor Committee during the following spring and fall semesters. This subcommittee will interview all interested sophomore members of the committee and appoint one sophomore by a majority vote. This sophomore member will automatically become a member of the committee the following year. In the event that the clerk withdraws from the University, or is otherwise unable to serve as chair, the subcommittee described above will convene to select a new clerk from the committee members in the spring semester of their sophomore year or fall semester of their junior year. In the case that one or more of the elected student representatives on the Honor Committee is unable to serve on the subcommittee, two other positions shall be allocated corresponding to an additional member of the Honor Committee and an additional voting member of the Undergraduate Student Government Executive Committee. Under these circumstances, the additional member of the Honor Committee should be a senior class member if at all possible. In the case that a senior class member is unable to serve on the subcommittee, the Honor Committee chair shall select another member of the Honor Committee. Chair. The clerk will become the chair of the Honor Committee at the beginning of the spring semester in their junior year. In the event that the chair withdraws from the University, or is otherwise unable to serve as chair in the spring semester of their junior year, the Chair Emeritus will serve as chair until they graduate, at which time the clerk will become chair. In the event that the chair withdraws from the University, or is otherwise unable to serve as chair, in the fall semester of their senior year, the clerk will become chair. Chair Emeritus. The former chair will take on an advisory role, in addition to their responsibilities as a committee member, as Chair Emeritus during the spring semester of their senior year, to guide the new chair. The Chair Emeritus may serve as acting chair if needed. Evaluation. Each Honor Committee member that is not currently nor ever has been the clerk or the chair will be afforded ONE opportunity to “evaluate” the clerkship or chairship. The evaluation process will proceed as follows: A member of the Honor Committee will initiate the process by providing a statement outlining their reasons for the evaluation to both the Undergraduate Student Government Senate President and the sitting chair of the Honor Committee. The member should declare upon submission of this statement whether or not he/she/they plan to continue with the subsequent steps of the process, keeping in mind that they are allotted only ONE opportunity to conduct an evaluation. If the member chooses not to continue with the subsequent steps of the process, the evaluation ends here. If the member chooses to continue with the process, both the member that has submitted the evaluation and the clerk or chair then under evaluation will interview before an independent committee. This will only take place provided that the member belongs to the constitutionally appropriate year for the position under evaluation. The independent committee will be selected by the Undergraduate Student Government President and composed of nine students. Three of these students must have at least one full semester on the Honor Committee, at least one of whom must be a current member of the Honor Committee. The remaining students must be elected Undergraduate Student Government Senate officials. The independent committee will then determine by a two-thirds vote whether the sitting clerk or chair will be replaced in his/her/their executive capacity by the member submitting the evaluation. Should the independent committee choose to change the clerkship or chairship, such a change is only to take place the following semester, thereby providing a period for transition during the recess. The independent committee will release a statement outlining the criteria upon which the outcome was decided, regardless of whether or not there was a change. This will be done with due consideration for confidentiality for all those involved in the process. Article II. Violations A. The Honor Pledge The Honor Pledge is as follows: "I pledge my honor that I have not violated the Honor Code during this examination." This must at all times be written in full on the examination paper and signed by the student on the examination. Any undergraduate who fails to write and sign the pledge on the examination paper will be reminded to do so by the instructor. If the instructor or the Committee cannot promptly obtain the written and signed pledge, the student will be reported to the Committee for investigation. Unwillingness to sign the pledge following notification by the instructor or the Committee will be prima facie evidence of a violation of the Honor Code. B. Violations Violations of the Honor Code consist of: Any attempt to gain an unfair advantage in regard to an examination, both inside and outside the examination room. Any attempt to give assistance, both inside and outside the examination room, whether the student attempting to give assistance has completed their own work or not. Specific violations include, but are not limited to: Tampering with a graded exam; Claiming another's work to be one's own; and Obtaining or attempting to obtain, previous to any examinations, copies of the examination papers or examination questions, or any illegal knowledge of these questions. Other actions in violation of the policies set forth by the professor. C. Dishonesty 1. Committing dishonesty, defined as lying to or purposely misleading the Committee, is also a violation of the Honor Code. It will not be considered dishonesty for a student to maintain their own innocence. D. Findings of Responsibility 1. A student will be found responsible if the Committee finds overwhelmingly convincing evidence that the student ought reasonably to have understood that their actions were in violation of the Honor Code. E. Reporting Suspected Violations 1. Every student is obligated to report to the Honor Committee any suspected violation of the Honor Code that they have observed. The Committee will make every attempt to ensure the anonymity of reporting students. Students may make reports by emailing honor@princeton.edu, contacting the chair directly, or any member of the committee. Article III. Investigations and Hearings A. Rights for Students In Question Under Investigation A student suspected of a possible violation of the Honor Code is referred to as the “student in question.” During the investigation and hearing process the rights of the student in question include: Rights during investigation The right to be informed that they are under investigation as the student in question before answering any questions. The right to have a witness present during the initial interview with investigators. The right to review in advance of the hearing all documents constituting direct material evidence. The right to call witnesses. The right to maintain innocence at all times during the process. Rights during adjudication The right to have a representative from the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students serve as a procedural adviser prior to the hearing and be present or on call during an adjudication to serve as a nonvoting resource. The right to choose a current undergraduate member of the University community to serve as a peer representative. While the student in question is expected to provide answers to questions, the peer representative may clarify or supplement their answers. The peer representative may also question witnesses. A current member of the Honor Committee may not serve as a peer representative. The Princeton University Peer Representatives are trained students available to support any student accused of violating the Honor Code. The right, in the event of a finding of responsibility, to receive a copy of the chair’s summary of the case. This summary must outline the charge made against the student, describe the evidence and testimony provided in support of this charge, and provide the rationale for the Committee's finding, both in terms of verdict and punishment assigned. The right, in the event of a finding of responsibility, to poll the votes of the individual Committee members. The right, in the event of a finding of responsibility, to listen to any recording made of the hearing. B. Confidentiality All those involved in the investigation and hearing process are expected to maintain the confidentiality of all students involved in the case. C. Investigation Procedures Upon receiving a report of a suspected violation, the chair will appoint members on a rotating basis to conduct a preliminary investigation. If an allegation of an Honor Code violation is made over the summer, the Committee will make every reasonable attempt to investigate it in a timely manner. All cases that cannot be practically concluded over the summer will resume in the fall. The appointed investigators may: Meet with the student or students in question; Meet with witnesses; Collect any relevant documents or material evidence; Obtain any other information bearing on the allegation. The chair and investigators shall utilize the help of professional investigators from the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students during the course of investigations for tasks including but not limited to collecting relevant witness testimony and compiling investigative summaries. When making initial contact with a student, the investigators will disclose the student’s status as a student in question or a witness. If the student’s status changes during the course of the investigation, the investigators will inform them as soon as possible. The investigators’ meeting with the student in question will proceed as follows: The investigators will explain the rights of the student in question (see III.A. above). The student in question will be asked to sign a statement prior to a hearing saying they have been informed of their rights under the Honor Constitution. The student in question will be asked to provide an account of the suspected violation in question. The student in question will be given a letter, describing the suspected violation in reasonable detail, from the reporting witness. The letter need not be signed. The investigators will explain the nature of the suspected violation. Upon the completion of the investigation, the investigators in consultation with the chair will determine whether or not a hearing is warranted. If a hearing is not warranted, all records of the case that personally identify the student in question or any other student will be immediately destroyed. If a hearing is warranted, the student may exercise their right of up to seven days of preparation. D. Hearing Procedures The place and time of all hearings will be determined by the chair. The Committee will make every reasonable attempt to hold and adjudicate the hearing in a timely manner. All cases that cannot be practically concluded over the summer will resume in the fall. The hearing will proceed as follows: The chair will preside and will appoint six other members to hear the case. The Committee will use a recording device to record the proceedings of each case. The student in question will be given the opportunity to make statements, answer questions, present evidence, and question witnesses. Members of the committee may ask questions at any point, seek additional materials or testimony, visit any relevant location, recall or review evidence or testimony provided earlier, and in general seek to obtain any information bearing on the accusation. The chair may request that a representative from the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students be present or on call during an adjudication to serve as a nonvoting resource. It is incumbent upon the Honor Committee members to investigate all possible connections between the student in question and all witnesses protecting the confidentiality of all parties involved. After testimony is concluded, the chair and the six other Committee members who conducted the hearing will deliberate in private. Deliberations will proceed as follows. The Committee will first deliberate on the question of whether to find the student in question responsible for the violation charged. At least six of the seven members must be overwhelmingly convinced that the student in question is responsible for the student in question to be found responsible. Documented evidence and plausibility of method, in the absence of demonstrated intent, may be enough to convict. Should the Committee find the student in question responsible, the appropriate penalty will be determined by a majority vote. After deliberations have concluded, the Committee will inform the student in question of the decision. If the student in question was found responsible, the chair will write a summary directed to the dean of undergraduate students. The penalty will take effect upon imposition by the dean of undergraduate students. A student will not be subjected to a second hearing for the same offense, except in light of new and important evidence, as determined by a majority vote of the committee. The testimony of one individual, without more, will not warrant another hearing. Article IV. Penalties A. Penalties Students found responsible for violating the Honor Code will receive penalties in accordance with Rights, Rules, Responsibilities as follows: Typically, Undergraduate students are subject to the following penalties for a first violation of the Honor Code: disciplinary probation, suspension for one semester, and suspension for one, two or three years. These guidelines are subject to the following exceptions: Where a student is found responsible for writing overtime on an examination or otherwise gaining a time advantage, the Committee will normally recommend that the student be issued a reprimand and recommend that the student receive a zero for the examination. However, in especially egregious cases of writing overtime, the Committee may exercise the option to increase the penalty. Where there are extenuating circumstances, the first offense may result in a reduced penalty. Extenuating circumstances may include, but are not limited to, situations where there was a substantial, material error on the part of an agent of the University, and situations where the Committee fails to conclude that a student should reasonably have understood that their actions were in violation of the Honor Code. A reprimand may be taken into account in judging the seriousness of any future violation. If dishonesty occurs, the Committee may exercise the option to increase the penalty. Normally, a second violation of the Honor Code, or a violation of the Honor Code following a suspension for a violation of the University’s academic integrity regulations, will result in expulsion from the University. Students whose first Honor Code or academic integrity violation resulted in a penalty of probation may face either suspension or expulsion should they be found responsible for a second violation of the Honor Code. In cases adjudicated prior to the last day of classes, if the final decision is a separation from the University (e.g., suspension or expulsion), the student will normally not earn credit for the semester in which the infraction occurred. If the case is adjudicated during reading or exam period or if the student has essentially completed course requirements while awaiting the final disposition of the matter, obtaining credit for the semester will be at the discretion of the committee. In such cases, the Honor Committee will normally recommend that the student receive a failing grade in the course in which the violation occurred. B. Appeals A student found responsible for a violation may appeal the Honor Committee’s decision as follows: Only the dean of the college may review the final penalty recommended by the Honor Committee. Appeals can only be made on the grounds of procedural unfairness or harmful bias. An appeal of the decision of the Honor Committee must be directed to the dean of the college in writing within one week of the committee's decision. A student interested in appealing should first contact the associate secretary of the University to discuss the appeal process. If the dean of the college determines that a penalty of the Honor Committee should be reduced, the dean will make a recommendation to the President, describing the reasons for the proposed modification, and the president will decide whether or not to implement the recommendation. The penalty recommended by the Honor Committee may not be increased upon appeal. In the case of a successful appeal, the Honor Committee will destroy all records of the case that personally identify the student in question or any other student. C. Enrollment Status If the student in question is found responsible, and if the appeal does not alter the Committee’s decision, the penalty will normally be considered effective as of the date of the original decision. If a senior is found responsible for a violation during the spring reading or exam period, or if the senior has essentially completed all spring course requirements, the senior’s degree may be withheld in lieu of suspension. In such cases, the Honor Committee will normally recommend that the student receive a failing grade in the course in which the violation occurred. Under normal circumstances, when a violation requiring suspension occurs during the fall term, the student in question will not be eligible to return until the following fall term. When a violation requiring suspension occurs during the spring term, the student in question will not be eligible to return until the following spring term. Pending a hearing or the student's decision about whether to appeal a separation from the University or the withholding of the degree, and/or while an appeal is in process, an administrative hold will be placed on the student's University transcript. Should the student decide not to appeal a separation or the withholding of the degree, or should an appeal not result in an alteration of the committee's decision to dismiss the student or withhold their degree, the registrar will record the fact of the penalty on the student's transcript. Article V. Publications A. Constitution Publication The Constitution will be published by the first week of each academic year. It will also be printed in Rights, Rules, Responsibilities, copies of which are issued to all students upon matriculation at the University. In addition, Article II will be circulated immediately before midterm and final examinations. B. Publication of Committee Statistics Every year, the Committee will publish aggregated, anonymous statistics for the last five years, indicating the number of students reported to the Committee, the types of violations that are reported, the number of cases that go to hearing, the respective outcomes of those cases, the number of appeals made, and the respective outcomes of those appeals. Article VI. Amending the Constitution A. The Constitution may be amended in the following ways: Upon the initiative of thirteen of the fifteen members of the committee, followed by a three-fourths vote of the Undergraduate Student Government members present at a meeting of the Undergraduate Student Government; or Upon the initiative by petition of 200 members of the undergraduate body, followed by a three-fourths vote in a student referendum as conducted by the Elections Committee of the Undergraduate Student Government. Article VI can be amended only by such a student referendum. 2.4 Academic Regulations 2.4.1 Introduction A student is in good standing if the student is making normal progress toward a degree and has a satisfactory record in scholarship and conduct. Scholastic regulations for undergraduates pertaining to choice of studies, completion of course requirements, and academic standing are published online in the Undergraduate Announcement (ua.princeton.edu), and graduate students regulations also are online. 2.4.2 Jurisdiction over Undergraduates for Violations of Academic Rules and Regulations Jurisdiction over violations of academic rules and regulations rests with two distinct committees at Princeton. All in-class undergraduate written examinations and tests are conducted under the honor system. All violations of the honor system are the concern of the Undergraduate Honor Committee. Violations of rules and regulations pertaining to all other academic work, including essays, term papers, laboratory reports, and take-home examinations fall under the jurisdiction of the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline. Should there be any uncertainty regarding which body is responsible for the adjudication of a particular case, clarification should be requested from the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students or the chair of the Honor Committee. 2.4.3 Student Acknowledgment of Original Work At the end of an essay, laboratory report, or any other requirement, undergraduates must write the following sentence and sign their name: "This paper represents my own work in accordance with University regulations." 2.4.4 Transcription or Publication of Course-Related Materials Students may not engage in the publication, sale, or distribution—online or by any other means—of syllabi, assignments, examinations, abstracts, or notes or transcriptions of the lectures and other course-related materials or required reading in any course of instruction in the University. This regulation is not intended to preclude situations in which students may act as assistants to instructors who are themselves preparing lectures or other course-related materials, either for informal distribution (without sale) to members of a particular course or department, or for formal publication and sale by a publisher. 2.4.5 Tutoring and Online Solutions An undergraduate is subject to disciplinary action if that student makes use of any paid or unpaid tutor, tutoring service or facility other than that regularly authorized by the Office of the Dean of the College. Also, no undergraduate may accept compensation for tutoring in Princeton courses except as authorized by the Office of the Dean of the College. Graduate students should consult the Office of the Dean of the Graduate School. The use of solutions to specific questions or problems on any websites or online services (regardless of whether they require a paid subscription) when completing any work submitted to fulfill an academic requirement (such as homework assignments, problem sets, quizzes, tests, or examinations of any kind) is prohibited. Any student violating this provision is subject to disciplinary action. 2.4.6 General Requirements for the Acknowledgment of Sources in Academic Work The academic departments of the University have varying requirements for the acknowledgment of sources, but certain fundamental principles apply to all levels of work. In order to prevent any misunderstanding, students are expected to study and comply with the following basic requirements. If you have any questions about when and how to cite your sources, ask the course instructor. An important general rule is this: if you are unsure whether or not to acknowledge a source, always err on the side of caution and completeness by citing rather than not citing. Quotations Any quotations, however small, must be placed in quotation marks or clearly indented beyond the regular margin. Any quotation must be accompanied (either within the text or in a footnote) by a precise indication of the source—identifying the author, title, place and date of publication (where relevant), and page numbers. Any sentence or phrase which is not the original work of the student must be acknowledged. Paraphrasing Any material which is paraphrased or summarized must also be specifically acknowledged in a footnote or in the text. A thorough rewording or rearrangement of an author's text does not relieve one of this responsibility. Occasionally, students maintain that they have read a source long before they wrote their papers and have unwittingly duplicated some of its phrases or ideas. This is not a valid excuse. The student is responsible for taking adequate notes so that debts of phrasing may be acknowledged where they are due. Ideas and Facts Any ideas or facts which are borrowed should be specifically acknowledged in a footnote or in the text, even if the idea or fact has been further elaborated by the student. Some ideas, facts, formulas, and other kinds of information which are widely known and considered to be in the "public domain" of common knowledge do not always require citation. The criteria for common knowledge vary among disciplines; students in doubt should consult a member of the faculty. Occasionally, a student in preparing an essay has consulted an essay or body of notes on a similar subject by another student. If the student has done so, the student must state that fact and indicate clearly the nature and extent of their indebtedness to the other source. The name and class of the author of an essay or notes which are consulted should be given, and the student should be prepared to show the work consulted to the instructor, if requested to do so. Footnotes and Bibliography All the sources that have been consulted in the preparation of an essay or report should be listed in a bibliography, unless specific guidelines (from the academic department or instructor) request that only works cited be so included. However, the mere listing of a source in a bibliography shall not be considered a "proper acknowledgment" for specific use of that source within the essay or report; a footnote or endnote must also appear after the information or quotation from that source. Neither shall the use of a footnote at the end of a sentence or paragraph in which only minor word changes have been made from the original source be considered "proper acknowledgment." The extent of indebtedness to the author must be made clear. Nonprint and Electronic Sources The requirement to acknowledge sources is not limited to printed material such as books or journal articles. You may need to acknowledge information that you’ve found in graphical form, sources that are works of visual or musical art, handwritten notes from a lecture or a laboratory, or even personal conversations. You should find out the disciplinary protocols for citing such nonprint sources by consulting a citation style manual, such as the MLA Handbook or The Chicago Manual of Style. Electronic information through the internet, email, e-media, and e-publication has had a significant impact on the way we conduct research. An electronic source is any source that exists primarily in electronic form and is accessed primarily through electronic means. Websites, electronic periodicals, electronic books, emails and social media postings, and even streaming audio are all forms of electronic sources. Information and quotations from any electronic sources must be properly acknowledged. The protocols for citing electronic sources are well-established and you should consult a citation style manual for particular examples. At a minimum, cite the name and author of the electronic source, publisher information, the DOI (director object identifier) or the URL if the DOI is not available, and the date you accessed the material. Laboratory Work, Problem Sets, Computer Programs, and Homework The organization of laboratory and computational courses varies throughout the University. In many courses, students work in pairs or in larger groups. In those cases where individual reports are submitted based on work involving collaboration, proper acknowledgment of the extent of the collaboration must appear in the report. In those cases where there are two or more signatories to a submitted report, each student's signature is taken to mean that the student has contributed fairly to the work involved and understands and endorses the content of the report. If for any reason, a set of observations or calculations has been invalidated or left incomplete, permission must be granted by the instructor to obtain the data from other sources and those sources must be specifically acknowledged in the report. Make sure you understand the rules of collaboration in any course by asking the instructor. Multiple Submission Under certain conditions, the student may be permitted to rewrite an earlier work or to satisfy two academic requirements by producing a single piece of work more extensive than that which would satisfy either requirement on its own. In such cases however, the student must secure in writing, prior permission of each instructor. In cases where a previously submitted work, or a portion of it, is submitted in its original or revised form to another instructor, the student must also submit the original work with the revised version. If a single extended work has been written for more than one course, that fact must be clearly indicated at the beginning of the essay. Oral Reports Students required to submit written notes for oral reports must clearly acknowledge any work that is not original, in accordance with the requirements stated above. Standard Forms of Reference For standard forms of quotations, footnotes, and bibliographies, the student may consult one of the following: The MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers (Modern Language Association of America, 4th edition, l995); A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations (Kate L. Turabian, John Grossman, and Alice Bennett, 6th revised edition, 1996) or a style sheet provided by a department of the University. 2.4.7 Definitions of Academic Violations under the Jurisdiction of the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline and the Subcommittee on Student Life and Discipline of the Faculty Committee on the Graduate School With regard to essays, laboratory reports, take-home examinations, or any other work submitted to fulfill an official academic requirement (including work submitted in draft form for an instructor’s review, where the instructor would reasonably assume adequate citations and/or true data), the following are considered academic infractions: Plagiarism The use of any outside source without proper acknowledgment. "Outside source" means any work, published or unpublished, by any person other than the student (see section 2.4.6 and section 2.4.9). Unauthorized Multiple Submission The failure to obtain prior written permission of the relevant instructors to submit any work that has been submitted in identical or similar form in fulfillment of any other academic requirement at any institution. False Citation The attribution to, or citation of, a source from which the material in question was not, in fact, obtained. False Data The submission of data or information that has been deliberately altered or contrived by the student or with the student's knowledge. Attempt to Gain an Unfair Advantage The attempt to gain unauthorized advantage over fellow students in any work in fulfillment of an academic requirement. This may include but is not limited to a failure to follow the instructor’s policies or instructions for an assignment or exam in such a way that provides an advantage to the student or the misrepresentation—explicit or implicit—of information regarding the preparation, presentation, or submission of work in fulfillment of an academic requirement, where such misrepresentation is made to an instructor in an attempt to gain an unfair advantage, including the submission for re-grading of any academic work under the jurisdiction of the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline. Violation of Examination Procedures During the course of an examination, the failure to follow examination procedures as set forth by the faculty member(s) who oversee that examination. For in-class examination violations by undergraduate students, see section 2.3 The Undergraduate Honor System.] Graduate students see also section 2.6.7 (research integrity.) Aiding Plagiarism or Any Other Academic Violation Any aid knowingly given to another in committing any of the infractions described above, or aid given contrary to instructions provided by the course instructor, will also be considered a violation. 2.4.8 Violations Jurisdiction Violations of these regulations are under the jurisdiction of the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline or the Office of the Dean of the Graduate School. Student's Defense The only adequate defense for a student accused of an academic violation is that the work in question does not, in fact, constitute a violation. Neither the defense that the student was ignorant of the regulations concerning academic violations nor the defense that the student was under pressure at the time the violation was committed is considered an adequate defense or a mitigating factor. Students who require assistance fulfilling their academic obligations are expected to seek such assistance on a prospective basis. Students with disabilities should inquire about available academic accommodations at the Office of Disability Services. All students are encouraged to avail themselves of the resources at the McGraw Center for Teaching and Learning, the Writing Center, and the residential colleges. When students come under time pressure, they are encouraged to discuss the possibility of an extension with their instructors and/or residential college dean or director of studies. A known disability for which the student did not seek accommodations prospectively will not be considered an adequate defense against an academic integrity charge or a mitigating factor. Seriousness of the Offense Academic infractions are always considered a serious matter, but will be considered especially serious if: The student has submitted a paper prepared by another person or agency. The student has a record of a previous finding of responsibility for another serious violation. The infraction includes the theft of another student's work—even if the paper or assignment is returned after use, or consulted without being removed from the other student's room or from a public or private room or from an electronic online location such as a website where work has been placed. Penalties In determining the seriousness of the offense, the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline will consider whether the student ought reasonably to have understood that the actions were in violation of University regulations. If the committee concludes that this threshold has been met, the penalty will normally be suspension or suspension with conditions from the University. Egregious academic integrity violations on the senior thesis may be grounds for expulsion. Students who have previously been suspended for an academic integrity violation should expect to be expelled for a second such violation where the committee concludes that the student ought reasonably to have understood that their actions were a violation. While the failure to fulfill the general requirements for acknowledgment of sources in academic work may not be determined to reach this level of seriousness, any such failure will be considered an academic infraction and will normally result in a disciplinary penalty. For further discussion of undergraduate academic violations, please consult the chapter on the honor system in this booklet. 2.4.9 Examples of Plagiarism The following examples provide a range of plagiarism from verbatim copying to thorough paraphrasing. The examples and comments offer clear guidance about how a source may be used and when a source must be cited. Original Source From: Alvin Kernan, The Playwright as Magician. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1979, pp.102–103. From time to time this submerged or latent theater in Hamlet becomes almost overt. It is close to the surface in Hamlet's pretense of madness, the "antic disposition" he puts on to protect himself and prevent his antagonists from plucking out the heart of his mystery. It is even closer to the surface when Hamlet enters his mother's room and holds up, side by side, the pictures of the two kings, Old Hamlet and Claudius, and proceeds to describe for her the true nature of the choice she has made, presenting truth by means of a show. Similarly, when he leaps into the open grave at Ophelia's funeral, ranting in high heroic terms, he is acting out for Laertes, and perhaps for himself as well, the folly of excessive, melodramatic expressions of grief. 1. Example of Verbatim Plagiarism, or Unacknowledged Direct Quotation (lifted passages are bold): Almost all of Shakespeare's Hamlet can be understood as a play about acting and the theatre. For example, there is Hamlet's pretense of madness, the "antic disposition" that he puts on to protect himself and prevent his antagonists from plucking out the heart of his mystery. When Hamlet enters his mother's room, he holds up, side by side, the pictures of the two kings, Old Hamlet and Claudius, and proceeds to describe for her the true nature of the choice she has made, presenting truth by means of a show. Similarly, when he leaps into the open grave at Ophelia's funeral, ranting in high heroic terms, he is acting out for Laertes, and perhaps for himself as well, the folly of excessive, melodramatic expressions of grief. Comment: Aside from an opening sentence loosely adapted from the original and reworded more simply, this entire passage is taken almost word-for-word from the source. The few small alterations of the source do not relieve the writer of the responsibility to attribute these words to their original author. A passage from a source may be worth quoting at length if it makes a point precisely or elegantly. In such cases, copy the passage exactly, place it in quotation marks, and cite the author. 2. Example of Lifting Selected Passages and Phrases Without Proper Acknowledgement (lifted passages are bold): Almost all of Shakespeare's Hamlet can be understood as a play about acting and the theatre. For example, in Act 1, Hamlet adopts a pretense of madness that he uses to protect himself and prevent his antagonists from discovering his mission to revenge his father's murder. He also presents truth by means of a show when he compares the portraits of Gertrude's two husbands in order to describe for her the true nature of the choice she has made. And when he leaps in Ophelia's open grave ranting in high heroic terms, Hamlet is acting out the folly of excessive, melodramatic expressions of grief. Comment: This passage, in content and structure, is taken wholesale from the source. Although the writer has rewritten much of the paragraph, and fewer phrases are lifted verbatim from the source, this is a clear example of plagiarism. Inserting even short phrases from the source into a new sentence still requires placing quotations around the borrowed words and citing the author. If even one phrase is good enough to borrow, it must be properly set off by quotation marks. In the case above, if the writer had rewritten the entire paragraph and only used Alvin Kernan's phrase "high heroic terms" without properly quoting and acknowledging its source, the writer would have plagiarized. 3. Example of Paraphrasing the Text While Maintaining the Basic Paragraph and Sentence Structure: Almost all of Shakespeare's Hamlet can be understood as a play about acting and the theatre. For example, in Act 1, Hamlet pretends to be insane in order to make sure his enemies do not discover his mission to revenge his father's murder. The theme is even more obvious when Hamlet compares the pictures of his mother's two husbands to show her what a bad choice she has made, using their images to reveal the truth. Also, when he jumps into Ophelia's grave, hurling his challenge to Laertes, Hamlet demonstrates the foolishness of exaggerated expressions of emotion. Comment: Almost nothing of Alvin Kernan's original language remains in this rewritten paragraph. However the key idea, the choice and order of the examples, and even the basic structure of the original sentences are all taken from the source. Although it would no longer be necessary to use quotation marks, it would absolutely be necessary to place a citation at the end of this paragraph to acknowledge that the content is not original. Better still would be to acknowledge the author in the text by adding a second sentence such as—"Alvin Kernan provides several examples from the play where these themes become more obvious"—and then citing the source at the end of the paragraph. In the case where the writer did not try to paraphrase the source's sentences quite so closely, but borrowed the main idea and examples from Kernan's book, an acknowledgment would still be necessary. Collaboration In many courses—particularly, but not exclusively, in the sciences or engineering—instructors may permit or even encourage students to collaborate on problem sets, programming assignments, laboratory reports, or other academic projects. The standard for permissible collaboration varies from course to course, even within a particular department. Some instructors permit pairs or groups to turn in a single piece of work on behalf of all students in that group; other instructors allow students to discuss assignments but require them to write up their own unique answers; still others prohibit any collaboration at all. It is the student's responsibility to understand where the line is between permissible collaboration and independent work. To avoid confusion and possible violations of academic regulations, students must be clear about exactly what may be done collaboratively, and what must be done independently. If the expectations and rules are unstated or unclear, the student must ask the instructor for clarification. If a deadline is imminent and the course policy is unclear, the student must err on the side of working independently. Regardless, collaborating with another student without indicating the extent of collaboration is considered plagiarism. Even in courses where collaboration is permitted, the ideas, words, or other intellectual contribution of students with whom one is collaborating are considered an "outside source" which must be clearly acknowledged. 2.5 University Discipline 2.5.1 Jurisdiction The Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline, comprising students, faculty members, and administrators, is responsible for the administration of the stated rules and regulations governing undergraduate student conduct, for assessing reported violations, and, when necessary, for assigning appropriate penalties. Cases Involving Undergraduates All alleged academic violations involving undergraduates that do not implicate the honor system (section 2.3) fall under the jurisdiction of the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline. The Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline also adjudicates any other potentially serious alleged infraction (except allegations of sex discrimination or sexual misconduct; see section 1.3) involving undergraduate students for which the penalty might interrupt the student's academic career. The committee also considers cases for which no clear precedent exists. Where an undergraduate student is alleged to have committed a behavioral infraction for which precedents are available and for which the penalty will not interrupt the student's academic career, the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline delegates jurisdiction to the Residential College Disciplinary Board. (See section 2.5.3 regarding the resolution of infractions that do not result in separation.) Cases Involving Graduate Students Alleged violations of academic and nonacademic rules and regulations (except allegations of sex discrimination or sexual misconduct; see section 1.3) involving graduate students are discussed in section 2.6.7. Cases Involving Both Undergraduates and Graduate Students In the event that one or more undergraduate students and one or more graduate students are alleged to have violated University policy, where the facts and circumstances of the case are inextricably intertwined, special procedures apply. See section 2.5.7. Sexual Misconduct The Title IX coordinator, in consultation with appropriate University officials, may direct a Title IX Panel to investigate and adjudicate charges normally handled by the Faculty Student Committee on Discipline or by other judicial authorities described in section 2.5.3 and section 2.6.7, when those charges are raised in connection with an investigation under the policies on Title IX Sexual Harassment and University Sexual Misconduct (section 1.3). 2.5.2 The Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline Membership The committee consists of the following voting members: six members of the faculty (no more than four of whom may be present during any hearing); a dean from the Office of the Dean of the College; and eight undergraduate students (no more than five of whom may be present during any hearing). The dean of undergraduate students serves as chair and votes only in the event of a tie as set forth below, and an associate or assistant dean of undergraduate students serves as secretary without vote. A quorum consists of at least three student members and at least two faculty members. The representative from the Office of the Dean of the College shall have the duties and powers of the dean of undergraduate students in the dean's absence. Investigation of Alleged Infractions An assistant or associate dean or University investigator will normally investigate alleged infractions under the jurisdiction of the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline. Other representatives of the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students (including investigators retained for this purpose) may assist in the investigation of such matters. Following the investigation, the student may obtain from the committee's secretary all documents pertaining to reports of the alleged misconduct and the names of the members of the committee. The student has the option of submitting any additional written materials that may assist the committee in reaching a decision. Complaints of discrimination or harassment, except for complaints of sex discrimination or sexual misconduct, where the alleged behaviors are those of a student are normally investigated and resolved through the student disciplinary process, administered by the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students as described in this section. (Information relating to the University's Non-Discrimination/Anti-Harassment Policy and Complaint Procedures, including available resources and how to file a complaint under the policy, can be found at https://inclusive.princeton.edu/addressing-concerns/bias-discrimination-harassment). A report or a written complaint against a student should be filed with the associate or assistant dean responsible for disciplinary matters in the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students. All disciplinary cases involving allegations of sexual misconduct, including complaints of discrimination or harassment based on sex or gender, are investigated and adjudicated in accordance with the procedures outlined in section 1.3. Notice and Convening of Hearings Matters shall be presented to the committee with all reasonable promptness. In all cases referred to the Committee on Discipline, the student involved will be informed in writing of the charge(s) and of the specific day and time when the student is to appear before the committee. Where a matter is first presented to the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students within one week of the end of an academic term, it may be held for consideration until the following term. In certain circumstances, an undergraduate student whose case falls under the jurisdiction of the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline may request that the dean of undergraduate students adjudicate the matter, waiving the right to a hearing by the committee. If the dean agrees to hear the case, the student retains the right to appeal the decision except on procedural grounds. There are no procedural appeals in such cases. Enrollment and Residence Status Normally, pending action on the charges by the committee or pending an appeal, the student will be permitted to remain in residence on campus, attend classes, and make use of some or all University facilities, except for circumstances relating to the physical or emotional safety or well-being of a member (or members) of the University community, or the ability of the University to carry out its essential functions. The student should understand that if the committee's decision proves adverse, or if an appeal proves unsuccessful, the decision of the committee will normally be considered effective as of the date of the original decision. In cases adjudicated prior to the last day of classes, if the final decision is a separation from the University (i.e., suspension, suspension with conditions, or expulsion), the student will normally not earn credit for the semester in which the infraction occurred. If the case is adjudicated during reading period obtaining credit for the semester will be at the discretion of the committee. If the case is adjudicated during exam period and the final decision is a separation from the University the student must complete the term and the committee’s penalty will take effect immediately thereafter. Pending a hearing or the student's decision about whether to appeal a separation from the University or the withholding of the degree, and/or while an appeal is in process, an administrative hold will be placed on the student's University transcript. Should the student decide not to appeal a separation or the withholding of the degree, or should an appeal not result in an alteration of the committee's decision to dismiss the student or withhold the degree, the registrar will record the fact of the penalty on the student's transcript. Conduct of Hearings The student may be accompanied at the committee hearing by an adviser, who must be a current member of the resident University community, and who may participate in the hearing in accordance with instructions issued by the chair. At the hearing, any person with information about the matter before the committee may be requested to appear by the student, the dean of undergraduate students, or the committee, subject to reasonable limits agreed on by the committee. In an opening statement the student has an opportunity to explain the circumstances from a personal point of view and may also question individuals who have provided information and may in turn be questioned by the committee members. The student may make a closing statement and is then excused while the committee deliberates in closed session. There may be some occasions in which, because of external legal proceedings, the student believes that there are compelling reasons for refusing to speak or to answer questions. In the event that (1) legal proceedings—including but not limited to arrest, summons, and indictment—have been instituted or are anticipated against a student in state or federal courts as a result of alleged involvement in the matters that the committee is considering and (2) the alleged misconduct is more serious than a disorderly person offense, the student will be granted permission not to speak or to answer questions without prejudicing the committee's decision. In the case of other external proceedings, the dean will consider the student's reasons for declining to speak, and if these reasons are deemed legitimate, will excuse the student from giving information without prejudice to the disposition of the case. In instances as set forth above, when a student has chosen not to speak and when in the dean's judgment the committee does not have enough information to come to a conclusion without the student's testimony, at the dean's discretion the hearing may be postponed until more complete information is available. In such instances, when the dean believes that circumstances are present that seriously affect the health or well-being of any person, or where physical safety is seriously threatened, or where the ability of the University to carry out its essential operations is seriously threatened or impaired, the dean normally will bar the student from campus, pending disposition of the legal proceedings and recommencement of the hearing. This decision will be subject to review in accordance with section 1.1.8, and without prejudice to the committee's eventual consideration of the charges. If a hearing proceeds before external legal matters are resolved, the chair of the committee must explain to the student the risks either of speaking freely or of not speaking at all. Under no circumstances will a student whose disciplinary matter is pending be permitted to receive a degree. Deliberations and Findings In order to determine that a student has violated a University rule, a majority of the voting committee members present must conclude that the evidence presented constitutes a clear and persuasive case in support of the charges against the student. If the student is found responsible for one or more of the violations charged, the committee will consult applicable rules and precedents to determine the proper penalty. If the student is found to have misled the committee during the hearing, the committee may take that fact into account in reaching a conclusion and assigning a penalty. If the voting members are evenly divided on a particular case, the case must be reconsidered at the next meeting of the committee. If at the second meeting at which the case is considered the regular voting members are still evenly divided, the dean of undergraduate students votes to break the tie. The chair or the secretary of the committee informs the student promptly of the decision. If a penalty is imposed, special effort is made in this discussion to ensure that the student fully understands why the penalty was imposed and its nature and consequences. The student has the right to receive a summary report of the proceedings upon request. Appeals in Behavioral Cases If a student is found by the Committee on Discipline to have violated University policy, the student found responsible (sometimes referred to as the "respondent") has the right to appeal the decision. The appellate body has the following five members: the dean of the college, the dean of the Graduate School, the vice president for campus life, the chair of the Judicial Committee of the Council of the Princeton University Community, and another faculty member appointed by the president. The members will be impartial and unbiased. One member will be appointed by the president to serve as its chair. Each appeal will be heard by three members of the appellate body (i.e., appeal panel). The chair will assign the appeal panel for each case. All decisions shall be made by a majority of the appeal panel. Grounds for appeal are: The procedures have not been fair and reasonable. The period of time under review starts when a student is formally charged with a violation and ends when the committee issues a final decision. Neither the choice of venue nor the nature of the investigation is grounds for appeal. There exists substantial relevant information that was not presented, and reasonably could not have been presented to the committee. The imposed penalty does not fall within the range of penalties imposed for similar misconduct. The purpose of an appeal is not to initiate a review of substantive issues of fact or a new determination of whether a violation of University rules has occurred. The appeal panel may decide to uphold the original decision of the committee; to reduce the imposed penalty; or to return the case to the original hearing body for additional proceedings, a rehearing or other action. If a student requests a review of a penalty, it cannot be increased on appeal. The deadline for filing an appeal in a behavioral case is one week from the date of decision by the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline. Appeals in Academic Cases A student wishing to appeal a decision of the committee on Discipline in a case involving an academic infraction may appeal to the dean of the college, seeking a review of a decision or penalty on the grounds that (1) there exists substantial relevant information that was not presented, and reasonably could not have been presented, to the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline, or (2) the imposed penalty does not fall within the range of penalties imposed for similar misconduct. The purpose of such an appeal is not to initiate a review of substantive issues of fact, or a new determination of whether a violation of rules has occurred. If the dean concludes after such a review that additional proceedings or a rehearing is warranted, the original hearing body will normally perform these functions. Also, if the dean determines that a penalty of the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline (or the dean of undergraduate students) should be altered, the dean will make a recommendation to the president, describing the reasons for the proposed modification, and the president will decide whether or not to implement the recommendation. If a student requests a review of a penalty, it cannot be increased on appeal. A student has the right to appeal questions of procedural unfairness only to the Judicial Committee of the Council of the Princeton University Community, in accordance with the appeal procedures defined by the Judicial Committee (see section 1.9.4). The associate secretary of the University will serve as secretary for all appeals of decisions by the Committee on Discipline and will have primary responsibility for interactions with the parties and for the gathering of information needed for the appeal. The deadline for filing an appeal in an academic case is one week from the date the decision is communicated to the student by the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline. 2.5.3 Adjudication of Infractions That Do Not Result in Separation (Undergraduate) General Procedures Normally, if a student is alleged to have committed a behavioral infraction, other than sex discrimination or sexual misconduct, for which precedents are available and for which the penalty will not interrupt the student's academic career, the matter will be resolved by the Residential College Disciplinary Board (RCDB), comprising associate and assistant deans of undergraduate students responsible for discipline and the six directors of student life. General procedures are as follows: The student will first be asked to meet with the appropriate director of student life, dean, or a University investigator. All complaints will be investigated promptly. The student may read all statements, reports, or other information relevant to the allegation. The facts of the case will be discussed and the student given ample opportunity to present the student's own account of the incident in question, including a written account, witnesses, or other relevant information, or to request clarification of any relevant information submitted by other parties. The student will be notified of the specific violation the student is alleged to have committed before the case is considered by the RCDB. The director of student life will then bring the case, with a recommendation regarding the student's responsibility for the alleged infraction, to the RCDB. The RCDB will consider the case and determine the appropriate action, up to and including disciplinary probation (including housing and/or campus service sanctions or other restrictions on access to space, resources, or activities). Other representatives of the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students (including investigators retained for this purpose) may assist in the investigation and/or resolution of minor infractions under the jurisdiction of the RCDB. Appeals A student has the right to appeal to the dean of undergraduate students any disciplinary decision of the Residential College Disciplinary Board. The appeal should be submitted in writing. The purpose of the appeal is to seek a review of a decision or penalty on the grounds that (1) there exists substantial relevant information that was not presented, and reasonably could not have been presented, to the dean or the RCDB; (2) the imposed penalty does not fall within the range of penalties imposed for similar misconduct; or (3) a procedural irregularity occurred in the adjudication of the incident in question. The purpose of such an appeal is not to initiate a review of substantive issues of fact, or a new determination of whether a violation of rules has occurred. The deadline for filing such an appeal is one week from the date the student was informed in writing of the penalty. The decision of the dean of undergraduate students shall be final. 2.5.4 Records of Proceedings (Undergraduate) Confidential records of all disciplinary proceedings involving undergraduate students are maintained by the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students. The use of these documents is restricted according to the rules and procedures concerning the confidential nature of student records. Disciplinary procedures normally involve only the student and the University. Generally, the student's family is not informed while disciplinary procedures are underway. When, however, in the judgment of the University the welfare of the student or the community warrants communication, family members may be contacted during the disciplinary process. All disciplinary decisions resulting in serious penalties (especially, but not exclusively, withholding of degree, suspension, suspension with conditions, and expulsion) will be communicated to the student's family or other legal guardian, unless the student has before the commencement of the term in question filed a statement certifying that the student is not financially dependent as defined by the federal income tax laws. 2.5.5 Penalties Penalties that may be applied by all University disciplinary bodies are set forth under section 1.1 "University Principles of General Conduct and Regulations." 2.5.6 Grievance Procedures Students are also afforded certain protections under federal and state laws, and may elect to file a harassment or discrimination complaint with a federal or state agency authorized to investigate such complaints. The appropriate agency will depend on the nature of the complaint and the status of the parties involved. One such agency is the United States Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights. Information concerning grievance procedures is available under section 1.7. 2.5.7 Special Procedures in Cases Involving Both Undergraduate and Graduate Students In the event that one or more undergraduate students and one or more graduate students are alleged to have violated University policy, where the facts and circumstances of the case are inextricably intertwined, the following special procedures apply. In such situations, an ad hoc joint committee comprising representatives from the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline and the Subcommittee on Student Life and Discipline of the Faculty Committee on the Graduate School will adjudicate all alleged academic infractions that do not implicate the honor system (see section 2.3) and all other potentially serious alleged infractions (except allegations of sex discrimination or other sexual misconduct; see section 1.3) for which the penalty might interrupt any student’s academic career. The joint committee will be appointed by the deans of the undergraduate students and the Graduate School. The joint committee will be comprised of one faculty member and two undergraduate students from the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline and one faculty member and two graduate students selected in accordance with the procedures of the Subcommittee on Student Life and Discipline of the Faculty Committee on the Graduate School. The chair of the joint committee will be drawn from either the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline or the Subcommittee on Student Life and Discipline of the Faculty Committee on the Graduate School, and the secretary of the joint committee will be drawn from the other. The joint committee will conduct hearings and render decisions according to the procedures and standards of the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline (see section 2.5.2). Students whose cases fall under the jurisdiction of an ad hoc joint committee may request that the dean of the Graduate School and the dean of undergraduate students alone adjudicate the matter, waiving the right to a hearing by an ad hoc joint committee. All students who would fall under the jurisdiction of an ad hoc joint committee in such a case would need to agree to the request. If the deans agree to hear the case, the students retain the right to appeal the decision except on procedural grounds. There are no procedural appeals in such cases. Where one or more undergraduate students and one or more graduate students are alleged to have committed a behavioral infraction for which precedents are available and for which the penalty will not interrupt the students’ academic career, the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline and the Subcommittee on Student Life and Discipline of the Faculty Committee on the Graduate School delegate jurisdiction to an associate dean of the Graduate School and one of the chairs of the Residential College Disciplinary Board, who will jointly investigate and adjudicate the case, assisted by other deans, investigators and directors in the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Students and the Graduate School as necessary and appropriate. In investigating and adjudicating such cases, the associate dean of the Graduate School and the chair of the Residential College Disciplinary Board will follow the procedures and standards of the Residential College Disciplinary Board (see section 2.5.3). 2.6 The Graduate School All regulations in the Orange Pages apply to graduate students, with the exception of the sections that treat the "Honor Committee." 2.6.1 Jurisdiction over Graduate Students for Violations of Academic Rules and Regulations Jurisdiction over all violations of academic rules and regulations rests with the dean of the Graduate School. A more detailed explanation of the regulations and the procedures follows below. 2.6.2 The Graduate Student Government The Graduate Student Government (GSG) plays an important role in areas pertaining to graduate students. It is the main entity responsible for representing their concerns and considers questions relating to graduate student life; it seeks to enhance the quality of their lives, participates in the formulation of various University policies, and is the body that should be approached when graduate student opinion is required by the administration. Graduate students can get in touch with the GSG by email at gsg@princeton.edu. The GSG holds monthly meetings that are open to the public; graduate students interested in specific issues or in getting involved are encouraged to attend. Purpose The purposes of the Graduate Student Government are: To represent and advocate for the interests of graduate students at Princeton University; To provide a forum for free and open discussion of matters affecting this community; and To provide financial and organizational support for social events within this community. The full text of the constitution of the GSG can be found online at http://gsg.princeton.edu. Structure The GSG consists of an Assembly, an Executive Committee, and four standing committees (Academic Affairs, Facilities and Transportation, Health and Life, and Social). The Assembly of the GSG consists of representatives elected from each academic department or other recognized academic program (e.g., applied and computational mathematics), of delegates chosen by residential communities, or special interest groups and of councilors who represent the GSG to outside bodies (e.g., CPUC). The standing committees are composed of volunteers both from within Assembly and from the graduate student body more generally. The Executive Committee is composed of 11 members. Of these, seven officers, the president, the vice president, the vice president for internal affairs, the secretary, the treasurer, the communications director, and the social chair are elected annually by the graduate student body. The remaining Executive Committee officers are the chairs of the GSG's four standing committees and are elected annually by the GSG Assembly. Getting Involved Graduate students are encouraged to get involved at any level of the GSG starting with attendance at the monthly meetings of the Assembly. Election procedures for the representatives to the Assembly and for delegates are set within each group represented. Officers of the Executive Committee are elected annually per the constitution, typically around March. More information about running for office can be obtained through email at gsg@princeton.edu. The GSG Assembly elects the graduate U-Councilors of the Council of the Princeton University Community each year no later than April 30. The GSG has standing committees and can form task forces that work on specific issues. The GSG social chair organizes social events open to the entire graduate student population. 2.6.3 Dormitory Regulations Dormitory and apartment regulations for graduate students are established and administered by the Housing Office in conjunction with the Office of the Dean of the Graduate School. Students violating these regulations will be subject to University disciplinary action, which may include the imposition of fines by the Housing Office. These regulations can be found in the Orange Pages as well as the Graduate College/Annex Residential Living Policies Guide and Apartment Life Guide for Graduate Students on the Housing and Real Estate Services website (http://hres.princeton.edu/graduates). 2.6.4 Alcohol Policy Refer to section 2.2.9. Those who are of legal drinking age and who wish to sponsor campus events with alcohol must comply with the guidelines established by and obtainable from the Office of the Dean of the Graduate School. 2.6.5 Dining Regulations All individuals living in the Graduate College are required to sign a Campus Dining contract for one of the specified meal plans unless excused by the assistant/associate dean of the Graduate School.

A student who fails to meet all financial obligations may be subject to one or more of the following: (a) prohibited from course selection and/or course changes, (b) placed on leave of absence or withdrawn until all financial obligations are met, (c) prohibited from enrolling or being readmitted to the University, (d) prohibited from standing for the Final Public Oral examination (e) refused a transcript, (f) denied a diploma document at graduation, and (g) payment of all collection agency fees, attorney charges, and legal fees necessary for the collection of outstanding indebtedness. Additional financial information regarding tuition and terms of payment is available online at www.princeton.edu/studentaccounts. 2.6.7 The Graduate School Judicial System As members of the University community, graduate students are bound by the rules and procedures described in the sections "1. University-Wide Regulations" and "2. Students and the University." All dormitory regulations are applicable to graduate students who reside in the undergraduate residential colleges, and the Graduate College and Annexes. In all academic and research matters, graduate students are governed by the presumption that their work is held to the highest standards of scholarship and professional conduct. Such standards are set forth herewith in Rights, Rules, Responsibilities, as well as in orientations, handbooks, websites, course materials, and individual adviser-advisee interactions in laboratory, classroom, and other educational settings. Definitions of academic violations in work submitted in fulfillment of an official academic requirement may be found in section 2.4.7. For graduate students, scholarly and research activity that is subject to the University's standards may go beyond the work submitted in fulfillment of an official academic requirement for the degree. Academic and research integrity is an expectation that extends to all professional activities undertaken by graduate students on or off campus. Examples of scholarly activities related to graduate students' academic or research training and development may include teaching activities, relevant internships, and submitted or published work, especially but not only when such work cites their affiliation with the University. All forms of academic fraud, including plagiarism, multiple submission, false citation, and data falsification, are regarded as serious violations and will be subject to disciplinary action. Additionally, failure to abide by standards related to the responsible conduct of research when students ought reasonably to understand those standards will also be considered a serious violation and will be subject to disciplinary action. Allegations concerning academic or research integrity violations should not be handled informally or at the department level but must be brought as soon as possible, as a complaint either by a graduate student or against a graduate student, to the attention of the dean of the Graduate School. Academic and Nonacademic Disciplinary Procedures When the Office of the Dean of the Graduate School has been informed of an academic or nonacademic (behavioral) charge against a graduate student, the student is immediately notified by a deputy, associate, or assistant dean of an impending investigation. Alleged infractions of a less serious nature, other than Title IX sexual harassment and University sexual misconduct (which follow procedures outlined in section 1.3), for which precedents exist and for which separation from the University is not a possible outcome, are normally investigated and resolved by a deputy, associate, or assistant dean. A deputy, associate, or assistant dean for academic affairs will handle academic infractions and the associate or assistant dean for student life will handle nonacademic infractions. Other representatives of the Office of the Dean of the Graduate School may assist in the investigation of such matters. All complaints will be investigated promptly. The student may read all statements, reports, or other information relevant to the allegation. The deputy, associate, or assistant dean conducting the investigation will discuss the facts of the case with the student and the student will be given ample opportunity to present the student's own account of the incident in question, including a written account, witnesses, or other relevant information, or to request clarification of any relevant information submitted by other parties. The student will be provided a written statement concerning the charge and the procedures governing the investigation. The student will be given an opportunity to provide a written response to the charge before any finding of responsibility is made. For academic matters, the hearing dean will encourage the student to seek the advice of a resident faculty member or academic administrator. The hearing dean will determine appropriate action, up to and including disciplinary probation (including housing and/or campus service sanctions or other restrictions on access to space, resources, or activities). If the complaint is of a more serious nature, other than Title IX sexual harassment and University sexual misconduct (which follow procedures outlined in section 1.3), for which separation from the University is a possible outcome, a deputy, associate, or assistant dean will request all parties and witnesses to prepare written accounts of the event(s) in question. If appropriate, the matter will then be referred to the dean of the Graduate School who is advised, in accordance with the Rules and Procedures of the Faculty, by the Subcommittee on Student Life and Discipline of the Faculty Committee of the Graduate School. The subcommittee consists of the dean of the Graduate School, ex officio, as chair; a deputy, associate, or assistant dean as secretary (without vote; a deputy, associate, or assistant dean for academic affairs will serve for academic infractions, and the associate or assistant dean for student life will serve for nonacademic infractions); and four members of the Graduate School Faculty Committee, at least two of whom must be present at a hearing and at least one of whom must be appointed in the same division as the student's home department. The subcommittee may be enlarged, at the student's request, by up to four graduate students, selected by the Office of the Dean of the Graduate School at random. The subcommittee will: (a) conduct a fact-finding inquiry that may include written statements and interviews (the graduate student may submit to the subcommittee a list of witnesses that the student seeks to have testify); (b) conduct a closed hearing, which the charged student may attend, along with an adviser (who must be a current resident member of the University community), if the student chooses to invite one; and (c) make recommendations--including suggested penalties, if appropriate--to the dean of the Graduate School. While the length of the process will depend on a variety of factors, including the nature and scope of the allegations, the number of parties and witnesses, and the availability of parties and witnesses, an effort will be made to conclude the process within 45 working days of receipt of the complaint. In general, the procedures of the subcommittee are analogous to the "General Procedures" of the Judicial Committee of the CPUC (see section 1.9), with the exception that the subcommittee always holds closed hearings. Moreover, since cases vary widely, their disposition will inevitably depend upon the nature of the alleged infraction. For instance, since cases often involve students who are not currently, or are no longer, in residence, the student's presence at the proceedings is not an absolute requirement as long as the student has personally received adequate notification and been given reasonable opportunity to submit a written response to the charges. (In such cases, students who are unable to be present may, at their request, be represented by an adviser who is a current member of the resident University community, and who may participate in the same manner as the student in the hearing. The subcommittee does not deal with outside counsel.) The student always has the right to appear before the subcommittee with or without an adviser as defined above. In every case, the subcommittee proceeds with an appropriate regard for fair process, deliberate speed, and satisfactory records. The student may read all statements, reports, or other information relevant to the allegation. In order to find that a student has violated a University rule, the subcommittee must be persuaded that the charges against the student are supported by clear and persuasive evidence. Following its investigation and hearing, the subcommittee presents its advice in the form of a recommendation to the dean, who, observing fair process and deliberate speed, then determines what action to take. The student is notified by the dean in writing of the subcommittee's recommendation and the dean's action, and is also informed of the rights of appeal and the appropriate procedures. Confidential records for matters that result in a finding of responsibility are maintained by the Office of the Dean of the Graduate School. The use of these documents is restricted, according to the rules and procedures concerning the confidential nature of student records. The dean of the Graduate School may, in some instances, refer an academic case back to the academic department for resolution if the dean deems it appropriate or upon the advice of the deputy, associate, or assistant dean involved in the investigation, or the subcommittee, if the case falls under the jurisdiction of the subcommittee. In the event that one or more undergraduate students and one or more graduate students are alleged to have violated University policy jointly, where the facts and circumstances of the case are inextricably intertwined, special procedures apply, as detailed in section 2.5.7. A student whose case falls under the jurisdiction of the Subcommittee on Student Life and Discipline may request that the dean of the Graduate School alone adjudicate the matter, waiving the right to a hearing by the subcommittee. If the dean agrees to hear the case, the student retains the right to appeal the decision except on procedural grounds. There are no procedural appeals in such cases. Complaints of harassment or discrimination where the alleged behaviors are those of a graduate student are normally investigated and resolved through the student disciplinary process, administered by the Office of the Dean of the Graduate School and described in this section. (Information relating to the University's Nondiscrimination/Anti-Harassment Policy and Complaint Procedures, including available resources and how to file a complaint under the policy, can be found at https://inclusive.princeton.edu/addressing-concerns/bias-discrimination-harassment.) A report or written complaint of harassment or discrimination against a graduate student should be filed with the associate or assistant dean responsible for nonacademic (behavioral) disciplinary matters in the Office of the Dean of the Graduate School. The graduate student will be notified by the associate or assistant dean of the impending investigation and provided a written statement concerning the charge and the procedures governing the investigation. The student will be given an opportunity to provide a written response to the charge before any finding of responsibility is made. If the complaint is one for which separation from the University is not a possible outcome, the associate or assistant dean will investigate, issue findings, and take remedial action as necessary. If separation from the University is a possible outcome, the matter will be referred to the dean of the Graduate School who is advised, in accordance with the Rules and Procedures of the Faculty, by the Subcommittee on Student Life and Discipline of the Faculty Committee of the Graduate School. Disciplinary cases involving allegations of Title IX sexual harassment and University sexual misconduct by a graduate student are investigated and adjudicated in accordance with the procedures outlined in section 1.3. Under no circumstances will a student whose disciplinary matter is pending be permitted to stand for the Final Public Oral examination or receive a degree. In the case of unenrolled students whose degree candidacy continues, the procedures of this section are applicable in all academic cases and in the appropriate behavioral cases. Appeal on Academic and Nonacademic Disciplinary Matters The purpose of an appeal is to seek a review of a decision or penalty on the grounds that (1) there exists substantial relevant information that was not presented, and reasonably could not have been presented, in the original deliberations; (2) the imposed penalty does not fall within the range of penalties imposed for similar misconduct; or (3) a procedural irregularity occurred in the adjudication of the incident in question. The purpose of such an appeal is not to initiate a review of substantive issues of fact, or a new determination of whether a violation of rules has occurred. For infractions for which separation from the University is not a possible outcome, the student may appeal the decision of the deputy, associate, or assistant dean to the dean of the Graduate School. The deadline for filing such an appeal is one week from the date of written notification of the original decision. The student should understand that, in hearing the appeal, the dean of the Graduate School is not bound in any way by the prior decision of the hearing dean and that, after reviewing the facts, the dean of the Graduate School may impose a greater or lesser penalty than that originally imposed by the hearing dean. The appeal should be submitted in writing. The decision of the dean of the Graduate School shall be final. For infractions for which separation from the University is a possible outcome, a student wishing to appeal decisions of the dean of the Graduate School should notify the dean of the faculty in writing to that effect, specifying the grounds of the appeal, not later than one week (during which the University is in session) after receipt of the written notice of the decision which the student wishes to appeal. The dean of the faculty shall transmit the student's written statement and any other relevant material directly to the Faculty Advisory Committee on Policy and report the transmittal to the faculty at its next meeting. The Faculty Advisory Committee on Policy shall determine whether or not the grounds of appeal are sufficient to warrant a hearing. If it decides that a hearing is warranted, the committee may appoint a special panel to consider the individual case and make a report with recommendations to the Faculty Advisory Committee on Policy, or it may itself hear the appeal. In all cases, the decision of the Faculty Advisory Committee on Policy shall be final. Penalties The range of possible penalties available to the dean of the Graduate School includes the seven penalties specified in section 1.1.7. It may also include revocation of the degree in cases involving students who have already left the University. Should the recommended penalty interrupt the student's academic career, the dean of the Graduate School will consult with the student's department before reaching a final decision in all academic disciplinary matters. Minor offenses adjudicated by a deputy, associate, or assistant dean may result in a warning, disciplinary probation, or disciplinary probation with censure. Campus service, University housing restrictions, or restrictions on access to space, resources, or activities may be added to any penalty. Enrollment and Resident Status Normally, pending action on the charges by the dean of the Graduate School, or pending an appeal, the student will be permitted to remain in residence on campus, attend classes, and make use of all University facilities, except when the dean believes that circumstances are present that seriously affect the health or well-being of any person, or where physical safety is seriously threatened, or where the ability of the University to carry out its essential operations is seriously threatened or impaired. In such circumstances, the dean normally will bar the student from campus. This decision will be subject to review in accordance with section 1.1.8, and without prejudice to the eventual adjudication of the charges. If the decision of the dean proves adverse, or if an appeal proves unsuccessful, the decision of the dean will normally be considered effective as of the date of the original decision. Tuition and fees continue to accrue while an appeal is pending. Pending a hearing or the student's decision about whether to appeal a separation from the University or the withholding of the degree, and/or while an appeal is in process, an administrative hold will be placed on the student's University transcript. Should the student decide not to appeal a separation or the withholding of the degree, or should an appeal not result in an alteration of the committee's decision to dismiss the student or withhold the degree, the registrar will record the fact of the penalty on the student's transcript. Graduate Student Grievances The Office of the Dean of the Graduate School normally handles in the first instance all grievances of graduate students. The deputy, associate, or assistant dean of the Graduate School advises graduate students as to where their grievances may be addressed, e.g., against an undergraduate, to the dean of undergraduate students; against a faculty member, to the dean of faculty; or against a staff member, to the Office of Human Resources. A graduate student with a grievance concerning academic standing (e.g., early termination from the program but excluding academic disciplinary matters, as defined above) should first attempt to resolve the grievance at the departmental level through discussions with the faculty member(s) concerned and/or the department chair and director of graduate studies. This procedure applies also to graduate students serving as assistants in instruction or assistants in research. If the student feels that a satisfactory resolution has not been found, the student should consult the deputy, associate, or assistant dean of the Graduate School for academic affairs for further review. If a satisfactory resolution cannot be found through this review, the student may request a final review by the dean of the Graduate School. If the dean determines that the grievance raises issues of faculty misconduct, the dean will refer those portions of it to the dean of the faculty, who may choose to appoint a special committee of faculty to advise with regard to those issues. If no issues of faculty misconduct are involved, the dean of the Graduate School will render a decision as expeditiously as possible on all aspects of the complaint. When considering the grievance, the dean of the Graduate School may proceed in consultation with, or upon the advice of, the appropriate subcommittee of the Faculty Committee on the Graduate School (the Subcommittee on Policy or the Subcommittee on Student Life and Discipline). Students are also afforded certain protections under federal and state laws, and may elect to file a harassment or discrimination complaint with a federal or state agency authorized to investigate such claims. The appropriate agency will depend on the nature of the complaint and the status of the parties involved. One such agency is the United States Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights. Information concerning grievance procedures is available under section 1.7. 2.7 Student Privacy Rights under Federal Law The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) commonly known as the "Buckley Amendment" affords students certain rights with respect to their education records. They are: (A) The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days of the day the University receives a written request for access. "Education records" is a defined term in the federal regulations implementing FERPA. Among the documents it does not include are: Personal files of members of the faculty and administration; Treatment records; Security files not available for review by individuals other than security officers and other local law enforcement officials; Employment records that relate exclusively to the individual's capacity as an employee; Records containing only information concerning a person's activities after graduation or withdrawal from the University; Material relating to the financial status of parents which is contained in any record maintained by the University; Confidential letters of recommendation placed in a student's education record prior to January 1975; and Confidential letters of recommendation to which a student has waived right of access. Student education records are located primarily in the offices of the dean of the college, the dean of undergraduate students, the dean of the Graduate School, student accounts, the registrar, and the various academic departments. A student may request access to personal education records by filing a written request with the person who is responsible for maintaining the record which the student wants to review. The request must identify the particular record(s) which the student wishes to inspect. The University official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the University official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed. (B) The right to request the amendment of the student's education records that the student believes are inaccurate or misleading. Students may ask the University to amend a record that they believe is inaccurate or misleading. They should write the University official responsible for the record, clearly identifying the part of the record they want changed and specifying why it is inaccurate or misleading. If the University decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the University will notify the student of the decision and advise the student of the right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing. (C) The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosures without consent. FERPA contains various exceptions to the general rule that the University shall not disclose personally identifiable information contained in a student's education records without seeking the prior written consent of the student. The following circumstances are representative of those in which such information may be disclosed without the student's prior written consent: The University may disclose the following types of "directory information" without restriction unless the student otherwise requests: name; address; telephone number; email address; photograph; student identification number; dates of attendance; major field of study; participation in officially recognized activities, organizations, and athletic teams; weight and height of members of athletic teams; degrees and awards; academic institution attended immediately prior to Princeton University. A student requesting that some or all directory information be restricted from disclosure must make a written request to the Office of the Registrar specifying which information should be restricted. Faculty members and other officials of the University who have a legitimate educational interest in a student's education record may be permitted to review it. A University official is a person employed by the University in an administrative, supervisory, academic, or research or support staff position (including law enforcement personnel, health staff, and alumni and development staff); a person or company with whom the University has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor, or consultant); a person serving on the Board of Trustees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another University official in performing tasks. A University official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an educational record in order to fulfill a professional responsibility. The University will disclose information to government agencies entitled to it by law. The University may disclose information to the parent(s) or guardian(s) of a student unless the student has filed a statement certifying that the student is not financially dependent as defined by the federal income tax laws. The University will disclose information in response to a lawfully issued subpoena, and will ordinarily provide notice to the student involved in advance of complying with the subpoena. The University may disclose information when necessary to determine the student's eligibility for financial aid or to enforce the terms or conditions of financial aid which a student has received. The University may disclose information to an organization conducting a study if the organization certifies that the study will not be conducted in a way which will permit the personal identification of the students and that personally identifying information will be destroyed when the study is completed. The University has the right to disclose education records without a student's prior consent to officials of another institution in which a student seeks or intends to enroll or where the student has enrolled if the disclosure is for purposes related to the enrollment or transfer. However, the University encourages its departments and offices, at the minimum, to make a reasonable attempt to advise the student of the disclosure either before or after it occurs. The University will disclose information to a third party that has been granted permission by the student to request such information. When the student has given written permission for disclosure of information to a third party and subsequent events materially affect the accuracy of the University's original reporting, permission for the reporting of such additional information is understood in order to make the original reporting accurate. The University will disclose information to a third party, consistent with federal and state law, in the context of student disciplinary proceedings. (D) The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures of the University to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the office that administers FERPA are: Family Policy Compliance Office, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW, Washington, DC 20202-5920.
