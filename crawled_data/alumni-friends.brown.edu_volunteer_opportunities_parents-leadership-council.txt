Members seek to inspire support from other Brown parents by making example-setting gifts, engaging in personal outreach, hosting and attending regional events, and welcoming new families into the community. Brown parents have a strong tradition of philanthropy to the University, both while their children are at Brown and after they have graduated. Brown parents' generosity has repeatedly positioned The Parents Fund as one of the most successful parent funds in the Ivy League. These gifts go to work immediately, sustaining Brown's academic excellence and ensuring that every student has access to all that Brown has to offer. “We can think of nothing more important than helping to provide equal opportunity for all by assuring a quality education. It’s clear that Brown makes that happen for so many. We are excited to be part of a parent community committed to the education of all students at Brown.” ALICIA A.
