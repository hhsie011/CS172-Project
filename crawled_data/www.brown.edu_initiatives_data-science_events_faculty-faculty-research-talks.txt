The talks are presented at a very general level, to stimulate discussion and interdisciplinary interchange of ideas. Our goal is to provide a networking venue that promotes research collaborations between faculty across all disciplines; awareness of the breadth of data science–related research at Brown; and a forum for faculty to share their expertise with one another. Participation will be limited to Brown faculty members. All faculty are welcome, and we invite you all to participate by volunteering to give a presentation. The presentation can be at any level: concepts or ideas, implementation, or published research results, presented such that faculty from a range of disciplines can engage and see how the concepts and techniques could map on to their own research programs. For virtual events, we ask participants to register in advance, and we will send a Zoom link to all registrants. Please contact us if you are interested in presenting your research. All events will be announced through our newsletter (sign up here).
