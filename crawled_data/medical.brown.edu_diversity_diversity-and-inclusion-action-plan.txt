The Division of Biology and Medicine, in keeping with Brown University’s mission, recognizes, supports, develops, and maintains a diverse faculty, workforce, and student population. Dimensions of diversity include, but are not limited to, race, ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, veteran status, age, and socioeconomic and geographic background. Our commitment ensures respect for diversity, broad representation at all levels, and consistency and compliance with Brown’s policies on non-discrimination. Multicultural perspectives are critical to the success of the Division by enriching educational understanding, fostering outreach in clinical care settings, and enhancing trust in research. Diversity among faculty, staff, and students creates a greater number of role models, broadens perspectives, and combats negative and inappropriate stereotyping. Institutional diversity improves outreach to the community, enhances trust and communication, and facilitates development of culturally appropriate clinical and research programs. The Division of Biology and Medicine strives to create and maintain an environment that welcomes and respects individuals with diverse perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds. Strategic Plan Brown University has developed a strategic plan that reflects its commitment to building a diverse and inclusive campus. This plan, titled Pathways to Diversity and Inclusion: An Action Plan for Brown University, highlights the institution's desire to improve upon efforts to include people of all races, ethnicities, creeds, socioeconomic status, gender identities, sexual orientation, and disability statuses. The university sought community input and compiled a historical timeline of diversity and inclusion efforts, shared available data on historically underrepresented groups, and aims to engage with the greater community to foster relationship aimed at inclusiveness.
