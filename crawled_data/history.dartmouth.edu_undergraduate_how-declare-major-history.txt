The history department does not assign advisers to students. Instead, prospective majors and minors should contact and set up a meeting with a faculty member whose research and teaching fields aligns with their interests. You can see the pages and contact information for history faculty members here: https://history.dartmouth.edu/people. If you are unsure who to choose as an adviser, contact the Vice Chair of the History Department, Jennifer Miller (Jennifer.m.miller@dartmouth.edu) and she can assist you in identifying potential major advisers. STEP 2 – Think about courses A major in history requires ten courses. You can review the major requirements here: https://history.dartmouth.edu/undergraduate/major. A modified major in history requires twelve courses, eight of which must be history courses. You can review the modified major requirements here: https://history.dartmouth.edu/undergraduate/major/modified. A minor in history requires seven courses. You can review the minor requirements here: https://history.dartmouth.edu/undergraduate/minor. In order to plan your major or minor, you should consult the list of planned history course offerings over the next two years. You can find the most updated list of course offerings here: https://history.dartmouth.edu/undergraduate/course-schedule. Prior to meeting with your faculty adviser, think about courses that appeal to you, fit your D Plan, and/or fulfill the major or minor requirements. In particular, you should think about the upper level seminars (HIST 96) that you would like to take as part of your major or minor (2 are required for majors, one is required for modified majors and minors), starting as early as sophomore summer. In these small classes, limited to 12 students, students engage in high-level historical discussion and produce a significant piece of original research and writing. Look for seminars that have a connection to other course work that you have done in the history department and can effectively serve as a culminating experience in the history major. You can learn more about history seminars here: https://history.dartmouth.edu/undergraduate/curriculum/seminars-colloquia. STEP 3 – Meet with your faculty adviser and fill out the major/minor worksheet When you meet with your faculty adviser, bring your ideas about courses and seminars, along with a copy of a history major or minor worksheet. The major worksheet can be found here: Class of 2023 and Before History Major Worksheet Class of 2024 and Beyond History Major Worksheet The modified major worksheet can be found here: Class of 2023 and Before History Modified Major Worksheet Class of 2024 and Beyond History Modified Major Worksheet The minor worksheet can be found here: Class of 2023 and Before History Minor Worksheet Class of 2024 and Beyond History Minor Worksheet Your faculty adviser will help you develop a plan of courses that fits your interest and fulfills the major or minor requirements. In particular, they will help you identify appropriate seminars and offer advice about when to take various classes. Fill out the major or minor worksheet with your faculty adviser and have them sign it. Remember that this worksheet is simply a plan and can be revised as you progress through the major or minor, your interests change, and/or the available classes change. As you fill out your worksheet, you should also email the professors who are teaching the seminars (HIST 96) that you hope to take in order to inquire about any enrollment requirements and/or to be placed on their enrollment list. Enrollment in seminars is by instructor permission only. STEP 4 – Turn in your major or minor worksheet and enter your plan into DartWorks Turn in your signed worksheet to Department Administrator Bruch Lehmann in Carson 311 or via email to bruch.lehmann@dartmouth.edu. After you have completed your worksheet, go to DartWorks to select your courses and complete the online major or minor declaration process. Please note: Your major or minor plan in DartWorks will not be approved until you have turned in your adviser-approved major or minor worksheet to Department Adminstrator Bruch Lehmann.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of History Undergraduate Overview History FAQs for First Year and Transfer Students How to Declare a Major or Minor in History Major Modified Major Minor Transfer Credit Policy Course Descriptions First-Year Seminars Introductory Africa, Asia, Latin America & The Caribbean (AALAC) Europe (EUR) Interregional & Comparative (INTER) United States (US) Seminars & Colloquia Independent Study & Honors Course Schedule 2021-2022 Schedule 2022-2023 Schedule 2023-2024 Schedule Course Syllabi Honors Thesis Program General Timeline Guidelines for the Class of 2022 Guidelines for the Class of 2023 Honors Theses By Year Phi Alpha Theta Honors Society Prizes After Graduation Alumni Update Research Overview Faculty Research Initiatives Dartmouth History Institute Student Research Initiatives and Resources The Dartmouth Vietnam Project History Librarian Research Funding Resources Undergraduate Research Database Student Class Projects Foreign Study News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
