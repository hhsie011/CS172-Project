Section Menu: Visit Us Overview of Visit Us Dining Accommodations Visit Us Located in the heart of Silicon Valley, and surrounded by some of the state’s most beautiful scenery, Stanford campus is easily accessible. Address Stanford Graduate School of Business Knight Management Center 655 Knight Way Stanford, CA 94305-7298 Maps Knight Management Center Designated Smoking Areas Getting Here Alternative Transportation Stanford University offers a variety of programs that encourage and support the use of alternative transportation. Visitors can get to, from, and around campus easily by bicycle, shuttles, and Bay Area transit. Marguerite is Stanford University’s free public shuttle service, which connects to nearby transit, shopping, dining, and entertainment venues. The Line X and Line Y shuttles pick up and drop off passengers near the southbound train platform, and stop at Knight Management Center, as illustrated on the system map. Parking Parking is available in the underground structure at the Knight Management Center. Permits are required and enforced Monday through Friday from 6:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Visitor Parking Visitors may park for $4.46 per hour or $35.68 per day in the Knight Management Center parking garage. We have transitioned to a contactless payment process through ParkMobile, in which the parking garage is zone #7207. In the interest of safety, physical pay stations at visitor lots have been taken offline to avoid the touching of shared surfaces that cannot be adequately disinfected throughout the day. You have two options for payment: Mobile payment: Use the ParkMobile app, mobile website, or QR code, or by texting PARK to 77223 to pay using a credit card. In addition to the hourly visitor parking fee, ParkMobile charges 35 cents for each transaction. Pay online in advance: Customers who do not own cell phones may consider the option to create a ParkMobile account and purchase visitor parking in advance through a computer using the ParkMobile website. Purchasing visitor parking in advance does not guarantee a space, so there is a risk that you are unable to find parking in the zone when you arrive. The payment is non-refundable. Other nearby parking locations include: Parking lot at Bonair Siding Road and Campus Drive — two-minute walk On-street parking at Memorial Way and Galvez Street — five-minute walk Visitor Center parking lot at 295 Galvez Street — ten-minute walk The underground parking structure at Campus Drive East and Wilbur Way — ten-minute walk Departments can also purchase daily and long-term virtual permits for department use. Virtual Permits Employees and students can order and pay for their permits using our online ordering system. All permits are virtual. This means that, once you complete your order, your license plate becomes your permit. Taxi and Rideshare Drop-Off and Pick-Up Jane Stanford Way is closed to traffic since the street in front of the Knight Management Center is now a bicycle and pedestrian mall. Therefore, taxis and rideshare drivers should use the passenger turnaround, located in front of the Schwab Residential Center, for drop-off and pick-up. This turnaround is accessible on Jane Stanford Way via Campus Drive East. Use 680 Jane Stanford Way, Stanford, CA as the address to get directions to the turnaround.

Disability Access Office Telephone: (650) 725-0326 TTY: (650) 723-1216 Email: Disability Access Office Pets, Service & Support Animals Stanford has a “no pet policy” for office, academic, and student residence spaces, with the exception of service and approved support animals. General guidelines for service and approved support animals include the following: Dogs must be kept on leash at all times (unless performing a task) in all interior common area spaces as well as exterior spaces. In an effort to prevent damage to lawns, tan bark areas should be used as designated relief areas. Be sure you pick up after your animal. Do not leave pet food out in interior or exterior spaces since it may attract pests. Toys, bedding, etc., may not be left out in common areas. If your service or approved support animal causes damage to the building, you may be charged a repair and/or cleaning fee. Approved support animals are allowed in Stanford student housing; however, support animals are generally restricted in other areas. See FAQs: Service and Support Animals at Stanford for further information. The Diversity and Access Office provides additional guidance to students, staff, faculty and members of the public with service and support animals at Stanford. If you require an accommodation for a service or support animal at Stanford GSB, students are requested to advise their Student Program Office, staff advise Stanford GSB Human Resources, and faculty advise Stanford GSB Academic Administration. Smoke-Free Environment The Knight Management Center, GSB Residences buildings, and surrounding areas are smoke-free environments. “Smoke-free” refers to an environment that is free of smoke from, among other things, tobacco products and/or vapors from electronic smoking devices. Smoking is prohibited at all university-sponsored indoor and outdoor events. There are designated smoking areas which are noted on the map linked above. Safety, Security, and Fire Report Stanford University complies with the Jeanne Clery Act and publishes crime statistics for the most recent three-year period.
