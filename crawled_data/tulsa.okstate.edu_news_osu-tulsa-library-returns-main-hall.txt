Library operations were temporarily moved to the building outside Main Hall for maintenance in the Main Hall space. The library will be closed from May 16 - 19 during the move, but staff will be checking and responding to messages and questions. Library books may still be returned to the Drop Box during this time. To return Tech-to-Go items on one of these dates, call 918-594-8130 or text 918-205-7730 to arrange a drop-off. All current library services will be available in the Main Hall location and operating hours will remain the same. The library’s return to the Main Hall location means the return of open book stacks, so students and the public can see the physical collection and browse the shelves. The electronic collection remains much larger than the physical collection, featuring thousands of academic journals, e-books and e-textbooks. More study space and collaborative space will be available after the move, including group study spaces, a data visualization room, instruction room and more computers and printers. Each group study room will be equipped with computers and other technology. Additional improvements to the library include an expanded archive space that now features temperature and humidity control. This space holds the library’s collections, including the Cyrus Stevens Avery Archive, the Ruth Sigler Avery Tulsa Race Massacre Collection and the Michael Wallis Route 66 Research Collection.
