Salvatore, MD Mary M. Salvatore MD, MBA, is an associate professor of radiology at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in NYC. She specializes in thoracic radiology with a specific focus in interstitial lung diseases and patterns of fibrosis on CT. She is a passionate teacher and has spoken throughout the country on the early and correct diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Dr. Salvatore and colleagues have created and maintain a pulmonary fibrosis registry which has currently enrolled over 400 patients. She has initiated a daily journal club in order to provide continuing education for herself and other clinicians and patients on the topic of lung fibrosis by summarizing all recent articles and disseminating by email. She has started a support group for patients and their families, who have pulmonary fibrosis. Dr. Salvatore is actively involved in research, retrospectively reviewing well-established CTs of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) and looking at earlier exams to determine earliest CT manifestations of disease. She has written a text on CT interpretation for non-radiologists. Her ultimate goal is to affect as many people in a positive way as possible through education and positive attitude.
