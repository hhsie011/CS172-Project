Mythologies of Mumbai is a seven-year project of Partners of Urban Knowledge and Action Research (PUKAR) that extensively documented and archived the erstwhile mill lands of Girangaon through the eyes of the people who lived and worked there. The project is based on PUKAR’s 'right to research' methodology for democratizing research and using it as a tool for alternative pedagogy, advocacy, intervention, and transformation. Designed by HELM Studios and based on the work of PUKAR, this exhibition uses 360-degree multimedia production techniques, photography and video along with personal interviews, urban maps, and vast historical records, to bring new interpretations and perspectives of Girangaon's past, present and future. The exhibition is hosted by Columbia Global Centers | Mumbai as part of its Mumbai as a City of Knowledge initiative. The exhibition is open to the general public from November 21-25, 2017 from 10am to 6:30pm each day.
