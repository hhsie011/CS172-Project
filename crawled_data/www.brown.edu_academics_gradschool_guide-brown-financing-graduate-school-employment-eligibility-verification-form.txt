This process can be started online through the Brown Workday system and then completed in person at the HR Service Center, by appointment only, in Page-Robinson Hall on the second floor. Stipend payments will not be disbursed until an I-9 form has been completed, so it is imperative students comply as soon as they arrive in Providence. Please note: The I-9 process can be completed without a social security number (or receipt thereof), however, the I-9 form cannot be validated through E-Verify without a social security number. Students should apply for a social security card as soon as they are eligible to do so (two weeks after arrival in the U.S. for the first time). International students are strongly encouraged to bring their passports and the I-94 and I-20 forms issued by the University. See the full list of acceptable documents.
