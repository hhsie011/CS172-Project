William's research involves using seismic data to image the interior of the Earth, and integrate geodynamic models with the inferred seismic structure to better understand the long-term evolution of our planet. Although the evolution of oceanic plates plays a crucial role in plate tectonics, and therefore Earth evolution, the structure beneath ocean basins remains largely unexplored. He uses ocean bottom seismometers to address a range of problems in marine geophysics, including deep processes related mid-ocean ridges, structural and mechanical properties of the lithosphere and asthenosphere, and the structure and evolution of subduction zones. William began at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in the fall of 2019. He completed his PhD at the University of California, Berkeley in 2019, and his B.A. in physics and astrophysics from Harvard University in 2012 Education University of California, Berkeley (Earth and Planetary Science) – Ph.D. (2019) Harvard University (Physics and Astrophysics) – B.A. (2012) Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Seismology, Geology and Tectonophysics Areas of Expertise seismology geophysics Earthquake preparedness Contact Info 201I Seismology Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory 61 Route 9W Palisades, NY 10964 USA [email protected] LinkedIn Github Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory61 Route 9W · Palisades, NY 10964 Phone 845-359-2900 Contact Us [email protected] Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
