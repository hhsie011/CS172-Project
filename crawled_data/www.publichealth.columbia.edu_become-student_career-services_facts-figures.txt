JOB SEARCH PROCESS While the Mailman School has excellent career outcomes, and students and alumni have lifetime access to top-quality career services resources, students are ultimately responsible for taking ownership of their own job search. To find employment, students applied, on average, to 33 jobs in 2019-20, (excluding those who were recruited from internships or prior jobs). Students went through an average of 4.7 first-round interviews and 2.9 second-round interviews, to receive an average number of 1.5 job offers (There was 3 students receiving 5 or more offers, 11 students receiving 4 offers; 37 students receiving 3 offers; 85 students receiving 2 offers). Students used a variety of search methods to hear about the jobs they ended up accepting. 24% of students identified the job they accepted through Career Services (i.e. Mailman career fair, recruiting event, CareerLink job board); 5% used Mailman School Alumni networking; 13% Department/faculty; 8% Classmate referrals, 10% practicum; 13% personal network; and 25% used a non-Mailman Job Board; 6% were promoted from an existing job; and 13% used other methods (such as reciprocity career services with other public health schools, professional associations, or staffing firms). (Note: Percentages do not add to 100% because students could indicate more than one job search method; percentages indicate the percent of unique survey respondents mentioning that method.) In all, approximately 57% of students found their jobs via networking; and 62% found their jobs with the assistance of Columbia’s Mailman School of Public Health.
