Speakers are asked to prepare a 40-45 minute presentation, which will be followed by a question and discussion period. The colloquium audience comes from a diverse array of scientific backgrounds including graduate students from the geological, biological, chemical, and physical sciences. Not all members of the audience will be familiar with the history of or methodologies used in every subfield of the Earth sciences. Speakers should therefore begin their talk with at least 15-20 minutes of general background information before proceeding to more specialized topics. Time and Place This year, Colloquia will be given through a mix of in-person lectures held in the Monell Auditorium and virtual presentations through Zoom. Colloquium will begin at 3:30 pm ET Friday afternoons throughout the academic year. For virtual presentations, the start time may be shifted several hours to accommodate a speaker’s home time zone. Staff and student meetings for in-person speakers will be held on Friday prior to the 3:30 pm lecture. Facilities All in-person Colloquia will be held in the Monell Auditorium. All virtual Colloquia will be given via Zoom. Colloquium speakers will deliver their talks through screen sharing on their personal computer. Zoom support for setting up speaker presentations can be arranged by contacting the colloquium coordinators.
