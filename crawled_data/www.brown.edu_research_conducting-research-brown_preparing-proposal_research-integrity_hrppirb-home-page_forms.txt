Forms and Templates Submitting an Application | New Applications | Appendices and Supporting Documents | Consent/Assent Forms & HIPAA Authorizations | Revision Forms | Progress Reports, Study Closures & Reportable Events | Self-Determination Tools & Checklists Submitting an Application to the Brown IRB Principal Investigators must submit an application and required supplemental materials for research activities that meet the definition of human subjects research. Download a submission form from this page each time you submit. Forms are periodically updated to meet any changes in federal regulations and Brown policy. Submissions using forms that are more than 30 calendar days out of date will not be accepted. All IRB/HRPP submission forms and templates are provided below. Submission instructions Ensure that you have completed all required CITI training and Conflict of Interest reporting before you submit any new application materials. Abide by the "Single Submission Policy." For an accurate sequential review of your study submissions, HRPP will only accept one submission per study at a time. For example, if you have a progress report under review, you may not submit an amendment for the same study until the first submission is approved. E-mail all submissions to: [email protected]. (Please do NOT submit to an individual HRPP staff member. Please do not copy individual HRPP staff members on your submissions.) Include all submission materials in ONE single PDF file attachment. Please do NOT attach multiple files, Word docs, or zip files. PIs should not embed any associated documents into the application. Required documents (i.e. recruitment material, consent document, surveys) should be included in the single PDF, but not in the associated sections of the application. Certain components of human subjects research may require Ancillary Review by a department outside of the IRB. These reviews are independent of IRB approval and will not delay approval to conduct your research. However, compliance with the determinations of an ancillary review are required before you can begin research activities. *NEW* HRPP has a One Application Policy in accordance with Title 45 CFR 46.115 (Health and Human Services, IRB Records) and Title 21 CFR 56.115 (Food and Drug Administration, IRB Records). All new initial studies (Exempt/Expedited/Full Board) reviewed by the HRPP/IRB after May 1, 2022 will receive stamped IRB Approved Documents upon approval, which must be submitted for all future amendments and progress reports in order to maintain a single, active application that incorporates all IRB-approved amendments. If the PI is a graduate or medical student, the studentâ€™s academic advisor (as listed on the application) must be copied on e-mailed submissions. Expect a holistic review of your active study. The HRPP conducts a holistic review of your active study with each submission as part of normal review procedures to ensure it remains in compliance with current federal regulations, Brown policies, and IRB position statements. For example, if modifying compensation on a flyer, HRPP will review the entire flyer to confirm that it meets Brown's current recruitment policy. Need help? Please contact HRPP staff at 401-863-3050 or [email protected] New Applications New applications must be reviewed and approved by the IRB prior to conducting research with human participants. Depending on the details of the proposed research, supplemental forms and approvals may be required.
