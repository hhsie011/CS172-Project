Home  |  Graduate Graduate Engineering Studies at Dartmouth Join a dynamic community of leading researchers who will help you forge your own unique path to discovery, invention, and application. Tackle both focused and multidisciplinary problems together with peers and mentors who put human well-being and global societal need at the center of their engineering education, research, and practice. The benefits of a Dartmouth graduate degree in engineering include developing the skills and the drive to innovate with impact. As you work toward becoming an expert in your field, you'll be supported by a culture that values and fosters: Service to society through human-centered engineering Pioneering research that drives invention and new application An integrated approach to investigation, innovation, and technology transfer Engineering Master's Degrees MS Master of Science Emphasizes engineering research, applied mathematics skills, and depth with breadth across disciplines. Learn More MEng Master of Engineering Provides specialized depth in your field of choice through either full-time or part-time coursework. Learn More MEM Master of Engineering Management Combines graduate level engineering courses with management classes at Tuck School of Business. Learn More Engineering Doctoral Degrees PhD Doctor of Philosophy Offers flexibility within and across research/program areas and prepares you for either a professional or academic position. Learn More PhD-I PhD Innovation Program Supplements the doctoral engineering curriculum with entrepreneurial studies—the first of its kind in the nation. Learn More PhD+MD PhD + Doctor of Medicine Combines a PhD in engineering sciences with an MD from The Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth. Learn More Graduate Information Sessions & Campus Visits Connect with faculty experts to learn more about ways to enhance your career and research through Dartmouth Engineering’s graduate degree programs. Graduate Information Sessions & Campus Visits The Graduate Engineering Experience “One of my projects was developing a tool to study climate change through measuring the changes in Arctic sea ice. It called on a combination of mechanical, electrical, and systems engineering. The systems part was key. The product emerged on the boundary between science and engineering.” —Cameron Planck, PhD Th'20 Program Areas Dartmouth offers a diversity of concentrations with collaborative synergies between engineering disciplines. Graduate students are expected to propose a plan of study that supports their interests on a path unconstrained by disciplinary boundaries. Both faculty and students draw from these multiple areas of expertise for maximum human-centered impact: Biological and Chemical Engineering Biomedical Engineering Electrical and Computer Engineering Energy Engineering Materials Science and Engineering Mechanical, Operations and Systems Engineering Entrepreneurship At Dartmouth, where half of the tenure-track engineering faculty have started companies, we are working to address the nation's growing need for people with both technical and entrepreneurial expertise. As part of that effort, you may: Become a PhD Innovation Program Fellow Get involved with a faculty start-up Gain training through the Magnuson Center for Entrepreneurship Add yours to the list of patent applications filed by PhD candidates Start your own company Human-Centered Design "Students who become really good at design become experts at a process that they can apply to anything, from designing medical devices to improving the lives of infants in their car seats. The same process can be applied, no matter what the problem is.” —Professor Peter Robbie The principles of design thinking are integrated throughout the curriculum. Students come away with the skills to assess human nature, needs, habits, desires, abilities, and cultures and incorporate them into technological design. “In our medical and biomedical engineering, just to pick one area, we have the huge advantage to work closely with a teaching hospital. We can work directly with clinicians. We can test patients. That ability doesn’t exist in the same way at other places.” —Professor Doug Van Citters Collaboration Dartmouth encourages and facilitates collaboration to widen your horizon even further. Partners for collaboration include: Guarini School of Graduate and Advanced Studies Department of Computer Science Tuck School of Business Geisel School of Medicine Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center Magnuson Center for Entrepreneurship Irving Institute for Energy and Society Cold Regions Research and Engineering Lab (CRREL) Peer institutions, government, and industry Leadership While acquiring technical depth in your area, you'll also hone your leadership skills. You'll practice different kinds of writing, learn to give constructive criticism, and become an experienced presenter. The opportunities go beyond a typical advanced degree in engineering. For example, you might: Create or redesign a course with a professor Start a journal or club in your research area Take classes in other departments Every experience you have beyond your chosen field of expertise prepares you to take the lead in whatever path you choose. Discover Dartmouth Engineering Collaborative Programs Dartmouth prides itself on facilitating collaboration both on and off-campus. Teamwork and cross-pollination occur between peers, colleagues, schools, centers, institutions, and industry. Learn More Graduate Degree Outcomes Most MEM graduates enter directly into full-time positions; 20–40% of MS graduates continue on to pursue a PhD and the remaining secure employment; PhD recipients enter into professorships (~15%), research positions (50–60%), or entrepreneurship or industry (~30%). Learn More Graduate Student Life & Housing Dartmouth owns and manages over 500 on- and off-campus rental housing units within two miles of campus. Accommodations range from studio apartments to single-family homes. Learn More Scholarship, Fellowship & Grant Programs Endowed named scholarships and fellowships, established through the generosity of alumni/ae, friends, foundations, and corporations, are awarded to engineering students with financial need who have demonstrated academic ability and show promise of contributing to the engineering profession.
