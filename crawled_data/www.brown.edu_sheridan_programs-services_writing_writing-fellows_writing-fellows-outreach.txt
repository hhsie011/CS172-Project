Through this work, the program furthers its mission of promoting inclusive, equitable writing approaches across campus by increasing opportunities for the student community to engage in meaningful dialog about their writing experiences and practices. Campus outreach initiatives are led by the program’s Diversity, Inclusion, and Outreach Coordinators, or DIOCs. The program’s 2021-2022 DIOCs are Allison Singleton and Megan Zhang. Below, learn more about our current campus outreach initiatives. Writing Fellows Open Hours In Spring 2022, the Writing Fellows program launched Writing Fellows Open Hours. Spearheaded by 2021-2022 DIOC Allison Singleton, the program stations fellows across campus, where they offer student writers feedback on quick writing questions, without writers needing to make an appointment. Our Spring 2022 open hours are being held in-person and virtually throughout the month of April. All students are welcome to drop into sessions held in the Blue Room and virtually. We are also holding sessions at several identity centers for students who are members of the communities they serve.
