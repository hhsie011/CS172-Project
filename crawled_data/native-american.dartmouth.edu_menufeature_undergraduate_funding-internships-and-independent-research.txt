Applicants may apply for awards of up to $4,000 to support travel and living expenses for a 10-week period (the typical length of a college term). Students awarded funding of any amount for either an internship or a leave term independent research project are not eligible to apply for another round of funding from NAIS. Proposals for Funding to support Leave Term Independent Research Projects NAIS funds are intended to support students who are pursuing independent research relating to Native American/Indigenous Peoples in projects of their own design and away from campus during a leave term. Preference will be given to projects that relate in some tangible way to a student's on-going academic research interests in the study of Native American/Indigenous Peoples, e.g., foundational research preparatory for a thesis or fellowship project (whether in NAIS or another college department or program). As these projects are undertaken during a leave term, students may not earn academic credit for their work, though their research may serve as the basis for an independent study course (NAIS 85) taken upon their return to campus. Written proposals are submitted to the chair of NAIS and must include the following information: 1. an overview of the project that clearly explains your academic plan in some detail, including the subject matter and the essential research question(s) to be investigated. 2. a description of the research site, community or archive where you will be working and evidence that you have the requisite permission from an authorized source to conduct such work (including the necessary clearances from the host and the college to conduct research involving human subjects); 3. a description of your preparation for undertaking such work; here, your basic goal is to show that you're prepared to undertake a project of this magnitude & have the requisite academic and personal qualifications to do so, working mostly independently (though supervised by a faculty member). Your evidence could include prior coursework; other independent study projects; work experiences, etc. that respond to the points above; 4. a description of prior research in your proposed research area, including a bibliography of source material (primary and secondary sources) that you have or will consult as part of the research for this project; 5. the name of your faculty supervisor (you should consult with and confirm the agreement of an NAS faculty member to serve as your advisor before submitting your proposal). Students receiving funding to support either an internship or leave term independent research projects will be required to make a presentation before the NAIS faculty (and any invited guests) during their next term in residence describing their experiences and any work product developed during their time away from campus. They will also be required to submit a brief report of their experiences to the donor, Gordon Russell '55, whose gift to Dartmouth allows NAIS to support these academic experiences. Proposals for Funding to support Off-Campus Internships NAIS funds are intended to support students who have secured an unpaid off-campus internship with a tribal nation; or an organization or government entity whose primary mission is dedicated to the study, support and/or advancement of Native American/Indigenous Peoples. This funding source is not available to support internships at any Dartmouth College office, department or program. Written proposals are submitted to the chair of NAIS and must include the following information: (1) A description of the sponsoring tribal nation, organization or government entity with whom the student will be working and, if the sponsoring party is an organization or government entity, a description of their mission as it relates to Native Americans/Indigenous Peoples; (2) the name, title and role of the supervisor who will oversee the student's work; (3) a description of the student's assignment(s) and work schedule during the term, including particular outcomes or deliverables; (4) a brief description of your preparation for this internship, including relevant coursework and/or prior work experience; (5) a statement of how this internship advances or complements the student's academic work in NAIS and/or their longer-term career interests as they relate to Native Americans/Indigenous Peoples. Students receiving funding to support either an internship or leave term independent research projects will be required to make a presentation before the NAIS faculty (and any invited guests) during their next term in residence describing their experiences and any work product developed during their time away from campus. They will also be required to submit a brief report of their experiences to the donor, Gordon Russell '55, whose gift to Dartmouth allows NAIS to support these academic experiences.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Native American and Indigenous Studies Undergraduate Overview Major and Minor Courses Honors Program Waitlists and Applications NAS 85 Independent Study Rules & Procedures NAS Students Writing Prize Award Recipients Alumni - Tell Us Your Story 2020 2021 Funding for Internships and Independent Research Off-Campus Program Research Overview Gordon Russell Visiting Professorship Gordon Russell Visiting Professorship Alumni Charles Eastman Fellowship Eastman Fellowship Alumni Tribal Scholar Fellowship Program Tribal Scholar Fellowship Alumni Resources News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
