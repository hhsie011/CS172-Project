Additionally, the Carney Institute supports interdisciplinary research through the New Frontiers awards, and highly creative research projects through the Innovation fund. Zimmerman Innovation Awards in Brain Science The call for applications is open, the deadline is June 15, 2022 The purpose of these awards is to launch innovative projects that have great potential to advance science and benefit society in ways that have major and lasting impact. Projects that are too risky and early stage to be appropriate for NIH or similar funding mechanism are strongly favored. The Carney Institute will invest up to $100,000 per project for one year, renewable for a second year on a competitive basis, to support projects that meet these criteria.

Pre-proposals due May 25, 2022; invited Full applications due June 24, 2022 The Carney Institute for Brain Science COBRE Center for Nervous System Function aims to increase the quantity and quality of research on the nervous system in Rhode Island. One means of attaining this goal concerns identifying and nurturing talented young investigators and enabling established investigators to create a new research line. We welcome project submissions that explore the neural basis of attention, decision-making, learning, memory, or other cognitive functions. Read More Graduate Awards in Brain Science Scientific review is underway. Results will be announced in late Spring 2022. The Carney Institute for Brain Science invites applications for Graduate Awards in Brain Science. These awards recognize outstanding and productive mid- to late-stage Ph.D. candidates conducting brain science-related research in a Brown graduate program. Awards cover full costs for two academic semesters and one summer beginning in the Fall. Read More Postdoctoral T32 Training Program in Recovery and Restoration of CNS Health and Function Applications closed. The goal of this exciting multidisciplinary, multi-institutional training program, based at Massachusetts General Hospital and the School of Engineering and the Carney Institute for Brain Science, is to enhance recovery from disabling brain injuries by filling a pressing need for clinician-scientists and neuroengineers trained to leverage the computational neurosciences and to develop and test device-based and other interventions for patients. Read More Undergraduate Teaching and Research Awards (UTRA) Applications closed The Carney Institute for Brain Science offers summer undergraduate research experiences in coordination with the Brown University Undergraduate Teaching and Research Award (UTRA) program. Each summer, Carney supports undergraduate summer research awards as funding permits. Applications that are not awarded a Carney Institute-specific UTRA will still be considered for funding through the University-wide pool of UTRA funding.
