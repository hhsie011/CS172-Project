We aim to create a dynamic group where nascent ideas can be evaluated for their real world applicability (clinicians and scientists), feasibility (engineers), and market potential (entrepreneurs) simultaneously. We want to encourage the development and refinement of early ideas and provide information on concrete steps towards turning ideas into products and companies.
