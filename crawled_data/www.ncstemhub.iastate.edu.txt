The Iowa STEM Advisory Council was created to increase interest and achievement in these key areas. In order for Iowa students to complete in a global economy and make smart, socially-responsible decisions, Iowa graduates need a solid STEM education. In addition, it is vital to Iowa’s economy and quality of life. The Council unites educators, students, businesses, legislators, nonprofits, and communities in an effort to improve STEM opportunities and awareness. The NC STEM Region is just one of six around the state. Our efforts fall into three main categories: 1) provide programming and support for K-12 teachers, 2) host community-wide STEM festivals and events, and 3) seek out opportunities to offer STEM to diverse communities around the region.
