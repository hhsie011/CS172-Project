This program addresses and assists students in technical majors. We offer services that promote success, present career opportunities, and provides students with networking. We offer mentoring, guidance, counseling, and other services that benefit students in the College of Science and Engineering and Applied Sciences. The program puts students in contact with other students in their classes and with successful people in the workforce. These personal contacts can not only furnish a great deal of support as you pursue your studies, but they form a network upon which to call when launching your career.
