Expenditures exceed three hundred and twenty five million dollars annually. Since the university must provide for administrative, academic, medical, research, and individual student needs, almost every product and service imaginable is purchased. UC will continue to follow the procurement requirement of OMB Circular A-110. UC employees seeking purchasing-related resources and PACE systems guides should visit the Purchasing Bearcats Landing site, where internal documents are published. How We Work UC is a state institution with its own board of trustees. Much of what UC buys is competitively bid. Generally, bidding is conducted electronically (phone, fax, email) for small dollar purchases, and in writing for larger requirements. Buyers select prospective bidders in a number proportionate to each expenditure, ordinarily choosing firms that they evaluate as offering a maximum effort in competition and service. At fifty thousand dollars, advertisements are placed in two local newspapers. As a state institution, UC is privileged to use state contracts. The university also participates in joint purchase agreements with the State Universities Council, the City of Cincinnati, and others.
