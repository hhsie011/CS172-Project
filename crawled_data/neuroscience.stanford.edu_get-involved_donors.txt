Why Stanford? Stanford has long been a leader in basic research, engineering, and medicine and has stayed ahead of the curve by uniting scientists across disciplines around challenging questions in neurosciences. Our small campus – where scientists from different disciplines can easily meet to share ideas – fosters collaborative, interdisciplinary research like no other. We engage extraordinary people, including faculty and, through training programs and fellowships, graduate students and postdocs. We drive interdisciplinary research through major research initiatives and seed grants for off-the-beaten-path ideas. And we provide vital infrastructure, including a new, state-of-the-art research facility set to open in 2019. Gift Opportunities – Make a Difference Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute relies on the generous support of alumni, parents, and friends to foster highly novel and collaborative brain research across all disciplines with the goal of better understanding and treating the human brain in health and disease. Our flagship initiatives to transform neuroscience are our Big Ideas in Neuroscience. Philanthropic support significantly helps Stanford advance groundbreaking discoveries as well as uniquely train a new breed of neuroscientists. Expendable and endowment support at all levels will have a dramatic impact on many lives far into the future.
