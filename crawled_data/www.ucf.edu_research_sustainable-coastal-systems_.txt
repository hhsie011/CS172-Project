By crossing disciplines, the cluster works to understand complex local, national and global problems related to natural changes in coastal systems and those caused by humans. The threats and challenges Florida faces are the same that coastal communities around the world face. The solutions, methods and technologies developed at UCF will have immediate application to other geographic locations, with the potential to be statewide and national models for how coastal states should address future environmental and economic challenges as well as growth opportunities. UCF Coastal researcher Christopher Emrich speaks with NBC News about disaster preparedness in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. UCF Coastal notched several victories in its second year, including a new research station at Econfina River State Park and also by establishing an advisory board of passionate supporters.
