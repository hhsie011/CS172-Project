The purpose of the test is to determine a student's mathematic abilities in the following subjects: Algebra Geometry Trigonometry Pre-Calculus The test is taken online for approximately one hour while being proctored virtually by staff from the Testing Services Office. While taking the test, a student is permitted to use paper and pencil/pen to complete the math equations, but may not use a calculator or any other help from a friend, family member, or teacher. The final score report is available immediately after taking the test. Become familiar with the test and refresh your skills by completing the MPT sample questions and viewing the Math Minute videos. Application & Scholarship Requirement International Admissions requires that each applicant show their math ability for admission* and scholarship review. To do this a student can submit their SAT or ACT test results. If a student didn't take the SAT or ACT, they may request to take the MPT. Both options are viewed equally though our application review process. *A student applying to a program in the College of Arts & Sciences, College of Education, Criminal Justice, and Human Resources, UC Blue Ash Campus, and UC Clermont Campus aren't required to show math ability. However, it's encouraged to submit a test of math ability for scholarship review. *The College-Conservatory of Music has different requirements for test of math ability. Contact CCM Admissions for requirements. Register Contact your admissions counselor or email international.admissions@uc.edu to schedule an MPT.
