Climate Response Journalism Share Share Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Cancel The Energy and Environmental Reporting Project is an intensive, full-time investigative reporting fellowship for four recent graduates of Columbia Journalism School. The fellows work independently and in teams to examine issues related to the environment and energy resources on an international level. Fellows perform extensive archival, public records, and database research, as well as conduct interviews with a variety of sources from government, academia, and industry.
