The seminar examines three technologies: drones used for collecting intelligence and “targeted killings;” heavily surveilled separation walls used to enforce a strict regime of movement; tunnels used by insurgency forces for undercover movement. We will study these technologies’ modes of operation; the discourse that represent and justifies their actual deployment; the local and global economy of violence in which they are embedded; the system of state sovereignty which they enable or undermine; and the political regime which they help reproduce or destabilize. DPLL. MES 0950 Cultures, Societies and Practices of Resistance in the Middle East Professor Hanan Toukan This course critically examines the various manifestations of counter-hegemony, resistance and dissent in the societies of the Middle East. Taking as its starting point the fact that much of the literature on politics, culture and society in the Middle East emphasizes the region’s various hierarchies of power, dogged ideologies and prevailing hegemony in ordering identities and experiences, the course proceeds to study the ways in which these dominant forms are in reality countered in cultural production and every day cultural practices. The course will analyze how subcultures, social movements and individuals throughout the region have tried to negotiate with, subvert and resist these forms of social and political hegemonies through the use of various art forms such as writing, poetry, music, political film, political posters and pamphlets, performance art and public art and the mixed outcomes of many of these struggles. The readings are organized thematically rather than geographically, covering major issues in cultural theory, cultural sociology, cultural studies and many of the key readings in Middle Eastern Studies. The course will theorize themes such as the aesthetics of resistance, dissensus, social movements, global culture, subcultures and post-subcultures and illustrate them through specific case studies from different countries in the region. MES 1999E Displacement and Refugees in the Middle East (COURSE FULL) TTh 1:00-2:20 p.m. Professor Sarah Tobin Displacement and refugees constitute one of the most significant sources of upheaval, instability, and uncertainty in our time. In 100 years, the Middle East saw waves of displaced persons, with no singular explanation and no end in sight: Armenians, Circassians, Palestinians, Iraqis, Yazidis, Kurds, and Syrians. The impetuses for displacement include wars, fall of empires and nations, crafting of new states, and modernization attempts and environmental disasters. They challenge the narratives of the durability of nation-states, ascendancy of capitalism, and emplaced, “timeless” Arab populations. This course includes a mandatory GELT-funded spring break trip to Jordan. Enrollment by instructor permission only. DPLL. FOUNDATIONAL COURSES ANTH 1151 Ethnographies of the Muslim Middle East W 12:30-3:00 p.m. Professor Anila Daulatzai An introduction to ethnographic studies of Middle East, focus on: religion, language, modernity, gender, and political culture. Students will engage in critical examination which anthropologists sought to capture Middle Eastern life, and problems that have pervaded anthropological representation, methodologically and theoretically. You will learn, through the ways anthropologists approach the peoples, ideas, and cultures of the region in ways that complement and contradict the knowledge production of other disciplines, the processes we come to understand cultural difference, and ways this encounter sheds light on our selves and practices. Previous course in Anthropology/ Middle East studies is suggested. Enrollment limited to 25. DPLL. HIST 1445 The Making of the Ottoman World, 15th-20th Centuries TTh 2:30-3:50 p.m. Professor Meltem Toksoz This course treats some of the major themes of Ottoman state and society, one of the major empires of the world out of which many new polities in the Balkans, Anatolia, the Middle East and North Africa emerged during the twentieth century. At the center of the course is the transformation of the “classical” Ottoman state to the early modern and modern through the many shapes and forms it has taken. We will be covering the beginnings from the 15th century and end with the analysis of the making of the modern Ottoman society in the early 20th century. RELS 0095 Islam M 2:00-2:50 p.m. Professor Abed Azzam This course covers the basic beliefs and practices, political and social institutions, law and theology, philosophy and art that constitute Islam’s history and culture. We will begin to examine the emergence of Muhammad’s message in Arabia in its geopolitical, cultural and religious context to look later at Islamic institutional and intellectual tradition against the backdrop of the Islamic state and society. In the modern period, we will read the social, political and intellectual results of Islam’s encounter with European colonialism. In light of this account, the course concludes by studying contemporary phenomena such as ISIS and European Islam.
