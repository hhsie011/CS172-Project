Current research focuses include infectious disease investigation for the rare Indonesian rhinos (i.e. tabanid vectors driving trypanosome infection). Our engaged learning initiative in Africa and Indonesia represents a significant commitment by the CCMP to train veterinary and undergraduate students and engage faculty in conservation medicine. A primary objective of our Conservation with Communities for One Health program is to engage students in creating, from beginning to end, a small project of study relating to one health that will help conservation efforts for endangered species while simultaneously building the skills of the student and the scientific capacity of the local host.
