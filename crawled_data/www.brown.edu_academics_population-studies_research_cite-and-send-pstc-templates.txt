CITE the PSTC grant number in any current or future publications that have benefited from PSTC services, tools, or funding. (Grant numbers and example acknowledgments provided below.) This acknowledgment of support is tracked and reported to the NIH. It is used as a key metric of the PSTC's productivity (publications) to ensure continued funding for the Center. 2. SEND the final, pre-formatted version of all peer-reviewed publications to [email protected]. The articles must also be deposited in NIH's PubMed Central upon acceptance for publication. It is the author's responsibility to ensure this is done. Some journals make deposits automatically; this can also be done by the author or by PSTC staff, if requested. Authors should always verify that their articles have been submitted in order to comply with the NIH public access policy. To add your article to PubMed Central, log in to the NIH manuscript submission system using an eRA Commons ID. The system will generate an email message asking you to verify the submission.
