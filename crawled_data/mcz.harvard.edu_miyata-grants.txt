Miyata grants are intended to defray the costs of field research by graduate students in herpetology, but costs of non-herpetological fieldwork may be eligible when there are no deserving herpetological projects. Allowable expenses include, but are not limited to, travel, per diem, collecting and export permits, and necessary field equipment and supplies. Researchers are expected to deposit tissues for accessioning together with the corresponding whole (voucher) specimens. Curatorial staff will transfer these samples to the MCZ Cryogenic Collection for long-term storage in liquid nitrogen. Miyata grants commemorate Dr. Kenneth Miyata PhD 1980. They are intended to support students who share Ken’s interests as a naturalist, biogeographer, and writer/photographer. Support is derived from The Ken Miyata Fund for Field Research, which was established by a generous gift from Barbara Wu PhD 1981 and Eric Larson AB 1977, who were close friends of Ken. Eligibility MCZ graduate students only. Application There is no standard application form for Miyata grants and no regular deadlines. Unsolicited applications are not accepted.
