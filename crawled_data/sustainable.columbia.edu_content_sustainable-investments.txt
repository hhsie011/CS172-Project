Recognizing that certain oil and gas companies aim to transition their businesses to net zero emissions by 2050, the University may make an exception to its non-investment policy when a credible plan exists for a company to do so. Together with its 2017 decision to divest from thermal coal, the University’s current investment approach aligns with its considerable academic and research commitment to this essential cause. This policy was informed by The Advisory Committee on Socially Responsible Investing (ACSRI), a volunteer committee that was established in March 2000 to advise the University Trustees on ethical and social issues that arise in the management of the investments in the University's endowment.
