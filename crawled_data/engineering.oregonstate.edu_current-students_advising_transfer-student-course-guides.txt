Every effort is made to keep these guides up to date, but the curriculum is always evolving. The OSU Catalog provides the most up-to-date curricular requirements for the College of Engineering programs. Students transferring to OSU will be required to complete the degree requirements outlined in the catalog for the year they matriculated. For example, students entering OSU in fall 2020 will be required to complete the curriculum in the 2020-2021 catalog, regardless of changes made to the curriculum in subsequent years. Questions about articulations can be directed to: Cate Olson, Student Transitions Coordinator Cate.Olson@oregonstate.edu 541-737-1206 *Updated 3/22/21 Blue Mountain Community College Architectural Engineering Bioengineering Chemical Engineering Civil Engineering Computer Science -
