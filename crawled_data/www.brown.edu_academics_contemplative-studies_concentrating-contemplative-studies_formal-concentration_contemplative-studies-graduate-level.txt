The Scholarly Concentration in Contemplative Studies is a branch of the Contemplative Studies Initiative and is similarly focused on a range of beneficial mental states (deemed "contemplative") that involve focused attention, deep concentration, and complete absorption in activity. These mental states and their underlying philosophy, psychology, physiology and links with human creativity are central to the elective program. Training young physicians in the use of contemplative methods in clinical practice, this program also supports them in developing their own skills for listening to patients and remaining calm and focused amidst challenging medical situations. Students are matched with clinical mentors who are using contemplative methods in their own practices or researchers who are studying the effects of contemplative practices on healthy individuals and patients.
