The HB2 location will open for business when the University's Summer 1 sesssion begins on June 6. One of the biggest "perks" at Hilton College is our popular student-run coffeehouse, Cougar Grounds®. This campus hot spot features gourmet coffee, blended coffee drinks, deluxe teas, pastries, desserts and more in the hip atmosphere of an independent, urban coffeehouse. Located on the first floor of the College's South Wing, Cougar Grounds is the first university coffeehouse in the country to be run by students as part of a corollary education class. It serves as the laboratory for an entrepreneurship class, in which students learn all about small-business operations, including marketing and sales, price-setting, payroll, cost control, supply management and new product development. In August 2018, Cougar Grounds expanded its operations to the second floor of the University’s Health 2 Building, which houses the College of Optometry and the College of Pharmacy. With two locations on campus, Cougar Grounds allows a true multi-unit management experience for our students.
