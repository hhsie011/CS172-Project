It is similar to many other liberal arts majors (history, literature, philosophy to name a few) because it gives you the intellectual tools for success in a host of career fields. It is not a dry, cloistered, or indoctrinating study. Here, you will encounter new ways of understanding the world, learn exciting methods of analysis, and develop sophistication in the interpretation of religious texts, beliefs and practices. You will learn to think, write, and speak with clarity and precision, to do research on complex issues, and to listen and relate to others with understanding and respect.
