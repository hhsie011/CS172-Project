Let us know by filing a research disclosure form. A research disclosure is the first step in initiating the technology transfer process, and is handled by UofL Innovation and Commercialization, within the UofL Office of Research and Innovation. A disclosure is a summary of an innovation, and includes information such as when the innovation was first conceived, when it was first used, and who was involved in its discovery or creation. Even if you’re not certain your discovery qualifies as an “invention,” our staff wants to hear about it. Remember: “when in doubt, disclose.” What is required when completing research disclosure forms? While our team recognizes that not all sections of our research disclosure forms will apply to your specific case, we do request that as many sections be completed as possible. Please pay particular attention to research funding sources, as well as the date of any previous or future public disclosures (such as talks open to the general public, discussions with companies/institutions, and any other sharing of information with anyone outside of the university not under a non-disclosure agreement). Please provide all of the following information to our staff, if possible: Signed and completed research disclosure form; Any/All supporting documentation (if applicable): Draft manuscripts; Draft poster presentations; Abstracts; And hyperlinks to online publications.
