The Bulletin contains longer contributions, those over 30 printed pages; Breviora carries shorter papers. Both publications are focused on reporting work based on specimens held in the MCZ collections or by staff, students, and associates of the MCZ. Both publications are issued at irregular intervals and are available for download via Search Publications, as well as through BioOne. Issues printed prior to 2004 can also be found in the Biodiversity Heritage Library. From 1865 intermittently through 1973, the MCZ also published the Memoirs of the Museum of Comparative Zoology. This publication contained longer monographs concerned with all aspects of zoology and related topics. From 1931 to 1997, multiple books and monographs were published. These special publications covered discipline-specific topics including Peters’ Check-list of Birds of the Worldand Paynter’s Ornithological Gazetteers of South America. Starting in 1861, annual reports and newsletters were published documenting institutional activities and updates from MCZ directors, curators, staff and students.
