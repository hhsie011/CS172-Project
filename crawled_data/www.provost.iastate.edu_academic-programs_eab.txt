Students enjoy the ability to conveniently meet with staff through the Appointment Scheduler. Beginning in August 2021, students will also be able to receive notifications on crucial items to stay on track towards graduation through your To-Do List and Hold Resolution, find classmates to study with through the Study Buddies feature, and, coming in January 2022, update their graduation plan in collaboration with their academic advisor(s) within the app using Academic Planner. Academic and support staff are able to communicate and schedule meetings with large groups or individual students, conduct outreach to connect students with support resources (e.g. academic support services, financial aid, multicultural students affairs, etc.), use advanced search for targeted outreach, pull reports and analytics on student interactions and intervention outcomes to improve student retention. Currently, Navigate is accessible to current undergraduate students and some graduate students at Iowa State University. Incoming students will be able to utilize the system when you accept your offer of admission to Iowa State and your netid (@iastate.edu account) becomes active. Students can access EAB Navigate from their Student tab in AccessPlus. Faculty/Staff can access Navigate directly through this link if already logged in, through OKTA or through AccessPlus.
