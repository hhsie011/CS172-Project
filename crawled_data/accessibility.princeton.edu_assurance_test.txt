The earlier issues are identified, the easier they are to fix. While we do teach departments how to test for accessibility, we not recommend departments do their own screen reader testing. Effective and comprehensive screen reader testing requires multiple devices, a lot of training and a lot of practice. Reach out to us for help: Reviewing implementation plans, design concepts and prototypes. Evaluating vendor products being considered for purchase. Doing quality assurance testing before launch, independently or as part of the Office of Communications website review process. We can offer usability advice, run site-wide scans and manually check compatibility with alternative-input devices and screen readers.
