Read more about our Test Optional policy. When you apply for freshman admissions at Baylor, you might submit ACT or SAT scores. We only ask for one or the other, but if possible, we suggest that you try each exam at least once to see which exam is a better fit for you. As you plan ahead here are just a few tips to help you prepare for these important exams. Set goals. To find the median ACT and SAT score range for accepted freshman, visit our Freshman: What We're Looking For page. Don't let this information scare you. Rather, use it to set goals for the scores you're aiming for. We recommend applying to Baylor and submitting your official ACT and/or SAT scores by the November 1 application deadline. Take this deadline into account as you consider which tests to schedule. Look into our residual ACT test if you need an additional test score outside of the National testing date. Here's a bonus for you - at Baylor we superscore, which means we combine subscores from tests taken on different dates. That means we will take your best Math and best Critical Reading scores from different tests when considering you for admission and academic scholarships. Study! Below are some tips to help you succeed as you begin to think about taking the ACT or SAT and applying to Baylor: Work hard and pay attention in your classes in high school. A lot of the concepts and skills you learn in the classroom will help you on these exams. Find out if your school offers an SAT or ACT prep course or find a local prep course that you could take. Utilize online study resources such as the following: www.princetonreview.com kaptest.com sat.collegeboard.org/practice Retest if necessary. The benefit of thinking about the college process earlier than most is that you have plenty of time to retest if you'd like to improve your score. So don't get down on yourself if your score wasn't where you hoped it would be. Just form a new game plan and try again.
