NOCGS is dedicated to preserving, perpetuating, and celebrating the distinctive cultures of New Orleans and the Gulf South, identified as the bioregion stretching from Florida to Texas. Its focus is not only on the coastal states, but is international as well, exploring areas of Latin America, the Caribbean, and Africa that have ties to the region and have influenced its distinctive history and traditions, as well as other delta city and coastal wetland areas around the world that share geographical traits. The Center’s mission rests on three pillars: research, teaching, and community engagement. All of our programming is based on the belief that the more we understand where we are, the more fully we can engage in our democracy and collective destiny.
