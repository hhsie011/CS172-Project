In addition to answering the police department’s general administration line, FSUPD Dispatchers relay information to officers and first responders over the radio. Dispatchers are responsible for keeping track of the location and status of every on-duty officer and first responder. In order to do so, Dispatchers use a system called CAD (Computer Aided Dispatch), in which they can create, log, track, and update calls and database information for the police department. The Dispatchers also maintain the National Criminal Database in which driver’s licenses and license plates can be checked, as well as the status of pending warrants and stolen items. A dispatcher is also required to maintain communication with surrounding agencies, monitor several campus alarm systems, call out any after-hours personnel, and answer the 911 emergency and Blue Light phones. title-inside title-centered 2 FSUPD Headquarters Florida State University Police Department 830 West Jefferson Street PO Box 3064215 Tallahassee FL, 32306 Map Location P: (850) 644-1234 F: (850) 644-3205 FSUPD Panama City Florida State University Panama City 4750 Collegiate Drive Panama City FL, 32405 Map Location P: (850) 872-4250 F: (850) 770-2721 Transportation & Parking Services 104 N.
