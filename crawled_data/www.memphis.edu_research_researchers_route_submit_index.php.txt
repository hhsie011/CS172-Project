OSP's highest priority is providing direct support to faculty and staff involved in sponsored activities during the entire lifecycle of the grant. Each step is defined with clear expectations, roles and responsibilities, and guidance. All proposals require a budget. Use the "Internal Budget Template" for all proposals of a full year or more. Use the "Monthly Budget Template" for proposals of fewer than 11 months. Be sure to include a signed FCOI form which can be accessed here. If you need an individual organization code, you may access the request form.
