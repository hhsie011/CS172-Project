Your COA covers both your tuition and basic living expenses, including room and board, books and supplies, transportation and travel costs and personal expenses. Your COA is also used to create your financial aid package. Small changes to this estimate may or may not result in adjustments to aid depending on Federal/State policies and regulations. UT and other resources may provide financial aid up to your total COA but will not provide financial aid exceeding that amount. Find your estimated COA on the Costs and Tuition calculator. 2021-2022 Estimated Costs The figures below outline the estimated cost of attendance for undergraduate and graduate students to attend UT during the 2021-22 academic year.
