It's hard to think about a company or a job that it doesn't touch and it's always changing." Meet Christopher Wilson The opportunity for undergraduates to research alongside faculty, a benefit often reserved only for graduate students, is a standout bonus for College of Business students. Take Christopher Wilson, a senior studying supply chain and logistics management. He knew he was getting an exciting opportunity to conduct undergraduate research with Professor Zhaohui Wu for the National Association of State Procurement Officials (NASPO). But he didn't quite grasp the scope of the assignment until he was sitting in the kickoff meeting with, as he says, "all the adults." "My expectation at that meeting was that I was the student, and I would be helping them, assisting someone," Wilson said. "But I quickly realized that I was their researcher, expected to supply them with information they didn't have." He also realized while pursuing the major that supply chain is becoming one of the largest industries not only in the U.S., but in international business operations worldwide. Educational partnership Magnate Worldwide, a supply chain management company focused on expedited domestic transportation and global freight forwarding, has partnered with the College of Business to provide supply chain and logistics management students with licensing to SAP University Alliance - ERP. This gives our students access to and training with the industry's leading enterprise resource planning software. " I enjoy challenges, and I love to learn. That desire to learn and solve tough problems has guided me my entire career.
