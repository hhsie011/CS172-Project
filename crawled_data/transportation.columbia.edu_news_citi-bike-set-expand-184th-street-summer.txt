The expansion will provide more sustainable and healthy travel alternatives for those living uptown. Columbia met with the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) during the planning process and advocated to unite the university's Manhattan campuses under the Citi Bike network. Back in March, in response to COVID-19 and the need for transit alternatives for essential workers, Citi Bike expedited an installation at Columbia’s Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) campus. More stations are expected to be installed near CUIMC in the coming weeks, making bike share a great option for intercampus travel this summer as phased reopening begins. View a map of new station locations provided by the NYC Department of Transportation. The new Citi Bike stations will be equipped with both electric pedal assist bikes and traditional bikes. The progress of Citi Bike’s expansion supports the goals outlined in the university’s Sustainability Plan, specifically Columbia's commitments to reduce vehicular traffic and parking congestion.
