Students will also gain the expertise to adapt technology to improve learning outcomes.

Both choices prepare students to integrate technology into the curriculum and lesson planning; know all your technology options, including assistive or augmentative tools; manage hardware and software use for a classroom/lab, building, district or school; and utilize technology to assist all learners with diverse needs and backgrounds. The Instructional Learning Technology Graduate Certificate may be completed in one or two years, depending on whether students take classes full- or part-time. Courses are available in the fall, spring and summer sessions. Who might be interested? Teachers working in early childhood, middle grades, secondary or special education should find that the expertise developed through this program strengthens professional competencies.
