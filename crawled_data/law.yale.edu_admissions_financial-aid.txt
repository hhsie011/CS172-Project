Using a combination of loans and scholarship grants, we make every effort to provide students with the difference between their resources—such as family resources, summer earnings and student savings—and the cost of attending Yale. 76% of our J.D. student body received some form of financial aid in the 2021-2022 academic year, and 64% qualified for Law School scholarship grants, which are awarded solely on the basis of financial need. Using a combination of loans and grants/scholarships, we make every effort to provide students with the difference between their resources (such as family resources, summer earnings, and student savings) and the cost of attending Yale Law School.
