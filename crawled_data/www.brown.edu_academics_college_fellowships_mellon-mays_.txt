The program is named in honor of Dr. Benjamin E. Mays, an educator, scholar, minister, social activist, and former president of Morehouse College. The son of former slaves and an advisor to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Dr. Mays cultivated a unique mentoring style that integrated academic excellence with a concern for social justice. MMUF is funded by a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Since the program's inception in 1992, Brown has supported close to 120 Fellows. Nearly twenty-five Brown MMUF alumni are pursuing doctoral study at Columbia University, University of California at Berkeley, Vanderbilt University, the University of Chicago, the University of Michigan, Yale University, and other institutions. Nationally, more than 700 Fellows, including nearly thirty Brown alumni, have earned doctoral degrees and are now employed at colleges and universities throughout the country -- including Brown!
