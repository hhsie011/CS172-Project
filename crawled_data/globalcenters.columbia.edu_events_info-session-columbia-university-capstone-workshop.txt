We will hold a virtual info session at our office in Beyoğlu with the program directors who are based on Columbia’s campus in New York City. About the Workshop At the School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA) at Columbia University, Capstone workshops are offered as an a opportunity for organizations to work with Masters of International Affairs and Masters of Public Administration students on a policy-oriented consulting project. We seek to partner with organizations that can offer a project that is timely, but not urgent, which can be completed within a four-month period, that is of value both to the organization itself and to the learning experience of students—and produces actionable recommendations, which ideally will be utilized by the client within the near future. Organizations that students work with include public agencies (from the local to national level), international NGOs and multinational organizations, and major firms in the private sector—recent examples include Barclays, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Moody’s, Morgan Stanley, United Nations Development Programme, and the World Bank Group. Suzanne Hollmann is the Director of the Capstone Workshop Program at SIPA where she is responsible for the development of Capstone consulting projects designed to solve public policy challenges across the public, private and non-profit sectors. She is also a Capstone faculty advisor focused on youth engagement and experiential teaching methods in international education and humanitarian response settings. Prior to SIPA, she was a lecturer in Ghana, West Africa for teacher training and development and began her career in education as a Teach for America Corps member in Houston, Texas. She has a Master of Arts in International Education Development, with a focus on education in post conflict countries, from Teachers College, Columbia University and a BA in Sociology and Comparative Literature from Bard College. Eugenia McGill is a Senior Lecturer in the Discipline of International and Public Affairs and the Interim Director of the Economic and Political Development Concentration at SIPA, where she directs the Workshop in Development Practice and teaches courses in Methods for Development Practice and Gender, Politics and Development. Her teaching and research interests include the social impacts of globalization, development interventions and development finance, particularly gender-related impacts, as well as innovative and inclusive approaches to development planning. A lawyer and development specialist, Professor McGill also advises development agencies, governments and nongovernmental organizations on social policy, law and development issues, and on addressing gender and other social concerns through development plans, programs and projects. She has a JD from the University of Pennsylvania, MIA from SIPA, MAT from Northwestern University and BA from Williams College.
