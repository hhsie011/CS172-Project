A diversity of concentrations is offered with strong synergies between the biological and chemical, electrical and computer, energy, materials, and mechanical, operations and systems engineering research areas. Graduate engineering students are expected to propose a plan of study that supports their interests, potentially including distinctive intellectual paths unconstrained by disciplinary boundaries and enriched by interdisciplinary synergies. BME research, carried out at both Thayer School and the Williamson Translational Science Building at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, addresses key challenges in the following sub-areas supported by leading faculty in their fields. On This Page Imaging & Physics Biomaterials & Biomechanics Devices & Diagnostics Molecular Engineering Imaging & Physics Research in imaging and physics focuses on developing medical technologies that help clinicians better detect, diagnose, stage, treat, and monitor patients with a variety of pathologies. There is particular emphasis on improving surgical procedures and creating new surgical tools to improve patient care as well as developing new cancer detection and treatment strategies. Dartmouth also encourages and facilitates efforts toward clinical translation of new imaging and therapy tools.

Davis Solomon G. Diamond Jonathan T. Elliott Xiaoyao Fan Ryan Halter Shudong Jiang Geoffrey P. Luke Paul M. Meaney Ethan K. Murphy Keith D. Paulsen Kimberley S. Samkoe Biomaterials & Biomechanics Biomaterials and biomechanics research at Dartmouth is a collaborative, interdisciplinary effort that combines materials research, engineering design, and biomechanical assessment and modeling in an interactive teaching environment. Research Subfields Cell biomechanics Magnetic resonance elastography Nanoparticles for magnetic hyperthermia Orthopedic implant design and analysis Spinal fusion surgery and image guidance Tissue engineering and biomimetics Researchers Ian Baker Katie Hixon Yan Li Matthew McGarry Keith D. Paulsen Douglas W. Van Citters Devices & Diagnostics Identifying the biomarkers for diseases and developing health-monitoring sensors have the potential to transform health care delivery from a centralized and curative model to a more patient-centric and preventive one, while real-time diagnostics and implantable bionic systems could offer cures involving sensing at the molecular scale. These multi-scale approaches can facilitate precision medicine and point-of-care diagnostics for a variety of global health initiatives. Research Subfields Health informatics Implantable bionic systems Micro- and nano-scale medical systems Neural engineering ‘Omics biomarkers for diseases Wearable integrated circuit sensor devices Researchers Petr Brůža Jonathan T. Elliott Hui Fang Ryan Halter Elizabeth L. Murnane Kofi M. Odame Rahul Sarpeshkar Fridon Shubitidze Douglas W. Van Citters John X.J. Zhang Molecular Engineering Research in molecular engineering applies fundamental engineering principles utilizing protein evolution, molecular biology, and mathematical modeling. High performance biotherapeutics can be engineered by optimizing molecular recognition, signaling, or catalysis, and in the case of immunoglobulins, knowledge of how immune repertoires and responses impact health and disease drives the design of next generation antibody therapies, vaccines, and other biologics.
