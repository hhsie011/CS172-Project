The Center is especially focused on Latin America and its Miami diaspora. The Center’s projects are geared to discovering communication’s contribution to accelerated, but sustainable, participatory change. While the application of new media in support of positive change is a special interest of the Center, all forms of communication and their influence are embraced by the Center and its projects. Indeed, collaboration across content areas, methodological orientations, and platforms of expression is the hallmark of the Center. The Center is committed to the best practices of formative and evaluative research. Thus, each creative project is grounded in data that guide its concept, design, launch, and implementation, and is evaluated against communication and social/ behavior change objectives derived from these data. The Center provides opportunities for faculty and students engaged in scholarship and creative activity to work together in mutually reinforcing ways.
