Contact UW-IT About UW-IT 3D Printing & Consultation October 2021 update: 3D printing services are not offered at this time due to staffing and resource priorities. Please check back in future quarters. The Computer Vet on the second floor of Odegaard is piloting a free service to help students explore the world of 3D printing in a supportive learning environment. Our goal is to help you experience 3D printing in a supported environment to build your confidence for using other 3D printers on campus for your larger projects. Sign up for a 4-hour block of consultation/printing time, and our consultants will help you get a print started. Each person is limited to a maximum of two appointments per quarter. You can: bring a file that’s ready to go* get help finding a workable file on thingiverse print one of our pre-selected items: Plan to stay at the Help Desk long enough to get the print started, about 30-45 minutes. You may return to pick up your print at the end of your reservation time. *If you are bringing your own file, please note: It may be necessary to modify the size and settings of your file to ensure it will finish within the allotted time and to maximize the chances of a successful print. Objects should not contain extreme angles or have overhangs, as shown in the following examples: Avoid objects with moving parts or requiring pieces to snap together, such as the items pictured below. They may not print successfully. Examples of successful projects: Schedule: Appointments are available Monday through Friday, 10:30 am to 2:30 pm; and Monday through Thursday, 3 pm to 7 pm.
