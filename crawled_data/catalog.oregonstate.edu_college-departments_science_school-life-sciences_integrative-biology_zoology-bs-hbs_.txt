Administered by the Department of Integrative Biology under the School of Life Sciences. The Zoology major offers scientific training in the diversity, organismal biology, ecology, and evolution of animals. The major core provides a solid foundation in the biological sciences while electives allow students to cater course work to meet specific interests in animal biology. Undergraduate research, internship, teaching and study abroad experience are strongly recommended, and credits can be integrated with major requirements. Zoology majors enter such varied fields as animal care and husbandry, curatorial and museum management, laboratory animal research, field biology and conservation, and environmental management and policy. The Zoology major is not suitable for pre-veterinary medicine students as it does not include the required prerequisite course work (see the option in Pre-Veterinary Medicine in the Biology major). Major Code: 620 Explain and apply the fundamental concepts of the zoological sciences including these four disciplinary areas: Animal diversity; Ecology and Evolution; Organismal Biology; and, Cell Biology and Genetics. Explain and apply the fundamental concepts of animal diversity. Explain and apply the fundamental concepts of ecology and evolution. Explain and apply the fundamental concepts of organismal biology Explain and apply the fundamental concepts of cell biology and genetics. Apply the process of science. Apply the process of science through accessing primary literature, identifying relevant works for a particular topic, and evaluating the scientific content of these works. Apply the process of science through formulating testable hypotheses based on observation, gathering data to address these hypotheses and analyzing those data to assess the degree to which their hypothesis is supported. Employing fundamental quantitative and statistical principles to present and critique scientific findings. Communicate scientific information through effective formal and informal writing and speaking in a format used by practicing scientists. Integrate and analyze information across levels of organization ranging from cells to ecosystems within the zoological sciences to formulate arguments and critically evaluate scientific claims. Conduct background research and apply fundamental zoological science principles to make informed decisions on socio-scientific issues. Students in the Biology major must complete BI 221 or BI 221H, BI 222 or BI 222H, and BI 223 or BI 223H with a C– or better to continue on to upper-division Biology (BI) and Zoology (Z) coursework. Students must also complete their General Chemistry series and CH 331 with a C– in each term to move on to other Chemistry (CH) coursework. Students majoring in Biology, BioHealth Sciences, Fisheries and Wildlife Sciences, or Zoology cannot seek a dual or double major in any combination of these four majors. Zoology majors cannot seek the Biology minor. For further information, see MyDegrees or the Integrative Biology website.
