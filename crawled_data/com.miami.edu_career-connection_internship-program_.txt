It is also possible for students to intern in their hometown during the summer. This program is designed to provide students with quality career related work experience prior to graduation. They can arrange the work hours to accommodate their academic schedule. One of the advantages of attending the University of Miami School of Communication is the city itself. South Florida offers a wealth of internship opportunities in journalism, Motion Picture, broadcasting, public relations, advertising, and others. For Internships, contact Luis Herrera in the School of Communication (Wolfson Bldg., 2037), 305-284-5234, lherrera@miami.edu Why An Internship? Ten years ago, internships were the exception, not the norm. Now it is rare to see a graduating student who does not have at least one internship under his or her belt. As students pursue an academic program in their chosen discipline, practical experience is an invaluable part of their education. Internships allow students to gain “real-world” experience and exposure to a specific industry. An internship also adds to a student’s resume and portfolio. Most importantly, approximately 35% of internships lead to jobs, directly or indirectly. Internships may be paid or unpaid. Students who wish to receive academic credit for the internships must seek approval and meet the requirements from the academic program in which they are in. There is no guarantee that students who are seeking internships will be hired. A student’s major, GPA, skills, resume, and other factors will influence his/her candidacy. How to Find an Internship? Internships are widely available. There are at least five different opportunities listed in the School of Communication internship binders for every student looking. Regularly stop by Wolfson 2037 to find out about new job opportunities and internships. Also, take advantage of the Career Library. Learn about market trends and who are the leaders in your industry. Attend Career Fairs. Bring copies of your resume and dress in business attire…. casual talk can turn into an interview! Internship Requirements To take an internship for academic credit, students must be at least a junior (60 hours completed) and must have a cumulative GPA of 2.5 in the major. Students must also have completed one course in the area of the proposed internship. The Internship Coordinator in the academic program will make determination of these qualifications. Students are responsible for identifying their internships. For assistance regarding the process and additional information, an appointment should be made with your Internship Coordinator or the Director of Student Services. A typical internship lasts one semester with a requirement of 10-20 hours per week. To receive credit for an internship, please see the following professors: Advertising – Dr. Alyse Lancaster, WCB 3013 Broadcast Journalism – Prof. Sam Terilli, WCB 2015 Communication Studies – Dr. Shara Pavlow, WCB 3006 Electronic Media – Prof. Sam Terilli, WCB 2015 Interactive Media – Prof. Zeven Rodriguez, WCB 2014 Media Management – Prof. Sam Terilli, WCB 2015 Motion Pictures – Prof. Jeffrey Stern, WCB 4017 Print Journalism – Prof. Sam Terilli, WCB 2015 Public Relations – Dr. Maria Scott, WCB 3022 Tips for a Successful Internship Experience and learn! Expose yourself to different career options before graduation. Learn about yourself. Choose the career path that will best fit your professional goals and personal values. When submitting a resume, letter, and any other information or application form an employer request, follow-up! Whoever shows they want the internship the most, is usually the one that gets it. Remember that you will be judged by your actions during the search. Be focused and professional in all written, oral, or personal contact with employers. Don’t be afraid to ask if a company will accept an intern, even if they’ve never had one before. Ask questions, answer questions honestly, and be yourself at all times. An internship is a mutual learning experience for both the intern and the employer. When you have the internship, raise above expectations! Maximize your learning experience as an intern and maybe you will get a job with the organization in the future. Keep your resume updated at all times! You never know when opportunities will knock on your door.
