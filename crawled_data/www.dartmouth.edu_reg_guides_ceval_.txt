It is designed so that no one's identity may be tracked. All students complete the assessment for most courses, excluding Off-campus, Independent Study, Honors, Research and Thesis courses. Students are required to assess all eligible courses each term before they may view grades online. Some faculty have opted-in to allow students to view a subset of responses to their course assessments, which includes three (3) student-initiated questions.
