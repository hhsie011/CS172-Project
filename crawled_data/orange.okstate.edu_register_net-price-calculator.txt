Price information reflects the estimated 2022-2023 aid year cost of attendance.

The Estimated Cost of Attendance includes estimated tuition and fees; on-campus room and board (or a housing and food allowance for off-campus students); and allowances for books, supplies and transportation. Expected Family Contribution is a measure of a family's financial strength and is estimated using the information provided in this calculator.

Your "Estimated Net Price" is calculated based on the information you provided. This Net Price Calculator gives estimates of your cost of attendance and net price. These estimates do not represent a final determination or actual award of financial assistance or the final net price. Any estimates calculated will not be guaranteed by the Secretary of Education, the state or the school. Oklahoma State University has the final authority on determining the financial aid award. For the academic year 2016-2017, 83% of first-time, full-time students at Oklahoma State University received grant/scholarship aid. While all care has been taken to produce estimates that are accurate based on the information provided to us by the student or user, cost of attendance and financial aid availability is subject to change without notice. Any future changes made by the federal government, state agencies, or institution could result in a different award. Also, any outside/private scholarship or financial assistance may reduce your aid award. Students must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) in order to determine their eligibility for, and receive an actual financial aid award that includes federal grant, loan, and work-study assistance.
