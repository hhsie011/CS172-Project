At Cornell, gender identity refers to an individual’s internal sense of gender. A person’s gender identity may be different from or the same as the person’s sex assigned at birth. Cornell's restroom and facilities use guidelines are unchanged by the recent actions of the federal government. Cornell is committed to our ongoing initiatives underway at the university to continue to advance protections for the LGBTQ+ community. The University maintains a number of universal restrooms across campus. All-gender, accessible spaces, may include amenities for families such as baby changing stations.
