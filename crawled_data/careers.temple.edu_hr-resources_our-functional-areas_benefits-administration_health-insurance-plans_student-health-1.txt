It is a supplemental policy that only covers injuries that result from an accident while performing required academic activities. These include injuries such as needle sticks, sharp injuries and cuts. The policy coordinates the payments made from your health insurance. The claims administrator of this policy is A-G Administrators, Inc. Specific students enrolled in the College of Public Health professions, School of Dentistry, School of Medicine, School of Podiatric Medicine upperclass and School of Pharmacy students are automatically enrolled in the accident insurance policy. If you sustain an injury as a result of a required academic activity, you must submit a claim under the student accident policy. To file a claim, you will need to complete a claim form making sure to provide information about your health insurance. Claim forms that are missing information will delay the claim process. If necessary, A-G Administrators, Inc. will write to you directly to request additional confidential health information. The claim form must be submitted within 30 days of the injury date. All claim forms must be submitted via mail or fax directly to A-G Administrators, Inc. Plan Documents See the plan documents for the Accident Insurance Policy.
