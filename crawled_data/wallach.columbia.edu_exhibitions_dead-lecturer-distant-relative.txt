It gathers together works by artists and writers whose approaches to abstraction either originated or developed at a remove from discourses of representation and resistance associated with the social movements of the 1960s and 70s. Drawing on a multifarious archive of refusal to prevailing modes of political and perceptual recognition and visibility, the exhibition asks what it means to make work without the promise of a world to receive it. Featured artists include Shusaku Arakawa, Beauford Delaney, Ted Kurahara, George Miyasaki, Martin Puryear, Kay Sekimachi, Thomas Sills, and Jack Whitten, among others.
