Carter Brown Architecture Lectures Performances Workshops Blog Gallery The Center for Public Humanities welcomes proposals for exhibits that examine the intersections of history, visual and performing art, technology, culture and politics. Exhibition spaces within the Nightingale-Brown House include the Carriage House Gallery (475 sf), the Garage Galleries (530 sf) and the Hallway display space (14 feet of wall for 2d graphics and a 3’ x 5’ cabinet appropriate for small objects or framed images). While exhibitions may range from a few days to a few months, most exhibitions at the Center for Public Humanities are installed for 4-6 weeks. Please note that the Carriage House and Garage Galleries do not provide museum-quality security or climate control and that the Hallway is exposed to high levels of UV light. To get more information about use of the galleries, please read this informational sheet. Exhibition proposals may be submitted here on a rolling basis, but as a guideline should be received at least 8 weeks prior to the proposed exhibition installation date. Please contact Ron Potvin, Curator, with any questions. During 2018-2019 academic year, in addition to the Carriage House Gallery, the display case in the hallway outside the lecture room will host Tiny Exhibits. Learn more about Tiny Exhibits, a rotating installation series curated by Public Humanities MA students, and submit a proposal here.
