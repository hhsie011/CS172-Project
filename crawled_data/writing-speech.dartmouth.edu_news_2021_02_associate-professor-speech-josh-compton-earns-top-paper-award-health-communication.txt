That combination gives us hope.Josh Compton “ Share Associate Professor of Speech Josh Compton earns top paper award in Health Communication Posted on February 09, 2021 by Liz Mackey Alicia Mason of Pittsburg State University and Josh Compton of Dartmouth College were awarded a "Top Four Paper" distinction by the Health Communication Interest Group of the Central States Communication Association for their research, Severity, susceptibility, efficacy, certainty and salience: Insights from early-stage "vestedness" of Midwestern populations toward the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The paper will be presented at a virtual conference in March. PreviousNext In their study, Mason and Compton examine the efficacy of public health risk information messages during the COVID-19 global pandemic. They confirmed that younger people saw COVID-19 differently than the ways older people saw COVID-19 during the early days of the pandemic. Based on their findings, Mason and Compton reason that health campaigns should take special care to tailor messages for different audiences based on how they see the severity of COVID-19 and their susceptibility to it. One messaging strategy that seems to hold particular promise, they suggest, is inoculation theory. Inoculation theory explains how people can be made more resistant to misunderstandings. The theory has been used to guide successful health communication campaigns, and one of its unique benefits is that it can boost people's perception of their "vestedness," or involvement, with a topic. "It's an exciting idea, isn't it? That we might be able to harness a messaging strategy based on the biological processes of inoculation—inoculation theory—to help meet the challenges of an actual virus," Compton said. Mason and Compton are now at work on a companion piece to their study. They are looking at how knowledge about COVID-19 plays a role in how people think and feel about COVID-19, and how this information might also inform better health campaign strategies. "Maybe we can inoculate against COVID-19 and against misunderstandings about COVID-19," Compton said. "That combination gives us hope."

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Institute for Writing and Rhetoric Philosophy & Aims About Writing at Dartmouth Speech at Dartmouth Our Stories The Story of Writing Instruction at Dartmouth The Story of Speech at Dartmouth The Story of Writing Support at Dartmouth Curriculum Overview Writing Courses Writing 2-3 WRIT 5 First-Year Seminars Humanities 1-2 Speech Courses Speech 20 Speech 25 Speech 26 Speech 27 Speech 30 Speech 31 Speech 33 Speech 34 Speech 36 Speech 37 Speech 40 Placement and Enrollment Policies First-Year Writing & First-Year Seminar Requirements Differences Among First-Year Writing Courses FAQ Directed Self-Placement Process for Writing Registration for Writing 5 or Writing 2-3 Registration for First Year Seminars FAQ First-year Writing Registration First-year Writing Choices Prizes Writing Prize Winners Speech Contest Winners Speech Contest Call for Entries Learning Overview Writing Center Make an Appointment Materials Sources and Citations at Dartmouth Teaching Overview Guidelines Teaching Writing in the First Year Expectations for Writing 2-3 Expectations for Writing 5 Teaching the First-Year Seminar First-Year Writing: Pedagogies, Methods, & Design Active Learning in the First-Year Writing Classroom Syllabus and Assignment Design Teaching Writing as Process Integrating Reading and Writing Diagnosing and Responding to Student Writing Conducting Writing Workshops Collaborative Learning/Learning with Peers Teaching Argument Teaching Research Addressing Grammar Useful links Support The Writing Assistant Program Research Past Research Activities Research Overview Multilingual Overview Support for Undergraduate Students Support for Graduate Students Faculty Support News & People People News Employment Upcoming Events Past Events My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
