Events that are open typically require advance registration. Registration may sometimes take place at the event itself. If in doubt, contact the Office of Communications and Public Affairs. To gain access, the media must agree to comply with these policies and must display valid credentials. Media who have not registered will not be permitted access. Student groups who wish to allow external media access to campus events should first consult their group advisor or the dean of students of their school and participate in the advance event review process. Media attending events must remain seated in a designated section unless permission is given to move elsewhere. Media are not allowed inside classrooms, libraries, dormitories, or other interior spaces unless special permission is granted in advance by the Office of Communications and Public Affairs as well as the Office of Public Safety. 212-854-5573 [email protected] Contact Us [email protected] Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University Â©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
