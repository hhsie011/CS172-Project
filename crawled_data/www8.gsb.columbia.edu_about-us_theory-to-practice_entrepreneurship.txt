Our courses will teach you to emphasize your individual initiative and bring those skills to bear on any business path you choose. The MBA program focuses on identifying, valuing, and capturing opportunity. Virtually all business leaders will depend on these skills, whether as entrepreneurs, consultants, financiers, or CEOs. Many entrepreneurs who got their start at Columbia are now building successful companies from the ground up. If you are looking to launch your own venture, the Eugene Lang Entrepreneurship Center is there to provide hands-on guidance and support during a student's academic career and beyond through initiatives like the Columbia Startup Lab, a new co-working space and entrepreneurship program for first-year alumni. Located in Soho, the lab engages faculty advisors and mentors and hosts events to help students successfully launch and grow their businesses after graduation.
