Graduates understand the production, distribution, and use of textiles and apparel, aesthetic expression, and communication. They are prepared to plan, develop, source and present textile and apparel products to meet the needs of consumers. Students understand the issues involved in textile and apparel production and marketing, both nationally and internationally. The AMD major provides a broad-based program of study with flexibility in creating an individualized program.

An option in creative and technical design is appropriate for those interested in the aesthetic and creative aspects of design, technical design, costuming, textile design, and product development. The fashion communications option prepares students for the development and delivery of visual, written, and oral communication. Career opportunities are in visual merchandising, styling, fashion influencing, social media, and communication. An option in product development and innovation is appropriate for those interested in developing innovative products for special markets including accessories, footwear, performance wear, smart textiles, functional apparel, and soft-goods for home. Career opportunities include designer, materials testing, quality assurance, and technical design. The product management and sourcing option is appropriate for those interested in both line planning, product development, and merchandising products or lines for consumer groups, sourcing, quality assurance, and manufacturing. An option in merchandising and retail analytics prepares students for the planning, promotion, and presentation of market-oriented product lines and events. Career opportunities are in buying, promotion, sales, product development, branding, and management in both manufacturing and retailing sectors with a focus on the textile and apparel industry. ***Instead of a portfolio review for admission, students in the creative and technical design option have a review of their first year design skills (AMD 206 Design Selective Advancement) after completing AMD 121 Apparel Assembly, AMD 131 Overview of the Fashion Industry, AMD 178 Introduction to Fashion Design Studio, and AMD 204 Textile Science. The AMD 206 Design Selective Advancement project is scored by design industry professionals and determines if/when students move forward into the creative and technical design option.

JUSTICE MINOR The Fashion, Culture, History, and Social Justice minor will benefit emerging professionals and future leaders entering the fashion, museum, or other related industries become more critical people in regards to fashion, appearance, clothing, history, and identity. Examples of a few job titles that this minor would benefit include museum curator, collections manager, research associate, chief diversity officer, human resource roles, designers, merchandisers, product developers, and/or marketing managers.

As students enter the workforce with a social justice background, they can better understand and work with others who are different from them. Additionally, having a better understanding of diverse consumers could help provide these consumers with the products they desire, in addition to avoiding public diversity issues that are far too common in the fashion industry.
