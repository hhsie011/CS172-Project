Shaded by flowering greenery, winding footpaths lined with perennials and shrubs take visitors through works of primarily American twentieth and twenty-first century sculpture. Ranging in size and material, this collection of artwork represents the diverse character of modern and contemporary sculpture in a natural, accessible setting. The university’s first president Adonijah Welch (1821-1889; President 1868-83) envisioned a picturesque campus: a graceful road encircling the college’s majestic buildings, an assortment of trees sprinkled throughout providing shade, a vast lawn of green grass, and flowers tickling noses with sweet fragrances. Today, the iconic 22-acre greenspace is still at the heart of Iowa State, which has been named one of the most beautiful college campuses in the world. The Elizabeth and Byron Anderson Sculpture Garden is located just northwest of central campus and furthers the longstanding dedication of public art at Iowa State University. The Elizabeth and Byron Anderson Sculpture Garden is given to Iowa State University by Elizabeth Anderson in memory of her husband, Byron.
