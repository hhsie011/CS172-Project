In selecting candidates to review for interviews, an applicant must have a minimum 2.9 overall GPA and a minimum 2.9 science GPA. Grades will not be factored after meeting these minimum standards when selecting students for interview or acceptance. Interview invitations will go out mid-December 2021. Once applicants are granted an interview, factors other than grades will be used for the selection of candidates, such as likelihood of service to rural and regional Texas, personal attributes, life experience, and meeting the mission and fostering the core values of the SVM. We will be conducting in-person interviews for the Fall 2022 admissions cycle in January 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th, 2022. Notification of interview will be sent to qualified applicants through the TTU SVM application portal (https://vetschool.admissions.ttu.edu/). Once invited for an interview, applicants can select their preferred interview date. Please know that the TTU SVM Admissions Office will do their best to accommodate all preferred interview dates, but it is not a guarantee applicants will receive their preferred interview date. The interview structure will be a relaxed format of Multi Mini Interviews (MMI). Interview days will begin with a 45 minute orientation and faculty introductions. Applicants then will go through a series of three 20 minute stations. All interviews will be conducted on the TTU SVM Main Campus. Applicants will be notified of acceptance to TTU SVM by the first week of March. Applicants will need to confirm acceptance by April 15th, 2022 and pay a seat fee (non-refundable matriculation fee) of $500.00 that will be applied to the 1st semester tuition.
