Your interviewing schedule will take place in the newly renovated Dunlap Success Center with assistance by our friendly staff. By recruiting on campus, you will not only create connections with our students, but also with our faculty, administration, and staff, and increase your company’s visibility at FSU. The Employer Relations and Recruitment Services team encourages on-campus recruiting in the fall (end of September through November) and spring (February through April). Interviews can be scheduled for on-campus or virtual. Virtual Interviews & In-Person Interview Locations Virtual Interviews: Virtual interviews can take place with the virtual platform of your choice depending on what your organization it utilizing in this virtual environment. Students are familiar with Zoom, WebEx, Teams, and other proprietary virtual platforms. NoleNetwork will be utilized to schedule the interviews with students. In-Person Interviews: In-person interviews are located in the Dunlap Success Center (DSC) at 100 South Woodward Avenue in one of our interview suites. Our interview rooms are on the third floor, and interviews are held between 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. Review Your Scheduling Options The Career Center uses NoleNetwork, powered by Symplicity, to coordinate and manage all recruiting schedules. Students will submit resumes and sign up for interviews directly through NoleNetwork and can be selected for interviews either through three types of schedules: Preselect, Open or Room Only. Preselect Schedules: Allows you to choose the students you want to interview. Students will submit their resumes for consideration to your schedule/position then you will have the opportunity to select the students you want to interview. Open Schedules: You will set your criteria for the positions (major, degree, graduation date, and GPA), and then any student who matches those will be able to automatically sign up for an interview slot. Students who do not match 100% of the criteria you set will be placed in a holding bin for your review. Room Only: Held in conjunction with our various career fairs or if you are building a schedule based on a job posting, information session or other networking opportunity. We will reserve your space, but you will craft your entire schedule prior to the visit. We require a copy of the schedule the morning of your interviews. Note: Room Only schedules are not available for virtual interviews. NoleNetwork for Interviews!

Changing or Canceling Schedules Changes and/or cancellations to scheduled date(s) or recruiting requirements will be accommodated if they are made at least three weeks prior to your recruiting date(s). Cancellations during this period are still accepted, and no further action is necessary. To make a change or cancellation, please call the Senior Assistant Director for Employer Relations & Recruitment Services at 850.644.6493 as soon as possible Changes made less than three weeks prior to your recruiting date(s) will not give adequate time for publicity and may result in a less effective recruiting visit. Once the appointments are scheduled two weeks prior to your recruiting date, we feel that the commitment to honor those arrangements rests equally with candidates and employers. Therefore, changes by the employer resulting in cancellation of appointments should be followed by letters or emails from your organization to the candidates. Resumes can be obtained through NoleNetwork to facilitate this courteous contact. Candidates are bound to the same courtesy's they must write a letter of explanation if they do not give adequate notice of cancellation or do not appear for an interview. In fact, in some cases, students may be banned from further on-campus interviewing for missing scheduled interviews.
