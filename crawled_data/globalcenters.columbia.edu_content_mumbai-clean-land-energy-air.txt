In a lecture on January 15, 2019 at Columbia Global Centers | Mumbai, Professor V. Faye McNeill, Professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering at Columbia University discussed the state of air pollution in Mumbai, sources of air pollution indoors and outdoors, its impacts on our health, and challenges and opportunities for clearing the air. This lecture was part of the Urban Works Innovation Challenge 2018-2019. Read more ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Air Pollution and India's Burden of Health “Outdoor air pollution is the second leading risk factor for mortality in India. Nearly one million lives are lost prematurely in India to air pollution,” said Dr. Alexandra Karambelas, Postdoctoral Research Fellow, The Earth Institute, Columbia University. She was speaking at a public lecture organized by Columbia Global Centers | Mumbai on May 29, 2018, which drew linkages between energy emissions, air quality and health outcomes and emphasized the need for better monitoring of air quality in India in order to draw up appropriate mitigation strategies.

One thing that clearly emerges from years of research is that we need to put an end to open dumping. Evidence for this argument was presented by Dr. Athanasios Bourtsalas, Adjunct Professor at the Earth and Environmental Engineering Department, Columbia University, and the Manager of the Earth Engineering Centre-Columbia (EEC), at a Lecture and Discussion organized by Columbia Global Centers | Mumbai on April 17, 2017.

Rapid economic development is exacerbating conditions of poor air quality in Indian cities. Sources of emissions include coal-fired power plants, industry, vehicles, and biomass burning, which contribute to harmful air pollutants and greenhouse gases. An interdisciplinary science-base is needed to identify approaches that will be effective for improving air quality. Under a PGIF Project awarded to Professor Ruth DeFries, the Center facilitated a workshop in February 2016 as a planning activity to initiate long-term collaborations, joint projects, and student exchanges, bringing together an interdisciplinary group of scientists from public health, atmospheric chemistry, and atmospheric transport modelling. ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Electricity Distribution in India: Challenges and Opportunities for Reform An efficient, resilient, and financially robust power sector is essential for India's growth and poverty reduction. Yet many parts of the country have poor availability and quality of power. Nearly 250 million Indians live without electricity. The needs of consumers and enterprises in urban areas differ from rural ones. The power industry and experts recognize that the key to reforming the entire utility lies in electricity distribution. Columbia Global Centers | Mumbai organized a lecture by Professor Vijay Modi on January 20, 2016 at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay in partnership with its Department of Energy Science and Engineering. The talk identified bottlenecks that energy distribution agencies face in India and advocated for accelerating reforms at this stage as a way for improving the entire grid.
