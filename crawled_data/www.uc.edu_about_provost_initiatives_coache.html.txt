To better understand the needs of our faculty, the University of Cincinnati (UC) has partnered with Collaborative on Academic Careers in Higher Education (COACHE). For more than 10 years, COACHE has worked with more than 250 academic institutions to survey faculty and identify themes associated with faculty satisfaction. UC faculty completed the COACHE Faculty Job Satisfaction Survey in the Spring of 2018. Results were received and reviewed by the COACHE Executive Team in the Fall of 2018. Results presented three areas of strength and three areas for development. According to the faculty, our strengths are departmental collegiality, faculty leadership, and tenure policies. Areas for development include departmental leadership, interdisciplinary work, and mentoring. During the spring 2019 semester, through a peer and self-nominated process, six working groups were formed that corresponded to our three areas of strength and three areas for development. These groups reviewed the COACHE quantitative and qualitative data in detail, conducted follow up interviews, and benchmarked practices at our peer institutions to create a set of recommendations that were presented to Provost Nelson, Vice Provost Serra, and the COACHE Executive Team in May 2019. Visit the Collaborative on Academic Careers in Higher Education website to learn more. New Initiatives Support Teaching, Research and Service Informed by faculty input through the COACHE Faculty Job Satisfaction Survey, and UC Women Lead's 2019 faculty project, the Office of the Provost is implementing new strategic initiatives to support faculty in teaching, research and service.
