However, the following may be useful if you are asked to submit a GPA as part of an application. Step 1: Convert letter grades to points using this scale. A+ = 4.0 (4.3 prior to 2000-2001) A = 4.0 A- = 3.7 B+ = 3.3 B = 3.0 B- = 2.7 C+ = 2.3 C = 2.0 C- = 1.7 D = 1.0 F = 0 Step 2: Identify the semester hours for each course, as follows. Regular courses: 4 semester hours GER 1025, FRE 1027, ITA 1027, and SPA 1027: 8 semester hours Senior Thesis: 8 semester hours Independent work: 4 semester hours for each term (If reported only in the spring for a year-long project, it equals 8 semester hours. ) Senior Departmental Exam: 0 semester hours Step 3: Calculate your GPA. Calculate points by course: Multiply the point value of each course with a final grade of A+ through F by its number of semester hours. Example: An A (four points) in a regular course (4 semester hours), equals 16 total points. An A in GER 1025 (8 semester hours) equals 32 points. Tally and divide: To calculate your GPA, add the points for all courses taken and divide by the total number of semester hours. Do not include courses graded AUD, P, Inc, or W.
