In response to the growing diversity and demographic changes in the state and in the nation, OSU is committed to preparing graduates to live and work in a culturally pluralistic world. The Graduate College is proud of the diversity of its graduate student population and of their contributions to both the generation and dissemination of new knowledge through their involvement in the University’s research and instructional programs. Numerous multicultural student organizations on campus provide information and support to international and diverse students to assist in the successful completion of their graduate studies. 1.2 The Graduate College. The Graduate College supervises all graduate work offered by OSU, including graduate degree programs at OSU–Stillwater, OSU–Tulsa, OSU Center for Health Sciences in Tulsa and OSU College of Veterinary Medicine in Stillwater. Professional degrees offered through the College of Veterinary Medicine and the Center for Health Sciences in Tulsa are not under the Graduate College. The Graduate College sets standards for admission to graduate standing and recommends to the Board of Regents those students who have completed work required for earning graduate degrees. In addition, the Graduate College offers a number of student services and professional preparation opportunities specifically designed for graduate student success while at OSU as well as after graduation. These activities include graduate teaching assistant orientation programs, three-minute oral communication competitions and thesis/dissertation writing workshops. 1.3 Graduate College Memberships. The Graduate College is a member of the Council of Graduate Schools (CGS), the Conference of Southern Graduate Schools (CSGS) and the Midwestern Association of Graduate Schools (MAGS). 1.4 Organization of the Graduate College. Consistent with its objective of maintaining the highest standards in graduate education, the Graduate College administers the policies and procedures specified and established by the Graduate Faculty, Graduate Council, Board of Regents for the Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical Colleges and the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education. The dean of the Graduate College is the senior administrator of the College as well as the dean for graduate students. The Graduate Council is the executive committee of the Graduate Faculty; it is elected by the Graduate Faculty to work with the dean of the Graduate College in the development and administration of applicable policy. The Graduate Council formulates and reviews policies concerning the conduct of graduate study at OSU, and Council members participate in the periodic review of graduate programs. All proposed policies and requests related to the initiation and development of graduate curricular offerings and programs are referred to the Graduate Council for review, comment and approval. 1.5 Accreditation. OSU is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission, (HLC) of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. (HLC, 30 N. LaSalle Street, Suite 2400, Chicago, IL 60602-2504; ph 1-800-621-7440; www.hlcommission.org). Several programs within the disciplinary colleges are also accredited by other agencies; see "Accreditation" in “The University” section of the Catalog. 1.6 General Regulation. Full authority on all academic decisions within the Graduate College rests with the dean of the Graduate College. The Graduate College policies and procedures described in the Catalog are for informational purposes. They are subject to regular review and may be revised at any time by the dean of the Graduate College in consultation with the Graduate Council. 1.7 Responsibilities. All graduate students are expected to read and to comply with the written regulations of their graduate programs and disciplinary college as well as the Graduate College and University. The regulations presented in the Catalog may be supplemented by written departmental or program requirements available at departmental offices and/or websites. Admission to a specific graduate program obligates the student to understand and adhere to the policies of that program. General regulations in the following sections relate to requirements for admission, enrollment and academic standing. Subsequent sections outline requirements for the following credentials: Graduate Certificate, Master’s, Specialist in Education, Doctor of Education, and Doctor of Philosophy degrees. Particular attention should be given to timing and substantive requirements for matriculation, especially admission, the Plan of Study, residency, language proficiency, research, dissertation/thesis/creative component/report, and graduation. The regulations are prescribed by the Graduate Council with the intent of assuring high-quality graduate programs and effective interaction of Graduate Faculty members and graduate students. 1.8 Email as Official Correspondence. OSU uses the institutional O-Key email address as an official means of communication with OSU faculty, staff, administrators, and students. All students have an official OSU email address that is activated when they set up their O-Key account. Students are expected to activate and check their OSU email on a frequent and consistent basis to remain informed of their official University business and are expected to ensure that adequate email space is available to receive messages. 1.9 Tuition and Fees. Refer to the "Tuition, Fees and Cost Estimates” section of the Catalog. 1.10 Exception Requests. Any request for a waiver of, exception to, or deviation from, any requirement set forth in the “Graduate College” section of the Catalog must be in the form of a written petition to the dean of the Graduate College.

The Graduate and Professional Student Government Association (GPSGA) is an official advisory body to the University President and dean of the Graduate College and serves as the representative voice for graduate and professional students at OSU. Its mission is to improve all aspects of post-graduate education and student life at OSU. The Association provides for representation from each graduate and professional degree program. Representatives are nominated by the graduate programs with membership conferred by the GPSGA president. Each representative is appointed for a term of one year; a representative must be in good academic standing and is enrolled full time. The GPSGA provides funds for graduate and professional student organizations and in collaboration with the Graduate College, travel grants to help students defray costs incurred by attending and presenting at professional meetings. For more information consult gpsga.okstate.edu. 3.0 Funding Your Graduate Education 3.1 General Financial Aid. One of the most common sources of funding for graduate students is graduate assistantships. Graduate teaching and research assistantships (GTAs/GRAs) support OSU’s instructional and scholarly activities. Most academic programs routinely evaluate graduate admission applications not only for admission consideration but also for the possibility of assistantship offers. The graduate program makes assistantship offers. These awards assist students in paying for their graduate education and also offer opportunities to gain valuable skills and experience in their discipline and as a professional. 3.2 Office of the Bursar Payment Plan OSU offers enrolled students a semester-based payment option, as an alternative to the traditional lump-sum payment method. This plan allows for University-billed expenses to be paid in regular monthly installment without a finance charges. The plan has a $25 application fee and additional information can be found at https://bursar.okstate.edu/payment-option-plan. 3.3 Federal Financial Aid. All domestic students who want to qualify for federal financial aid should complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Students are encouraged to complete the FAFSA annually as soon after October 1 as possible to receive aid for the subsequent academic year. The FAFSA is available at www.fafsa.ed.gov. 3.4 OSU Short-Term Emergency Loans. In addition to potential federal loans that may be awarded, OSU assists students in need of immediate funds through the Short-Term Emergency Loan Program. This program is designed to help OSU students who are currently enrolled and attending classes to meet educationally-related off-campus unexpected expenses. The program is not designed to pay a debt owed to OSU. Qualified students may borrow up to $500 less a $10 service charge one time per semester. Additional information about the Short-Term Emergency Loan Program can be found at https://financialaid.okstate.edu/aid/loans/stl. 3.5 Graduate Assistantships. OSU recognizes two types of graduate assistants for students enrolled in master's, specialist and doctoral degree programs. Graduate certificate seeking only and non-degree seeking students are not eligible for GTA or GRA positions or associated benefits. A Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) must be admitted to and meet the requirements of the Graduate College, be fully admitted to a graduate degree program, enrolled, and be under the supervision of an appropriate graduate faculty member. In consultation with the supervisor, the GTA works to gain instructional skills and an increased understanding of the discipline. The GTA is provided a stipend and their primary responsibilities are to support the University’s instructional mission. Services provided by a GTA may include: classroom or laboratory teaching; advising and mentoring of students; proctoring examinations; grading papers, homework, and/or projects; accompanying/coaching musical or vocal performances, providing artistic instruction or assisting with preparation and management of materials and programs that are utilized in imparting knowledge or in the instructional process; or providing other general assistance in the instruction process. A GTA may be assigned primary responsibilities in an extension, outreach or service role for which those responsibilities support the instructional mission of the University. GTAs may not be given duties to support faculty research or those primarily clerical in nature. A Graduate Research Assistant (GRA) must be admitted to and meet the requirements of the Graduate College, be fully admitted to a graduate degree program, enrolled, and be under the supervision of an appropriate graduate faculty member. A GRA is provided a stipend and their primary responsibilities are to provide general support to the University’s research mission. These responsibilities may or may not relate directly to the student’s thesis or dissertation. Duties of the GRA primarily involve applying and mastering research concepts, practices or methods of scholarship. Services provided by a GRA may include: assisting faculty members in a research or creative activity; perform degree-related professional or administrative services that supports research, instruction, professional development, or outreach missions of the University; developing and evaluating instructional materials or curricula; or assuming responsibility for designated scholarly endeavors. “Perform degree-related professional or administrative services” does not include jobs that are outside the student’s field of study. Assistantship inquiries should be addressed to the unit head or graduate program coordinator of the unit/department/school/program in which the appointment is desired. The service expected is governed by the terms of the appointment. 3.6 Graduate Assistantship Responsibilities. An offer of an assistantship is a commitment by a unit/department/school/program to provide financial support to admitted graduate students. Assistantships are an investment made by a unit/department/school/program and are granted primarily to enable the student to pursue an advanced degree and gain valuable experience. Accepting an assistantship brings with it a professional obligation to fulfill all of the responsibilities associated with the assistantship assignment. Included in this professional obligation is the expectation that students who have accepted an assistantship will diligently pursue their degree to completion. In recognition of this commitment and to provide adequate time for students holding assistantships to devote to study, employment as a graduate assistant is limited to a total, from all University sources (including external grants and contracts), of 0.50 FTE (an average of 20 hours per week) in the Fall and Spring semesters, and 0.75 FTE (an average of 30 hours per week) between the end of the Spring semester and the beginning of the Fall semester. Exceptions to this limitation may be requested by the employing unit or graduate program to the dean of the Graduate College. A student with a 0.50 FTE assistantship is expected to devote, on average, 20 hours per week to their duties as a graduate teaching or research assistant; the remainder of academic effort is devoted to his or her own studies and research. The time devoted to the assistantship may vary from day to day and week to week as long as it does not exceed the average given above. As part of a graduate student’s educational experience, OSU makes a number of GRAs available on a routine basis. Graduate students on a GRA are expected to devote full-time effort to their graduate programs. While the GRA appointment provides a modest stipend for an average of 10 or 20 hours per week for a 0.25 or a 0.50 FTE assignment, respectively, in recognition of contributions to the OSU research enterprise, it does not indicate that no additional time and effort may be required of the graduate student who is actively pursuing a graduate research degree. Depending on the stage of the research project and the graduate student’s advancement in the program, the student may be enrolled in research credit hours for academic credit or only enrolled in formal coursework. Irrespective of that enrollment, it is expected that the graduate student is working full-time toward completion of the advanced degree. OSU, like most institutions nationwide, does not define the research credit hour as equating to a specific amount of time and effort, as the nature of research is highly dependent on the individual’s progress on the project. For instance, general OSU policy only requires a minimum enrollment in two credit hours when a graduate student is working on a research project and using OSU resources unless they are employed as a GTA/GRA. In addition, all students holding a graduate assistantship are required to be full-time students - see “Enrollment Requirements” below. For fall and spring semesters, students employed 0.50 FTE must be enrolled in at least six credit hours to be considered full-time, while students employed less than 0.50 FTE must be enrolled in at least nine credit hours to be considered full-time. However, full-time enrollment for students admitted to doctoral candidacy is two credit hours. For the summer term, students employed at any level must be enrolled in at least two credit hours during any summer session to be considered full-time. International students who are dependent upon an assistantship for their financial guarantee must remember that forfeiture of that assistantship may require the re-submission of a newly revised financial guarantee to the Office of International Students and Scholars. Students who forfeit their graduate assistantships risk rescission of tuition waivers, as well as any health insurance coverage for graduate assistants provided by the University. Note that all graduate student benefit programs, such as tuition waivers, are only available to individuals with a primary classification as a graduate student enrolled in a degree program, which does not include certificate-seeking or non-degree seeking graduate students. OSU employees taking graduate classes do not qualify for graduate student benefit programs, irrespective of whether their employment is a benefit eligible position. One cannot selectively opt-out of certain benefits to seek eligibility for other benefits. Please contact the Graduate College or Human Resources if you have questions. 3.7 Graduate Assistantship General Benefits. Graduate Teaching or Research Assistants employed at least 0.50 FTE in the fall/spring semester (average of 20 hours per week) are enrolled in a minimum of six (or two for doctoral candidates) eligible graduate hours will receive a tuition waiver (hours of enrollment must be required per the graduate degree program). Summer tuition waivers for the same GTA or GRA for spring semester will apply during the summer regardless of summer employment. Tuition waivers cannot be applied to independent study, leveling, undergraduate or some outreach type courses. Granting of these tuition waivers is also contingent upon the student submitting an electronic GTA/GRA (GSSI) tuition waiver agreement through the Graduate College website (https://gradcollege.okstate.edu/resources/current-student-resources.html), by the first day of the semester, in which they acknowledge their employment, enrollment and good academic standing responsibilities. Once enrolled, good academic standing (i.e., not on academic probation – beyond probationary admission) is a requirement for OSU tuition waiver eligibility. Once matriculated, a graduate student going on probation is not eligible for tuition waiver benefits. This does not preclude a GTA/GRA appointment(s). Graduate programs can request a one-time exception for exceptional circumstances from the graduate dean. For more information regarding tuition waiver benefits or academic standing, please visit the Graduate College website (gradcollege.okstate.edu). Any graduate student employed as a GTA and/or a GRA less than 0.50 FTE total per week will not be eligible for any type of tuition waiver benefit. 3.7.1 Health Insurance Benefits. Graduate Teaching or Research Assistants employed in a 0.25 FTE GTA/GRA position during the fall or spring semesters and who are enrolled in at least nine graduate credit hours throughout that entire semester are eligible for subsidized single-person-coverage health insurance through OSU for the fall (or spring) semester. Note: Spring semester eligibility coverage continues through the following summer regardless of employment or enrollment status. Graduate Teaching or Research Assistants who are not eligible for health insurance coverage during the summer session by virtue of their eligibility during the previous spring semester but who are employed in a 0.25 FTE GTA/GRA position during the eight-week summer session and enrolled in at least two graduate credit hours are eligible for subsidized single-person-coverage health insurance through OSU for the summer term. The University subsidizes the student's coverage on a semester-by-semester basis. Students receiving the GTA/GRA insurance are required to pay the semester health fee. Information on the policy is available at OSU Human Resources http://hr.okstate.edu/student-health-plan. Eligible graduate students are automatically enrolled for the insurance coverage if they meet eligibility requirements. If students have other insurance coverage or choose not to be enrolled in the student health plan, they may complete a declination form to opt out. A declination form can be found at the following site http://hr.okstate.edu/student-health-plan. The form must be submitted by the deadline to OSU Human Resources, Benefits Office 106J Whitehurst. 3.8 Health Insurance for International Students. The Oklahoma State University Board of Regents requires that all visa-holding (i.e. non-immigrant) students at OSU be covered by health insurance. The OSU Student Insurance Policy is the recommended health insurance and will be billed to all non-immigrant student accounts automatically. Payment for the student insurance is included in the costs listed on the financial affidavit that international students are required to submit to receive a F-1 or J-1 visa. The insurance premium can be waived for non-immigrant students sponsored by the United States Government, a foreign government recognized by the United States of America, or certain international, government sponsored or non-governmental organizations. Such waivers will be based on the government or organization guaranteeing payment of all health care expenses including evacuation and repatriation. The insurance premium will also be waived for students who provide documented evidence of health insurance coverage by an employer. Non-immigrant students employed by OSU and eligible for both employer-provided insurance and international student health insurance may select between the two, as long as the insurance selected includes evacuation and repatriation coverage. Students covered by a private medical insurance plan with benefits comparable to or better than the OSU plan, may request a waiver from OSU’s international student health insurance requirement. Coverage must be in effect from the first day of their first semester classes for a 12-month period. To use alternate insurance, students must complete and submit a waiver request no later than the fifth day of classes. Waiver forms can be found on the International Students and Scholars (ISS) website at http://iss.okstate.edu. If a student holds an appointment as at least a 0.25 FTE OSU GTA or GRA position, OSU provides a subsidized student health insurance policy. 3.9 McNair Graduate Fellowships for former McNair Scholars. Entering graduate students in residential degree programs who are graduates of a McNair Scholar Program as undergraduates may be eligible to become McNair Graduate Fellows. McNair Graduate Fellows receive a tuition waiver for all degree-eligible courses up to the number of hours in their degree program, irrespective of a qualifying assistantship. Such tuition waivers cannot apply to independent study, leveling, or outreach-exception type courses. The McNair Graduate Fellow Tuition Waiver Program is competitive and is not guaranteed, irrespective of the McNair application waiver received. Please contact the Graduate College (grad-i@okstate.edu) for more information as restrictions apply. Also, note that all graduate student benefit programs, such as the McNair Graduate Fellow Tuition Waiver Program, are only available to individuals with a primary classification as degree seeking graduate students. OSU employees taking graduate classes do not qualify for graduate student benefit programs, irrespective of whether their employment is a benefit eligible position. One cannot opt-out of certain benefits in an a-la-carte manner to seek eligibility for other benefits. Please contact the Graduate College or Human Resources if you have any additional questions. McNair Graduate Fellows are required to submit the necessary contract to the Graduate College each year and restrictions apply. 3.10 City Year National Service Scholars. Oklahoma State University is proud to partner with City Year through our shared visions and values of integrating the power of knowledge and service in addressing social problems. The OSU Graduate College City Year National Service Scholars Program provides City Year Alumni an application fee waiver and a tuition waiver for all degree-eligible courses up to the number of hours in their degree program; however, acceptance as an OSU Graduate College City Year National Service Scholar is competitive and is not guaranteed. Please contact the Graduate College or grad-i@okstate.edu for specific requirements. 3.11 Spouse/Partner Tuition Waivers. A spouse/partner of a graduate teaching or research assistant who is receiving a tuition waiver that is associated with an eligible assistantship is eligible to apply for a waiver of the non-resident portion of tuition for all graduate level/eligible courses taken. Tuition waivers cannot apply to independent study, leveling or certain outreach-type courses. Contact the Graduate College for details. 3.12 Student Employment. Career Services provides assistance to OSU students seeking part-time employment or work study programs. Students are informed of job opportunities on campus and in the Stillwater community. Applications are available in room 360 Student Union. Jobs on campus usually offer 12 to 20 hours of work per week in clerical, technical, food service or general labor positions. Rate of pay and work schedules vary. Individual job search assistance is available with the graduate career consultant in the Student Union Career Services Office or with any of the college career consultants located in the respective disciplinary colleges. Services include resume and curriculum vitae development, written correspondence assistance, mock interviews and interview preparation, academic and non-academic job search assistance, workshops and career fairs. 4.0 Admission to the Graduate College Holders of baccalaureate or first professional degrees from accredited colleges and universities or those of recognized standing are eligible to seek admission to the Graduate College. Applicants must complete the web-based application and submit official transcripts of all academic work and degrees received including any previous graduate coursework and degrees. No application for admission will be reviewed until the application fee is paid. The prospective student should obtain transcripts for bachelor’s degree(s) conferred or pending as well as for any graduate or professional coursework and upload these transcripts as part of their application (some programs may require applicants to upload transcripts from all institutions previously attended). If an applicant is offered admission to graduate studies, the applicant will be required to have the institution that granted their bachelor’s degree to send one official transcript to the Graduate College, 202 Whitehurst, Stillwater, OK 74078. To be official, the transcript must be issued from the school and must show the complete scholastic record, bear the official seal of the institution, be signed by the issuing officer, and be in a sealed envelope or electronically delivered directly from the issuing institution. To assure adequate time for review, completed applications and transcripts should be received at least 60-90 days prior to the graduate program application deadline or the beginning of the semester, whichever comes first. All transcripts become the property of OSU and are not released or returned. When the applicant’s file is complete, the faculty in the graduate program of the student’s area of interest reviews the material and recommends an admission status to the dean of the Graduate College. The final decision for admission to the Graduate College is determined by the graduate dean on the basis of the graduate program’s recommendations, prior academic performance of the applicant, and availability of space, facilities, and faculty mentors in the program. 4.1 OSU Faculty Members. No member of the faculty, with the rank of associate professor or above or equivalent rank at the time of completing the requirements, may be granted a degree or graduate certificate from this institution. This regulation also applies to faculty members in the schools of engineering holding the rank of assistant professor or above. 4.2 Types of Admission. Admission to a graduate program at OSU is based on an evaluation of an applicant’s overall record, experience, personal qualifications, proposed area of study, and fit with the graduate program. For admission without qualification, a GPA of at least 3.00 on a 4.00 scale or the equivalent is expected in undergraduate coursework or a 3.00 in any graduate or professional coursework already completed. Graduate programs are encouraged to evaluate applications holistically and may petition the Graduate College on behalf of an applicant for an exception to the cumulative GPA requirement. Academic programs may set more stringent admission requirements. Please check with the graduate program to which you are applying in order to determine any program specific requirements. 4.2.1 Admission Without Qualification. Students planning to work toward a graduate degree in a recognized graduate program may be admitted in good standing provided they meet all Graduate College and graduate program requirements. 4.2.2 Provisional Admission. A student can be admitted provisionally upon recommendation of the graduate program and with concurrence by the dean of the Graduate College. Admission with provisional status is granted to an applicant who does not meet one or more of the graduate program’s admission requirements or when the applicant does not have the necessary academic background. In this case, the graduate program requires specific provisions be met for admission in good standing. For example, a graduate program may require additional leveling coursework or higher test scores. The first obligation of a student admitted provisionally is to successfully meet all of the provisions specified at the time of admission. Failure to meet these provisions could result in the dismissal from the program. 4.2.3 Probationary Admission. A student can be admitted with probation status upon recommendation of the graduate program with concurrence by the dean of the Graduate College. Admission with probation status is granted to an applicant who has deficiencies in previous academic coursework. A student admitted on probation status must make at least a 3.00 GPA through the semester in which they complete nine hours of courses eligible for graduate credit. Upon successful fulfillment of these requirements the student will be granted good academic standing. Failure to meet the required level of academic performance while in a probationary status may result in dismissal from the Graduate College. 4.2.4 Conditional Admission. Several graduate programs at OSU will consider an applicant for conditional admission. An applicant can be admitted conditionally upon recommendation of the graduate program and with concurrence by the dean of the Graduate College. Conditional admission means that the applicant is academically qualified for admission to the graduate degree program but lacks a minimum English proficiency test score which satisfies the University’s or graduate program’s minimum (see “International Student Admission” for minimum requirements). 4.3 Non-Degree Seeking Student Status. An applicant may be admitted to the Graduate College as a non-degree seeking student if he or she does not have immediate plans to become a degree candidate, but wants to take graduate courses, prerequisites, or other courses. Admission to the Graduate College as a non-degree seeking student means only that the student will be permitted to enroll in courses through the Graduate College. It does not imply that the student has been or will be admitted to a graduate program leading to an advanced degree or that the student will be able to obtain a graduate degree from OSU. Non-degree seeking students are not eligible for GTA or GRA positions or associated tuition waiver benefits. 4.3.1 Non-Degree Seeking Student Status Requirements. Non-degree seeking students are subject to the same admission standards as degree-seeking students, including English language proficiency. Applicants for non-degree seeking student status are not automatically admitted without due deliberation of their past academic performance. A non-degree seeking applicant can be considered for admission “Without Qualification” provided their overall GPA is 3.00 or higher for all courses on their bachelor’s degree transcript and/or transcripts from their graduate or professional coursework. An applicant whose GPA does not meet these criteria can be considered for admission after consultation and recommendation of the Graduate College’s non-degree seeking student advisor who may consider additional factors in making a decision, such as the following: length of time since last attendance at an institution of higher learning, a written appeal from the applicant explaining exceptional circumstances that warrant admission, and/or a letter of recommendation written by faculty who can speak to the applicant’s potential for graduate work. The prospective student is responsible for filing a new application for admission to the Graduate College should they wish to become a degree-seeking candidate. The new application will be evaluated by the graduate program and the dean of the Graduate College to ascertain admissibility to the degree program. Given that non-degree seeking coursework is not guided by a Plan of Study or approved by an advisor, no more than nine semester credit hours of coursework taken while a non-degree seeking student may be used on a Plan of Study to meet requirements for a graduate degree (including a graduate certificate) program. In addition, only three semester credit hours of coursework taken while a non-degree seeking student may be used on a Plan of Study toward an MBA degree. Non-degree seeking students may not enroll in more than nine hours of courses eligible for graduate credit without permission of the dean of the Graduate College, or their designee. To ensure that non-degree seeking students do not inadvertently exceed this limitation, an enrollment hold will be placed on each student's record in this status after the student has registered for six or more credit hours. This hold may be removed by the Graduate College (see below) once the student has formally re-acknowledged this nine-hour limitation. Non-degree seeking students are subject to the same academic regulations as those graduate students admitted into degree programs. Such students are strongly encouraged to consult with the instructor of any course in which they intend to enroll in order to ensure they are adequately prepared for that course. Non-degree seeking students may not enroll in thesis (5000) or dissertation (6000) courses. Generally, International students with an F-1 visa, except students on Optional Practical training (OPT) or Curricular Practical training (CPT), may not be admitted or enroll as non-degree seeking students. Academic advising for non-degree seeking student is provided by an advisor in the Graduate College. Students should contact the Graduate College at 405-744-6368 or grad-academici@okstate.edu for details. 4.4 International Student Admission. International applicants are expected to submit applications, financial affidavits, transcripts and/or mark sheets, and, if required, official scores of the English proficiency examinations. Applicants who present a TOEFL score of at least 79 iBT/550 PBT or a PTE academic test score of at least 53, or an IELTS academic stream score of at least 6.5 satisfy the Graduate College’s English proficiency requirements for admission to a graduate program. Note that some graduate programs require an English proficiency score or other tests above these levels, and applicants should contact the program for specific language requirements. Completed applications are due no later than February 1 for fall enrollment and August 1 for spring enrollment. Applications that become complete after these deadline dates may be reviewed, but the Graduate College cannot guarantee an admissions decision will be made with sufficient time for the issuance of the I-20 form required to obtain an entry visa. 4.4.1 English Proficiency. As a condition of admission to graduate study at OSU, all persons for whom English is a second language are required to present proof of English competency regardless of the number of semesters or terms completed at OSU or in other institutions of higher education. A waiver of this requirement can be obtained for students who have completed a baccalaureate or graduate degree from an accredited institution of higher learning, at which English is the primary language of instruction, located in a country in which English is a recognized primary language. Note, that additional testing on-campus may be still necessary if employment as a graduate teaching assistant is desired. Graduate programs may have additional requirements. Proof of English competency can be in the form of an official examination must have been taken within the last two years. Applicants who present a TOEFL score of at least 61 IBT/500 PBT, but at less than 79 IBT/500 PBT or an IELTS Academic Stream of 6.0, or a PTE academic test score of 44 and who demonstrate unusual academic promise may be admitted to graduate study on a conditional status upon petition to the Graduate College by the graduate program. Applicants with English proficiency a test scores of at least 61 iBT/500 PBT, but less than 79 iBT/550 PBT, an IELTS Academic Stream of 6.0 or PTE Academic test score of 44 must successfully complete a minimum of 12 weeks of study at an intensive English program (IEP) approved by the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education State Regents. At least two-thirds (eight weeks) of the 12 weeks must be instruction at an advanced level. A list of State Regents’ approved IEPs can be found in the OSRHE Academic Affairs Procedures Handbook. The OSU intensive English program, known as the English Language Institute (ELI), is a state-approved IEP. More information on the OSU ELI program can be found here https://global.okstate.edu/eli/about_osu_eli.html. Applicants, who do not submit a test score, can seek admission to the OSU English Language Institute (ELI) in their first semester. These students will be issued an I-20 by ELI. After successful completion of an approved 12 week ELI program as described above, the student will be eligible for admission to their graduate program and will be issued an I-20 by the Graduate College. Concurrent enrollment in graduate courses and ELI is not permitted. 4.4.2 Spoken English Proficiency for Employment. OSU policy requires all persons for whom English is a second language to demonstrate an acceptable level of spoken English before being employed in an instructional related capacity, including laboratory assignments. Graduate students who serve only as laboratory assistants (e.g., setting up and/or maintaining equipment) or graders are not required to comply with these provisions. See https://gradcollege.okstate.edu/prospective-students/international-teaching-assistant-test.html for specific policy requirements for the International Teaching Assistant Program. Any new international teaching assistant (ITA) is required to have a qualifying score of 26 or greater on the speaking portion of the iBT or to take the ITA test prior to being approved for instructional assignments. All new ITAs are also required to participate in the international teaching assistant orientation. Any new international teaching assistant (ITA) who submits a PTE or IELTS score are required to take the ITA test prior to being approved for instructional assignments. See https://gradcollege.okstate.edu/prospective-students/international-teaching-assistant-test.html for specific policy requirements. 5.0 Transfer of Graduate Credits Transfer credit for "non-aged" courses must be recommended by the graduate student’s advisory committee through the submission of a Plan of Study, which requires approval by the dean of the Graduate College. See Section 7.0 for additional information on coursework time limits. Transfer credit will only be considered if it was earned when the student was post-baccalaureate (i.e., after earning a bachelor’s degree) at an accredited institution and the applicable course(s) was/were certified as graduate credit by that institution. All courses used as transfer credit must have a grade of “B” or better. Transfer of credits from medical professional programs (e.g., DO, DVM and MD) to graduate degrees may also be considered when a student was admitted to a medical professional program at an accredited institution and the applicable courses were certified for enrollment restricted to professional-level study. All courses used as transfer credit must have a grade of “B” or better or a grade of “pass” for those institutions which only offer professional courses as a “pass/no pass” grading system. Up to three hours of transfer credit may be used toward an OSU graduate certificate and up to nine credit hours of transfer credit may be used toward any OSU graduate degree. A doctoral student may transfer more than nine hours if they have completed a master's degree and if the courses are approved by their advisory committee. Doctoral students must include a minimum of 30 hours of OSU credit on their Plan of Study. Also, see Section 11.2 for the number of times a course can be used in multiple degree Plans of Study. 6.0 Enrollment Policies 6.1 Initial and Continuous Enrollment Policy. A prospective student must enroll in courses at OSU within the time frame specified in the admission letter to retain active status. A prospective student who does not conform to these conditions must reapply for admission. Any student who interrupts enrollment for one year (i.e., a consecutive period of one fall semester plus one spring semester plus one summer term) must re-apply for admission, and will be subject to the regulations in effect at the time of reapplication. See section 6.6 below for additional doctoral candidacy enrollment requirements. 6.2 Full-Time Enrollment. To be considered enrolled full time, a graduate student must be enrolled in at least nine hours in either fall or spring semester and at least three hours during the summer sessions. Full-time enrollment for Graduate Teaching/Research Associate/Assistants (GTAs/GRAs) with a 0.50 FTE appointment is at least six hours in either fall or spring semester and at least two hours during a summer session. 6.3 Minimum and Maximum Enrollment. Students are required to be enrolled in at least two credit hours in each semester in which they are using University resources (e.g., physical - laboratory, studios; electronic – library holdings; computing; human - faculty, staff). Students holding graduate assistantships should note that additional requirements apply (see below). Regardless of the number of hours taken, a student may not enroll in more than 12 (16 for the Spears School of Business graduate programs; 24 for the Physician Assistant Studies program) credit hours in the fall or spring semester without permission of the dean of the Graduate College. During the summer session, a student may not enroll in more than nine (15 for the Physician Assistant Studies program) credit hours taken in any session during the eight-week summer period. No more than three credit hours can be taken during the first summer session (intersession). Summer intersession is defined as any course that begins after the end of the spring semester and ends prior to the beginning of the eight-week summer session. For any short course session less than eight weeks in length, enrollment shall not exceed one credit hour for each week. International students on F-1 or J-1 visas must maintain full-time status (as defined above) during the first semester of enrollment, and during each fall and spring semester thereafter. Also, see Section 11.2 for the number of times a course can be used in multiple degree Plans of Study. 6.4 Graduating Semester Enrollment. Degree-seeking graduate students must be enrolled in at least two credit hours of courses eligible for graduate credit during their graduating semester (defined as the semester in which they satisfactorily complete all degree requirements). However, a student would not need to be enrolled during their graduating semester if they meet all of the following conditions: has been assigned an “Incomplete” (grade of I) in a non-research or creative component course; the course is required for graduation; and, the course in which the incomplete was received is the only graduation requirement left to fulfill. Students must enroll in research, thesis, or dissertation hours, as appropriate, during each semester in which they are involved in research leading to a thesis or dissertation, irrespective of the number of credit hours of such courses either required or permitted for the degree. 6.5 Master’s Degree Enrollment Requirements. Students with a fall (spring/summer) graduating semester who have research courses (i.e., courses numbered 5000) on their approved Plan of Study must satisfactorily complete no fewer than six hours of courses eligible for graduate credit during the calendar (academic) year which includes the graduating semester. As an example, a student wishing to graduate in a fall semester must be enrolled in a total of at least six hours for that fall semester plus the preceding spring semester and summer session. Doctoral students meet this requirement by virtue of the Doctoral Candidacy Continuous Enrollment Requirements noted below. 6.6 Doctoral Candidacy Enrollment Requirements. Doctoral students who have completed the requirements for admission to doctoral candidacy and had their “Admission to Doctoral Candidacy” form approved by the dean of the Graduate College may enroll in a minimum of at least two credit hours during any term and be considered full-time. This post-candidacy reduced enrollment option applies to all qualified graduate students, including GTAs, GRAs, international students and veterans receiving VA benefits. A student is normally expected to primarily enroll in research hours or in program-approved courses after being admitted to doctoral candidacy. Continuous enrollment post-candidacy is required of all students. Enrollment of a minimum of at least two credits per semester is required for every semester of a student’s candidacy (summer session excluded) until graduation. It is ultimately the responsibility of each student to ensure that they meet this enrollment requirement. Students who are not able to maintain active status are strongly encouraged to consult with their program, advisor and the Graduate College to determine whether requesting a Leave of Absence (LOA) is the most appropriate course of action. 6.6.1 Reinstatement Fee. Post-candidacy students who do not maintain continuous enrollment will be assessed a reinstatement fee based upon their residency status at the time of last enrollment as follows: Resident: $750/semester (summer session excluded) of non-enrollment Nonresident: $1,900/semester (summer session excluded) of non-enrollment In addition to the reinstatement fee, students whose continuous enrollment disruption exceeds one academic year also must apply for readmission to the graduate program (see Enrollment). During the readmission process, previous coursework will be evaluated for applicability in accordance with coursework (10 years) and time-to-degree (9 years) time limits (see Time to Degree Requirements). Notification of the conditions of readmission and reinstatement will be provided if an acceptance occurs. New program requirements may apply based on the aforementioned enrollment policy. Please note that reinstatement and readmission are not guaranteed and significant challenges may occur that hinder a student’s ability to complete a degree after a lapse in enrollment, such as the reapplication process (e.g., new letters of recommendation and unexpired standardize test scores); availability of the same graduate advisor, project and/or grant support; and new/revised program requirements and/or core courses for degree. 6.7 Enrollment and Financial Assistance. For the purpose of receiving monetary assistance through the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid, the amount of the award is related to the total number of enrolled credit hours that apply toward the degree (for graduate students, such courses must be offered for graduate credit), such as 5000 and 6000 level courses. OSU graduate certificate and master’s, specialist and, doctoral degree programs are federal aid-eligible programs, depending on a person’s personal circumstances. In general, a graduate student must be enrolled in four hours of courses eligible for graduate credit each fall and spring semester, and two hours of courses eligible for graduate credit in the summer term, to be eligible for federal financial aid. Some students may be required to enroll in more hours in the fall or spring or summer to receive the full amount of federal financial aid. Students should verify with their financial aid advisor in the OSU Office of Scholarship and Financial Aid about the number of hours they are required to take. Certifiable enrollment status, based upon a combination of enrollment and employment, only assists with the deferral of loan repayments, never qualification for aid, which is based solely on enrollment. 6.8 Enrollment as a Non-Degree Seeking or Degree-Seeking Graduate Student. Students with a bachelor’s degree are expected to enroll in the Graduate College unless they want to obtain another bachelor’s degree. If they enroll as an undergraduate student, the courses taken cannot be given graduate credit at a later date. 6.9 Graduate Student Enrollment in Undergraduate Courses. Students admitted to the Graduate College may enroll in, or audit, undergraduate courses or course sections that do not carry graduate credit if approved to do so by their graduate faculty advisor. Such courses cannot subsequently be used as part of a graduate Plan of Study and are not generally covered by graduate tuition waiver programs. 6.10 Undergraduate Student Enrollment in Graduate Courses. An OSU undergraduate senior may take a limited number of courses for graduate credit toward an OSU degree program. Undergraduates admitted to an approved OSU accelerated master’s degree program may utilize some of these credits for both a baccalaureate degree and graduate degree as outlined in section 11.15 of the Graduate College section of the University Catalog. All other undergraduates are subject to the graduate credit rules below. The credits may not be utilized for both a baccalaureate degree and a graduate degree. The courses in question must be approved for graduate credit (as listed in the Course Catalog). The applicability of such graduate courses to a specific graduate program will be determined by the student's graduate advisory committee when the student enrolls in the Graduate College and submits a Plan of Study for an advanced degree. To receive graduate credit for hours taken when not admitted to an approved OSU accelerated master's degree program, a Graduate Credit for Seniors form must be completed by the student to receive graduate credit for courses taken. This form must be submitted prior to the end of the second week of class instruction of a regular semester, or the first week of a regular summer session. The required form is available on the Registrar's website or upon request to grad-i@okstate.edu. Such credit may be earned only if the following conditions are satisfied at the time of application: Students must have a minimum overall (cumulative graduation/retention) undergraduate GPA of 3.00. The total semester enrollment must not exceed 18 credit hours for a regular semester or nine credit hours for a summer session. The student must be within 12 semester credit hours of completing requirements for the baccalaureate degree at the beginning of the semester or summer session in which courses are taken for graduate credit. Admission to courses taken for graduate credit must have approval of the course instructor, the dean of the disciplinary college associated with the student’s major, and the dean of the Graduate College. No more than 15 semester credit hours taken while a senior may be approved for graduate credit. The student must earn a grade of “B” or higher in those courses for which he or she seeks graduate credit. Students are cautioned that institutions other than OSU may or may not allow courses taken for graduate credit during the senior year to be transferred into one of their graduate degree programs. 7.0 Time to Degree Graduate College matriculation starts when a student first enrolls as an admitted, degree-seeking graduate student. That date will be used in calculating time limits for degree completion. Students are expected to complete the degree requirements from first enrollment after admission within the following time limits: five years for a graduate certificate degree program, seven years for a master’s or specialist degree program, and nine years for a doctoral degree program. After that time, a student must submit a written petition to the Graduate College requesting an extension of time-to degree limits. Credit for all courses on a graduate Plan of Study must have been awarded within ten years of completion of all degree requirements. Any exception to these time limits must be approved by the dean of the Graduate College. 7.1 Leave of Absence. OSU graduate students are expected to maintain active status through continuous enrollment from the time they matriculate until they graduate. Students who are not able to maintain active status are strongly encouraged to consult with their program, advisor, and Graduate College to determine whether requesting a Leave of Absence (LOA) is the most appropriate course of action. International students must consult with the International Students and Scholars (ISS) office to ensure compliance with Federal immigration policy. Example situations that may lead a student to explore a Leave of Absence request are medical, personal, employment, and military service. Students who do not have an approved leave of absence and are not continuously enrolled may experience negative consequences related to academic, visa, financial aid, and other student issues – see University policies and guidelines for additional information. A student status of “good standing” (academic and conduct) is generally required for a Leave of Absence. Please see https://gradcollege.okstate.edu/resources/current-student-resources.html for additional Leave of Absence information. 8.0 Enrollment Procedure Students are strongly encouraged to review the course offerings for the upcoming semester prior to attempting to enroll. For more information about enrollment and classes go to http://my.okstate.edu. First semester graduate students must first obtain their advisor's clearance prior to attempting to enroll. Non-degree seeking students may be granted enrollment clearance through the Graduate College. Non-degree seeking students will be provided assistance with selecting coursework, issues surrounding the transferability of special student credits, applying to degree-seeking programs, and other academic topics. If the student has not completed a Plan of Study or if this is the first semester as a graduate student, the student should consult with the graduate faculty advisor. The graduate faculty advisor can provide information about required courses, course sequencing, and other information in order to select appropriate courses. The advisor should give approval for course selections prior to enrollment. All graduate students must complete Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) requirements prior to the submission of a Plan of Study. A student should consult with his or her graduate coordinator as to what these requirements are in his or her graduate program. A Plan of Study will not be approved by the Graduate College until the program has certified RCR completion. If a Plan of Study has been completed, the student should verify that all planned courses are listed on the Plan of Study. Students should consult with their advisor any time they deviate from courses listed on the Plan of Study. The ultimate responsibility for completing degree requirements rests with the student. Students who have active academic, financial or advising holds must clear these holds prior to attempting to enroll. Students can view any holds by logging into the Self Service portal at http://my.okstate.edu. 8.1 Last Day to Enroll. Information regarding dates to enroll, when courses begin, and last days to drop are listed in the Class Schedule available at the Office of the Registrar's website at http://registrar.okstate.edu. Generally, the sixth class day of a regular semester or the third class day of the eight-week summer session is the last day a course may be added (nonrestrictive) via the student enrollment system. A short course may be added no later than the first day of the short course. 8.2 Late Enrollment. Graduate students should enroll prior to the end of the official enrollment deadline for the semester. If they do not, there are limited options to enroll in classes. The options available to the student depend on the number of weeks past the deadline and the student's current enrollment status. During the second week of fall/spring or first week of the eight-week summer session: If a student wishes to add course hours or is not currently enrolled, they must submit a drop/add card or Trial Study signed by their advisor giving permission to enroll. If the student is adding a course they must have the instructor's signature on the add/drop card or Trial Study. If a student is non-degree seeking, they must have the signature of the dean of the Graduate College and the instructor of the course in which they wish to enroll. After the second week of fall/spring or first week of the eight-week summer session graduate students may add any course which has not started. 8.3 Other Enrollment. In order to enroll in a given semester, a student must have received grades for at least six semester credit hours (including "I" and "R" and excluding "W") in the 12 months prior to the beginning of that semester. 9.0 Online and Outreach Courses Courses offered online are considered equivalent to courses offered through traditional formats. However, some online courses classified as outreach may not be eligible for tuition waivers. Check with the Graduate College for eligibility before enrolling. Any student wishing to enroll in a graduate credit course offered online or through outreach must make application for admission to the Graduate College at OSU. Some limitations apply to McNair Graduate Fellows (see Section 3.9), City Year Scholars (see section 3.10), International students on F-1 or J-1 visas and students on spousal/partner waivers (see Section 3.11). 10.0 Individual Study Credit (formerly Correspondence Education) OSU does not offer graduate-level courses by individual study (formerly correspondence education) and does not accept credit taken by individual study (formerly correspondence education) toward an advanced degree. Graduate students may enroll in individual study courses (formerly correspondence education courses); however, such courses will not be considered as part of minimum graduate degree or certificate requirements. Tuition waiver programs are not applicable to courses taken through individual study (formerly correspondence study). Courses taken through individual study (formerly correspondence education) do not count toward minimum enrollment requirements for any graduate student. 11.0 Academic Regulations Also refer to "University Academic Regulations” section in the Catalog. 11.1 Graduate Credit Courses. Courses numbered 5000 and above are for graduate students. Seniors who have obtained prior approval from the Graduate College may enroll in graduate level courses in accordance with the provisions of "Enrollment" stated earlier. 11.2 Number of Times a Course Can be Used to Earn Multiple Degrees. Typically, a graduate course can be used in more than one certificate or degree. For example, a student may initially earn a graduate certificate and later use the certificate coursework to earn a master’s degree. Similarly, coursework from a master’s degree may also be applied toward a doctoral degree. In both cases, the course credit has been used twice in earning the two graduate credentials – the certificate and the master’s degree and a master’s and a doctoral degree, respectively. With approved Plans of Study, graduate courses can be used to earn no more than three degrees, (degrees include undergraduate and graduate certificates). This applies to both OSU courses and courses approved for transfer credit. This policy does not refer to the use of zero-ending courses used within a Plan of Study. 11.3 Grades for Thesis (5000) and Dissertation (6000). The grade of “SR,” indicating satisfactory research progress, “UR” indicating unsatisfactory progress, or “IUR” indicating an incomplete (see section 6.2 “Grade Interpretation” in the “University Academic Regulations” chapter of the Catalog) will be assigned to thesis (5000) and dissertation (6000) courses at the end of the semester in which the course is taken. These grades are permanent and have no impact on a student’s grade point average, but affect the graduate student’s academic standing. Only courses in which a grade of “SR” (or a previously-awarded grade of “R,” “A,” “B,” or “C”) is earned may be used toward minimum degree requirements. 11.4 Grades for Creative Component Courses. The “R” grade can be assigned in a course identified as a creative component portion of a master’s degree by a graduate program. The grade of “R” may be assigned if more than one semester is required to complete the creative component. Upon completion of the creative component, the advisor submits a Change of Grade form to have the final grade entered. 11.5 Pass-No Pass Grading System. Graduate students may take a course utilizing the Pass-No Pass grading system with the consent of their faculty advisors, but courses taken under this system cannot be used on a Plan of Study to meet graduate degree requirements. A student who chooses the pass-no pass option must do so by the last date on which a course may be added. See section 6.6 “Grades and Grading” in the "University Academic Regulations” chapter of the Catalog. 11.6 Pass-Fail Grading System. Graduate students may take courses utilizing the Pass-Fail grading with the consent of their faculty advisors; however, only a limited number of these hours can be used on a Plan of Study to meet graduate degree requirements and these require advance permission of the dean of the Graduate College. Pass-Fail courses are typically internship, practicum, clinicals, seminar, special problems and student teaching. See section 6.7 “Grades and Grading” in the "University Academic Regulations” chapter of the Catalog. 11.7 Minimum Grade Requirements. A grade-point average of "B" (3.00) is required to maintain good standing as a graduate student and meet requirements for a degree. No course with a grade of “D” or “F” can be used on the Plan of Study to satisfy the degree course requirements. At the graduate level, a grade of a “D” or “F” is a failing grade that can result in dismissal by the dean of the Graduate College, regardless of academic standing. To receive a graduate degree, a student must have a minimum 3.00 GPA in the coursework taken for graduate credit No course with a grade below "C" can be used as part of the minimum number of semester credit hours required for the graduate degree. Some programs have more stringent requirements. The graduate program should be consulted concerning minimum grade requirements. 11.8 Annual Review of Student Progress. The graduate program in which a student is seeking a graduate degree will provide a mechanism for assessing the student’s progress toward degree completion at least once annually. If it is determined the student is not to be making adequate progress, then a specific plan to address and correct any inadequacies in progress will be prepared in a written document provided to the student and the dean of the Graduate College annually by June 30. Failure to correct these inadequacies may result in termination from the graduate program and/or Graduate College. 11.9 Academic Progress. Each semester, the dean of the Graduate College reviews the academic progress of any graduate student who receives a grade of "F", "NP", “C” or lower in a class or “UR” in research. Programs are notified which of their students have received a “C” or lower and of the dean of the Graduate College’s academic progress decision. At the discretion of the dean of the Graduate College, one of four actions based on the student’s current semester performance and past academic history will be taken as follows: Program Notice. The graduate program is notified and is encouraged to review the student’s performance to determine if any program intervention is needed. Academic Probation. If a student’s overall GPA drops below a 3.00, if a "F," "NP," or “UR” grade is earned, or if the dean of the Graduate College judges the student’s overall academic performance so warrants then they are subject to being placed on academic probation. At the discretion of the dean of the Graduate College, probation may be removed at the end of the semester only after the student brings his or her cumulative GPA for courses eligible for graduate credit taken at OSU to 3.00 or greater, earns a "P" or "SR" grade, and/or completes all degree requirements, whichever comes first. No Further Enrollment Without Program Consent (NFEWPC). If the student was admitted on academic probation and did not meet the requirements of this admission, or If they have received two consecutive grades of "F", "NP," and/or “UR”, or If the student was on academic probation the previous semester, or If the dean of the Graduate College believes the student’s overall academic performance warrants program intervention, then the student is not permitted to enroll further without the consent of the program. To continue in the program, the student must submit a written petition to the dean of the Graduate College requesting reinstatement and outlining a plan to remedy the academic situation. This petition must be accompanied by a letter of support from the unit head or graduate program coordinator. Failure to submit such a reinstatement petition could result in the cancellation of any pre-enrollment for the upcoming semester. No Further Enrollment (NFE). The student has consistently performed below the acceptable standards for graduate students. The student is not permitted to continue graduate study at OSU. 11.10 Course Grade Appeals. A student may appeal a grade given by an instructor in a case in which they believe the grade awarded is inconsistent with the announced grading policy. The student should consult the “Student Rights and Responsibilities” or contact the Office of Academic Affairs for information regarding initiating the appeals process. 11.11 Appeals of Research Grades and Non-grade Issues. A student wishing to appeal a “UR” grade issued for a research course (5000 or 6000), or an academic issue not involving a grade should contact the dean of the Graduate College about the appeals process available to graduate students. 11.12 Advisory Committee Decisions-Criteria for Passing. In decisions resulting from a vote of a graduate student advisory committee (e.g., PhD candidacy exam, final thesis defense, or approving a dissertation), a pass requires that no more than one member of the committee dissent. Graduate programs may impose more stringent requirements. 11.13 Discontinuance from a Program. In instances when a student reaches a situation when it is no longer possible to complete the intended degree (e.g., failure of all permitted attempts of the PhD qualifying exam, comprehensive exam or candidacy exam), and is still in good academic standing with the Graduate College, a domestic student may be considered for transfer to non-degree seeking student status and be subject to all non-degree seeking student rules (including maximum number of hours that can later be used toward a graduate degree or certificate program). If visa restrictions prohibit the student's matriculation as a non-degree seeking student, the Graduate College will inform the Office of International Students and Scholars of the student's impending dismissal from the program; the student will have until the end of the semester to be admitted into another graduate program. This change in status is initiated with a letter from the unit head or graduate program coordinator to the student, copied to the dean of the Graduate College, and should detail the reasons for the student's potential dismissal from the program. In accordance with graduate program policies, students have a limited number of days from the intent to dismiss letter date to initiate the appeals process in the program. Graduate students should contact the dean of the Graduate College about the appeals process. 11.14 Second Graduate Degrees. The Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education (OSRHE) do not allow students to obtain a second degree in the same “major” as the first degree, even if the options are different. For example, it is not possible to earn both an M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering with an option in Control Systems and an M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering with an option in Optics and Photonics. Completion of requirements for more than one option may be noted on the official transcript, but a second degree will not be awarded. Additionally, because of the OSRHE requirement for a coursework common core within master’s degree options, it should not be assumed that obtaining an additional option within the same degree program and level will be possible. Careful discussions and planning with the Graduate Program Coordinator prior to admission is imperative, if such study is desired. While graduate and professional students may simultaneously pursue more than one degree and/or certificate, pursuing a second Ph.D. degree is not allowed without preapproval of the dean of the Graduate College prior to the application for admission. Given Ph.D. degrees are research degrees, earning a second Ph.D. degree is highly unusual. 11.15 Accelerated Master's Degree Accelerated master’s degree programs offer a streamlined path to a master’s degree, reducing the time to earn a master’s degree by sharing up to 30 percent of the coursework required for the stand-alone master’s degree with the undergraduate degree. All shared courses must be approved for graduate credit. For example, a 30-hour master’s degree may share 9 hours with the undergraduate degree, while a 45-hour master’s degree may share 14 hours. The curriculum of an accelerated master’s degree program is designed to fulfill all requirements of both the undergraduate and graduate degrees. Accelerated bachelor to master's degree programs require approval of the deans of the Graduate College and the relevant undergraduate college(s). 11.16 Awarding of Certificates and Degrees The retroactive awarding of a newly approved graduate degree or certificate for prior coursework is prohibited. The majority of the coursework for a graduate certificate must be completed after the student is admitted to and enrolled in the degree program. 11.17 Theses and Dissertations All students theses and dissertations and derivatives of these works are considered Personal Works under Section 7.02 of OSU's IP Policy 1-0202, and the student will own the copyright unless otherwise provided by the IP Policy. The University, however, retains a non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free license to reproduce, distribute, and publish the works for any purpose without appropriate attribution. 12.0 Responsible Conduct of Research All graduate students must complete Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) training requirements prior to the submission of a Plan of Study. Students should consult with their graduate program coordinators as to what these requirements are in their graduate programs. Graduate programs may impose more stringent requirements. A Plan of Study will not be approved by the dean of the Graduate College until the graduate program has certified RCR completion. Information and University policies regarding RCR can be found at https://research.okstate.edu/compliance/policies.html. 12.1 Research Involving Human Subjects. If the thesis, dissertation, formal report or creative component involves the use of human subjects, the research project is governed by federal regulations that require review by the OSU Institutional Review Board (IRB). Approval to conduct the research must be obtained from the IRB before the research is started. Failure to obtain IRB approval will result in the University’s rejection of the thesis, dissertation, or formal report. While the Graduate College does not monitor degree capstone/creative components, this does not negate the student's responsibility to obtain IRB approval if human subjects are involved in that capstone/creative activity. This section is meant to be informational only and does not contain a complete description of the IRB review process. All of the forms and guidance for completing the application are available on the IRB website https://research.okstate.edu/compliance/irb/forms.html. 13.0 Graduation Clearance Process At the time of enrollment for the last semester or summer session of work toward a degree, graduate students must complete and submit a Graduation Clearance form to the Graduate College before they can submit an Application for Diploma with the Office of the Registrar. The Graduation Clearance form is completed in conjunction with the academic advisor and confirms that a student has met or will meet by the end of the semester in question, all program and Graduate College requirements to earn the degree they are seeking. If these requirements are not met, the student must complete a new Graduation Clearance Form and Application for Diploma for a future semester. In order to allow opportunity for any class schedule changes necessitated by the review of the Graduation Clearance Form, this form and the Application for Diploma, should be submitted as early as possible in the graduating semester but no later than the deadlines listed on the Graduate College website. 13.1 Graduate Commencement and Diplomas. The University holds one Graduate Commencement Ceremony at the close of the fall and spring semesters. Students who plan to meet graduation requirements at the close of the summer session are invited and encouraged to participate in the Graduate Commencement Ceremony at the close of the previous spring semester or return for the next ceremony on the fall. Although attendance is not compulsory, the University encourages all candidates for advanced degrees, including certificates, to participate in the Graduate Commencement Ceremony. Candidates should also notify the Office of the Registrar of the address to which the diploma should be mailed. 13.2 Graduate Records and Transcripts. All permanent records are in the Office of the Registrar. Requests for grades, transcripts, diplomas, and degree-completion letters should be made to that office. A graduate student who does not complete the requirements in time to receive the degree at the end of the semester may secure a statement from the Office of the Registrar when all requirements for the degree have been satisfied. Such a statement will not be issued until all grades for the semester have been recorded. 14.0 Graduate Programs Offered At OSU-Tulsa, Greenwood Campus OSU offers several graduate degrees and courses in Tulsa. All courses offered by OSU-Tulsa are considered resident credit for degrees granted by OSU. Both current and prospective graduate students are encouraged to utilize the OSU-Tulsa Graduate Student Services, located in North Hall 130. To schedule an appointment with an advisor or to learn more about a graduate program in Tulsa, call 918-594-8445 or email tulsa.gradinfo@okstate.edu. The graduate degree, graduate certificate and certification programs that OSU offers in Tulsa can be found at http://www.osu-tulsa.okstate.edu/programs#graduatedegrees. 15.0 Graduate Programs Offered at the OSU Center for Health Sciences in Tulsa OSU offers specialized graduate programs in athletic training (MAT), biomedical sciences (MS, PhD, and dual degree s DO/MS and DO/PhD) forensic sciences (graduate certificates, MS and Ph.D.); health care administration (graduate certificates, MS, and dual-degrees MS HCA/MBA), global health (MS and dual-degree MS GH/MBA), medical sciences (graduate certificate), and physician assistant studies (MS) through the OSU Center for Health Sciences (CHS). 15.1 Athletic Training. The Master of Athletic Training (MAT) graduate program in the School of Allied Health at OSU Center for Health Sciences prepares individuals to become competent and independent clinicians who will enhance the quality of patient health care and advance the profession of athletic training through practice and research. The MAT program is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education (CAATE) and offered on campus. Once accepted into the program, students supervised by a Board of Certification (BOC) Certified Athletic Trainer (AT) or other healthcare provider where they are responsible to provide for the overall health care of patients over the course of their respective seasons or occupation. Clinical instruction of students is achieved through direct supervision of a licensed healthcare provider. The curriculum is based in the human sciences with anatomy, physiology, biomechanics, pathology, pharmacology, nutrition and psychology providing the theoretical foundation of student inquiry. Students learn how to apply these theoretical concepts while in the clinical setting learning under licensed physicians, athletic trainers, physical therapists and other allied health care professionals. This balance of theory and practical application prepares students to sit for the Board of Certification examination where upon successful completion, may earn the credentials ATC. 15.2 Biomedical Sciences. The MS and PhD programs in biomedical sciences are interdisciplinary programs involving the basic biomedical science disciplines of anatomy, biochemistry, cell biology, microbiology, pathology, pharmacology and physiology. The programs consist of core basic sciences medical courses, additional basic sciences graduate courses, research, and thesis for the MS and a dissertation for the PhD. A non-thesis MS is also available. All degree programs are offered on campus. 15.2.1 Medical Sciences. The Graduate Certificate in Medical Sciences is an academic credential earned after completing a one-year program of focused study. It is designed to prepare students to become more qualified applicants to medical school, master’s and doctoral programs; or serve as a standalone educational achievement to assist in career development. 15.3 Forensic Sciences. The graduate program in forensic sciences is interdisciplinary and reflects a broad range of disciplines. The School offers a graduate certificate, MS, and PhD degrees. The graduate certificate in forensic arson, explosive, firearms and toolmarks investigation is offered in a hybrid format, incorporating both on campus and online components. The master’s degree program has non-thesis (forensic investigative sciences; arson, explosive, firearms and toolmarks investigation) and thesis (forensic biology/DNA; forensic chemistry/toxicology; forensic psychology) specializations. The master’s degree specializations are offered on campus, hybrid and/or online. The PhD program is offered in a hybrid format. Admission to some degree programs in forensic science require specific professional qualifications. 15.4 Health Care Administration. The School of Health Care Administration trains leaders to guide hospitals, clinics, nursing homes and other health organizations. The MS is ideal for those who want to move into management or executive positions in health care and is offered online, on-campus and hybrid. Well-qualified applicants may be admitted to dual-degree program with the master of business administration (MBA). The health care administration program requires students to take core courses in health care administration and research methods along with a series of electives selected from applicable courses in business and social sciences. The multidisciplinary approach to the health care administration discipline provides students with a unique perspective on the complex issues facing the profession today. 15.4.1. Global Health.

William McGlynn, PhD—Program Coordinator The following departments participate in the food science program: Agricultural Economics, Animal Science, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering, Entomology and Plant Pathology, Horticulture, Plant and Soil Science, and Nutritional Sciences. Food science is an interdisciplinary graduate program designed to provide an opportunity for students to acquire basic knowledge of the food industry encompassing the biological and physical sciences. The increasing complexity of the problems involved in the safe and secure production, processing, and utilization of food requires us to expand our fundamental knowledge to solve these problems. There is a great demand for personnel with advanced training in the broad area of food science to staff research, production, food safety and quality assurance positions in industry, universities and government Admission to either the MS or PhD degree program requires an undergraduate major in animal science, biochemistry, dairy science, food science, human nutrition, microbiology or poultry science. Students majoring in other curricula may qualify by remedying specific undergraduate deficiencies as recognized by the student's graduate committee. A student enrolling in a degree program must have been accepted by an advisor prior to official admission. The GRE is required for admission, no minimum score is required. Three letters of reference and a personal statement of purpose are also required. 16.3 Interdisciplinary Studies. Mary Jo Self, EdD—General Program Coordinator The MS in Interdisciplinary Studies offers students the flexibility to create a program of study to fit background, experience and career goals. By stacking graduate certificates and/or other focused graduate coursework, students can tailor their degree to make the most of their education. The MS is for students who wish to increase their competence in a particular thematic area(s) by taking a series of courses in several disciplines. This multidisciplinary approach provides educational opportunities leading to a variety of careers. Interdisciplinary studies consist of no fewer than two separate fields of study. The advisory committee will assist the student in formulating the Plan of Study. 16.3.1 Admission Requirements. An undergraduate grade-point average of 3.00 is required for unqualified admission. Students with a grade-point average between 2.50 and 3.00 may be admitted on a probationary basis. Applications to the program should include: a cover letter indicating the personal goals and professional objectives to be obtained from the program; transcripts from all schools previously attended; three letters of recommendation from persons who can describe abilities, interest, and motivation as a student; a proposed course of study with an endorsement from an OSU faculty advisor. Particular courses are not specified for the degree; the advisory committee can assist in selecting appropriate courses. Up to nine graduate hours can be transferred from a regionally-accredited graduate program with consent of the advisory committee. The student chooses one of the two master's degree plans: 30-hour plan, thesis, includes six-hours of research; 32-hour plan, non-thesis. May include a culminating experience (e.g., internship, practicum, comprehensive exam, portfolio, or capstone project); may include a final report with no more than three hours of research; 16.4 Public Health. Jean Van Delinder, PhD—Interim Program Director Randolph Hubach, MPH, PhD - Associate Director The Master of Public Health (MPH) is an interdisciplinary degree program and focuses on training public health professionals to improve health and wellbeing of rural and underserved populations. Students are encouraged to identify a rural community or undeserved population as the focus of class projects. In doing so, students will have the opportunity to assess the needs of that community or population, and to thoughtfully create programs for preventing disease within that community or population. Prevention efforts often include a focus on lifestyle and health behaviors. Current students study health behaviors and health outcome areas that include: the use of alcohol, tobacco, other drugs, mental health, disabilities, zoonotic diseases, nutrition and food security, obesity, physical activity, maternal and child health, teen pregnancy and sexual health. These students are meaningfully engaged with rural communities throughout Oklahoma and underserved populations that include indigenous populations, racial minorities, recent immigrants, and sexual minorities. 16.4.1 Admission Requirements. Application for admission includes a statement of purpose defining professional goals and interest in public health, a resume, and three letters of reference. 17.0 Graduate Certificate Programs Offerings Graduate certificate programs offer students the opportunity for focused study of a body of knowledge at the graduate level, leading to the award of a transcripted academic credential that can be earned in a relatively short time. Graduate certificate programs can serve both as a stepping stone onto more advanced study leading to a master’s or doctoral degree or as a stand alone educational achievement to assist an individual in their career. Many OSU graduate certificate programs are offered online or on the graduate-serving campuses (OSU-Stillwater, OSU-Tulsa and OSU-Center for Health Sciences in Tulsa). In addition, many graduate certificate programs allow students to enroll as either a certificate-seeking or a degree-seeking graduate student. Certificate-seeking students are not eligible for GTA or GRA positions or associated benefits, but may be eligible for federal financial aid. For the current graduate certificate offerings at OSU please see the Graduate College website for additional information. 17.1 Admission to a Graduate Certificate Program. Any student admitted to the Graduate College may apply for admission to a graduate certificate program. Some certificate programs may have additional requirements, such as official scores on standardized tests, letters of recommendation, etc. Contact the appropriate graduate program for specifics. 17.2 Basic Requirements. A graduate certificate requires completion of a minimum of 12 credit hours of coursework eligible for graduate credit. Specific certificate programs may have more stringent requirements. Also, see Section 11.2 for the number of times a course can be used in multiple degree Plans of Study. 17.3 Transfer of Courses. With the approval of the graduate program and the Graduate College, up to three hours of graduate-level credit from another institution may be used toward certificate requirements. The GPA must be at least 3.0 on any transfer credit. 17.4 Academic Standing. A grade-point average of "B" (3.00) is required on courses applicable to a graduate certificate. No grade lower than a "C" may be used as part of the minimum requirements for the certificate. Individual certificate programs may have more stringent requirements. 17.5 Plan of Study and Certificate Completion Procedures. Upon application to a graduate certificate program, a student should complete a Plan of Study listing the courses intended to be used in earning the certificate. This plan must be approved by the graduate program and the Graduate College prior to recording the credential on the student's academic record. During the semester of anticipated certificate completion, the student must complete an Application for Certificate Completion, which is submitted to the Office of the Registrar. This action will cause the graduate certificate to be recorded on the official transcript and a certificate will be printed, provided all requirements have been met. 17.6 Special Program – Certificate Program in Education. OSU offers Oklahoma State Department of Education-approved post-bachelor’s certification programs for elementary school principals, school counselors, reading specialists, library/media specialists, and secondary school principals. Certification is also offered in speech and language pathology and in special education. Master’s degrees are available in most of these programs and doctorates are available in many. Post-master’s level certification programs are available for school superintendents and school psychologists. Inquiries concerning any aspect of the Professional Education program should be addressed to the Office of Professional Education at 405-744-6252 or the head of the unit/department/school offering the program. 18.0 Graduate Minors Graduate minors offer students the opportunity to pursue coursework outside, or ancillary to, the requirements for the degree earned. Minors may not be earned independently of a degree granted by OSU. OSU offers graduate minors in the following areas: Agribusiness Agricultural Economics Entomology Plant Pathology Statistics 18.1 Basic Requirements. A graduate minor must include between nine and eighteen hours, inclusive, of coursework eligible for graduate credit. Transfer of courses: No more than one-third of the credit for the minor may be earned through transfer credit of courses taken at other institutions, with the approval of the coordinator of the minor and the dean of the Graduate College. Transfer credit will only be considered if it was earned when the student was post-baccalaureate (i.e., after earning a bachelor’s degree) at another accredited institution. All courses used as transfer credit must have a grade of “B” or better. Grades earned in courses transferred to Oklahoma State University will not be used in calculating the cumulative GPA. 18.2 Academic Standing. A grade-point average of “B” (3.00) is required on courses applicable to a graduate minor. No grade lower than a “C” may be used as part of the minimum requirements for the minor. Individual minors may have more stringent requirements. 18.3 Plan of Study and Minor Completion Procedures. Graduate students can declare a minor by entering it in the appropriate section of an original or revised Plan of Study submitted to the Graduate College prior to conferral of the degree. The pursuit of graduate minors is not denoted on the academic transcript while in progress. Graduate students can file for minor completion in the semester that the required courses for that minor will be finished. At that time, the graduate student should ask the coordinator for that minor area to submit a memorandum to the Graduate College certifying the completion of the minor requirements and listing the courses required for the minor. A notation of the minor will be added to the student’s transcript with the conferral of a degree. The courses required for a graduate minor may be included on a Plan of Study for any graduate degree or they may be in addition to the degree requirements, depending on the overlap between the minor and the degree Plan of Study. However, the graduate minor must be earned in an academic field other than the student’s graduate program or degree option (for example, a graduate student who is majoring in economics could not receive a graduate minor in economics). 18.4 Time Limits. Requirements for the graduate minor must be completed at the time of conferral of the primary degree. All graduate courses used to complete the minor must have been taken within ten years prior to the date of completion of the graduate minor requirements. 19.0 Master’s Degree Programs 19.1 Abbreviations.

The doctoral advisory committee of each candidate may require evidence of proficiency in one or more foreign languages, educational research, statistics and/or computer usage. 21.9 Admission to Doctoral Candidacy. Admission to doctoral candidacy marks the transition into the research phase of a doctoral degree and indicates agreement that the student has demonstrated the ability to do acceptable graduate work and that satisfactory progress has been made toward a degree. Consideration for candidacy requires the presentation of a written research proposal for doctoral research to the doctoral advisory committee, who will assess the proposal and offer the student pertinent counsel, advice and feedback. The approval of the research proposal by the advisory committee is the basic requirement for admission to doctoral candidacy; individual programs will normally impose additional requirements, such as the successful completion of oral and/or written comprehensive or qualifying examinations. These additional requirements may occur in conjunction with the presentation of the research proposal, or they may occur at different times within the course of doctoral study. Admission to doctoral candidacy is conferred with the approval of the dean of the Graduate College, on behalf of the Graduate Council, acting upon the recommendation of program faculty. Admission to candidacy should occur fairly early in the graduate degree program. It is the responsibility of the chair of the advisory committee to notify the Graduate College when admission to candidacy is granted by submitting the Admission to Doctoral Candidacy form. 21.10 Dissertation Hours Taken as a Doctoral Candidate. Admission to candidacy must occur at least six months prior to the date of the final dissertation defense. Since admission to candidacy may occur at various times related to the academic calendar, the student will need to be admitted to candidacy early in the fall semester to be eligible to schedule their final dissertation defense and graduate in the spring; very early in the spring semester for summer graduation; and extremely early in the summer session for fall graduation. (See the Graduate College Calendar for term-specific dates.) If a student is admitted to candidacy prior to the first day of a given term, all dissertation hours taken that term and following may be included in the hours of dissertation research required as a doctoral candidate. 21.11 Dissertation. A dissertation is required of each candidate for the EdD degree. The dissertation has three principal functions: training in research, promoting professional growth, and contributing to professional knowledge in education. Not every dissertation will be expected to serve these three functions in the same way or to the same extent. The format specifications, procedures and regulations for the dissertation are the same as for the PhD. The EdD candidate should refer to the "Doctor of Philosophy" section in the Graduate College chapter of the Catalog on dissertations and submission procedures through the Graduate College. The style of the document is to be determined by the advisory committee and should be reflective of publications in the student’s discipline. Any graduate student writing a dissertation must attend a format workshop prior to submission of their final copy. The dates for the workshops are on the Graduate Calendar and a webinar version is available. 22.0 Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Degree Programs The Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree is granted in recognition of high achievement in scholarship and independent investigation. The student must prove his or her acceptability by: successfully completing a series of courses comprising a Plan of Study; passing various examinations demonstrating academic competence; carrying out a research program under supervision and preparing an acceptable dissertation; and demonstrating initiative, creative intelligence, and ability to plan and carry out research in his or her chosen field. 22.1 Current Degree Inventory. For the current listing of doctoral programs offered at OSU see the Graduate College website: https://gradcollege.okstate.edu/programs/listing-by-degree.html#Doctoral. 22.2 Basic Requirements. The Doctor of Philosophy degree requires the number of credit hours as specified by the degree program with a minimum of 60 credit hours beyond the bachelor’s degree. These hours must include a minimum of 15 dissertation hours (6000) with a grade of “SR.” The maximum number of dissertation hours (6000 with a grade of “SR”) permissible on a Plan of Study must not exceed three-fourths of the total credit hours in the approved graduate degree program. Also, see Section 11.2 for the number of times a course can be used in multiple degree Plans of Study. 22.3 Temporary Advisor. At the beginning of a student's doctoral program, the graduate program will designate a member of the Graduate Faculty to serve as temporary advisor to the student. The temporary advisor will assist the student in the early selection of courses. Often, it is the graduate coordinator who serves as the temporary advisor. 22.4 Advisory Committee. Upon recommendation of the graduate program and approval of the dean of the Graduate College, an advisory committee of not fewer than four voting members will be appointed. The duties of the advisory committee consist of: advising the student, assisting the student in preparing a Plan of Study, assisting in planning and conducting the research, supervising the writing of the dissertation, and conducting the dissertation defense. The chair of the committee need not necessarily serve as the student’s research advisor, but must hold an OSU Graduate Faculty appointment with doctoral chairing privileges, and have familiarity with the academic requirements of the degree sought. Each doctoral advisory committee must have at least one member of the Graduate Faculty from outside the student's major department. To view the roles and responsibilities associated with members of advisory committees, go to https://gradcollege.okstate.edu/resources/best-practices.html. The student should consult the members of the advisory committee frequently keep them informed on the progress of their work. 22.5 Preliminary Conference. As soon as the student is notified that an advisory committee has been approved, the student should arrange with the chairperson for a conference with the committee. During the conference, the preparation and qualifications of the student for graduate work will be discussed and appropriate plans made for future study. 22.6 Plan of Study. The student should develop the Plan of Study with the advisory committee using the online Plan of Study application . The online submission requires approval by the advisory committee and the student’s graduate program with final approval by the Graduate College. The original Plan of Study must be submitted to the Graduate College prior to the end of the third semester (excluding summer sessions) of enrollment in the doctoral program. The plan must include all the acceptable graduate work that has been completed and all that will be taken for the doctoral degree. The Plan of Study must include all the acceptable graduate work that has been completed and all that will be taken for the doctoral degree. The Plan of Study should include: all courses taken at the 5000-6000 level, a minimum of 60 hours beyond the master's degree, and a minimum of 15 (maximum of 45) dissertation hours (6000) with a grade of “SR” for the 60 hour doctorate or a minimum of 15 (maximum of 60) dissertation hours (6000) for the 90 hour doctorate. Courses used to earn a master’s degree are not listed on the doctoral Plan of Study. Credit for all courses on a graduate Plan of Study must have been awarded within 10 years of completion of all degree requirements. Changes in the Plan of Study can be made with the approval of the advisory committee, graduate program, and the dean of the Graduate College. A final, accurate and approved plan must be filed by the eighth week of the semester in which the degree is to be conferred. 22.7 Character of Work. The satisfactory completion of coursework (see "General Regulations") is only one requirement for earning the degree. The student must also: pass a qualifying examination, prepare an acceptable dissertation, demonstrate the ability to do independent study, pass a defense of dissertation, and comply with any other requirements of the graduate program. 22.8 Residency Requirements. A minimum of 30 credit hours must be taken at OSU. While the Graduate College does not have a specific residency requirement that applies to all graduate programs, graduate programs may require a period of time in residence for students enrolled in departmental graduate programs. Programs must inform students of any residence requirements upon their admission to their graduate programs. 22.9 Language Requirement. Foreign language or other proficiency requirements may be specified to meet the need for specific skills and areas of knowledge that facilitate research and contribute to wider understanding. Specific requirements are determined by graduate programs. In many fields, a reading knowledge of one or two modern foreign languages is an important part of scholarship and necessary for research. In other fields, proficiency in special and related disciplines may be required that will contribute to the needs of the individual program. 22.10 Admission to Doctoral Candidacy. Admission to doctoral candidacy marks the transition into the research phase of a doctoral degree and indicates agreement that the student has demonstrated the ability to do acceptable, doctoral-level graduate work and that satisfactory progress has been made toward a degree. Consideration for candidacy requires the presentation of a written research proposal for doctoral research to the doctoral advisory committee, who will assess the proposal and offer the student pertinent counsel, advice and feedback. The approval of the research proposal by the advisory committee is the basic requirement for admission to doctoral candidacy; individual programs will normally impose additional requirements, such as the successful completion of oral and/or written comprehensive or qualifying examinations. These additional requirements may occur in conjunction with the presentation of the research proposal, or they may occur at different times within the course of doctoral study. Admission to doctoral candidacy is conferred with the approval of the dean of the Graduate College, on behalf of the Graduate Council, acting upon the recommendation of program faculty. It is the responsibility of the chair of the advisory committee to notify the Graduate College when admission to candidacy is granted by submitting the Admission to Doctoral Candidacy form. 22.11 Dissertation Hours Taken as a Doctoral Candidate. Admission to candidacy must occur at least six months prior to the date of the final dissertation defense. Since admission to candidacy may occur at various times related to the academic calendar, the student will need to be admitted to candidacy early in fall semester to be eligible to schedule their final dissertation defense and graduate in the spring; very early in the spring semester for summer graduation; and extremely early in the summer session for fall graduation. See the Graduate College Calendar for term-specific dates. 22.12 Dissertation. A dissertation (doctoral thesis) is required of each doctoral candidate. The subject of the dissertation must be approved by the advisory committee and the dissertation is prepared under the direction of members of the committee or a special dissertation committee approved by the advisory committee chair. The dissertation must follow specifications in the Graduate College Thesis/ Dissertation Guidelines, available at http://gradcollege.okstate.edu. The style of the document is to be determined by the advisory committee and should be reflective of publications in the student’s discipline. Any graduate student is writing a dissertation must attend a format and graduation review prior to submission of their final copy. The dates for the reviews are on the Graduate Calendar and a webinar version is also available. All dissertation copies must have the necessary approval signatures before submission to the Graduate College. It is strongly recommended that a graduate student submit complete copies of his or her dissertation to the advisory committee members at least two weeks prior to the defense date, that the defense presentation be publicized, and that the dissertation defense occur on a date during the normal academic semesters and sessions. Graduate programs may have additional or more restrictive requirements for dissertation defenses. The student should submit an electronic copy of the dissertation through the OSU electronic submission website. Instructions for on-line submission are given to the student after completion of the National Survey of Earned Doctorates. In addition, the student must submit to the Graduate College one paper copy of the approval page with all original signatures and the student’s name and CWID number entered at the top of the page. Both the electronic submission and paper approval page must be received no later than the stated final copy submission deadline date (see the Graduate Calendar for dates). 22.13 Final Examination. The student should arrange with the graduate program for the final examination and to distribute a copy of the dissertation as described in the preceding section. The final examination is primarily a defense of the dissertation. If the defense is judged inadequate, a decision on whether to permit re-examination will be made by the advisory committee. Another examination cannot be given for at least two months after a failure, and a graduate program may limit the number of times that the examination may be repeated. If the advisory committee decides against re-examination, the committee’s decision is final. The outcome of the dissertation defense falls under the “professional and scholarly assessment made by faculty and advisory committees” and is not appealable. The committee will notify the Graduate College immediately of results of the final examination. Following satisfactory completion of the final examination, the candidate will make changes in the dissertation as required by the committee and by the Graduate College and submit it in final form signed by the committee to the Graduate College by the semester deadline. Please see the Graduate College’s Best Practices: Advisory Committees and Defenses document for additional guidance.
