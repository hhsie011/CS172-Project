Proposal Review & Submission (OSP) OSP Contacts by Department Proposal Submission Pre-Award Staff in the Office of Sponsored Projects (OSP) are responsible for reviewing and approving all submissions to external sponsors. Brown University currently uses COEUS as its proposal routing and submission system, but is in the process of converting to InfoEd as its new electronic platform for research administration and compliance. OSP utilizes a 5/3 day rule for proposal submission. Proposals (including new, continuation, renewal, revision, resubmission, progress reports, RPPRs, task orders, and supplemental funding) must be routed to OSP for review in a near to final format five days in advance of the sponsored due date. Signed pre-proposals/letters of intent or official budgets (non-draft) must be routed to OSP three days in advance of the sponsor's due date. A more comprehensive description of the 5/3 day rule can be found on the Proposal Submission Policy & Guidelines webpage. During the first three days PI’s may devote extra time to doing a final read‐through and “polishing” of the technical section/science. Proposal Review Pre-Award staff work closely with Department Administrators to ensure proposals meet the highest standard of compliance. Utilizing a set of proposal review checklists, they review each proposal for compliance with the guidelines and policies of the sponsor and Brown. By Day 3 of the process Pre-Award staff email a correction memo with suggested changes to the Department Administrator. A final review is completed after all necessary changes are made and the proposal is approved both internally and externally. Several members of the Pre-Award team are granted authority to submit proposals as Authorized Signatories of Brown University. The required documentation of approval are sent to the sponsor directly by OSP or to the Department Administrator if needed.
