Focusing on its early decades, this centennial exhibition looks back at the Institute’s contributions within Columbia, the broader seminal influence it has had in the founding of Hispanism and Lusophone studies in the American academy, and the pivotal role it has played in fostering cultural exchange and mediating engagement with academics, writers, and artists abroad and at home. The exhibition also highlights the geopolitical dimension of the Institute and its strategic positioning between the economic expansionism of the United States in Latin America and the project of cultural revitalization of Spain after the loss of its colonies. Exhibit Curators: Felipe Becerra, PhD Candidate in Latin American and Iberian Cultures and Sócrates Silva, Latin American & Iberian Studies Librarian. With much gratitude to the staff of the Rare Book & Manuscript Library, Preservation & Digital Conversion, The Barnard Archives & Special Collections, The Hispanic Museum and Library, The Hispanic Institute and staff and faculty of the Department of Latin American and Iberian Cultures.
