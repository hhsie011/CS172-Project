Not reading every book, but reading the collection: how it is organized, what subjects have more texts, what sections see more traffic. Since December 2016, I have been playing the vibrations between student and Library Circulation Assistant. The library is […] Read More… Posted in UncategorizedTagged Behind the Stacks, Burke Library, Collections, library science, Processing, students, Union Theological Serminary1 Comment Circulation Team Re-Orientation: New Year, Fresh Start Posted on February 2, 2018 (February 2, 2018) by Carolyn Bratnober The Burke Library is of course a world-renowned research library and serves as the steward of rare volumes, sacred objects, and archives of Union Theological Seminary and Columbia University. But the Burke is also home to a thriving circulating collection; thousands of books, bound periodicals, microforms, and audio-visual materials change hands at our front desk […] Read More… Posted in Circulation & DeliveryTagged Access, Behind the Stacks, Burke Library, Circulation, Columbia University Libraries, Library of Congress Call Numbers, library science, public service, Shelving, students, Union Theological Seminary, work-studyLeave a comment Behind the Stacks: Born’s Natural History of Monks Posted on January 26, 2018 (April 15, 2020) by Myong Jin Browsing our special collections stacks surfaced this amusing plate depicting what at first glance looks like random shorts, sandals, and… rope? The book is Ignaz Edler von Born’s Specimen of the natural history of the various orders of monks, printed in London in 1783. It turns out to be a satirical, anticlerical pamphlet that describes […] Read More… Posted in Rare booksTagged Behind the Stacks, CollectionsLeave a comment Behind the Stacks: You had me at “charts” Posted on July 14, 2017 (April 15, 2020) by Myong Jin Since my last “Behind the Stacks” entry on R. C. Shimeall’s A Complete Ecclesiastical Chart, I have been noticing more charts, awkward formats, and too-large items within our special collections. As a redux of that post, here featured is another circular chart of history and yet another exhaustive production from Shimeall. Enjoy the images!

One item I happened to find recently was too large and unwieldy to simply peek at, and since there’s no telling when some reader will next request […] Read More… Posted in Rare booksTagged Behind the Stacks, Collections2 Comments Behind the Stacks: Acts of the Saints Posted on February 17, 2017 (July 14, 2017) by Myong Jin In the course of preparing more of Burke’s rare books for preservation boxes, I came across a set of the Acta Sanctorum (published from 1643 to 1794) with each volume holding a small piece of waste paper behind the title page. It’s not unusual to find random scraps of paper stuck in the pages of […] Read More… Posted in Rare booksTagged Behind the Stacks, CollectionsLeave a comment Behind the Stacks: Church Missionary Juvenile Instructor Posted on September 2, 2016 (February 17, 2017) by Myong Jin Children’s missionary periodicals have some of the most charming, amusing, and eyebrow-raising content I’ve come across in the Burke Library’s collections. The Church Missionary Juvenile Instructor is one in particular that caught my eye with the delightful cover shown above. The Burke has fairly comprehensive holdings of this periodical, which was published in London by […] Read More… Posted in UncategorizedTagged Behind the Stacks, Collections1 Comment Behind the Stacks: literally Posted on July 7, 2016 (February 17, 2017) by Myong Jin Sometimes the most interesting views are not the front of bookshelves with all the book spines facing outward, but rather the back, where you can find various edge decorations, hardware, and conditions that make for a visual treat. I often find these during shelf maintenance tasks that involve removing a range of books from a shelf, […] Read More… Posted in UncategorizedTagged Behind the Stacks, CollectionsLeave a comment Behind the Stacks: Manuscript facsimile Posted on June 10, 2016 (February 17, 2017) by Myong Jin In youth, I spent interminable hours copying out by hand long passages of the Bible for Sunday school. I also remember dutifully copying out lecture notes in school and feeling grateful for mechanical pencils (no sharpening!). These days, I use my phone to snap a picture of some text, printed or handwritten, and in a […] Read More… Posted in Rare booksTagged Behind the Stacks, Collections, ManuscriptsLeave a comment 1 2 » Search Quick Links Staff Contributors Student Bloggers Recent Posts The Construction and Evolution of the UTS Campus: a Re-Imagined Exhibit Union Seminary Quarterly Review (USQR) Archive Gratian’s “Decretum” and the Foundations of Christian Legal Education Looking Back & Looking Forward Belonging As a Latinx Seminarian Archives April 2022 March 2022 February 2022 December 2021 November 2021 September 2021 May 2021 April 2021 March 2021 February 2021 January 2021 May 2020 April 2020 March 2020 February 2020 January 2020 November 2019 October 2019 September 2019 August 2019 July 2019 June 2019 May 2019 April 2019 March 2019 February 2019 December 2018 November 2018 October 2018 September 2018 May 2018 April 2018 March 2018 February 2018 January 2018 December 2017 September 2017 August 2017 July 2017 June 2017 May 2017 April 2017 March 2017 February 2017 January 2017 December 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 Tags Archives Behind the Stacks Burke Archives Burke Library COVID-19 CUL Graduate Student Internship CUL Graduate Student Internship Program Diary ecumenism Exhibits FMCNA German Graduate Intern History Imperialism India Instruction interns Journal library science Luce Luce Foundation Manuscripts Missionaries Missions More Product Less Process MRL MRL3 MRL10 MRL12 Native Americans NCC prisoners of war Processing Rare Books Special Collections students Union Theological Seminary Union Theological Serminary UNP WAB war Water Disaster WCC work-study Subscribe2 Leave This Blank:Leave This Blank Too:Do Not Change This: Your email: Category Specific RSS Archives (41) Burke Library History (10) Burke Staff (8) Circulation & Delivery (4) Collections (2) Events (1) History (38) Manuscripts (4) Rare books (30) Student Entry (86) Student projects (1) Uncategorized (2) Union Theological Seminary History (25) CUL Blogs Home CUL Blogs Dashboard 535 West 114th St. New York, NY 10027 | Telephone (212) 854-7309 | Fax (212) 854-9099 Copyright | Policies | Suggestions & Feedback | Contact Us | About Us
