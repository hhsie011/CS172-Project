It emphasizes the application of mathematics, chemistry and engineering to paper and bioresources-based industries. BSE is a capacity-constrained major. Its curriculum is compatible with a fifth-year, double degree with chemical engineering and provides extensive faculty contact and active student groups and is an engineering program accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET. Please contact chemical engineering student advisors if you plan to apply for a double-degree in BSE and chemical engineering. The BSE Course Checklist, faculty list, and a number of other important documents relevant to students in the program can be found on the BSE Courses page. The BSE program focuses on the development of process engineers who optimize the manufacture of value added products from sustainable natural resources. Students learn the fundamentals of science and engineering related to the conversion of biomass to fuels, chemicals, and pulp and paper products with a strong research component. Check out this video from recent graduate Jackie Kobal about her BSE experience! BSE graduates begin careers in manufacturing, engineering, technical service and management training. Positions include process engineer, technical sales engineer, product development engineer, environmental engineer or scientist and research engineer as well as many other specialties that require a fundamental chemical engineering background. BSE students are supported by the Washington Pulp and Paper Foundation for scholarships, internships and a path to full-time employment. For more information, view the frequently asked questions about the BSE major and view scholarship opportunities for SEFS students and those available to BSE students only.
