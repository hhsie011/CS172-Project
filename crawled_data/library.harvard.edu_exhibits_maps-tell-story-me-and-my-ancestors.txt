The Philip Hofer Prize is awarded each year to students at Harvard whose collections of books or works of art best exemplify the traditions of breadth, coherence, and imagination represented by Philip Hofer, AB ’21, LHD ’67, founder and first Curator of the Department of Printing and Graphic Arts in the Houghton Library and Secretary of the Fogg Art Museum. The prize, which is to encourage student interest in collecting, was established in 1987 by Melvin R. Seiden, A.B. ’52, LLB ’55. Students competing for the prize submit an annotated list or bibliography and an essay describing the scope, contents, and goal of the collection.
