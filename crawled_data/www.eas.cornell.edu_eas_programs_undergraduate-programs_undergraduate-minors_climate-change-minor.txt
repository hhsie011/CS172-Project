The climate change minor gives students the opportunity to explore climate change from varied disciplinary perspectives while gaining a firm grounding in the basic physical, ecological, and social science as well as its interactions with history, philosophy and the arts. Based in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, the minor is available to all Cornell undergraduates. The minor is offered collaboratively with classes across campus coordinated by Peter Hess (BEE/CALS), Christy Goodale (EEB/A+S), Natalie Mahowald (EAS/ENG), Karen Pinkus (COML/A+S), and David Wolfe (HORT/CALS). This coordinating committee can add or subtract courses from this list, based on proposals by professors or students. The minor is administered by the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences. A brief meeting with one of the climate change coordinating faculty as you plan your minor is required. During your final semester (or earlier if you have already completed your minor requirements), you should submit a completed climate change minor certification form to Sierra Henry in 2102 Snee Hall for approval. Please contact Sierra Henry (slh297@cornell.edu) with any questions about the minor certification process and to obtain the climate change minor certification form. Contacts: Curricular topics: Natalie Mahowald (nmm63@cornell.edu) Administration: Sierra Henry (slh297@cornell.edu) Minor Requirements Many courses across Cornell deal with the multi-facets of climate change. The minor is structured such that students without prerequisites can obtain the minor, thus enabling students from most any major at Cornell to obtain the minor. If the minor requirements change during a student's time at Cornell, the student may request to complete the minor under the old requirements. To do so, the student should contact Sierra Henry (slh297@cornell.edu). This minor requires that students complete at least 18 credits of appropriate coursework as follows: 1. BEE 2000 Perspectives on the Climate Change Challenge (1 credit spring seminar consisting of public lectures on climate change) 2. At least one course in each of the following categories: Category 1: Physical Science Behind Climate Change Category 2: Ecosystems and Climate Change Category 3: Humans and Climate Change 3. Additional courses to meet the 18 credit requirement, chosen from the broad list (Categories 1-4) below.

Courses marked with ** only require 1 year of math, physics or chemistry (most students in engineering or physical science should be able to take). Courses marked with *** require 1 semester of biology (students in life sciences should be able to take). Courses without asterisks may have multiple prerequisites. If a student would like a new course to be considered for the minor, they should email Professor Natalie Mahowald (nmm63@cornell.edu) and Sierra Henry (slh297@cornell.edu) with the course syllabus and a statement from the instructor indicating that at least 20% of the course content is about climate change. Only Cornell classes, and some transfer classes, count towards the minor. AP credit cannot be used towards the minor. No more than 3 unstructured credits can count towards the minor.
