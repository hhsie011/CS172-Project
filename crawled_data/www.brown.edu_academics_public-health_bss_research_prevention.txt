Interventions are created to decrease the longer term risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and hypertension, as well as shorter term markers such as biochemical markers such as hemoglobin A1C, blood sugar, cholesterol, triglycerides and anthropometric or clinical measures such as blood pressure, body fatness, waist circumference and weight measures. Additionally, long term risk of many types of cancer are studied. Some infectious diseases, such as HIV and Hepatitis C have become chronic in their treatment plans. In addition to these health outcomes, shorter term behaviors of screening for chronic diseases as or adherence to clinical care guidelines are often targeted.
