The college is pursuing diversity initiatives with renewed vigor and is striving to be at the forefront of change in academia. The Guarini School is committed to developing a climate that acknowledges and embraces diversity, supporting a culture that fosters inclusion, and actively pursuing equity. Our commitment is driven by recognition of historical injustices and a firm belief that welcoming differences of opinion, experience, identity, and perspectives helps build a stronger community. To that end we have updated our Diversity Commitment and Plan. You can view the document HERE and a full list of all Guarini-supported initiatives can be viewed HERE (pdf). If you would like to become more involved, we invite all our community members to join our Diversity Committee meetings. Information and schedule for those can be found HERE. And we encourage you to email us HERE. Graduate students at Dartmouth’s commencement ceremony.
