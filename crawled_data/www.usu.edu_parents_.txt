We do this by providing Parent Orientation, Parent Publications & Podcasts, and Deferment & Notification of Leave Outreach. We provide parents and families with these resources to promote student success and independence at any stage in their studentâ€™s academic career at Utah State University.

The goal of the Speaking Parent Orientation is to help accommodate our parents and incoming students who are more comfortable asking questions in Spanish. This year our Spanish Speaking Parent orientation will be held in August TBA in the TSC Ballroom. The event consists of a boxed take home dinner, a few presentations, and an information fair, where parents and students can ask questions and get information.

Notification of Leave & Deferment The Notification of Leave Office assists undergraduate students who wish to take a break from their studies for one or more semesters (other than summer semester), for a variety of reasons.
