Carskadon received a BA in psychology from Gettysburg College (1969), is a distinguished alumna of that institution, and holds an honorary doctor of sciences degree. She holds a doctorate with distinction in neuro- and biobehavioral sciences from Stanford University (1979), earned under the mentorship of William C. Dement, MD, PhD. Carskadon’s early research with her graduate mentor, William C. Dement, culminated in the development and application of a standardized measure for daytime sleep tendency, the multiple sleep latency test. A major focus of Dr. Carskadon’s scientific activities is research examining interrelations between the circadian timing system and sleep/wake patterns of children, adolescents, and young adults. Her findings have raised public health issues regarding the consequences of insufficient sleep for adolescents as well as concerns about early starting times of schools.Her work has affected education policy, prompting the AAP and others to promote later school timing for adolescents and many school districts to delay school start times. Carskadon has written many scientific papers, and she has received a number of honors, including Lifetime Achievement Award of the National Sleep Foundation, Outstanding Educator and Distinguished Scientist Awards of the Sleep Research Society. She is an elected Fellow of the Association for Psychological Science and Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. She is also the inaugural editor-in-chief of the Sleep Research Society's new gold open access journal: SLEEP Advances. Carskadon is the Director of the COBRE Center for Sleep and Circadian Rhythms in Child and Adolescent Mental Health at EP Bradley Hospital, funded by the NIH, NIGMS since April, 2021. The primary goal of the Center is to establish and build a comprehensive and sustainable resource to support the growth of pediatric sleep, circadian rhythms, and mental health research while providing mentorship of junior Research Project Leaders for research and for transitioning to independent scientific careers with external funding. Extending the reach and accelerating the growth of a cadre of clinical scientists with multidisciplinary training and with the infrastructure to support advancement to independent research careers shows great promise to improve the health and well-being of children and adolescents and their families.

Another project examines sleep behavior and physiology and circadian timing in a project to study sleep-health disparities in urban children with asthma. Studies of sleep patterns in adolescents and adults at risk for suicide frames another aspect of current research Another study measures the impact of auditory and visual stimuli on EEG in youth with ADHD. Another project examines individualized circadian rhythm therapy using schedule-sensitive photic interventions in share workspaces, as par of an NSF STTR Phase I project. A recent initiative supports a COBRE Center for Sleep and Circadian Rhythms in Child and Adolescent Mental Health, with several research projects and core support services.
