We strongly encourage you to review the financing options offered by Brown. The Bursar's Office requires payment by August 1 for fall semester and by January 1 for spring semester. All aid, regardless of source or origination, must be credited first toward University-billed charges, such as tuition, fees, and room and board. If you will owe a balance after deducting your anticipated financial aid from these charges, consider these payment options and resources. Federal Student Loans The Direct Loan program provides low-interest loans to qualifying students to assist with paying for educational expenses. Even if a student was not offered a federal student loan in the initial financial aid package, U.S. citizens and permanent residents may be eligible to borrow either a subsidized or unsubsidized Federal Direct Loan. To request the Direct loan(s), the student needs to log in to Banner Self-Service, go to the Financial Aid Tab, and submit a Loan Request to the Office of Financial Aid. After the Financial Aid Office reviews the request, they will post a loan offer and the student would then log back in to accept (or decline) as needed. Detailed information about these loans, including maximum borrowing limits, is available on the Loan Office website. Additional Resources Brown 20th Century Loan Limited funding for a Brown 20th Century Loan may be available to high-need students. Students interested in this loan also should contact the Office of Financial Aid to discuss possible eligibility. Private Student Loans Private credit-based educational loans are offered by private lenders or state loan authorities to undergraduate students for the purpose of financing educational costs. Federal Direct PLUS Loans The Federal Direct PLUS Loan is available for qualifying parents, guardians and graduate students who wish to borrow all or a portion of the cost of education.
