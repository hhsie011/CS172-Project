If translations are needed, it is your responsibility to have the credentials translated by a reputable translation and evaluation service. Syracuse University will not provide translations for you. A key to the marking system or grading scale should also be included if it is not indicated on the transcript. Please note that students completing the British curriculum are not eligible to apply upon completion of the IGCSE/GCSE – we require at least one additional year of education.

Standardized Tests The SAT/ACT is not required* of any student studying outside the U.S. (including U.S. citizens living abroad) and currently enrolled in a school that does not follow the American system of education. If your native language is not English you must take one of the following English proficiency exams: TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) IELTS (International English Language Testing System) Cambridge English Language Assessment PTE (Pearson Test of English) Duolingo English Test If you are a U.S. citizen and your native language is not English, you are also strongly encouraged to take one of these exams to demonstrate your proficiency. More specific information on English proficiency requirements is provided below. English Proficiency English proficiency exam score reports must be sent directly to the University from the testing service. Due to testing centers administering TOEFL and IELTS exams closing due to the coronavirus, we are now accepting the Duolingo English Test for the spring/fall 2022 . This is a convenient, fast, and affordable option. The exam can be taken anywhere provided you have a computer and a quiet work space. Use ID code 2823 when requesting your official TOEFL scores from ETS. Please note that at this time, Syracuse University does not use “MyBest” TOEFL scores to fulfill English proficiency requirements; students who submit the TOEFL must meet our requirements within one exam session. Syracuse University is currently accepting the At Home decision of the TOEFL exam. Please note that the TOEFL Essentials or ITP exam, TOEFL My Best Score and IELTS Indicator are not accepted as proof of English proficiency.

Waiver approval is not guaranteed, so it is recommended that you take the TOEFL, IELTS, Cambridge, or PTE Academic as part of the application process if your native language is not English. Financial Requirements If you are an international applicant who requires an F-1 Student Visa to come to Syracuse, you must submit documentation that demonstrates the ability to fund your education for one full academic year. International students intending to apply for an F-1 student visa must complete the Visa/Financial Support Information Form and submit it along with a bank statement or letter indicating proof of liquid funds. Photocopies of financial documentation are acceptable. Please include a copy of your passport with the financial documents you send us. Be sure to write your name, date of birth, and name of the program to which you are applying on all documents you send. You may fax documents to +1.315.443.3423 or scan and e-mail to orange@syr.edu . Details: Please refer to the cost of attendance for international students . The estimated cost of attendance for the 2022-23 academic year will be finalized in March 2022. Students applying for spring/fall 2022 must show sufficient funds to meet your first-year expenses at Syracuse University per the University's current estimate of $81,939 for the 2022-2023 academic year. The amount that applicants must show is the total cost of attendance for the semester to which they are applying. Please note that you will also be responsible for all costs associated with your additional years required for completion of your degree. If you are a privately or personally sponsored applicant, acceptable proof of finances may be a bank statement or signed letter of support from a bank that states the account holdings meet the minimum total cost of attendance to fund your first-year expenses at Syracuse University. It is not necessary for the bank statement to show the amount in US dollars; however, the currency does need to be clearly indicated. The print date of the statement must be within a year of the start of the term to which you are applying. Although the statement addresses only the first year of funding, you will be responsible for all costs associated with attaining your degree. A statement of income or earnings does not constitute proof of sufficient funds. If you are a government-sponsored applicant, you must submit a certified copy of the award letter that includes the U.S. dollar amount of the award per year, the duration of the award, and a list of expenses covered by the award. Please refer to the cost of attendance for international students . In addition to the above expenses, you should plan on expenses for the winter break and summer months. If you are returning to your home country or are traveling to another location, you should anticipate those additional expenses. International applicants will also be considered for merit scholarships . Personal Interviews (Optional) Interviews are not a requirement for admission to Syracuse University. Students who would like the opportunity to add an interview to their application portfolio can contact the Office of Admissions at orange@syr.edu for details. Students in Asia may arrange for an interview with Vericant . Syracuse University, in partnership with Vericant, provides in-person interview opportunities for international applicants interested in showcasing English skills and professionalism to the admissions team. We also accept InitialView interviews . Conditional Admission You may be granted conditional admission to Syracuse University if the academic requirements for admission have been met, but there is insufficient English proficiency and/or insufficient financial support to be fully admitted to your program. Only those students who have submitted an official TOEFL, IELTS, Cambridge, or PTE Academic score may be considered for conditional admission. Conditionally admitted students are not considered fully admitted to the University and will not be issued the SEVIS I-20 form (the form that is needed to obtain the F-1 Student Visa) until the University receives the necessary official English proficiency credentials and/or the necessary proof of sufficient funding. It is not guaranteed that space will still be available at the time a student meets the condition. Student Visas and Immigration Upon admission: If you are at another institution in the United States in F-1 immigration status: Your school will need to transfer your SEVIS record to Syracuse University by ‘Releasing Your Record.’ This would happen on a date that you and the international student advisor at your current school agree upon. Most importantly, to maintain your legal status, you must be released from your current school and Syracuse University must issue a ‘Transfer Pending I-20’ no later than 60 days after your program end date (likely the last day of final exams or the graduation date at your previous school). You and your current international student advisor can notify Syracuse University of your intent to transfer by accessing the “ Transfer-In Form ” which has to be completed by you and your advisor at your current school. It is also important to remember that if you are going back to your home country between the time you finish at your current school and the date you are coming to Syracuse University, you need to enter the United States with the I-20 of Syracuse University. If you are going home and your current F-1 visa is valid, you do not need to apply for a new visa. However, if your F-1 visa is expired and you are leaving the U.S. and re-entering, you do need to apply for a new F-1 Student Visa. See the directions below for applying for a Non-immigrant Visa. If you have been studying outside the United States prior to coming to Syracuse University: You will need an I-20 (Certificate of Eligibility for Non-immigrant Student Status) in order to apply for your student visa at your nearest U.S. embassy or consulate. When you receive the I-20 from the Center for International Services, directions will be provided on exactly how you apply for the visa and what documents you need. For further information, visit the Center for International Services . Forms Visa/Financial Support Information Form Related Pages College-Specific Requirements Prospective students of the School of Architecture, some programs in the College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Engineering and Computer Sciences, and the College of Visual and Performing Arts, have additional application requirements to be aware of. Cost of Attendance for International Students The cost of attendance is an estimate of what it will cost for a international undergraduate student to attend Syracuse University for an academic year.
