And this new knowledge is not simply lab experiments, or journal articles, or textbooks. New knowledge lives in people, most especially in our outstanding students. Throughout our academic, research, and community programs, we seek to build a culture of collaboration and inclusivity, supported by pillars of People, Partnerships, and Translation. Our focus is the holistic success of our students and alumni through life-long learning and engagement. Our path forward is challenging, but our future lights the way. Forge Ahead. James R.
