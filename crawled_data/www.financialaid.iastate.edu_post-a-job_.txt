Full-time or permanent positions will not be advertised here. Employers may post jobs advertisements on the Student Job Board as an easy way to find student employees. On-Campus Employers On-Campus employers may post job advertisements by completing the following steps: Log in to AccessPlus Click the ‘u-Business’ Tab. Select ‘Student Employment’. Enter the Employer ID and click ‘Post Job’. The Employer ID is the same as the university departmental code. If unsure, click ‘Select Employer ID’ to browse all codes. Employers may also browse the Student Job Board in the Student Employment Section of AccessPlus. If you are an on-campus employer, please apply directly through AccessPlus. Off-Campus Employers Off campus employers can use our online job posting form to submit a job to the student job board. On campus employers should post directly from AccessPlus. CyHire The Student Job Board is ideal for part-time jobs in the community and surrounding area. For positions geared more toward full-time, post-graduation work or internships, a separate system called CyHire is used. CyHire is an online, career management system operated by Career Services at Iowa State. With this system, employers can post positions, schedule on-campus interviews and supply information that students may find useful when evaluating whether to apply for a particular position.
