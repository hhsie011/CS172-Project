Project Director and Editor: Ben Jacks, Educating from the Group Up: The Places that Sustain Us Root Us to the Earth Current Faculty Research Latinos Unidos por la Salud (LU-Salud) Latinos Unidos por la Salud (LU-Salud) is a community-based participatory research project where Drs. Lisa Vaughn and Farrah Jacquez (UC Psychology) have partnered with a Latinx immigrant community research team to understand barriers and strengths to health care and help-seeking behaviors in Cincinnati. The community research team is composed of 17 Latinx immigrants from the community who have been trained in conducting research and making change in their communities. Youth Council for Suicide Prevention The Youth Council for Suicide Prevention (YCSP) was developed by Dr. Lisa Vaughn in 2013. Since 2013, the YCSP has used a youth participatory action research framework to engage young people in critical reflection and action around the issue of adolescent suicide in Cincinnati. The YCSP has collaborated with ECAR graduate student facilitators and is hosted by the community advocacy organization, 1N5. The YCSP is comprised of 30+ youth from different local high schools who design and participate in various research and action projects centered on suicide prevention. Past projects have included: advising researchers on suicide screening in the emergency department through questionnaires and concept mapping, interviewing peers about effective suicide prevention communication strategies, surveying peers and parents about effective strategies for encouraging communication about suicide prevention, and presenting research and workshops at five regional high school conferences. Youth Built Change (YBC) YBC is a program funded by the National Institutes of Health to increase diversity in the STEM workforce (NIH R25OD023763-01; Dr. Farrah Jacquez (PI); Dr. Lisa Vaughn (Co-I; leadership team). YBC engages students in their junior year from Princeton High School (PHS) in metro Cincinnati and Manchester High School (MHS) in rural Adams County in a year-long research process investigating drug abuse and addiction in local communities. YBC student researchers use their experiences and observations to develop their own research questions and design, collect and analyze quantitative and/or qualitative data, and present their findings in both academic and community settings. The basis of YBC is that engaging students in research with real-world implications will increase the likelihood that students enroll in college and choose STEM careers that allow them to use science to make a difference in their communities. Participatory Inquiry as a Space for Adult Jewish Learning Miriam Raider-Roth, Mindy Gold, Mary Brydon-Miller, Gail Z. Dorph This project explores the theory, practice, and possibilities of the Future Creating Workshop (FCW) process, a participatory research method that invites diverse stakeholders to address key issues in their communities through a shared inquiry of envisioning the future. The first phase of this project focused on developing online applications of this methodology. In the current phase, we are working together with members of the Mandel Teacher Educator Institute (MTEI) community to examine how the FCW online process can harness diverse perspectives and creative visioning in order to plan and enact action based on data. We are studying how this collaborative, creative, learner/participant-driven FCW process can galvanize educational leaders to innovate, as part of becoming stronger, more effective leaders of Jewish educational organizations. In so doing, we contend that participatory inquiry processes are innovative spaces for adult learning. Studying the Learning Trajectories of Jewish Educators Enrolled in a Two-Year Professional Development Program: A Practitioner Action Research Study Project Manager and PI: Allison Lester, PI Miriam Raider-Roth, Sharon Feiman-Nemser, Jeff Stanzler, Gail Dorph This research study seeks to understand the nature of participants’ learning in Mandel Teacher Educator Institute’s two-year professional development program for educational leaders in the North American Jewish community. The findings of this study contribute to MTEI’s knowledge building by providing new understandings of the ways in which participants in this two-year professional development program generate new knowledge and use their learning in their practice. This research study aims to help MTEI participants develop a strong inquiry stance on their learning, be able to readily identify evidence of their learning, and potentially help their own teachers take such an inquiry stance as well.
