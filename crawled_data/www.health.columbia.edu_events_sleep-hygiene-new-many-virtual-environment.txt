The stress of change, new environments, and different time zones can impact an individual’s sleep patterns. In the current climate, many Columbia students may be trying to establish new routines and schedules, including those for sleep. Join Alice! Health Promotion for a conversation about the critical role of sleep and how to establish healthy practices while navigating a new (for many) physical and remote learning environment. Participants will have space to learn from each other and share strategies for improving healthy sleep patterns while establishing new schedules and routines. By the end of the session, we intend for participants to be able to: • Describe how sleep affects daily function. • Assess their current sleep patterns. • Identify environmental factors that may negatively impact an individual’s sleep patterns. • List strategies for improving sleep quality. **If you are interested in participating in this open workshop, please register to receive the Zoom invitation.
