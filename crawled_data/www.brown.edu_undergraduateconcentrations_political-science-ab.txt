What is the American dream? Political science is about questions like these. You can grapple with every one of them — and many more — in the classrooms of the Brown political science department. We study how people — nations, regions, cities, communities — live their common lives. How people solve (or duck) their common problems. How people govern themselves. How they think, talk, argue, fight, and vote. Students passionate about social challenges may also choose to pursue the Engaged Scholars Program, which allows them to connect theory and practice and gain hands-on experience working with community partners.
