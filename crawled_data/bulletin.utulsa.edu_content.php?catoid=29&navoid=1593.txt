Sorem, Jr., Dean Mission Accreditation Collegiate Academic Policies Academic Units and Programs The College of Engineering and Natural Sciences has diversified undergraduate programs in applied mathematics, biochemistry, biogeosciences, biology, chemical engineering, chemistry, computer science, computer simulation and gaming, computer engineering, electrical engineering, engineering physics, geosciences, information technology, mathematics, mechanical engineering, petroleum engineering, and physics. The overall academic approach in the College of Engineering and Natural Sciences is to encourage curiosity and to transform that curiosity into love of learning. A distinguishing characteristic of our academic programs is the opportunity for undergraduate students to participate in meaningful research with professors. Our classes are taught by faculty members who recognize and address individual student instructional needs. Mission The mission of the College of Engineering and Natural Sciences is to provide a modern, high-quality educational experience for all of our students. We provide the knowledge and principles on which engineering and science are founded in order to graduate engineers and scientists who are technically competent, creative, literate, ethically informed, and socially aware. Accreditation The Bachelor of Science degree programs in chemical engineering, electrical engineering, engineering physics, mechanical engineering, and petroleum engineering are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org. The Bachelor of Science degree program in computer science is accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org. The Bachelor of Science degree programs in chemistry and biochemistry are approved by the American Chemical Society. Collegiate Academic Policies Students enrolled in the College of Engineering and Natural Sciences must follow all University academic policies as well as College-specific academic policies .
