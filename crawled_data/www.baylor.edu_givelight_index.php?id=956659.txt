Baylor’s alumni, parents, faculty, staff, and friends have chosen to make a transformational difference in the future of this institution through the Give Light Campaign, a $1.1 billion and counting comprehensive campaign. The Give Light Campaign has already provided resources, faculty endowment and scholarships that helped propel Baylor to Research 1 status. Gifts from the Baylor Family, of every size, combine to create exciting opportunities for our students and faculty. There is more to do. Guided by Illuminate, our strategic plan, Baylor can build infrastructure, secure enduring endowment support and open doors for students that will turn this spark into a flame that burns bright for generations to come. Endowed Funds Endowment is critical to securing our future. Investment in endowment will lay a foundation upon which future generations will grow in their knowledge and pursuit of their life's calling. Capital Projects Critical resources are needed to support facilities and infrastructure for growth in research and programs that contribute solutions to problems facing an ever-changing world and prepare graduates as leaders in their fields. President's Excellence Fund Gifts to the President's Excellence Fund create the ability for the University to meet tangible needs beyond tuition support for students or programs that may need a boost of support. Initiatives Baylor stands apart as a Christian research university - a position that empowers our aspiration to become the world's preeminent Christian research university. Academic Units Advancing the work of Baylor's schools and colleges is a cornerstone of Give Light. Each academic unit will develop and pursue priorities that enhance collaboration, cultivate scholarship, provide opportunities for growth in undergraduate and graduate education, and yield outcomes that advance our society. Foster Academic Challenge The Foster Academic Challenge's purpose is to spark the funding and creation of new endowed faculty positions at Baylor University. Hord Scholarship Challenge The Hord Scholarship Challenge calls upon the Baylor Family to give $30 million in scholarship support for Baylor students. Trailblazer Scholars Program The Trailblazer Scholars Program is designed to recognize the importance of fostering diversity and mutual respect at Baylor University.
