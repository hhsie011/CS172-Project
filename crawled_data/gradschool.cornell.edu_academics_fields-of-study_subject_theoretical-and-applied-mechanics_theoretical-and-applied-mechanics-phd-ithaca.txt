Course work provides a broad education in the mechanics of rigid and deformable bodies, applied mathematics, and modern experimental techniques. Current research topics include solid mechanics (modeling of manufacturing processes, quantitative ultrasonic and acoustic emission techniques, fracture mechanics, composite materials, mechanics of human-powered vehicles, nonlinear elasticity); fluid mechanics (granular materials, strongly swirling flows); dynamics and space mechanics (evolution of the solar system, planetary rings, and rotation of celestial bodies, qualitative analysis of dynamic problems in nonlinear mechanics, bifurcations, chaos); and biomechanics and biomathematics (respiration of plants, how fishes swim). All students are required to minor in at least one subject from a field outside of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics. Frequently selected minors are aerospace engineering, applied mathematics, applied physics, astronomy, electrical and computer engineering, geophysics, materials science, mathematics, mechanical engineering, physics, and structural engineering. Ph.D. students take a qualifying examination. For incoming students with a Bachelor's degree, the examination is usually held after they have completed two semesters of graduate studies at Cornell. For incoming students with a Master's degree, the examination is held after they have completed one semester of graduate studies at Cornell. Two semesters of teaching experience are required.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
