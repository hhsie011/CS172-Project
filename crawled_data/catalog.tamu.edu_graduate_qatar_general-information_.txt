In the first semester, students meet with their faculty advisor to determine what courses should be taken as many of the initial courses are prescribed. More information can be found at https://www.qatar.tamu.edu/graduate-studies. The Association of Former Students The Association of Former Students traces its history to the Ex-Cadets Association that formed in 1879, and later to the A&M Alumni Association and Alpha Phi Fraternity.
