For further information contact Thomas Stieve. This exhibit featured some of the over 1,000 maps rediscovered at the John Hay Library. The collection represents the world throughout the time these maps were collected by Brown University. Two-thirds of the maps are from the 1800s and early 1900s, with a major focus on the United States and Europe. The local collection for southern New England is also noteworthy. Some of the more exceptional maps are a Nazi tourism map, a map cited by Herman Melville in writing Moby Dick, and an anti-slavery map donated to the Library by the family of an abolitionist who graduated from Brown in 1831. This historic map collection is featured in a February 13, 2007 Providence Journal article -- "The course of history - Brown's rediscovered maps tell tale".
