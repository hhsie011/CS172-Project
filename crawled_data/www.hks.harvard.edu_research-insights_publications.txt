A new working paper from Linda Bilmes explains how high rates of disability, greater outreach and benefit compensation, and more complex medical care have resulted in massive long-term costs. Feature: Strategic Partisans How do politicians use ideological communication to present a strategic version of themselves to voters? A new article from Justin de Benedictis-Kessner details how this practice extends to local politicians—and how it threatens accountability. Feature: Who Will Fill China’s Shoes? Gordon Hanson writes, “the world may again be on the cusp of significant change in where labor-intensive goods are produced.” His new working paper examines the changing face of manufacturing in East Asia. Feature: How to Construct A New Global Order “In our view, it is possible to envisage a global order that is largely peaceful and broadly beneficial yet leaves significant room for individual states to pursue their own interests and attend to their own needs.” A new working paper from HKS’ Dani Rodrik and Stephen Walt examines the changing global order—and how to design a new one. Harvard Kennedy School faculty disseminate their research in working publications and papers that contribute to public knowledge and fuel policy innovation.
