Further, students entering their first year in either the Fall 2021 or Spring 2022 term will not have to pay the swim-test fee to take their test at a later date. Additional information regarding Classes and Campus Activities for Winter 2022 and Spring 2022 Winter 2022 courses generally will be conducted online. Spring 2022 instruction generally will be conducted in-person and students therefore should make suitable arrangements to be present for in-person learning for the entire semester. Please be aware, however, the University reserves the right, as it deems necessary, to adjust course modality over the period of the semester to respond to changes in health and safety risk factors and regulatory requirements. By enrolling in my classes for either the Winter 2022 term or Spring 2022 semester, or both semesters, I understand and acknowledge the following: It is my responsibility to review all course information prior to the start of the semester, including but not limited to any updated information concerning the format in which and duration for which courses are anticipated to be offered; Other than when isolating or quarantining because of health and safety concerns, I will be expected to participate in each course in the format in which the course is offered (even if that format changes over the course of the semester); At any time, Cornell may change the format or duration of my courses based on factors including but not limited to health or safety concerns, the judgment of the instructor, instructor status, pedagogical needs, or student enrollment numbers; It is my responsibility to make course enrollment changes (e.g. drop, withdraw, adjust credits, or change grading basis, if available) if I do not think I can participate fully in a course in the format in which it is offered; Absent compelling circumstances, students, including me, are expected to take exams in person (unless the instructor, in their discretion, provides for an online or take-home exam modality). It is the responsibility of students, including me, to timely obtain approval and coordinate exemptions to in-person exams with the appropriate university unit, college and/or instructor; At any time, Cornell may restrict or prohibit student access to certain Cornell University-maintained facilities or services based on factors including but not limited to health or safety concerns; There may be disruptions or cancellations of campus services, programs, activities, or events; Students, including me, must follow all applicable university policies or rules (including the Student Code of Conduct and all campus health and safety requirements), and by failing to abide by all such policies and rules, students, including me, may have their access restricted to Canvas, university- maintained facilities, enrollment activity, campus services, programs, activities, or other campus events; Cornell may be required to shift all classes to an online or hybrid format, or modify the duration of the semester, if Cornell or the government (at the local, state, or federal level) determines for any reason that continued in-person instruction is unsafe. Finally, I understand, acknowledge, and agree that in no case will there be a tuition or fee refund if I remain enrolled through the Winter 2022 term or the Spring 2022 semester. The only eligible tuition and fee refunds for either semester are those that take place in accordance with the published schedule of early withdrawal dates from the Winter 2022 term and Spring 2022 semester. Classes and Campus Activities During the Fall 2021 Semester Absent certain medical and religious exemptions, Cornell will require vaccination for all students returning to Ithaca, Geneva, and Cornell Tech campuses for the Fall 2021 academic semester. With mandatory student vaccination and the widespread availability of a vaccine for most adults, the University hopes to operate in the Fall under conditions in which the degree of herd immunity is sufficient to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 within the community. If the science indicates that the extent of immunity of the Cornell community provides for safe campus operation, and relevant regulations allow for in-person classroom instruction; classes normally taught in person will return to that mode of instruction, without any routinely scheduled online option. Therefore, Cornell students should plan on in-person learning for the Fall 2021 academic semester and should make suitable arrangements to make themselves available for such participation for the entire semester. Please be aware, however, the University reserves the right, as it deems necessary, to adjust course modality over the period of the semester to respond to changes in health and safety risk factors and regulatory requirements.
