UC's Sustainability and Climate Action Plan Executive Summary Although there are many pressing issues associated with climate change and global environmental degradation, there are also many reasons to hope for a brighter future of vitality and prosperity for all on our planet. The University of Cincinnati is committed to enhancing resiliency in a future that is sustainable for all. To that end – and with the next generations to follow us in mind, we have made sustainability a priority at UC and enjoyed many notable achievements since publishing the university’s first Climate Action Plan in 2009. These include earning UC a Gold STARS rating from the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education. Much progress has been made, but sustainability is a journey, not a destination. There will always be ways for us to enhance natural ecosystems, enrich human communities and reinvest in our future. As such, Next Lives Here, the university’s Strategic Direction, will focus on furthering academic excellence, creating a positive urban impact, and fostering innovation to positively impact social transformation. The integration of Next Lives Here and this Sustainability and Climate Action Plan lays the foundation for ensuring that the University of Cincinnati will be a global leader in sustainability – whether in academics, research or operations. I call on all colleges and universities to join us in creating an enhanced culture of sustainability. - Neville Pinto, PhD President University of Cincinnati Read the full Sustainability and Climate Action Plan Division of Administration and Finance University Pavilion, Suite 630 2618 McMicken Circle PO Box 210620 Cincinnati, OH 45221-0620 UC Tools Canopy & Canvas One Stop Email Catalyst Shuttle Tracker IT Help UC VPN Bearcats Landing About Us Maps & Directions Jobs News Diversity Governance & Policies Directory Events Calendar University of Cincinnati | 2600 Clifton Ave. | Cincinnati, OH 45221 | ph: 513-556-6000 Alerts | Clery and HEOA Notice | Notice of Non-Discrimination | eAccessibility Concern | Privacy Statement | Free Speech | Copyright Information © 2020 University of Cincinnati Division of Administration and Finance University Pavilion, Suite 630 2618 McMicken Circle PO Box 210620 Cincinnati, OH 45221-0620 © 2020 University of Cincinnati scroll up to the top
