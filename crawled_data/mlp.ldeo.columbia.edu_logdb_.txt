The data are available through the following search pages. Scientific Ocean Drilling Access all the logging data recorded over more than 50 years by the Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP, 1968-1983), the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP, 1985-2003) and the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP, 2004-2013), now the International Ocean Discovery Program: DSDP, ODP, IODP Data Scientific Continental Drilling Projects, mostly in the US, where logging data helped address topics from local tectonics and geology to seismic monitoring or carbon sequestration. Search all logging data from these projects, Or search the data from individual projects: Northern Newark Basin, New York Southern Newark Basin, New Jersey Moodus Township, Connecticut Black Rock Forest, New York Toa Baja, Puerto Rico Cajon Pass, California APTICORE Cismon Well, Italy Gas Hydrates Logs are some of the most reliable tools to study gas hydrates in situ. Logging was a key component of the following projects, led by diverse consortia of government agencies, industry and academia, investigating the potential of gas hydrates as a hazard or a resource: Joint Industry Program (JIP), U.S. Gulf of Mexico India National Gas Hydrate Program (NGHP), Indian Ocean Mallik Programs, Mackenzie Delta, Northwest Territories, Canada Mount Elbert, North Slope, Alaska
