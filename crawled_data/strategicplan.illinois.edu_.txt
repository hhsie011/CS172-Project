Scholarship, Discovery, and Innovation Transformative Learning Experiences Societal Impact Resources and Strategic Investment Introduction For 150 years, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has been changing the world. As we embark on our next 150 years, we do so with a renewed commitment to educational opportunity, research, and public engagement. We envision a bold future built on our tradition of excellence and our land-grant heritage that will require us to harness our community's talents and our resources to be world-class in every dimension of our mission. Our most powerful asset is our diverse community: the faculty members who lead the research and teaching, the professionals who enable and support every aspect of our operation, the undergraduate and graduate students who learn from and inspire us, and the alumni who represent us around the globe. We derive strength from the pursuit of complex ideas, the value of multiple perspectives, and a commitment to scholarship and research that asks the difficult questions needed to create a better future for everyone. The quality, diversity, and breadth of our faculty are the cornerstone of our success. Illinois is home to some of the most accomplished scholars in the world. Illinois leads in academic disciplines that influence global scholarship. The grand challenges we will face as a society in the next 150 years will call for collaboration, listening, and a capacity for perspective-taking. Therefore, this strategic plan sets the course to bring scholars together in even more creative and innovative ways. In so doing, our university community will continue to lead and to find solutions for society's greatest challenges in areas as wide-ranging as energy, food security, health, and the human condition. Illinois must continue to attract outstanding students who reflect the full diversity of the world we will prepare them to lead. We prioritize access and affordability as well as our responsibility to make institutional transformations necessary to remove the barriers, assumptions, and biases that limit opportunities. By providing innovative learning opportunities, both in and out of the classrooms, we will prepare our students for multiple future careers, while teaching them to think critically, excel in their chosen disciplines, embrace the importance of continuing to learn over the course of their lives, and engage with the ever-changing, increasingly diverse world around them. We want our graduates and future alumni to be responsible citizens and leaders who value knowledge, creativity, global awareness, and social and cultural understanding. Our ability to embrace, encourage, and adapt to the accelerating diversity of cultures, ideas, and identities fuels our creative spirit and leads us to consider new perspectives, possibilities, and knowledge. As a land-grant university, Illinois is tasked with the privilege of service—to the local community, to the state, the country, and the world. As custodians of this charge, we are also recipients of an immense opportunity, and we will use this moment to reimagine our public engagement efforts. Interaction with our community will be woven into the fabric of everything we do—from research and teaching to educational experiences to our external partnerships. Specifically, we will strengthen our connections across the state—with both urban and rural communities—in a way that builds reciprocal and collaborative partnerships. We strive to encourage, elevate, and enhance community-engaged scholarship, teaching, and service to make a positive and visible impact in the spirit of our land-grant mission. Appropriate, sufficient, and sustainable resources are imperative to our success. Our new, transparent budget model will help us thrive as we progress toward our shared campuswide goals and aspirations. Reimagining our budget model was not a logistical exercise—it was a deliberate effort to build the engine that will power our plans. We must be responsible stewards to ensure that we have the necessary elements to achieve our goals. Through careful handling of resources, innovations in services, and focused efforts to find new efficiencies, we will conserve financial resources that can be reinvested across our strategic priorities. We will couple this increased financial capacity with our advancement efforts and new revenue sources to allow the university to move forward on our goals. We must also be accountable to the state, to our students and their families, and to our partners who invest in our mission and our success. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign's vision for the future is ambitious. Broad consultation, transparency, and shared commitment to our institutional goals will be necessary. We must balance long-term planning and short-term opportunities by empowering the units' expertise and flexibility to make their own strategic choices. The process we develop and implement must respect and leverage our university's commitment to shared governance. We are at an exciting time in our history. In our first 150 years, Illinois asserted itself as a world leader in higher education. Today's rapidly changing landscape does not allow us to rest on our accomplishments. Right now, we have an opportunity—and a responsibility—to redefine the role of public higher education. This plan is our public declaration of what the world should expect from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign over the next five years, and it sets the course for another 150 years of success. Vision & Mission Our Shared Vision We will be the pre-eminent public research university with a land-grant mission and a global impact. This is how the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will define pre-eminence: We will be the best at what we do; this is a matter of excellence in achievement. We will have impact locally, nationally, and globally through transformational educational experiences, innovative public engagement, and groundbreaking scholarship. We will be recognized as leaders by our peers. We will be visible, engaged, and significant agents for the prosperity of the state, nation, and world; this is the leadership expected from a world-class university with a land-grant mission. We will be leaders in advancing diversity and equity that will contribute to creating an institution committed to excellence in discovery, teaching, and research, and a climate where all can achieve their highest aspirations in a safe and welcoming environment. Our Mission The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is charged by our state to enhance the lives of people in Illinois, across the nation, and around the world through our leadership in learning, discovery, engagement, and economic development. We Will Achieve Our Vision by Leveraging Our Areas of Distinction In our 150-year history, this campus has established a distinctive identity. It leads us to work and explore in uniquely productive ways. These areas of distinction provide the fundamental building blocks for our strategic goals. Our iconic, inspirational, and inventive campus Our engaged and open scholarly community Our campuswide commitment to diversity, inclusion, and accessibility Our groundbreaking track record of convergence, innovation, and creativity Our technology-rich environment Our comprehensiveness and land-grant tradition Our effective, collegial, and nationally recognized system of shared governance Our regional, national, and global impact Our global leadership in creating an interdisciplinary culture Our hardworking, bright, and creative faculty, staff, students, and alumni Process & Principles Our Process Starting with the 2013-2016 Visioning Future Excellence plan and over the past five years, the entire campus community worked toward a shared vision for the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign—one that would strategically focus our intellectual and financial resources to face and respond to the challenges of our state, nation, and world. In the 2017-2018 academic year, the university celebrated its sesquicentennial, a timely opportunity to reflect on the past and plan for the future. Faithful to the guiding principles of our mission as the state's flagship public research university, we considered the changing landscape of higher education and the best ways to position ourselves in the next five years to drive 150 more years of discovery, innovation, and education. A leadership team was formed to guide the collective and comprehensive work of strategic planning. Faculty, staff, students, deans, and campus administration collaborated throughout this past year to set out the broad strategic goals, initiatives, actions, and metrics for success that will guide our decisions and priorities over the next five years. The 2013-2016 strategic plan served as a steppingstone to create a bold and ambitious new path forward in research, teaching, engagement, and resources that leverages our strengths and our identity, and embraces areas of growing importance to our mission and excellence, such as: Arts Data Science Diversity Energy and Sustainability Food Security Globalization Health Sciences Humanities Public Engagement Social and Behavioral Sciences Undergraduate Education The Chancellor and the Provost charged Strategic Task Forces to develop bold and broad strategies, comprehensive and far-reaching goals, and ideas covering research, teaching, service, and diversity. The Task Forces were also asked to reach out to stakeholders to garner feedback. After drafting the reports, the Task Force chairs presented during a strategic planning retreat, where administrators and a campuswide group of faculty members and staff had the opportunity to provide feedback. Following the consideration and integration of this feedback by the Task Forces, the chairs submitted a final version of the reports, which were posted on the planning website. To allow for broader ideas outside of the focus areas, the Office of the Provost organized multiple goal-development sessions on each of the four goals for several hundred members of the community from across campus. Summaries from these sessions were shared on the planning website. Our shared vision for the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will strategically focus our intellectual and financial resources to face and respond to the challenges of our state, nation, and world. Having both the Strategic Task Force reports and the summaries from the goal-development sessions posted on the web, the Strategic Planning Leadership Team worked to make the campus community aware of the work that had been accomplished and to encourage feedback from the campus community. Strategies used included a town hall event, email messages, and announcements in newsletters. To gather deeper feedback on the work that had been done, the Office of the Provost organized faculty and staff panels to read and respond to all of the material submitted. By late spring 2018, most of the feedback had been received, and campus leaders gathered to discuss what emerged from the yearlong activities so as to prioritize specific ideas. This prioritization continued through the summer months as the strategic plan underwent various drafts. By fall 2018, deans, campus institutes directors, Task Force chairs, and the aforementioned faculty panel read and responded to the drafts. The feedback received led to further improvements and refinement of the plan, and yielded a bold call to strategic and responsible action that sets the course for success in the next five years and a foundation for continued excellence in the next 150. Our Guiding Principles While the mechanics and implementation strategies of a plan may change over time to reflect the operating environment and global landscape, we are committed to a clear set of open and transparent principles to: continue to make strategic investments in institutional excellence be mindful of and responsive to the changing financial landscape of higher education be agile as we pursue the current sets of priorities in our plan embrace a culture of institutional improvement and assessment collaborate and engage with faculty members, staff, students, alumni, and other stakeholders in our planning and implementation celebrate our achievements visibly and proudly empower all members of our community to speak honestly and openly strive to create an inclusive environment for our students, faculty members, and staff enhance and promote diversity as a fundamental value foster connections across disciplinary boundaries to inspire and drive multidisciplinary convergence continue leading in areas that drive translation of innovation and global impact engage our local, state, national, and global community as we redefine what it means to be a land-grant university in the 21st century At the core of our university, and its principles, is the acknowledgement of Native peoples and the land on which this university exists. Our Goals We will be the pre-eminent public research university with a land-grant mission and a global impact.
