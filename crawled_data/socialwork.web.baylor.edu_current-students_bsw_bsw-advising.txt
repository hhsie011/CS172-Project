Prepare for Advising Pay attention to advising-related emails, as you will need to schedule your appointment through a specific link sent directly to you. Schedule your appointment early to ensure you are prepared before your assigned registration date and time. Before arriving, review your degree audit and the degree plan you received via email from your advisor after your previous advising session. Check BearWeb for any holds you may have on your registration. If you wish to make changes to your degree plan, come prepared with a new plan that represents those changes. Make use of the Schedule of Classes to see when courses are being offered. If you notice a time-conflict between two or more of your advised courses, alert your advisor.

Advisors are here to assist you with your academic goals and to connect you to resources that will help you achieve those goals. Bring a list of questions or concerns you would like to discuss with your advisor. Arrive at least 5 minutes prior to your appointment so that your advisor can stay on schedule and meet with all students.
