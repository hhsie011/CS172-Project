Greene Science Center was made possible by a transformational gift by the late Dawn M. Greene and the Jerome L. Greene Foundation. The gift honors the memory of Jerome L. Greene '26CC, '28LAW, a prominent New York lawyer and real-estate investor who was a devoted alumnus and stalwart supporter of Columbia University up until his death in 1999. Dawn Greene, '80HON, continued her husband's tradition of thoughtful and generous philanthropy in education, the arts, and medicine. When she died in 2010, New York City and Columbia University lost a forward-thinking philanthropist and friend. About the Jerome L.
