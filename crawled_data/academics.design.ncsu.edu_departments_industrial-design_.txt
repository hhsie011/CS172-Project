The NC State University Industrial Design Program is one of the top professional programs in this discipline in the country. The program offers Bachelor of Industrial Design (BID) and Master of Industrial Design (MID) degrees, both accredited by The National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD). Students learn and practice design in a studio environment very similar to that of professional design offices. Students methodically study human physical and cognitive interaction with artifacts and services in order to discover user experience insights and then create innovative solutions to design problems. The dynamic and sophisticated balance of form, function, innovation, and practicality are constantly debated and articulated throughout the journey to better design. Questions?

Collaborative Sponsored Studios What is Industrial Design? Industrial design is the professional service of creating and developing concepts and specifications that optimize the function, value, and appearance of products and systems for the mutual benefit of both user and manufacturer. Industrial designers develop these concepts and specifications for the user and manufacturer through the collection, analysis, and synthesis of data, often within the context of cooperative working relationships with other members of a development group such as management, marketing, engineering, and manufacturing specialists. They then communicate their clear and concise recommendations through drawings, models, and verbal descriptions that embody all relevant design criteria determined by the group. The industrial designer’s unique contribution emphasizes those aspects of the product or system that relate most directly to human characteristics, needs, experiences, and interests. This contribution requires specialized understanding of visual, spatial, and tactile senses as well as product safety and convenience criteria. Industrial designers are experts in anticipating psychological, physiological and sociological factors and perceptions that influence users of products and services. Industrial designers also maintain a practical concern for the technical processes and requirements for manufacturing; marketing opportunities and economic constraints; and regulatory requirements relevant to good design. In addition to supplying concepts for products and systems, industrial designers are often retained for consultation on a variety of problems that have to do with product and organization identity systems, development of communication systems, interior and exhibit design, advertising devices and packaging, and other related services. Their expertise is often sought in a wide variety of administrative arenas to assist in developing industry standards, regulatory guidelines, and quality control procedures to improve manufacturing operations and products. Industrial designers are guided by a professional obligation to protect the public safety and well-being, to respect the environment, and to observe contractual and ethical business practices.

Well, kind of. Graphic design students at the College of Design partnered with @redhatinc to create solutions for a world dominated by driverless vehicles. Throughout the studio, students had to imagine a future in which the public no longer had access to personal vehicles. Then, they had to ideate how autonomous vehicles can fit into various human factors such as family needs, career specializations and security concerns.

Eastman enlisted the College of Design to transform a new biodegradable and compostable material the company had created.

Congratulations class of 2022! 🎉🎓 ... 86 0 ncstatedesign View May 5 Open “Being in the architecture program at State has been the most challenging thing I’ve probably ever done, but I really have learned and grown so so much from it. I remember being in first year not having a clue what I was in for, but each semester pushed me more than the last. Looking back my confidence grew so much between those late nights staying up in studio, making huge models, and designing beautiful presentations. My favorite memories have to be with my studio mates. I’ve watched them grow side by side with me and go from strangers to friends over these past five years. They all have taught me so much. Also football games. Football games are the best haha. Go Pack! A lesson I have learned would be to give yourself grace and patience. Going through this program normally is hard and challenging anyway, but when you throw in a pandemic and other personal matters that can get in the way, it can be even more difficult to make everything perfect and reach that deadline. If I could tell myself one thing first year, or second year it would be to do what you can on your project but give yourself some time away. Make time for some day-trips, to go to football games, enjoy your friends. Not every project has to be perfect. If it’s the best you can do while giving yourself some patience and grace, it’s a win. If I were to name everyone who’s helped me along the way the list would be too long. To start, I’m lucky I was able to find my niche in what kind of architecture I want to design through Bryan Bell’s public interest design classes. Because of his classes and studio, I have a sense of direction. My family also helped me stay the path. When it got hard they were behind me every step shoving me forward. Finally, I am beyond lucky to have found so many wonderful people here, friends, great teachers, and I’ve been lucky to have found my beautiful partner here as well, who has always cheered me on. I will continue to look at State fondly for bringing these beautiful people and experiences into my life. I’ll miss NC State immensely.” - Ariel Hills [B.Arch.

DM us with your experience! ... 176 6 ncstatedesign View May 4 Open "The most enjoyable and difficult moment I remember while studying architecture was when I stayed up all night preparing for a review with my studio friends. We were close to each other during the moments, and we spanned almost 20 hours a day. We were encouraging and leading each other, and also we were eating and chatting together. When I look back on my five years of journey at the studio, the moments where I thought I was very discouraged and frustrated were actually the most shining day of mine. The studio is always up and on 24/7. The studio lighted up those days for 5 years like moonlight in the night. Five years of NC State made a big turning point in my life. It had new programs that I could experience and met new people that I could make social with people who have various communication with many topics, so it became a steppingstone of the opportunity the experience abundantly and develop my future carrier and my future about the architecture. After I graduate, I will develop my career further by training in architecture, which is the beginning of my life as a newcomer to society. I am about to marry my loved one, a new beginning that will come soon. I am so thankful to my beloved parents, my sister Jane, my husband Young, my precious friend Leah and Sky. Also, Ashely helped me finish school well by having Chipotle time, and studio mates who spent the time with the studio stayed over each night. I realized that there were many people I was thankful for until graduation day." - Soya Kim [B.Arch.
