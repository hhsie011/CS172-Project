Recognizing the important and often irreplaceable content and professional opportunities that the ARM offers health services researchers and the broader health and health care community, we designed a virtual, interactive event in response to the COVID-19 pandemic - all in a safe, responsible way. From July 28 to August 6, this unique, online event offered live and on-demand sessions in bounded time blocks – helping to avoid meeting fatigue and allowing participants to attend to personal and professional commitments.
