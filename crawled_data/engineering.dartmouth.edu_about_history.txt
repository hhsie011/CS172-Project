He organized engineering at Dartmouth according to a deeply held principle: engineers need a broad educational foundation spanning the arts and sciences to be prepared for "the most responsible positions and the most difficult service," a central tenet of Dartmouth Engineering that still remains to this day. On This Page 1867–1900 1900-1950 1950-2000 2000-Present Video: Early History 1867–1900 1867 Colonel and Brevet General Sylvanus Thayer, valedictorian of the Dartmouth Class of 1807, initiates the establishment of an engineering school at his alma mater. The 81-year-old draws on his Dartmouth education, his experience developing an engineering curriculum as superintendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point (1817–1833), and his career in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to create a civil engineering curriculum for students with a firm grounding in the liberal arts. He provides gifts totaling $70,000 and donates a library of books, manuscripts, and plates about engineering in Europe and the United States. 1870 After a three-year search, 23-year-old Lieutenant Robert Fletcher is appointed the first dean and professor of Thayer School of Civil Engineering. 1871 Thayer School opens with three students and five small rooms in Wentworth, Reed, and Thornton Halls. Dean Fletcher, the only full-time faculty member, teaches 14 engineering courses during the first academic year and 36 the following year. 1872 Sylvanus Thayer dies, leaving a legacy as founder of Thayer School, "Father of West Point," and initiator of engineering education in the United States. 1873 Thayer graduates its first three students. 1879 Dean Fletcher introduces a curriculum that forms the mainstay through 1918. The 12 courses: Surveying; Mechanics; Resistance of Materials; Properties of Construction Materials; Materials and Structural Elements; Bridges and Roofs; Hydraulic Works; Heat and Heat-Engines; Sanitary Engineering; Rivers and Harbors; Rockwork, Tunneling, and Mining; and Masonry and Foundations. 1891 Thayer School's first capital campaign seeks $50,000 for the endowment to cover the cost of books and instruments, visiting lecturers, class tours, and a salary increase for the school’s second professor, Hiram Hitchcock. 1892 Thayer buys and moves into a building on Park Street. 1893 Dartmouth undergraduates are allowed to take courses at Thayer during senior year and graduate with an engineering degree after the fifth year. 1896 Using equipment he built, Professor Frank Austin, Class of 1895, helps Hanover physician Dr. Gilman Frost take the world's first diagnostic X-ray. 1900-1950 1902 The Thayer Society of Engineers (now Dartmouth Society of Engineers) forms "to further the interests of the Thayer School of Civil Engineering." 1912 Thayer School moves into Bissell Hall, next door to the Hanover Inn. 1918 Dean Fletcher retires from the deanship after 47 years but teaches for another 18 years. 1922 Dean Charles Holden arranges for Thayer students to take business courses at the Amos Tuck School of Administration and Finance. 1925 Professor Raymond Marsden, Class of 1909, becomes dean. He modifies the academic calendar and rearranges first-year courses to strengthen the school’s relationship with Dartmouth. 1933 Professor Frank Garran becomes dean. "Engineering is alive and real. We should make it that way in our teaching," he tells the faculty. 1936 Dean Fletcher dies at age 88 and is buried in the Dartmouth cemetery. 1939 Cummings Memorial Hall opens. Named in memory of Horace Cummings, Dartmouth class of 1862, husband of donor Jeannette Cummings, it is the first facility built specifically for Thayer School. 1940 Thayer offers a civilian pilot training program as World War II widens. 1941 The school drops "Civil" from its name and officially becomes Thayer School of Engineering. Thayer School adds electrical and mechanical engineering courses. Professors teach surveying, engineering drawing, and mathematics to regional government and defense industry workers at Hanover and Lebanon high schools. Professor Millett Morgan’s radiophysics study of the upper ionosphere and magnetosphere forms Thayer School’s first large-scale research program. 1942 The Tuck-Thayer program—three years of liberal arts at Dartmouth topped with two years of engineering and business—launches. 1943 Operating the Navy’s largest V-12 College Training Program, Thayer School shifts to year-round operation and accelerated engineering degrees. With reveille at 6 a.m. and taps at 10 p.m., Thayer School operates like a naval base for the rest of the war. Specialized V-12 courses include naval organization, law, history, and strategy. 1945 Dean Garran dies. The Thayer School Register praises him for reshaping the school "for the greatest service to the Country, the Profession and the College." Professor William Kimball '29 becomes dean. He expands the faculty, research, and facilities, oversees growth of the student body, and places curricular emphasis on mathematical analysis. 1947 Two wings are added to Cummings Hall. 1950-2000 1957 Professors James Browning (pictured) and Merle Thorpe '53 found Thermal Dynamics Corp. to market plasma-cutting technologies they developed at Thayer.
