With its administrative base within the Department of Immunobiology and its core laboratories housed in the Amistad building and the George Street Facility, the HTI program is open to all members of the Yale School of Medicine faculty with an interest in human immunology and the contributions of immunology to disease. The HTI faculty study the immunologic aspects of a very broad range of human diseases, encompassing investigations in the fields of cancer and cancer therapeutics, transplantation of solid organs and stem cells; autoimmune diseases including endocrine diseases such as Type 1 diabetes, rheumatologic diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosis; pulmonary diseases including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; neurologic diseases such as multiple sclerosis; gastrointestinal diseases such as Crohn's disease, celiac sprue, and ulcerative colitis; and many others. HTI programs offer investigators the opportunity to interact with other clinical and basic scientists to develop investigations in the treatment of human disease, and access to resources to support this work. Providing resources to develop novel therapies that are in the early stages (Phase I/II) of development are a top priority of HTI, which will assist in preparing applications to the Immune Tolerance Network, the FOCIS Centers of Excellence, Trialnet and other multi-institutional organizations. The HTI seminar series highlights studies of human disease and features nationally recognized internal and outside speakers. A training grant to develop the careers of new investigators with expertise in human translational immunology and support the work of these individuals in the laboratories of the HTI faculty is planned. HTI membership is open to Yale faculty interested in translational immunology. Approval for membership is given by the HTI steering committee.
