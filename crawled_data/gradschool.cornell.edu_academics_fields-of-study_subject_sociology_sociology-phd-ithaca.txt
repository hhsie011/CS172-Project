Candidates also choose two minors from sociology or related fields. Students normally take a sequence of core courses in theory and methods but may substitute a general examination in these subjects. Ph.D. students in full-time residence are normally expected to earn the Ph.D. degree within four years. The written and oral Admission to Candidacy examination is usually taken early in the third year, followed by the dissertation and oral defense. One year of directed teaching experience at Cornell is required unless the student is specifically exempted.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
