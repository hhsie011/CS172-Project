In acknowledgement of this fact, and in support of our mission to be an educational driver for the state of Kansas, Wichita State formed the First-Generation Coordinating Council. The F1RST Generation Coordinating Council (FGCC) was started in August of 2018 under the direction of the Kaye Monk-Morgan, Vice President of Strategic Engagement and Planning. The FGCC collaborates with those who promote research, awareness and mentorship in order to further support FGEN Shockers at Wichita State University. The Council’s work is trifold and includes Creating awareness related to the needs and success of this special population. Encouraging involvement and support of faculty and staff. Reviewing data and outcomes in order to make recommendations for systemic change that leads to better experiences and outcomes for students The F1RST GEN Coordinating Council at Wichita State University is composed of Wichita State individuals who are involved in the FGEN efforts that support current university activities, explore opportunities for departmental collaboration, look for opportunities to enhance the campus-wide approach to serve F1RST GEN SHOCKERS and make recommendations for new initiatives. WSU Selected for First Forward Designation In May of 2019 the Center for First-Generation Student Success announced that Wichita State University was selected as one of the higher education institutions who has demonstrated a commitment to improving experiences and advancing outcomes of first-gen college students. The Center for First-Generation Student Success is an initiative of NASPA – Student Affairs Administrators in Higher Education and The Suder Foundation. WSU’s application was submitted by the First-Generation Coordinating Council (FGCC). The application highlighted the increasing percentage of students attending Wichita State as well as the transformative work underway to make WSU a more student-ready campus. Our history of service to first-generation students includes our nine TRIO programs and four GEAR UP programs since 1965, those services provided in both Academic and Student Affairs and the solid communication about the assets brought to our campus by this special student demographic.
