Invited to the Neiman Center in 2006, Shishkin produced Hideous Potato, missed terribly, with likes and no hate, an ambitious suite of nine irregularly-shaped, offset lithographs that fit together like a jigsaw puzzle to form a single image. The central figure - both comic and grotesque - is a corpulent cherub with sphincters for eyes and a mouth who seems to spew bodily fluids at a retreating cavalry below. Such absurd scenes and fantastical characters abound in Shishkin’s dreamlike narratives. A masterful draftsman, she employed her confident line to create a suite of etchings, I Wanna Be Well, printed in cherry red with intricate laser cut borders in 2007. Dasha Shishkin (b. 1977, Moscow, Russia) moved with her parents to New York where she went to Parsons School of Design and later to the Rietveld Academy of Arts in Amsterdam. She received a MFA from Columbia University in 2006. She has participated in exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art, P.S. 1, New York; the Kunsthalle Hamburg, and Grimm/Rosenfeld Gallery in Munich and New York. Her work is included in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, New York; The Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; and the Pinakothek der Moderne, Munich. She currently lives and works in New York.
