Your medical provider will prescribe an antibiotic if they think it's appropriate and will help with your treatment. Taking an antibiotic when you shouldn't kills good bacteria and can cause your body to become resistant to antibiotics. It also won't help you recover, and the side effects could hurt you. DO: Take it exactly as your health care provider says. Take only what is prescribed for you. Prevent infections by washing your hands and getting vaccinated. DON'T: Don't skip doses. Don't share prescriptions with others. Don't insist on an antibiotic if your health care provider doesn't think you should have one.
