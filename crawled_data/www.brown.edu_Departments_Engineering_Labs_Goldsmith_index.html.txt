Goldsmith Group Members Research RMG-Cat Combustion Kinetics Energetic Materials Brown Shock Tube Nitrogen Chemistry Adsorbate Thermochemistry Monopropellants Publications Teaching News Our group focuses on chemical kinetics. We combine experimental techniques with electronic structure methods, statistical mechanics, and uncertainty quantification to provide accurate, predictive models for complex reaction networks in energy conversion. Most of our research focuses on elementary reactions in high-temperature and high-pressure systems, such as combustion, heterogeneous catalysis, energetic materials, and propellants.
