All colleges and universities use some instrument to evaluate their courses and faculty. The University of Memphis has developed the Student Evaluation of Teaching Effectiveness for this purpose. Many people contribute to the SETE process: among these are students, faculty, teaching assistants, department staff, and computer services. Every faculty member and teaching assistant who teaches must be evaluated. The results of the SETE are an important tool used by the chair and dean to evaluate the teaching ability of a faculty member. They are especially important during the tenure and promotion process. The instructor does not learn of the results of the evaluation until after the students have received their grades. They are important to the instructor so that changes in teaching formats reflect student progress. The University thanks each of you for your participation in the Student Evaluation of Teaching Effectiveness process.
