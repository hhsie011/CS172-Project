All students, faculty members and staff members are expected to report violations of the Honor Code. In addressing an alleged violation, the faculty member of the class affected by the violation may either handle the matter directly with the accused student or refer the case to the Honor Council. (Violations being referred to the Honor Council must be referred within 21 days of discovery of the violation.) However, in all cases, the incident and sanction(s) must be reported to the Office of Academic Integrity. Without such reporting, it would be impossible to determine if students are repeating the same behavior in other classes and have a pattern of academic dishonesty.
