This page provides information about disabilities and links to resources available to students with disabilities at Dartmouth. For more information or for questions, please visit Dartmouth's Student Accessibility Services Web site, or contact Assistant Dean of Academic and Student Affairs Holly Wilkinson in MacLean 105 or by phone or email at +1 (603) 646-3483 and Holly.Wilkinson@Dartmouth.edu. On This Page Applicants with Disabilities Requesting Accommodations Your Rights and Responsibilities Injuries and Temporary Conditions Campus Resources Confidentiality Resolving Concerns or Grievances Applicants with Disabilities We encourage applicants with disabilities, who contribute to a diverse Dartmouth community, to apply for admission with the expectation that reasonable accommodations and access to Dartmouth Engineering's graduate programs, including curricular and co-curricular pursuits, will be provided. Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth and Dartmouth College are committed to ensuring equal access under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) as amended, and Sections 504 and 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Applicants may disclose disability prior to admission but are not required to, nor will disability status be considered in the admissions process. Disability disclosure can be made at any time during your enrollment; however, students are encouraged to engage in the interactive process and request accommodations prior to the start of classes or as soon as a disability is identified during enrollment. Early notification allows for a smooth transition and the implementation of auxiliary services or modifications in a timely manner. Students are further encouraged to make use of reasonable accommodations and the support available throughout their enrollment. Requesting Accommodations Accommodations are determined on an individual basis through an interactive process that includes the student and the engineering school, and are based on federal law and Dartmouth College guidelines. Dartmouth Engineering's Assistant Dean of Academic and Student Affairs Holly Wilkinson works with engineering students to determine reasonable accommodations and coordinates the provision of accommodations for them. Learn More Your Rights and Responsibilities Students with disabilities have a right to reasonable accommodations, as well as other rights, to help ensure equal access to Dartmouth Engineerings's education and activities. Students also have responsibilities to help Dartmouth meet our obligations. Learn More Injuries and Temporary Conditions Temporary conditions such as broken bones, concussions, surgeries, or acute illnesses are generally not regarded as a disability under the law, but it can impair your ability to full participate in classes or student life. Dartmouth also has resources available to support students through temporary conditions— just as illness or injury. Learn More Campus Resources A disability can occur at any point in a student, faculty, or staff's life. Dartmouth has a number of assessment options, support services, organizations, and resources to support students, faculty, and staff. Learn More Confidentiality Disclosure of disability is voluntary and protected under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Disability information will be shared only on a need-to-know basis with appropriate college officials when coordinating disability-related services and accommodations. Learn More Resolving Concerns or Grievances Dartmouth is committed to providing equal opportunities for students, faculty, staff, and visitors with disabilities to access and participate in academic, social, cultural, and recreational programs at Dartmouth. Dartmouth's ADA/504 Coordinator (ADAC) in the Office of Institutional Diversity and Equity (IDE) serves as the first point of contact for information about Dartmouth's disability-based accommodation grievance procedures.
