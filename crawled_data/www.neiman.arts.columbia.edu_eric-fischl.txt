In his collaboration with the Neiman Center, Fischl used offset lithography to create three oversized studies of statuesque nudes. Despite their large scale and intense, saturated color, Fischl's painterly approach evokes the weightlessness and translucency of watercolor. Fischl (b. 1948) is a painter living and working in New York City and Sag Harbor, New York. He received a BFA in painting from the California Institute of the Arts in 1972. Since his first solo exhibition at the Edward Thorpe Gallery in 1979, he has exhibited widely in the United States and Europe. Notable exhibitions include the Venice Biennale, Biennale de Paris, the Whitney Biennial, The Carnegie International, Pittsburgh, PA, Documenta, Kassel, Germany among others. His work is in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC; and the Musée National D'Art Moderne, Paris, among others.
