At least one RIG has been designated to support research consistent with the University's commitment to the service of faith and the promotion of justice. The research project must be initiated during the summer months but the project period may continue through the following academic year. The RIG program is designed to support research carried out directly by the faculty applicant. With rare exceptions, a RIG will not be awarded to the same faculty member more than once in three years. Apply Now For Chairs and Deans Application Deadlines Completed online applications must be submitted by Friday, October 29, 2021. Application Process Applications should be submitted via online form. Please note: If the application is being submitted by two or more faculty jointly, check "Yes" in Item four on the Application. Since most of the reviewers will not have a specialized knowledge of your field of study, you should describe the proposed project in plain English. Once you application has been submitted, your chairperson or dean will receive a notification from the Internal Grants Manager to complete a recommendation form. RIG recipients will be notified of decisions in February 2022. Eligibility All regular full-time tenure-track faculty are eligible for these grants. Amount and Conditions of Awards Each RIG recipient will be awarded up to a total of $15,000, including one month's summer salary. Projects should be designed to start during the summer recess and to be completed by the end of the following academic year. At the end of the academic year, you will be asked to submit a brief report using our online form. Special Provisions An individual can apply for and receive a summer/fall Research Expense Grant, a winter/spring Research Expense Grant, and a Research Incentive Grant in the same year. REGs are awarded biannually and are available competitively to defer the smaller expenses of doing research. RIGs may be used for income; however, any amount that is used as income will be subject to taxation.
