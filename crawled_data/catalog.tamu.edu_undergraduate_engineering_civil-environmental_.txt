The civil engineering profession is one of the most stable and most diverse of the engineering disciplines. Civil engineers are employed by consulting firms, public agencies, and start and operate their own businesses. Workplaces range from construction sites to design offices. Most civil engineers work with some engineering or construction aspect of private and/or public facilities, such as airports, bridges, buildings, coastal structures, dams, environmental remediation of contaminated sites, harbors, highways, offshore structures, pipelines, railroads, transportation systems, tunnels, water collection systems, water distribution systems, water and wastewater treatment facilities, and waterways. Civil engineers are on the forefront of applying the newest technology innovations in engineering and construction. Civil engineering projects are unique because they require individual planning, analysis, design, construction supervision, performance monitoring, management, and retrofitting. Civil engineering projects often require technical, governmental, legal, financial, and social evaluations. The primary objective is to provide the best service for the users while minimizing costs and other undesirable impacts. Environmental engineers use a multidisciplinary approach to solve environmental challenges facing public and environmental health, such as water treatment, waste management, and climate change. Environmental engineers work to protect human health and welfare while minimizing the adverse effects of human activity on the environment. Environmental engineers are also employed by consulting firms, public agencies, and start and operate their own businesses. The mission of the Zachry Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Texas A&M University is to prepare our graduates to become professional engineers and leaders in the engineering profession by providing our students with a solid education that will enable them to integrate fundamental scientific engineering principles and that will couple with the latest technological advances to facilitate the development of their problem-solving skills. Additionally, the department provides opportunities for enhancement of the students’ educational experience through meaningful interactions with the profession. In summary, we expect our graduates to be fully prepared for life-long learning experiences that will strengthen their abilities to successfully and effectively solve the complex engineering problems facing society. The faculty of the Zachry Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering strives to ensure that our ever-evolving educational programs accomplish several objectives. First, our faculty must prepare the students to address the current and future civil and environmental engineering needs of the State of Texas, the nation and the world by being able to recognize the important geopolitical and public policy needs; and solve technical problems. In addition, the Department provides a curriculum that integrates scientific and technical knowledge with an appreciation for social, economic, and political concerns. The curriculum and programs provide opportunities for our students to: build leadership skills, learn professionalism and ethical responsibility, and develop an understanding of the need to engage in lifelong learning. Finally, the faculty of the Zachry Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Texas A&M University promotes the highest academic standards of excellence, quality, and ethics in both our undergraduate and graduate programs, and in doing so create both a culture of excellence and a community of scholars.
