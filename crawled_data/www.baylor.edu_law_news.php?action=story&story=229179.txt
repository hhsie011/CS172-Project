Counseller will receive a citation from the University and a $2,500 award. “Professor Counseller is a gifted teacher,” said Baylor Law School Dean Brad Toben. “He is a charismatic, demanding instructor with a distinctive ability to create a classroom environment in which his students do not want to disappoint him. ” Baylor University’s Outstanding Faculty Awards recognize the best all-around professors based on teaching capabilities, research achievement, effective committee service, time spent with students, and civic and church involvement. Twelve Baylor University professors, including Professor Counseller, were selected for the 2021-2022 academic year. This recognition is the second time Baylor University has recognized Professor Counseller’s teaching. In 2007, the University designated him an Outstanding Faculty member as a tenure-track professor. Professor Counseller teaches courses in Civil Procedure, Practice Court II, and Texas and Federal Procedure. He has authored articles and presented papers on various evidentiary and procedural issues and is the co-author of four books, including Civil Procedure: In Focus. In 2006, the President of the State Bar of Texas appointed him to serve on the Administration of the Rules of Evidence Committee, where he helped to restyle the Texas Rules of Evidence. He is also the Contributing Evidence Editor of the State Bar of Texas’ General Practice Digest. Counseller joined the faculty of Baylor Law in 2003. He graduated from Baylor Law with honors and was a member of the Baylor Law Review, the Order of the Barristers, and the interscholastic moot court and mock trial teams. Following his graduation from law school, Professor Counseller served as a law clerk to the Honorable Reynaldo G. Garza of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Professor Counseller then entered private practice in Houston, Texas, with Bracewell & Patterson, LLP (now Bracewell, LLP), where he was an associate in the trial section. Professor Counseller also served as an Assistant Criminal District Attorney in McLennan County, Texas, where he prosecuted both misdemeanors and felonies.
