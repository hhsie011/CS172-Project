Our People We care for and respect one another professionally and personally, acknowledging that while our work is important, our lives extend well beyond SAA. Excellence We strive to be outstanding in all that we do, both as individuals and as an organization, while embracing a growth mindset focused on learning and continuous improvement. Diversity, Equity & Inclusion We strive to be a safe, fair, open and wonderfully diverse community in which differences are celebrated and staff members can be authentically themselves, feel that they belong, have a voice and contribute meaningfully. Integrity We expect honesty, transparency, trust, accountability and respect for others, both personally and professionally, as we endeavor always to comport ourselves in an appropriate and ethical manner. Innovation We look for new ideas and better ways to accomplish our mission; accept the occasional failure as a necessary part of improvement; and applaud original thinkers who are courageous, bold and creative in both big and small ways. The Greater Good We endeavor to “own the whole” by embracing collaboration and thinking beyond our individual, departmental and organizational responsibilities, as we care for the success of not only our own work, but also for that of all our Stanford colleagues. Fun We take our work seriously, yet firmly believe in the power of humor and a work environment that is playful, lively and enjoyable.
