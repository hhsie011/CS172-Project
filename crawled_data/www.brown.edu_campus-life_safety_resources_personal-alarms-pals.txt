Any student, faculty or staff member who is concerned about their personal safety may obtain a personal alarm device to carry and use for alerting individuals nearby that they are in danger. The personal alarm can be carried in a purse, pocket, or attached to a belt. It can be used in an emergency situation to call for help, draw attention to a situation, or to scare off an attacker. Simply pull the pin and the alarm will sound. To silence the alarm insert the pin back into the device. Personal Safety Alarms are available to students, staff, and faculty at no cost. DPS distributes personal safety alarms to all first-year students at the First-Year Orientation Fair. Brown University members can stop by the Department of Public Safety (75 Charlesfield Street) to pick-up an alarm. A Brown ID is all that is needed! Please call 863-2542 or 863-1438 with any questions.
