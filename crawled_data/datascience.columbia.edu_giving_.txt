Bollinger Columbia University President We invite you to partner with us as we address societal problems and help make this world a better place. DSI adds value to nearly every part of Columbia’s education and research enterprise. Columbia data scientists, doctors, journalists, engineers, historians, social scientists, lawyers, and other experts apply data-driven insights to combat climate change, end discrimination in the justice system, open wealth management opportunities, motivate healthier habits, protect the security of nations, and much more. We are prepared for a not-too-distant future when data science informs every part of the University’s pursuit of its mission, providing new ways to answer familiar questions, new ways to even ask questions, and new ways to prepare students to lead us to a better future. Your gift will accelerate the University’s global leadership in collaborative data science research and education, help attract the most talented students and faculty, provide them with the most effective tools and resources, and establish the kind of environment they need to produce their best work…work that will have a direct impact on humanity.
