Now renewables are overtaking fossil fuels, with wind and solar energy becoming cheaper and more competitive. Bruce Usher, professor of professional practice at the Business School and co-director of the Tamer Center for Social Enterprise, explains the extraordinary growth in wind and solar energy; the trajectory of the transition from fossil fuels to renewables; and the implications for industries, countries, and the climate. He shows how governments and businesses with a farsighted approach will reap long-term benefits while others will trail behind amid the threat of catastrophic climate change. 212-854-5573 [email protected] Genre Nonfiction Topic Earth and Environmental Sciences Contact Us [email protected] Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University Â©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
