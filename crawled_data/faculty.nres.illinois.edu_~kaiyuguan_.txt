Goodwin Urbana, Illinois 61801 Visitor Locations: Last updated on April 23, 2022 by Kaiyu Guan All rights reserved. Kaiyu Guan University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign I am a Blue Waters Associate Professor in ecohydrology and remote sensing in the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences (NRES), College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences (ACES), Department of Computer Sciences (CS) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). I use satellite data, computational models, fieldwork, and machine learning approaches to address how climate and human practices affect crop productivity, water resource availability, and ecosystem functioning. I have keen interests in applying my knowledge and skills in solving real-life problems, such as large-scale crop monitoring and forecasting, water management and sustainability, and global food security. My lab closely works with scientists in computer science (deep learning, high performance computing), plant physiologists, agronomists, and economists in addressing the above real-world challenges. I was born in Jiangsu, China. My Chinese name is 管开宇, which carries my grandpa's sincere hope that I could be an astronaut to help explore and discover the universe ("开发宇宙"). Mission Statement: We aim to bring domain knowledge (i.e. hydrology, plant physiology, biogeochemistry, agricultural science), satellite data, supercomputing, and machine learning together to revolutionize the agricultural research, such that we can observe every crop field in real-time, monitor crop growth condition, water demands, and nutrient needs, forecast crop yield and risks, and provide farmers our solutions to best manage their fields, across the U.S. Corn Belt and Worldwide. We strive to achieve co-sustainability of environment quality and food security.

Short Bio: Before I joined UIUC, I was a post-doctoral scholar working with Prof. David Lobell in the Center on Food Security and the Environment and Department of Environmental Earth System Science, Stanford University. My postdoc research was to study climate change impacts and adaptations on crop production and food security in West African and US. Specifically, I used empirical and process-based approaches to model drought and heat stress effects on staple crop production and assess possible adaptation pathways. I also worked with Dr. Joe Berry on using satellite-based photosynthesis measurements (sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence) to quantify crop productivity. I briefly worked in the Climate Corporation to help their nitrogen modeling development between my Stanford and UIUC time. I got my Ph.D. from Princeton University in 2013, and I worked with Prof. Eric F. Wood in the Land Surface Hydrology Research Group. I also closely worked with Prof. Kelly K. Caylor and Prof. David Medvigy. My Ph.D. research focused on understanding how hydrological variability impacts vegetation dynamics (vegetation phenology, ecosystem productivity, and biome distributions) at the continent scale of tropics using multiple remote sensing datasets and ecosystem/land surface models (e.g. SEIB and VIC). Research Interests: Ecohydrology, Terrestrial Carbon Cycle, Remote Sensing Applications (optical/thermal/microwave), Airborne Hyperspectral Application, Agro-ecosystem modeling, Crop Modeling and Forecasting, Biogeochemistry, Agriculture Adaptation to Climate Change Peer-Reviewed Publications: (Google Scholar) Our group’s research portfolio includes the following three major categories with six specific areas (see below). Our group develops holistic solutions from sensing and monitoring, to modeling and quantification, for agricultural management practices, crop/feedstock carbon and GHG, and environmental conditions. The unique strength and innovation of our research group is the systematic thinking to integrate sensing (from satellite, airborne and ground sensing) with process models and AI to infer holistic agroecosystem dynamics, from aboveground to belowground conditions, covering the coupled water, carbon, nitrogen and energy cycles. Sensing & Monitoring Area 1: Satellite technology innovation and applications Area 2: Hyperspectral sensing in ground and airborne platforms Modeling & quantification Area 3: Carbon, GHG and crop yield quantification Area 4: Water resources and irrigation Advancing theory and mechanisms Area 5: Ecosystem-level ecohydrology and physiology Area 6: Agricultural sustainability and climate change All the peer-reviewed publications: (* indicates corresponding authorship, bold italics underline indicates group members at Guan's group) [120] Becker-Reshef, I. et al.
