Fellowship in Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine One of the nation's top training programs for experts in the field of neonatology and perinatal medicine. A Message from the Program Director & Associate Program Director We warmly welcome you to our website and appreciate your interest in our Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine Fellowship Program at The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University! The fellowship is based at Women & Infants Hospital, on the same campus as Hasbro Children's Hospital and Rhode Island Hospital. Just a quick point of clarification: While all three facilities are on the same campus, Women & Infants is within the Care New England healthcare system, and Hasbro and Rhode Island Hospitals are within the Lifespan healthcare system. We take immense pride in having educated and guided our past fellows. We remain equally proud of our present fellows, and are always excited to see them grow from anxious new fellows to fellows that are confident, experienced, and exceedingly well trained. It is a joy to see them leave our program ready to provide excellent care to neonates and flourish as academic or clinical neonatologists. We hope you enjoy your journey through our site! Joseph M.
