Every member of the faculty in Religious Studies can and does serve as a concentration advisor. The Director of Undergraduate Studies is the primary resource for concentrators and potential concentrators who have questions about the concentration's details. Would you like to know if a course from outside Religious Studies counts toward the concentration? Would you like to know how close you are to satisfying the concentration requirements? These are questions you should bring to the DUS. Your concentration advisor is your primary resource for discussing your course plan you interests, and your studies overall. Each concentrator is assigned a concentration advisor whose interests are related in some ways to interests that the concentrator has previously identified. Although the DUS also can discuss any issue related to a concentrator's studies, the concentration advisor provides an additional source of insight and advice.
