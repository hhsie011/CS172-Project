Building a Fire-Safe America in a Changing Climate Even as the United States grapples with the challenge of slowing global warming, Americans must also address the urgent need to shape more fire-safe communities across regions where human settlements have spread into fire-prone ecosystems and intensifying fires have increasingly, and devastatingly, been jumping from forests and grasslands into urban zones.
