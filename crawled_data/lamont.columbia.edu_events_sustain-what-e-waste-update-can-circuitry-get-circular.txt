More and more, you’re seeing shopping carts full of electronic gear pushed into stores like Staples. This is all part of a shift in consumer and commercial electronics toward a repair, re-use and recycling norm – and, in the long run, a pathway toward the end of the idea of waste. But the challenge is vast, with 57 million tons of such material generated worldwide in 2021. Explore the latest trends and issues with Andy Revkin of the Columbia Climate School and guests including "Junkyard Planet" author and Bloomberg columnist Adam Minter and Mike Sauchuk, associate director for retail merchandising for Staples in the U.S. Adam Minter's website: https://shanghaiscrap.com/ Staples' recycling page: https://www.staples.com/sbd/cre/marketing/sustainability-center/recycling-services/electronics/ Subscribe to receive Revkin’s dispatches and webcast alerts: http://j.mp/revkinbulletin Please click here for event website: https://www.earth.columbia.edu/videos/view/an-e-waste-update-can-circuitry-get-circularquestion Contact Information Andy Revkin [email protected] Upcoming Events Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory61 Route 9W · Palisades, NY 10964 Phone 845-359-2900 Contact Us [email protected] Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
