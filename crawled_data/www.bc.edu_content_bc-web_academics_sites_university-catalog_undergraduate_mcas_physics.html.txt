The Department of Physics offers a comprehensive program of study leading to the B.S. degree in Physics. This program is designed to prepare students not only for advanced graduate studies in physics or a related field but also for employment upon graduation in physics and other disciplines related to science and technology. Basic courses give students a solid foundation in the concepts of classical and modern physics and assist them in developing their analytical reasoning and problem-solving skills. Laboratory courses complement this experience with an opportunity to develop experimental skills and a working knowledge of advanced technology and computational techniques. Students are strongly encouraged to further develop all these skills by participating in advanced experimental, analytical, or computational research under the supervision of faculty mentors, and we will make every effort to find a suitable research opportunity for all interested students with our faculty members. Physics Courses Physics Faculty Physics Website Print Open All Close All Major Requirements Major Requirements The minimum requirements for the B.S. degree with a major in Physics include 44 credits in Physics, as described below, and additional corequisites in Mathematics and other sciences. Physics Requirements PHYS2200 Introductory Physics I (fall: 4 credits) PHYS2201 Introductory Physics II (spring: 4 credits) PHYS2050 Introductory Physics Lab I (fall: 1 credit) PHYS2051 Introductory Physics Lab II (spring: 1 credit) PHYS3100 Vibrations and Waves (fall: 4 credits) PHYS3300 Modern Physics (spring: 4 credits) PHYS4100 Classical Mechanics (fall: 4 credits) PHYS4200 Electricity and Magnetism (spring: 3 credits) PHYS4400 Quantum Physics I (fall: 3 credits) PHYS4401 Quantum Physics II (spring: 3 credits) PHYS4600 Statistical Mechanics and Thermodynamics (fall: 4 credits) At least 3 credits of a course*, chosen from: PHYS4300 Numerical Methods and Scientific Computing** (spring: 4 credits) PHYS4951 Senior Thesis*** (spring: 3 credits) PHYS4350 Experiments in Physics (spring: 3 credits) *MCAS Honors Program Thesis or Scholar of the College Thesis when supervised by a Physics faculty member will also meet this requirement. **Students need a background in computer programming, for example, CSCI2227 Introduction to Scientific Computation. ***Students will need prior agreement from a physics faculty supervisor to enroll in this course. At least 6 credits of an advanced (at or above the 4000 level) elective course. Courses vary from year-to-year, but recent offerings include: PHYS4505 Nuclear and Particle Physics (3 credits) PHYS4515 The Physics of Conventional and Alternative Energy (3 credits) PHYS4525 Foundations of Plasmonics (3 credits) PHYS4535 Nanoscale Integrated Science (3 credits) PHYS4545 Introduction to Condensed Matter Physics (3 credits) PHYS4555 Optics (3 credits) PHYS5540 General Relativity; Cosmological Implications PHYS4595 Introduction to Quantum Computing MATH4440 Dynamical Systems (3 credits) Advanced undergraduate Physics majors may, with departmental approval, enroll in first-year graduate courses, such as PHYS7711, 7732, or 7741. Students should consult with the Undergraduate Program Director regarding current elective offerings. Corequisites Students are also required to take the following courses. Mathematics MATH2202 Multivariable Calculus (4 credits) MATH2210 Linear Algebra (3 credits) MATH4410 Differential Equations (3 credits) Students without advanced math placement will need to take introductory calculus courses, such as MATH1103, which is a prerequisite for MATH2202. Chemistry CHEM1109â€“1110 and associated labs; other science courses, along with their associated labs, may qualify but require prior departmental approval. Computer Science CSCI2227 Introduction to Scientific Computation Minor Requirements Minor Requirements The minimum requirements for a minor in Physics include 24 credits in Physics and 8 corequisite credits, as described below: PHYS2200 Introductory Physics I (fall: 4 credits) PHYS2201 Introductory Physics II (spring: 4 credits) PHYS2050 Introductory Physics Lab I (fall: 1 credit) PHYS2051 Introductory Physics Lab II (spring: 1 credit) PHYS3100 Vibrations and Waves (fall: 4 credits) PHYS3300 Modern Physics (spring: 4 credits) Two upper-level courses (PHYS4000 and above) of 3 or more credits each. Students should discuss course selection with the Undergraduate Program Director. Information for First-Year Majors and Non-majors Information for First-Year Majors and Non-majors Physical science, computer science, and mathematics majors planning on taking physics in their freshman year should enroll in PHYS2200 and the associated lab PHYS2050. Biology majors and premedical students should enroll in PHYS2100 with the associated discussion section and lab PHYS2050. Depending on high school background, Physics majors take either the Calculus Iâ€“II sequence MATH1102â€“1103, or Calculus IIâ€“AP MATH1105 or start with Multivariable Calculus MATH2202. Note that MATH1100â€“1101 is intended for Biology and Premedical students and is not sufficient calculus preparation for Physics majors. Information for Study Abroad Information for Study Abroad Before undertaking study abroad, it is strongly recommended that the Physics major complete PHYS2200, PHYS2201 (or PHYS2100, 2101) with labs, PHYS3100, PHYS3300 (also with labs), and the corequisite math course MATH2202. The Department typically allows a maximum of four courses taken abroad to count for major credit. Of these four courses, two should be major required courses, plus two Physics electives. The department recommends any program with a solid teaching and research program in physics. Students who are interested in studying abroad are strongly encouraged to do so during the spring semester of their junior year. While planning their study abroad program, Physics majors should meet with the Undergraduate Program Director. Students should inquire early at the Office of International Programs, and with possible host institutions, to arrange for a course of study appropriate for physics majors. Course Offerings Course Offerings Courses numbered below 2000 are introductory courses directed primarily towards non-science majors. These courses have no prerequisites and need no mathematics beyond ordinary college entrance requirements. The courses that satisfy the Natural Science Core requirement are noted in the individual course descriptions. PHYS2100â€“2101 Introductory Physics I, II (Calculus) or PHYS2200â€“2201 Introduction to Physics I, II (Calculus) and PHYS2050â€“2051 Introductory Physics Laboratory I and II are required of all Chemistry and Physics majors; Biology majors should consult the Biology Department regarding Physics requirements. Courses numbered above 3000 are advanced offerings primarily for Physics majors.
