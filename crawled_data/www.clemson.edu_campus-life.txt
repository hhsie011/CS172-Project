Apply for Admission Finding Your Community Living on Campus Working at Clemson Clemson Home Current: Campus Life Surroundings That Inspire Gratitude A walk across Clemson’s campus transports visitors from rolling hills to Death Valley and farther still to Lake Hartwell. The sound of the carillon greets those within earshot of Tillman Hall, and often, the sight of an orange and purple sunset signals the end of a day spent in Clemson. Organizations That Foster Friendships “ "When I joined the club, I realized it was kind of a family. I felt like I fit in right away. [It] helped solidify in me that passion and the realization that I like being in close-knit groups working toward a common goal." Isabelle Conrad Genetics ’21 Campus Culture That Promotes Family “ "Clemson really is a family, and in a family, there are different personalities and beliefs. A family is able to sit all together and talk about our differences and accept that we aren’t all the same, but we still love each other. I want every student to know they have a spot at the table."
