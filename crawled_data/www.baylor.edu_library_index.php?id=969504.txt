The Baylor Libraries lead as an innovative research library that supports the mission of the university by undergirding scholarship, fostering teaching and learning, and building communities. Baylor has several research libraries, institutes, and centers, and is also home to Library and Academic Technology Services. Armstrong Browning Library and Museum is dedicated to the study of the lives and works of the Victorian poets Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett Browning, houses the world's largest collection of Browning material and contains 62 stained glass windows that illustrate the Brownings' poetry. Named by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) as one of the most beautiful college libraries in America, the facility serves as a cultural venue for the Baylor campus and draws more than 30,000 visitors a year. The Baylor Legal Research and Technology Center supports Baylor Law School students, other students across the university, practicing attorneys and the public. Its holdings include regularly updated collections of the laws and judicial decisions of the United States government and of all 50 states, administrative regulations of federal and Texas government agencies, as well as numerous legal periodicals, treatises, and practitioner resources. While part of the university's library system, this library operates under the oversight of Baylor Law School. The Arts & Special Collections Research Center houses the music and visual arts collections, as well as audio and video recordings for other disciplines. Recognized as one of the most distinguished music libraries in the Southwest, it boasts collections of approximately 75,000 music scores, 65,000 audio recordings, 10,000 video recordings, and 35,000 books on various aspects of music. The Library's special collections include rare and unique materials dating as far back as the 11th century. The Institute for Oral History has recorded and preserved oral histories since 1970, earning along the way a strong reputation for multidisciplinary outreach to both academic scholars and community historians by providing professional leadership, educational tools, and research opportunities. The Institute joined the University Libraries in 2019. The Keston Center for Religion, Politics, and Society receives, maintains, preserves, expands and makes available to researchers and scholars from across the globe the Keston Archives and Library, the world's most comprehensive artificially assembled collection of materials on religious persecution under communist and other totalitarian regimes. In addition to rare samizdat (illegal publications), the collection, which is housed on the third floor of Carroll Library, contains Keston News Service press releases, pamphlets, reports, manuscripts, court documents, and correspondence as well as 4,500 photographs, about 20 works of art, more than 700 audio-visual pieces, 69 propaganda posters, rare items and more. A library of about 8,000 books and nearly 900 periodicals augment the 1,400 linear feet of archives created in at least 33 languages and encompassing 30 discreet denominations and religions. Library and Academic Technology Services (LATS) supports the Libraries and the university by providing and supporting a wide-range of technologies that drive research, learning, and teaching. HelpDesk+ on the Garden Level of Moody Memorial Library features a Makerspace and Media Labs to empower creativity.
