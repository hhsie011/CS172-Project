Experts are available to advise Princeton University student, faculty, and staff on choosing appropriate data, application of quantitative research methods, the interpretation of statistical analyses, data conversion, and data visualization. Subject specialists help choose appropriate data. The statistical packages supported by consultants are R/R Studio and Stata. We provide limited help with SAS and SPSS. We provide statistical and software assistance in quantitative analysis of electronic data as part of independent research projects, such as junior papers, senior theses, term papers, dissertations, and scholarly articles.
