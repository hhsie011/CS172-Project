Students, faculty members and administrators spent the 2016-17 academic year developing the University Diversity and Inclusion Action Plan (UDIAP), which was adopted in spring 2017. The plan is a reflection upon how we can provide the best education possible for students from all backgrounds, especially those that have been historically marginalized. University Resource Groups University Resource Groups (URGs) provide an organized voice on campus for diverse communities within The University of Texas at Austin and also an outlet to celebrate the voices, identities, experiences, and talents of the groups.
