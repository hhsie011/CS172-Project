The MBSR Teacher Training Program for People Who Identify as Black, Indigenous, and/or Latino/Latina/Latinx Mar 30, 2022 MBSR Teacher Training Program for People Who Identify as Black, Indigenous, and/or Latino/Latina/Latinx Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) Class Application is Open Questions: [email protected] The MBSR Teacher Training Program for People Who Identify as Black, Indigenous, and/or Latino/Latina/Latinx The Mindfulness Center at Brown University is launching the MBSR Teacher Training Program for People Who Identify as Black, Indigenous, and/or Latino/Latina/Latinx. This program is for participants underrepresented by race and ethnicity in the mindfulness field. The first phase of this program is open to those who live in the United States and who identify as Black, Indigenous, and Latino/Latina. The program will be offered entirely online and will be taught by people of color and supported by some of the most experienced teacher trainers in the world and the Mindfulness Center at Brown through research, best practices and pedagogical approaches. We are also seeking diversity within these groups including by age, gender, sexual orientation, socioeconomics, and geographic location and are looking for participants active in their communities and with existing networks they will be able to offer mindfulness programs. Full Scholarships Provided The MBSR Teacher Training Program for People Who Identify as Black, Indigenous, and/or Latino/Latina/Latinx is funded by a generous foundation grant and the School of Public Health, Brown University. Full scholarships are available for participants. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) Mindfulness Based-Stress Reduction (MBSR) is based on ancient contemplative practices assembled into an 8-week program that is a systematic training in mindfulness meditation employing both formal and informal practices. The experiential program at Brown University taps into the wisdom of indigenous cultures to harness inner resources and cultivate resilience. MBSR has been researched over 40 years and consistently delivers positive outcomes associated with increased self-awareness and emotional and attentional regulation, demonstrating the impact of these ancient practices. In addition, outcomes have included reductions in symptoms for various physical and behavioral health conditions such as anxiety, depression, stress, chronic pain, and hypertension. MBSR Teacher Training at Brown University The MBSR Teacher Training Program for People Who Identify as Black, Indigenous, and/or Latino/Latina/Latinx is an effort to widen the population of teachers and participants who have access to mindfulness training and are involved in research programs. Despite the potential, mindfulness instruction in the West has historically been available to a narrow range of people, and all too often has failed to include and address the needs, life experiences, and priorities of marginalized communities. This program seeks to open opportunities for teacher trainees, participants, and a wider audience to engage with mindfulness practices taught by teachers and with trainees who are all members of underrepresented populations. The MBSR Teacher Training Program for People Who Identify as Black, Indigenous, and/or Latino/Latina/Latinx is an adaptation of the current Brown MBSR Teacher Training Program. Based on changes recommended by Black, Indigenous, and Latino/Latina focus group participants, the program is designed to meet the needs of this group while retaining the equivalent effectiveness and rigorous training. Changes and additions to the program include: adding a cohort mentoring program to provide additional ongoing support to participants throughout the entire training process; modifications to retreat requirements to support greater accessibility; and infusing the program with racial and societal issues ongoing. Currently, we are accepting applications for the MBSR class required as a prerequisite. Applications for the MBSR Teacher Training Program for People Who Identify as Black, Indigenous, and/or Latino/Latina/Latinx will open in August 2022 with full program details available then.
