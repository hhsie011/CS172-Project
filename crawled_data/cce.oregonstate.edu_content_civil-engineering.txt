Our civil engineering undergraduate program offers a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering (BSCE) degree where students receive general instruction in all disciplines, with the option for additional elective courses in desired areas. While our graduate program offers many areas of specialization for research focus: construction engineering management, geomatics engineering, geotechnical engineering, innovative materials, ocean and coastal engineering, structural engineering, surveying, transportation engineering, and water resources engineering. All undergraduate students upon graduation are eligible to take the National Fundamentals of Engineering, F.E., examination and students with an additional 16 quarter hours of surveying/geomatics courses can take in Oregon the Fundamentals of Surveying, F.S., examination. These examinations are the first step to becoming a licensed Professional Engineer or Professional Surveyor. Oregon State's BSCE program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, abet.org. Its mission is to provide a comprehensive, state-of-the art education to prepare students for professional and responsible engineering positions with business, industry, consulting firms or government. Information on ABET accreditation, Program Educational Objectives, Student Outcomes and enrollment and graduation data for the CE program are all found on the civil engineering accreditation page. Additional Opportunities Among the many unique opportunities open to OSU Civil Engineering students is the Civil Engineering Cooperative Program (CECOP). The program offers students a high quality, paid industrial experience and related academic activities while pursuing a degree at Oregon State. Students in the CE program are also eligible to seek registration as a Professional Engineer or a Professional Land Surveying license. A more detailed explanation of the BSCE program is contained in the Civil Engineering Undergraduate Advising Guide.
