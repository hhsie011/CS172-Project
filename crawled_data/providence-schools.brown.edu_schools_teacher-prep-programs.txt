Students in the Department of Education’s graduate programs spend the entire academic year embedded in Providence schools or interning at local education offices or nonprofits. Throughout the academic year, each student in Brown’s diverse cohort of Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) students is immersed in a local urban school, taking classes both at Brown and at the school site. Meanwhile, Urban Education Policy (UEP) students take part in internships that build relevant knowledge and skills while advancing the missions of Providence schools, city and state education offices and nonprofits who partner with the Providence Public School District (PPSD). Many graduate students continue to make a positive impact on local schools after graduation. Brown’s Urban Education Fellowship program provides loan forgiveness to up to 10 MAT and UEP graduates each year who pledge to serve Providence-area students and schools for three years. Undergraduate students also play a vital role in improving educational outcomes in Providence schools. As a complement to courses that teach them how to confront educational inequality, many education concentrators choose to volunteer in schools through the Community Corps program, providing tutoring, mentoring and after-school enrichment to elementary, middle and high school students across Providence. Program and Initiative Highlights Master of Arts in Teaching Master of Arts in Teaching students are immersed in a local urban school from fall to spring, serving as teaching residents as they take courses at Brown.
