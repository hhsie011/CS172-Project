Full-time employees in Schools/Departments that follow the University holiday calendar earn up to three personal days per year based on date of hire. Personal days are earned at the rate of one paid leave day for each four-month period worked starting from the date of hire. Full-time employees in Schools/Departments that follow the Clinical Practice calendar may earn between two and four personal days per year, based on date of hire and whether the clinical practices remain open on University designated holidays. At the Medical Center, those employees whose School/Department follow the Clinical Practice holiday calendar, two personal days are earned at the rate of one day for each six-month period worked starting from the date of hire and “additional personal days” accumulate on the day when the employee works on a University designated holiday. The number of personal days plus holidays will be the same regardless of which calendar is followed. Personal days may be used by an employee to observe religious holidays or for any other purpose. For officers and Non-Union Support Staff, personal days do not accumulate and must be used within twelve months of being earned. Union employees are governed by the provisions of their respective collective bargaining agreement.
