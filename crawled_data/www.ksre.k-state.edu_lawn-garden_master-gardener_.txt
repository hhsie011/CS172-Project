Donating time in return for horticultural training, Extension Master Gardeners help local agents meet the need for horticultural information in their communities. The means of providing this information are diverse, including horticultural "hotlines," demonstration gardens, garden shows, public presentations, and tours. In 2018, Extension Master Gardeners in Kansas donated more than 103,731 hours for a total volunteer value exceeding $2.3 million. See the list in the left column for more specific information.
