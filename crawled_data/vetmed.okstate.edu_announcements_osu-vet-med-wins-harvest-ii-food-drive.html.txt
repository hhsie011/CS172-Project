For the first time since 2006, Oklahoma State University’s IT group did not win OSU’s Harvest II Food Drive competition – OSU’s College of Veterinary Medicine won. The drive was sponsored by the Staff Advisory Council. “I thought it would be more beneficial to have our faculty, staff and students compete through our House System,” said Chris Pivinsky, Peterson Anatomy Learning Center lab manager at the veterinary college and SAC council member. “As a result, we were able to collect enough food to win the overall competition. All food donated went to Our Daily Bread located in Stillwater.” The House System is popular in the United Kingdom and used by many schools in the United States, including some veterinary schools. The OSU CVM House System aims to focus on promoting intellectual growth, mental and emotional health, social development, cultural competence and physical health. The four houses were named after individuals who shaped the trajectory of veterinary medicine through innovative theory and demonstrated passion and dedication to the profession as a whole—Drs. Louis Camuti, June Iben, Sidney Ewing and Wendell Krull. Here are the number of food items each house collected: Camuti 386, Iben 376, Ewing 254 and Krull 201 for a grand total of 1,217 cans.
