When health workers are not empowered with the knowledge they need to implement infectious disease and prevention measures, outbreaks within health facilities—and the communities they serve—are amplified. ICAP designs, develops and delivers competency-based curricula and training materials to support capacity building for health care workers at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels for nursing, medical, and public health students around the world.
