In addition to deciding on an academic path, TU students are also learning about the social issues that are important to them. The True Blue Neighbors Partner Fair during their first week on campus introduces new students to the people and organizations working in these areas across Tulsa. Throughout their time at TU, these initial connections deepen as students often develop along what we call the “Ladder of Engagement”. Volunteer service can develop into opportunities for advocacy and informing policy. In collaboration with other offices on campus, we provide support for students in their academic and co-curricular experiential learning and pursuit of community service-related internships and externships. These experiences prepare students to meet their academic and career goals by developing real-world skills and applying critical reasoning toward complex community issues. 800 S.
