Our goal is to develop and race the generation of formula-style racecar for FSAE Michigan, the largest collegiate engineering and racing competition of its kind in North America. We pride ourselves on running a team where anyone can join and learn regardless of experience or academic concentration. In fact, the majority of our members have never used the tools or softwares we employ before joining our team. This makes the learning experience all the more valuable. Our team provides a unique opportunity to be part of a simulated engineering business from project inception to vehicle completion. Members gain experience in basic and advanced metal and composites fabrication, 3D modeling, design for manufacture, as well as component and vehicle testing. Members then get the galvanizing experience of presenting their work to industry experts and learning from their critiques. In this environment, Brown Formula Racing provides a new dimension to Brown's academic curriculum that cannot be matched in the classroom. Of course we must thank the university and the Brown School of Engineering for their support as well as the support of our sponsors who make this project possible every year.
