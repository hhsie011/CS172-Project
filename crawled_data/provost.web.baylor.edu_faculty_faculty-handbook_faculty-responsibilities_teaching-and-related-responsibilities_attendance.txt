Interaction with faculty members and fellow students provides the best opportunity for learning information and for exercising skills necessary to gain competencies in the subject. Classroom discussion also enriches understanding beyond the boundaries of the specific course and develops students' analytical facility and ability to communicate ideas effectively. The University expects each student to take full advantage of his or her educational experience by developing personal responsibility for class attendance. Student attendance must be recorded through the census date of each term (the twelfth class day of the fall or spring terms). Specific policies for attendance are established by the academic units within the university. Faculty members may establish more stringent requirements regarding attendance, punctuality, and participation. Any attendance requirements and penalties for excessive absences will be set forth in the syllabus for each course. The student bears the responsibility for the effect that absences may have upon class participation, announced and unannounced examinations, written assignments, reports, papers, and other means of evaluating performance in a course. If a student's required participation in a University-sponsored activity causes the student to miss class, this is ordinarily considered an absence that is counted against a student in the context of an applicable attendance policy. However, if in this event the student seeks to make arrangements prior to the absence to complete scheduled assignments, the faculty member will work with the student to allow for the completion of missed classwork and assignments. In the event of serious illness, accident, or death in the family, students should contact their professors as soon as they are able. When such a crisis prohibits the student from being able to make immediate contact, the office of the Chaplain notifies faculty when information is available; the Chaplain, does not, however, pursue official verification of such reports. Requests by faculty to verify the nature of an absence should be made to the student upon the student's return. Students are usually allowed to make up classwork and/or tests missed which result from such crises. As these instances are academic matters, any dishonesty on the part of a student in such a situation is considered a violation of the University Honor Code. Class absences are one of the early signs that a student may be experiencing academic, personal, or emotional challenges or distress. Resources in the Paul L. Foster Success Center and Counseling Center are available for students who are experiencing difficulties related to class attendance.
