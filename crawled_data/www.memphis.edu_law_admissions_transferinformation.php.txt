Startover Admission The School of Law may admit to the first year entering class a student who has been academically excluded from an ABA accredited law school if, in the opinion of the Admissions Committee, the student has made an affirmative showing that he or she "possesses the requisite ability and that the prior disqualification does not indicate a lack of capacity to complete the course of study at the admitting school" pursuant to ABA Standard 505. The number of students who can be admitted as startovers in any given year is limited to five (5) and is further limited to residents of Tennessee or non-resident students previously excluded from the Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law. Transfer Admission Admission as a transfer student to the School of Law is competitive.
