The Academic Advising Center provides academic counseling to matriculated students with respect to the General Education Program and the policies/procedures associated with that program. The Academic Advising Center is the academic home department for undeclared students, providing services normally given through the student's declared major department. Additionally, the center provides programs and services to assist students in the selection of a major. Students seeking information about the implications of academic probation and disqualification are encouraged to visit the Academic Advising Center for a personal consultation. Please consult the Academic Advising Center website for useful information about the General Education program, graduation requirements, university policies and procedures. The center provides walk-in advising, no appointment necessary. This site is maintained by Academic Advising Center.
