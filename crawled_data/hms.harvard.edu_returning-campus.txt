Update as of May 23, 2022: Harvard University has shared the following COVID-19 public health guidance for those attending commencement-related activities: COVID-19 transmission is rated as “high” in Boston and Cambridge. Please use this knowledge as you plan your commencement activities. Get tested every day that you have a scheduled event, even if you are not experiencing symptoms. Rapid antigen tests are widely available at area pharmacies. Harvard’s Color PCR testing is still available. We encourage those enrolled in this program to continue using it, in addition to rapid tests. If you test positive, do not attend commencement events during your isolation period. After testing positive, adhere to the 5-day home isolation guidance. For the full 10 days, follow strict masking and do not drink or dine in proximity to other people. Visit the Keep Harvard Healthy website for more information. If you have symptoms, no matter how mild, please do not attend commencement events – even if you test negative. For indoor and crowded outdoor events, wear a high-quality mask that fits securely without air gaps around your nose and mouth. See mask guidance here. If attending events that involve unmasking to eat or drink, minimize any unmasked mingling and mask up whenever you can. COVID testing is optional for all Harvard community members as of May 10, 2022, except as noted above for those attending Commencement-related activities. Starting June 1, there will be no test collection or processing on Sundays. Please note that the current test kits, which are from Harvard University Clinical Lab (HUCL) and have a plastic swab, will be retired after June 30 so please do not take more than you will need. Further information regarding test kits post-June 30 is forthcoming. Anyone with symptoms or known exposure should continue to test. Those who test positive should notify Harvard University Health Services (HUHS) through Crimson Clear. Anyone who would still like to test is welcome to do so. Refer to the HMS Testing Guide for test kit pick up and drop off locations, as well as other details. Masks are optional in HMS and HSDM buildings as of March 7, 2022, except as noted above for those attending Commencement-related activities and these noted exceptions: Effective Monday, May 23, masks are now required within the classroom spaces of the TMEC, including in the learning studios, amphitheater, and tutorial rooms. Care should be taken with regard to eating and drinking in classroom settings, with removal of masks only briefly as needed to take bites or sip liquids. Masks are still required in health care facilities, including HSDM clinical facilities, and on University and MASCO buses and shuttles. Those completing isolation or quarantine are also required to wear masks. If you feel the need to wear a mask for your own protection, or to protect someone close to you, you should do so. Everyone should continue carry a mask when coming to campus in case it becomes necessary to wear it. Harvard will continue to monitor COVID-19 developments and will update masking requirements for the community or for certain populations when necessary. Eating and drinking are permitted on campus and at gatherings at HMS as of March 7, as they were pre-COVID, except as noted above for classroom settings and for those attending Commencement-related activities. Harvard’s vaccination requirement remain in place. Vaccination remains the best means of protecting ourselves against severe disease, hospitalization, and risk of death. Harvard updated its COVID-19 travel guidance on April 13, removing the requirements for petitions and attestations. Harvard travelers who are not vaccinated are no longer required to submit travel petitions for their Harvard-related travel within the United States or internationally. Vaccinated and boosted Harvard travelers are no longer required to submit a vaccination attestation form. As travel still poses risk, individuals should take appropriate precautions before deciding to travel domestically or internationally. Travelers must adhere to the COVID-19 travel requirements before, during, and after travel. The University remains committed to facilitating travel, which is critical to many of our academic and professional pursuits, under safe conditions. We will continue to adjust the University’s travel guidance and requirements in response to changing conditions. Students, faculty, staff, and researchers who are traveling internationally must register their Harvard-related international travel with International SOS, the University’s emergency response provider. Learn more about the benefits of registering international travel with the University’s emergency response provider. Proof of registration is required for international travel reimbursement. Travelers booking tickets through a Harvard preferred agency will automatically be registered with International SOS. The latest travel and reimbursement guidance details the reimbursement process.

Public Transportation Reset Your Commute As we continue returning to our campus and workplaces, our commutes may still not look like the pre-pandemic normal. CommuteWorks, a MASCO service, offers some tips for getting back to the LMA. Find more comfortable walking routes in your area at Walk Boston. If you don't have a bike, Bluebikes is a great option. Try public transit a few days a week to ease back into your commuting routine. All inbound trains now stop at Ruggles and JFK/UMass. See the new commuter rail schedules. Commute at off-peak times if schedule allows to avoid crowding. Use MBTA-endorsed transit apps to see real-time crowdsourced information for bus and Red/Orange/Blue lines. Commuter Rail 5-Day Flex Pass: The 5-day Flex Pass is a pandemic pilot product on the mTicket app that provided five days of Commuter Rail travel within a 30-day period at a 10% discount compared to five round-trip tickets. This pandemic pilot provided an additional option for riders with in-person work schedules limited by the pandemic. With the Commonwealth’s state of emergency ending on June 15, the 5-day Flex Pass Pilot will end three months later, on Sept. 15. The Flex Pass will no longer be available for purchase on mTicket after Sept. 15, though Flex Passes purchased before that date will continue to be valid until they are used or expire. Commuter Rail Fare Expiration Extension: Commuter Rail customers may travel with unused, expired, paper One-Way, Round-Trip, and 10-Ride tickets that were valid on March 10, 2020, onboard between June 15, 2021, and Sept. 15, 2021. Unused mTickets that were valid on March 10, 2020, will also be reissued a final time on Sunday, June 20, 2021, with an expiration of Sept. 15. Customers do not need to take any action – the MBTA will automatically push new mTickets to customers’ apps for use until Sept. 15. Ruggles Station Reopening: Ruggles Station has reopened, with a new commuter rail platform allowing an increase in commuter rail trains stopping at Ruggles Station. All inbound trains on the Providence/Stoughton, Needham, and Franklin lines will now stop at Ruggles (rather than backtracking to South Station or Back Bay stations). MBTA Summer 2021 Service Changes The MBTA is adding back service across the system to support increased travel across the region.
