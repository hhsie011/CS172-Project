Developmental Leave This award requires a faculty development leave (FDL). An expedited FDL procedure will be used when faculty receive one of the targeted external awards that is recognized by AAU/CMUP/THECB and is supported by internal incentives. This procedure is described here. TTU Internal Procedures for Prospective Applicants All faculty planning to apply for a Fulbright Scholar should reach out to their Department Chairs and/or College Deans before submitting their application to inform them about their intentions to apply for a Fulbright award and their prospective timeline for completing the project. Please note that if a faculty or administrator receives a Fulbright award several arrangements need to be made and resources need to be allocated in advance to cover for the grantee absence, and thus, is important to inform your department/college about your application plans ahead of time. Prospective applicants also need to notify Dr. Stephanie J. Jones, Faculty Fellow in the Office of Research & Innovation and Dr. Rob Stewart, Senior Vice Provost about their intentions to apply for a Fulbright award. TTU Resources for Prospective Applicants TTU-Fulbright Scholar Liaisons at the Office of International Affairs (OIA) are available to provide faculty with detailed information about the different Fulbright programs, application process and guidelines. They can also help faculty develop an application plan, provide guidance on the development of the proposal and identify a potential TTU-Fulbright Alumni mentor. Faculty across colleges and departments are encouraged to schedule an appointment with TTU-Fulbright Liaisons to discuss their research interests, timeline for submitting a Fulbright Scholar application, Fulbright programs that may fit their interests and career needs, and countries of interest as well as other topics and questions. You can contact them at: Dr. Elizabeth Trejos-Castillo, Human Development & Family Sciences; Email: elizabeth.trejos@ttu.edu Dr. Jorge Salazar-Bravo, Director, International Center for Arid and Semiarid Land Studies (ICASALS); Email: j.salazar-bravo@ttu.edu A list of Frequently Asked Questions about Fulbright applications can be found here.
