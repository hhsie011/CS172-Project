Combining these attributes allows for the desirable material properties of important semiconductor phases in the form of long lengths of fiber. Semiconductor optical fibers are made using one of two approaches: the molten core method and a chemical vapor deposition method…. Inventor: John Ballato, Thomasina Zaengle, Baris Kukuoz, Ursula Gibson Published: 5/23/2022 Learn More Download a Printable PDF Machine Learning Algorithm to Guide Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Personalization Biotechnology, Manufacturing This patient risk-assessment machine learning algorithm predicts patient response to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) intervention enabling more informed selection criteria and improved rates of therapy success. Approximately 90,000 patients receive cardiac resynchronization therapy per year, with only 50% of that population benefitting. This directly results from the uncertainties surrounding which patients will actually benefit from the procedure. Providing insights into… Inventor: Will Richardson, Anamul Haque, William Douglas Stubbs Jr. Published: 5/23/2022 Learn More Topology Agnostic Detection and Location of Fault in DC Microgrid Using Local Measurements Information and Communication, Manufacturing This topology agnostic fault detection and location technology is the first such technology that is system-independent, uses only local measurements, and is closed form (non-iterative). Combining these attributes allows this technology to operate quickly to meet the needs of the growing DC microgrid market. This speed advantage bridges a major challenge for DC microgrids by protecting components from speed critical… Inventor: Munim Bin Gani, Sukumar Brahma Published: 3/24/2022 Learn More Download a Printable PDF Purposeful Failure Methodology for Machinery Manufacturing This failure methodology utilizes purposeful generation of labeled failure mode datasets via surrogate purposeful failure twin (SPFT) simulations. Machine learning powered performance analysis, predictive maintenance, and production management capable of reducing unexpected failure and unnecessary downtime are enabled via this innovation. This technology revolutionizes the manufacturing operations management (MOM) system market, which currently suffers from a gap in the availability… Inventor: Ethan Wescoat, Laine Mears Published: 3/13/2022 Learn More Download a Printable PDF Triple Ridge Waveguide Laser Manufacturing Clemson University researchers have developed a TRW laser structure that consists of a broad-ridge waveguide to provide dissipative modes that can couple with higher-order modes. This laser can effectively suppress all the undesired higher-order transverse modes under a threshold, ensuring single-mode operation with a larger emitting aperture and a higher output power than traditional RW lasers.
