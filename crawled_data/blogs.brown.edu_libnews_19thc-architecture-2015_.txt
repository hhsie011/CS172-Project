This course surveyed stylistic developments, new building types, and changing social conditions of architectural production for the period covering 1800 to 1900. Students were asked either to write a final paper or construct an architecturally accurate model of a building or related work that had originally been created during the 19th century. Dates: May 15 – September 16, 2015 Location: Finn Reading Room Cases, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Library, 10 Prospect Street, Providence This entry was posted in Uncategorized by Jennifer Braga.
