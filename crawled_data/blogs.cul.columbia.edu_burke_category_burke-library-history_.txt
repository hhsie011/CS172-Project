Posted on September 30, 2021 (October 1, 2021) by Jeffrey Wayno Earlier this Fall, The Burke Library proudly reopened its doors to the Columbia and Union communities after being closed for eighteen months due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Our staff is particularly proud to provide […] Read More… Posted in Burke Library History, History, Rare booksTagged Collections, COVID-19, Events, Instruction, Manuscripts, Special Collections, van ess1 Comment Updating Finding Aids: Improving the Discovery of Archives at the Burke Library Posted on April 2, 2021 (May 13, 2021) by Leah Edelman Like many archivists at CUL and beyond, I’ve found working remotely to be an opportunity to address back burner projects. Chief among these is the conversion of Burke’s 400+ finding aids, which were originally created as PDFs, into Encoded Archival Description (EAD) format — an XML standard for archival finding aids. You may be […] Read More… Posted in Archives, Burke Library History, HistoryTagged Archives, Collections, EAD, Finding Aids2 Comments Virtual Teaching with Rare Materials in the Era of COVID-19 Posted on March 12, 2021 (March 12, 2021) by Jeffrey Wayno Over the last year, much has changed at The Burke library.

Yet I am constantly reminded of the astonishing efficiency of microformatting, when researchers ask to see the collection of primary-source materials of Dietrich Bonhoeffer—noted German theologian, pastor, and anti-Nazi dissident, and onetime student at Union Theological Seminary—preserved on microfiche, collectively […] Read More… Posted in Archives, Burke Library History, History, Union Theological Seminary HistoryTagged Archives, Bonhoeffer, Collections, Events, Exhibits, Manuscripts, microficheLeave a comment “Spirit of ’68” Part II: Research in the Administrative Files Posted on October 26, 2018 (October 30, 2018) by Jake Hearen By Jake Hearen, Student Research Assistant for the “Spirit of ’68” Exhibit (Posted c/o Carolyn Bratnober, Public Services Librarian) I came to Union a bit behind the power curve.

Gillett’s classed catalog, mixed together with Charles Ammi Cutter’s classification and folded into 3 cups Alfred Cave’s An Introduction to Theology. But as with any recipe, the most important element […] Read More… Posted in Archives, Burke Library History, History, Union Theological Seminary HistoryTagged Collections2 Comments Search Quick Links Staff Contributors Student Bloggers Recent Posts The Construction and Evolution of the UTS Campus: a Re-Imagined Exhibit Union Seminary Quarterly Review (USQR) Archive Gratian’s “Decretum” and the Foundations of Christian Legal Education Looking Back & Looking Forward Belonging As a Latinx Seminarian Archives April 2022 March 2022 February 2022 December 2021 November 2021 September 2021 May 2021 April 2021 March 2021 February 2021 January 2021 May 2020 April 2020 March 2020 February 2020 January 2020 November 2019 October 2019 September 2019 August 2019 July 2019 June 2019 May 2019 April 2019 March 2019 February 2019 December 2018 November 2018 October 2018 September 2018 May 2018 April 2018 March 2018 February 2018 January 2018 December 2017 September 2017 August 2017 July 2017 June 2017 May 2017 April 2017 March 2017 February 2017 January 2017 December 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 September 2014 August 2014 July 2014 June 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 August 2013 July 2013 June 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 Tags Archives Behind the Stacks Burke Archives Burke Library COVID-19 CUL Graduate Student Internship CUL Graduate Student Internship Program Diary ecumenism Exhibits FMCNA German Graduate Intern History Imperialism India Instruction interns Journal library science Luce Luce Foundation Manuscripts Missionaries Missions More Product Less Process MRL MRL3 MRL10 MRL12 Native Americans NCC prisoners of war Processing Rare Books Special Collections students Union Theological Seminary Union Theological Serminary UNP WAB war Water Disaster WCC work-study Subscribe2 Leave This Blank:Leave This Blank Too:Do Not Change This: Your email: Category Specific RSS Archives (41) Burke Library History (10) Burke Staff (8) Circulation & Delivery (4) Collections (2) Events (1) History (38) Manuscripts (4) Rare books (30) Student Entry (86) Student projects (1) Uncategorized (2) Union Theological Seminary History (25) CUL Blogs Home CUL Blogs Dashboard 535 West 114th St. New York, NY 10027 | Telephone (212) 854-7309 | Fax (212) 854-9099 Copyright | Policies | Suggestions & Feedback | Contact Us | About Us
