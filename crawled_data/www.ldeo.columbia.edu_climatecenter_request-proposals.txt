It is the foundation's wish to promote climate research at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and Goddard Institute for Space Studies (NASA) by providing seed money for research projects geared to exploring various climate issues. For background information on the Climate Center, please download the document entitled The Center for Climate Research . The Climate Center Committee is requesting proposal submissions for climate-related research projects twice a year. The deadline for the next RFP is 5pm on November 1st, 2021. Proposals are submitted at other times of the year, but are the rare exception and require a strong justification of the submission date. Please read the attached guidelines before applying for an award. All recipients will need to sign an acknowledgement form before accepting the funds. The Climate Center provides money for the following four major purposes: 1. To fund start-up research projects aimed at leveraging government sponsored research grants. For a list of projects funded in the more recent past, please contact us at clmtctr@ldeo.columbia.edu with your request. 2. To fund lecturer visits by prominent scientists depending on the availabilty of funds. (Not until campus is at 100% capacity) 3. To fund mini-conferences depending on availability of funds. 4. To fund ~2 sudents in the Undergraduate Research Project for the Earth Intern program depending on availability of funds. The vast majority of available funds go to start-up research projects (#1 above). ________________________________________________________________________________________________ General guidelines for proposal submission for 1. and 3.: Electronic submission of proposals is preferred (in either Adobe PDF and/or Microsoft Word formats).
