Many history majors also pursue a minor in another discipline, a second major, or secondary teacher certification. The department offers a variety of survey courses (200 series) for first- and second-year students as either general education courses or as introductions to advanced courses in history or other subject areas. In addition to 200-level survey courses, it offers advanced undergraduate courses in the history of Europe, Asia, Africa, Latin America, the United States, technology and science, agriculture, and other selected topics. Student Learning Outcomes Upon graduation, students should be able to: Display the appropriate level of cognitive knowledge of historical themes and events based upon the student’s course of study Display an understanding of past cultures and social organizations, based on the course of study Develop the fundamental methodological skills of the historical craft: the ability to contextualize and analyze primary source evidence; familiarity with the concepts of historical argument and interpretation, and the ability to formulate effective argumentation in written and oral forms; awareness of the basic historiography in selected research area; and the ability to conduct research and to write a historical essay based upon primary and secondary source research. Students receive an introduction to these concepts in HIST 301 The Historian's Toolbox. Display a sophisticated understanding of the relationship between past events and the present.

Minor The department offers a minor in History, which may be earned with 15 credits in History courses, of which at least 9 must be in courses numbered 300 or above, excluding HIST 490 Independent Study. A minimum of 9 credits numbered 300 or above must be taken at Iowa State. The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences requires students to earn a C or higher in at least 6 of the required 300-level credits. The minor must include at least 9 credits that are not used to meet any other department, college, or university requirement. A student may count a maximum of 3 hours of cross-listed courses originating in another teaching department toward the minor in History. The History minor is most frequently chosen by students majoring in Political Science, English, Journalism, Computer Science, and Business. Graduate Study The History Department offers two graduate degrees: an M.A. in History and a Ph.D. in Rural, Agricultural, Technological and Environmental History. Most history graduate courses are either readings seminars or research seminars. Readings seminars acquaint students with the historical literature of a field and prepare them for careers in teaching and research. Research seminars require students to conduct original historical research and to write research papers reporting the results. The M.A. in history includes both thesis and non-thesis options. See the departmental website on the M.A. in History for a full discussion of the options and requirements. An M.A. in History serves as the basis for continued study in history, as well as preparation for careers in law, education, business, and government service. Throughout world history human beings have depended on rural and agricultural communities as well as on the technologies developed and employed by these communities to sustain lives. Iowa State's Doctoral Program in Rural, Agricultural, Technological and Environmental History offers a scholarly community and learning environment dedicated to the close examination of pervasive and enduring questions about these basic aspects of human history. Such questions can best be answered through the multi-faceted perspectives provided by rural, agricultural, technological, and environmental history. The result is a dynamic learning experience that leads to comparative and transnational analysis shaped by a broad range of methods drawn from the humanities and social/physical sciences. The Program's aim is to produce students who are excellent researchers and engaging teachers, capable of succeeding in a broad variety of professional positions, both inside and outside of academia. The Ph.D. in Rural, Agricultural, Technological and Environmental History is designed for students who have completed an M.A. in history. Those who have not yet completed an M.A. will be expected to complete the degree while progressing toward the Ph.D. Thirty semester hours of graduate credit are required for the M.A. and 72 for the Ph.D. Students who continue beyond the M.A. are expected to pass preliminary examinations in four areas of specialization, complete a dissertation, and defend it orally in the Ph.D. final examination. See the departmental website on the program for a full description of requirements. Every effort has been made to make the catalog accurate as of the date of publication.
