Jones Graduate Student 216 Kemeny Hall · 603-646-9810 matthew.i.jones.gr@dartmouth.edu Networks; Complex systems; Game theory, economics, social and behavioral sciences website about After growing up on a farm in Northern Minnesota, I majored in physics at Arizona State University, where I also studied math and education. Now an applied math Ph.D. student at Dartmouth College, my work focuses on social problems and complex systems, examining how individuals interact with each other in large groups. I study everything from the spread of fake news to voting behavior to deciding where to eat dinner with your friends. When I'm not doing math, I enjoy hiking, snowboarding, reading, playing (board and video) games, and playing guitar.
