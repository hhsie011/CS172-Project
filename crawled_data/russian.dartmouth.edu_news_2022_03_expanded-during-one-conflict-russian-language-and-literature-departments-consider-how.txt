Many courses' focus on Russian president Vladimir Putin leads to the idea of a strong, unified imperial Russia, said Ainsley Morse, a Dartmouth College literature professor in the school's Russian Department — and that, she said, has contributed to today's conflict. "The idea of a very strong Russia is one of the driving forces behind the war that is happening right now," said Morse, who has taught Soviet and post-Soviet Russian/Russophone literature at Dartmouth College, Pomona College and University of California San-Diego. Rather than teach about him or the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, Morse instead focuses her classes on "talking about what ordinary people's lives are" in Russia, she said last week. That might mean "talking about what individual writers and artists and other cultural figures are trying to do to make sense of often catastrophic events," she said. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, Morse said she and her colleagues at other colleges around the country and around the world have been discussing how Russian studies are being taught and what is missing.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Russian Undergraduate Majors and Minors Majors: Russian Language and Area Studies Minors Courses Course Descriptions Courses by Term Placement Test Awards & Prizes The Solzhenitsyn Prize in Russian The Pray Modern Language Prize in Russian The Richard Sheldon Prize The Honors Program Foreign Study Resources & Opportunities Overview Student Assistant Teacher Opportunities Martin T.
