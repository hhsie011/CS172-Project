Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) The FAQ documents on the CUIMC COVID Vaccine Information page continue to be updated, so please check the site for the latest versions. Below is the Question of the Day: I wanted to know if there are any issues regarding diabetes and the vaccine? People with diabetes are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease and thus were intentionally enrolled in the clinical trials. Based on data from clinical trials, the COVID-19 vaccines appear to be safe and effective in people with diabetes. Thank you and hope you continue to stay safe!
