We feel that it is in the best interest of our families at this time. If GT grandparents would still like to visit campus and their GT students, we encourage them to check out the GT baseball schedule at RamblinWreck.com and come for a weekend game and create a special afternoon experience that works for them. If you have any questions about this event please visit our Events FAQs page. Thank you.
