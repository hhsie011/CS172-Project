Many assume that the study of economics is only about finance and the stock market, but in truth, the field is much, much broader. Economics delves into the science of human behavior, intersecting such diverse disciplines as law, anthropology, physics, sociology, engineering, history, math, education, medicine, gender, environment and agriculture. A student of economics will tap into all these fields to gain an understanding of how markets function.
