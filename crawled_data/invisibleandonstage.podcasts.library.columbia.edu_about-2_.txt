Skip to content Invisible and On Stage Menu All Episodes Get help About About Every day, both inside the classroom and out, many Black students struggle against stereotype threat, alienation, and impostor syndrome. How do these microaggressions, as well as more overt forms of systemic racism, erode an individual’s emotional well-being? How do daily experiences with racism deteriorate one’s identity and sense of community? In her limited podcast series, host Dr. Keoshia Worthy explores these questions with guests who share their personal experiences both as Black professionals and students, as she reflects on her own journey as a Black woman in academia. Provoking open and informed conversations around racism-related stress, identity, and community, Invisible and On Stage applies a psychosocial lens to the Black student experience – and investigates the insidious ways that racism harms mental health. the host Dr. Keoshia Worthy is a licensed psychologist formerly at Columbia Health Counseling and Psychological Services (Columbia University).
