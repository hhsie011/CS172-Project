Bringing together an interdisciplinary group of scholars, we mobilize the insights of the literary and visual arts, archaeology, anthropology, and history to excavate deep histories and sculpt speculative futures of the earth. Sponsored by the Program in Early Cultures, Hsiao Family Fund and Joseph Edinburg Fund in the History of Art and Architecture Department, Joukowsky Institute for Archaeology and the Ancient World, Cogut Institute for the Humanities, and Brown Arts Initiative.
