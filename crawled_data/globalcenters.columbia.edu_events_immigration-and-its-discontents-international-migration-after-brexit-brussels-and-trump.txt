From Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, and Germany to Singapore, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States, it is churning electoral politics. A hundred years ago, similar discontents resulted in severe restrictions on immigration. Will history repeat itself? The Columbia Global Centers | Mumbai invites you to a public lecture and discussion by Dr. Neeraj Kaushal, Professor of Social Policy at Columbia University. Dr. Kaushal will discuss the primary drivers of these discontents, how they are related to immigration, and how they would shape the future of international migration. About the Speaker Dr. Neeraj Kaushal is Professor of Social Policy and Chair of Doctoral Programs at the School of Social Work, Columbia University. Dr. Kaushal is also the co-director of the Immigration and Migration Program Research Group of the Columbia Population Research Center. She is a health and labor economist, specializes in immigration and refugee issues, and has studied impacts of social policies on the lives of low-income families in many countries.
