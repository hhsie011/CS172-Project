The musicians will be joined by members of the Prokofiev family for performances of The Ugly Duckling, the Sixth Piano Sonata, and several rarely-heard works from the Archive. Pre-concert talk at 6:30 PM on the history of Prokofiev's musical archives by Simon Morrison, Serge Prokofiev Foundation President and Professor of Music, Princeton University. Admission is free; no tickets required. "The Prokofiev family is pleased to celebrate the relocation of the Prokofiev Archive to Columbia University in New York City, where my grandparents first met some hundred years ago, and where his music has always been greeted so warmly by the music-loving public." --Serge Prokofiev, Jr. Simon Morrison, the Foundation's president and professor of musicology at Princeton University, says: "The works featured on the program for this recital--some heard for the first time in many decades--remind us of the many facets of Prokofiev's life and work that await discovery. Such discoveries will be considerably facilitated by the new consolidation of the composer's archives at Columbia." The Serge Prokofiev Foundation was founded in 1983 by Lina Prokofiev (the composer's first wife) with the object of furthering the knowledge and appreciation of Prokofiev's life and works. In addition to overseeing the preservation of and access to the composer's personal archives, the Foundation publishes the scholarly journal Three Oranges, and is in the process of developing a new critical edition of the composer's works with Bärenreiter, among other digital projects.
