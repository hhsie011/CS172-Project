The academic focus of the Greek foreign study program is the archeology, art and history of Greece. The classroom consists of dozens of archeological sites, some actually in the process of being excavated, and numerous museums housing some of the world's finest collections of ancient Classical art. Extensive traveling familiarizes the student not only with Greece's past but also with its present, its people and landscape. General Information Classics majors normally account for only about half of the enrollment. Occasionally students will participate in the Greek program in the spring, find a job on an excavation during the summer, and then enroll in the Classics Department's Roman program in the fall for a full nine months of classical archeology on site in the Mediterranean. No knowledge of ancient Greek or Latin is required. Basic proficiency in Modern Greek is appreciated (see list of prerequisite courses below) but not required. If interested in the program please contact Julie Hruby. Curriculum Coursework consists of quizzes, short papers, and oral reports as well as text and image contributions to a program-based Web site. Since no library is readily available, students will learn how to go about analyzing objects, buildings, and topographical and historical problems through on-site observation. All students participating in the Greece FSP take the following three courses: Classical Studies 30.90: Classical Art and Archaeology: Study Abroad Classical Studies 30.91: Classical Art and Archaeology: Study Abroad Classical Studies 31.90: Ancient History: Study Abroad Prerequisites The standard slate of prerequisites consists of three courses chosen from those listed below, but each applicant should discuss with the Faculty Director how s/he might fulfill the required prerequisites. The more academic preparation done ahead of time, the more rewarding the experience abroad tends to be. Students are urged to take more than three of the courses listed below if they can fit them into their schedules. A grade of B- or better is required in these courses in order for them to count as a prerequisite for the program. Classical Studies 6: Introduction to Classical Archaeology Classical Studies 11: Special Topics in Greek and Roman History (when taught on a Greek topic) Classical Studies 12: Special Topics in Greek and Roman Archaeology (when taught on a Greek topic) Classical Studies 14: History of Archaic and Classical Greece Classical Studies 15: Alexander the Great and the Macedonian Kings Classical Studies 19: Theories and Methods in Ancient History (when taught on a Greek topic) Classical Studies 20: Greek Prehistoric Archaeology: The Emergence of Civilization in the Aegean Classical Studies 21: From Disaster to Triumph: Greek Archaeology from the Destruction of Mycenae to the Persian Wars Classical Studies 22: Greek Classical Archaeology: City-States and Pan-hellenic Sanctuaries Greek 11: Modern Greek 1 (or its equivalent) Under special circumstances and with the consent of the program director, certain courses taught in the Department of Art History may be used to fulfill one of the prerequisites. Tuition & Fees The fees charged by the College for a Dartmouth-sponsored off-campus term of study include regular tuition charges for a term at Dartmouth, as well as the specific costs established for each off-campus study locale. In many programs, the room and board costs tend to be higher than for a term in Hanover. You can view a budget sheet for this program by clicking here. The cost of transportation to and from the site is the responsibility of the student. Financial Aid In order that all qualified Dartmouth undergraduate students may have the opportunity to take part in off-campus programs, the College endeavors to adjust its normal financial aid awards for students already receiving aid. Tuition and expected family contribution for Dartmouth's off-campus programs are the same as for an on-campus term. Assistance is available to meet extra costs associated with off-campus programs, including airfare. Half of any extra cost is met with additional Dartmouth scholarship; loan assistance is offered for the other half. Loan assistance is also offered to replace the employment that would normally be included in an on-campus term. Although financial aid recipients are given aid to cover all of the required costs of the program, students are responsible for purchasing their own plane ticket and, on some programs, meals. Often this means that part of the expected family contribution is used towards these costs rather than for tuition.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Classics Curriculum Overview Course Offerings by Term Fall 2021 Winter 2022 Spring 2022 Summer 2022 Fall 2022 Winter 2023 Spring 2023 2023-24 Classical Studies Courses Entry points for Classical Studies Literature, Philosophy, Religion Ancient History Classical Archaeology Language Study -- Latin Latin Classes Placement in Latin Language Study -- Ancient Greek Courses in Ancient Greek Placement in Ancient Greek Majors and Minors Classical Studies track Ancient History track Classical Archaeology track Classical Languages and Literature track Culminating Experience Foreign Study NEW Classics FSP in Spring 2022 Greece Foreign Study Program Rome Foreign Study Program Projects & Awards Classics-Related Projects and Awards Student Research Archaeological Fieldwork Reid/Wiencke Funding for Research Senior Honors Projects Awards & Prizes Faculty Media Projects Annual Lecture Programs Faculty Books Inclusivity News & Events People Our graduates Graduating with a Classics Degree Alumni Support Tell Us Your Story Alumni Stories My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
