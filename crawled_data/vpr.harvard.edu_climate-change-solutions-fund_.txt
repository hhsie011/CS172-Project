Between 2014 and 2021 the Office of the Vice Provost for Research acted as steward of the fund, facilitating seven funding cycles and making a total of 59 awards to research teams across the University. Beginning with the 2021-2022 cycle, the OVPR is excited to work with the newly established Office of the Vice Provost for Climate and Sustainability, which will now lead the stewardship of this important and timely fund. The Harvard University Climate Change Solutions Fund supports research and policy initiatives intended to reduce the risks of climate change, hasten the transition from fossil fuel-based energy systems to those that rely on renewable energy sources, to develop methods for diminishing the impact of existing fossil fuel-based energy systems on the climate, to understand and prepare for the impacts of climate change, and to propel scientific, technological, legal, behavioral, policy and artistic innovations needed to accelerate progress toward cleaner energy, improved human health, and a greener world. Watch the video below to see several awardees discussing their work and the role of the Harvard research community in understanding, counteracting, and mitigating climate change.
