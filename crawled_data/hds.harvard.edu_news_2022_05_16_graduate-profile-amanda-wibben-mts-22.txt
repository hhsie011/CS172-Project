How I've Changed 2020 was the start of so much chaos in conjunction with immense self-reflection and discovery. During my time at HDS, I have learned more about myself, my identity, history, and aspirations than I could have ever imagined. Through engaging in coursework at several of Harvard’s schools along with HDS, I have unearthed my own ignorance and found inspiration in various disciplines and among diverse peers. Message of Thanks I owe the last two years to the love and support of my family, friends, peers, and mentors. To my parents, thank you for always encouraging me and believing in me when I struggled to believe in myself. My best friends and roommates have been the most amazing support system—I am beyond grateful to them for their constant willingness to take on new adventures with me and for making our tiny Boston apartment feel like the best place to call home. To my professors, thank you for being such an incredible source of inspiration and guidance, especially Professor Alicia Yamin, whose work and mentorship has truly changed my life. And finally, to my peers at HDS and at many of Harvard’s other schools, thank you for teaching me, challenging me, and walking with me through this incredible learning journey. Future Plans This fall I will be starting medical school at Georgetown University! I am unbelievably excited to begin my career in medicine and hope to apply my work at HDS by engaging in global health work and policy in medical school and beyond. I am confident that I will be a better physician, caretaker, and person because of my time at HDS.
