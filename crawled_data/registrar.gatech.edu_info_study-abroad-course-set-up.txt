It is important that you follow these instructions so that various departments on campus can distinguish them from regular on-campus courses, the students can register without restrictions, and the proper fees can be assessed and collected. Enter campus code "7" on SSASECT for all programs except GTL . Use campus code "X" for the RMZ - GTL Metz (UG Program) and campus code "3" for GT-Lorraine (Graduate Program). Also, please be sure to include (I) the appropriate code ("7", "X", or "3") on SSARRES in the Campus Restrictions block. Coding the course on SSASECT is an identifier, but the restriction code on SSARRES controls registration. Also on SSASECT, please put a "4" (summer terms) or "D" (fall and spring terms) for part of term, and an "E" for the session code. All study abroad sections use "R" as the section code. In an effort to distinguish the different programs, a three-character code should be entered on the Degree Program Attributes tab of the SSADETL form. The codes are listed below the example.
