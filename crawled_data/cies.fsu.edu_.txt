Kevin is a proud CIES alumnus who successfully navigated the academic pathway in the United States. After receiving his MBA, Kevin spent two years working for Capitol Preferred Insurance Company here in Tallahassee before returning home. He then began working for a small, but growing mining company supplier called International Equipment Suppliers. He loves working for this company, but as an entrepreneur, is looking to expand his business opportunities. Through the program he initiated called INTERNATIONAL STUDENT PATHWAYS (IS-PATHWAYS), he now wants to help others achieve their dreams and be just as successful in their quest for a degree from an American university.
