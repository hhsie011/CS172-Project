Prospective students: Log on to Transfer Equivalency Self-Services and find out how your credits will transfer to OSU degree plans. TRANSFER EQUIVALENCY SELF-SERVICE Current OSU students: If you are looking for a specific course from another institution that you want to transfer to your OSU degree, use the Transfer Guides, alongside your desired OSU degree sheet, to find course equivalents. Transfer Guides These are tools and guides to help you in the transfer process. The application of your transfer credit toward completion of a bachelor's degree will be determined by your academic college upon your enrollment. Our academic departments determine which credits will be used to meet degree requirements. Have questions about specific courses not found in these tools? Email transfercrediteval@okstate.edu. An admissions representative will review your course and get back to you as soon as possible. Please note: The Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education guides include lower division (1000 and 2000 level) courses earned at two-year institutions listed as "equal in content" to upper division (3000 and 4000 level) courses at OSU. These particular courses may fulfill the content requirement of the indicated equivalency. However, they will not transfer as upper-division hours and do not directly substitute for upper-division courses in an OSU degree plan. Related course waivers may be possible if approved by the OSU college offering the degree, provided the total number of waived credit hours does not exceed six. It may be necessary to take additional upper-division hours at OSU if such lower-division courses are taken at a two-year college.
