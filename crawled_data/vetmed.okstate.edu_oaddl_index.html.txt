Give COVID-19 and Pets According to the One Health Federal Interagency COVID-19 Coordination Group (OH-FICC), as of Aug. 11, 2020: There are currently 31 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in animals in the United States. Of these animals, some have shown signs of illness while others have not appeared sick. There is no evidence that animals, including pets, are playing a significant role in the spread of COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals, including pets, spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. If you are sick with COVID-19 (either suspected or confirmed by a test), you should restrict contact with your pets and other animals, just as you would with people. Talk to your veterinarian if your pet gets sick or if you have any concerns about your pet’s health For more information, read the complete OH-FICC report or visit the AVMA’s COVID-19 in Pet Animals webpage. If you need to test a pet for COVID-19, please follow the Oklahoma State Veterinarian’s Guidelines for testing companion animals for COVID-19.
