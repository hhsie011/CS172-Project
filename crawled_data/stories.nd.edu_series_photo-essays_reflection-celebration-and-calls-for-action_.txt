The University was treated to a few days of springlike weather, which enhanced the celebratory atmosphere around St. Patrick's Day and the NCAA basketball tournaments and served to remind the campus community that even the long Midwest winter will come to an end. Yet calls for reflection and action were ever-present. The University began the month by marking the beginning of the Lenten season, a time made more poignant as we stood in solidarity with the people of Ukraine. In addition, reminders of our mission to be a force for good in the world were delivered, especially in the areas of social and environmental justice.
