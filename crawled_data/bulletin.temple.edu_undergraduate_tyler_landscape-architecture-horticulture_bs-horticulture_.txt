Careers in the field of horticulture can be in the built landscape or in natural environments and encompasses a myriad of different occupational opportunities. The Temple horticulture curriculum includes both technical course work and hands-on learning experiences and is designed to educate students using a broad array of courses that encompasses the breadth of the discipline. In order to further broaden and deepen knowledge and understanding of the natural and cultural world, students also receive solid education in the liberal arts. Students learn the relationships between horticulture, technology, and natural ecological processes, and develop a responsible horticultural approach toward the environment. The department encourages students to consider ways to eliminate many outmoded, environmentally damaging practices. Graduates find exciting professional opportunities in landscape contracting, restoration, and management; wholesale or retail nurseries; urban forestry; floriculture; public horticulture; garden restoration; horticultural therapy; interior plantscaping, and many other career areas. Research, teaching and extension are also rewarding pathways within the horticulture profession. Courses for the Bachelor of Science in Horticulture are offered at the Ambler Campus with a portion of the coursework also available on Temple's Main and Center City campuses. The Horticulture Program has access to the Ambler Arboretum at Temple University and The Temple University Field Station at Ambler. Faculty and students use these resources in coursework and research. For more information see: https://ambler.temple.edu/arboretum and https://ambler.temple.edu/fieldstation. Sasha W.
