Columbia University in the City of New York: "A Doubled Magic" Academic Calendar for 2022-2023 Columbia University’s academic calendar for 2022-2023 has been adjusted as a result of the impact of the pandemic experienced globally in 2020. Below is the calendar for the year. Fall September 6 - December 23 Spring January 17 - May 12 Summer *Dates Forthcoming* Academic Calendar for 2021-2022 Columbia University’s academic calendar for 2021-2022 has been adjusted as a result of the impact of the pandemic experienced globally in 2020. Below is the calendar for the year. Fall September 8 - December 23 Spring January 18 - May 13 Summer *Dates Forthcoming* New Student Checklist Activate Your Computing Account (Columbia UNI) Learn how to activate your UNI. Once you have activated your UNI, check your University email account - stay up to date with deadlines and events by adding our calendar to your LionMail account. Clicking the (+) button on the bottom right will sync our Calendar with your LionMail! The UNI and the password gives you access to both your Columbia email and Student Services Online (SSOL). The SSOL account gives you access to online course registration, student billing, and much more. Please ensure that we have your updated contact information in SSOL at all times. Secure Your Student Visa (International Students) Complete Your Visa Application International students need to complete the necessary application for student visas. For more information, please refer to International Students and Scholars website. The International Students and Scholars Office (ISSO) website assists with online submission of your application for Certificate of Eligibility. A Certificate of Eligibility is a document issued by the ISSO for an admitted student that is evidence of your eligibility for a non-immigrant student status in the United States. New students who will study in F-1 Student status receive an I-20 form. International students must obtain an I-20 form before applying for an F-1 entry visa at a U.S. Consulate or a change of status if already in the U.S. In the case you are asked to submit additional information regarding your graduate program of study in your visa application process, please refer to the CU Engineering Bulletin and your specific Department's website. Visit the International Students and Scholars Office's website for details about eligibility, restrictions, and the online application. For questions related to the visa application process or the status of your I-20, please email ﻿﻿[email protected]﻿﻿. Watch Immigration Essentials Webinar Please view the following video and refer any questions related to this video to [email protected]. Information in this video will be shared in the ISSO presentations during Welcome Week. Complete Online Check-In Form All new international students must submit this online check-in form within 7 days of arrival in the U.S. The data you submit will be added to your record at the ISSO and used to update your SEVIS record from Initial to Active status. If you have a spouse and/or children who are here in F-2 status, you DO NOT have to submit a separate form for them. You must have your I-20 form, your passport, and your I-94 arrival record (printed from the Customs and Border Protection [CBP] I-94 website) available to submit this form. If you are a J-1 Student, report your arrival using the New Exchange Visitor SEVIS Registration Form. Complete Additional Registration Requirements All registered full-time international students are enrolled in the Gold Level of the Columbia Health Insurance Plan offered by the University by default. Two charges for the selected Insurance Plan and the Columbia Health fee will appear on your first student bill. More information is available on the Columbia Health Website. International students on F-1 or J-1 visas must maintain full-time registration (12 credits) per semester. Full time registration does not include American Language Program credits. International students may only take less than 12 credits in their last semester of study. Please review the guidelines from the International Students and Scholars Office on maintaining your status. English Language Proficiency Language proficiency is the responsibility of the student. Regardless of previous TOEFL/IELTS test scores, students should continue to work on maintaining adequate verbal and/or written abilities for successful integration within their classes and future professional endeavors. As a rule, ISSO will not permit students to drop courses or fall below full-time registration (12 credits per semester) due to language deficiencies. Several English improvement resources are available on and off campus. Please note that any credits earned for English improvement programs do not count towards engineering program requirements.

Admitted students who plan to enroll must submit official transcripts to Columbia Engineering. Certified and secure online official transcripts must be submitted directly to Columbia from your prior academic institution(s)’ Registrar Office to [email protected]; among these must be a transcript indicating conferral of a Bachelor’s degree. The policy for submitting official transcripts is as follows: 1) All students who have attended a college or university in the United States must submit electronic transcripts directly from their school to [email protected]. If a school does not offer electronic delivery, applicants must write to [email protected] to provide us with the link to their institution's webpage concerning transcript orders. Applicants may also be asked to provide additional documentation to confirm the school cannot send transcripts electronically. After verifying that your institution does not provide an electronic option, we will then authorize a hardcopy submission mailed directly to us by the Registrar of your university in a sealed envelope. 2) All students attending Chinese institutions will be required to contact CHESICC to arrange submission of a “Verification Report of China Higher Education Student's Academic Transcript” AND a “Verification Report of China Higher Education Qualification Certificate” (for those earning a degree in China) to Columbia at [email protected]. 3) All other students who have attended an international university must submit an electronic transcript if their school offers secure online delivery to [email protected]. If the school cannot send transcripts electronically via a secure, password-protected system, applicants must order a Course-by-Course Evaluation and International Credential Advantage Package to be sent electronically to [email protected] from World Education Services (WES). Can I drop off my transcripts to the Office of Graduate Student Affairs? No, transcripts may not be delivered in-person. Please review the instructions above for submitting official transcripts. What is a degree conferral date? The degree conferral date is the date of when your degree was granted. The degree conferral date must be clearly marked (ex: "June 20th , 2014" or "20, June 2014." "Completed Bachelors" or "Successfully passed final exams" ARE NOT considered a degree conferral. What if my transcripts do not have a degree conferral date? If your transcripts do not have a degree conferral date, you may submit a separate official degree statement or copy of your original diploma; either document must be validated and sealed in an envelope by an authorized person(s) at your institution (i.e. Deputy Registrar). How do I know if my transcripts have been received? Please log in to your Status Portal to confirm the status of your official transcript(s). Any missing official transcripts will be noted with a red X on the checklist. If every item on the checklist is complete, nothing further is needed. Please continue to monitor your Enrollment Checklist as needed. If you have questions about other checklist items, email us at: [email protected].
