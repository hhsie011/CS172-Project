A Journey Through an Urban World of Horses and the Origins of Mass Public Transit, 1859-1910. Join Dr. Chris Stacey for an exploration into horses! To understand life in Chicago in the late 19th and early 20th century you must imagine a city filled with horses. Horses were essential to the growth of Chicago and served as a primary means of commercial and public transportation. The emergence of public transit in Chicago began in 1856 with horse drawn streetcars. Three large transit corporations carved-out geographic monopolies on each side of the city for public transit, which originated to serve long-distance railroad passengers so they could easily cross-town to another terminal or travel to downtown hotels and retail businesses. https://chicago.alumni.columbia.edu/history_of_chicago_series_chicago_city_of_horses?utm_campaign=newsletter_sept_16_supp&utm_medium=email&utm_source=columbia48 Contact Information CAA Global and Diversity Engagement [email protected] Upcoming Events Columbia Alumni Center 622 West 113th Street, Mail Code 4525 · New York, NY 10025 Phone 212-851-7800 Contact Us [email protected] Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
