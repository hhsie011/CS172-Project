Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity — an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction — will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all. See Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan and Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports.” Department statements Black Lives Matter The department’s June 2020 Black Lives Matter statement in response to the killings of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and George Floyd.
