Through its long history of research, teaching, collaboration, innovation, and truth-seeking, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences is positioned to solve problems in ways others cannot. And although we face a new and unexpected future with urgent demands, the FAS has always seen challenges as opportunities. In the midst of profoundly changed circumstances, Harvard is adapting and readying itself to thrive. Your support allows the FAS to invest in talent, recruiting and retaining the brightest students and faculty; power innovations that address problems of public importance; and sustain a commitment to academic discovery in service of a more just world. There are many ways that you can support this community and their work to ensure Harvard continues to be a place of unbounded intellectual ambition: Make a gift to Harvard College or the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences to support research, financial aid, and the many other aspects of the Harvard experience that make the FAS a leader of innovation. Volunteer your time and get involved with the alumni community — online, on campus, or at local events. About What is FAS?
