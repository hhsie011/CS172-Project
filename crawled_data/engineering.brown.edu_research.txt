The program features an interdisciplinary approach in four complementary research areas: tissue engineering/regenerative medicine, neuroengineering/imaging, biomaterials/nanotechnology, and biomechanics. Chemical and Environmental Engineering Research The Chemical and Environmental Engineering program applies chemical and engineering principles to emerging technologies and investigates their impacts on human health and the environment. Specific research topics include groundwater remediation, biotechnologies, transport processes, nanoscience, carbon-based materials, environmental pollutants, and thermal and electrochemical energy conversion. Electrical and Computer Engineering Research Electrical and Computer Engineering Research focuses on solid state and quantum electronics, multimedia signal processing, medical imaging, computer vision, speech and image processing, computer architecture, integrated circuit design, communications theory, and wireless communications. Fluids and Thermal Sciences Research Research in the Fluids and Thermal Sciences group focuses on a broad range of disciplines and applications including fundamental fluid dynamics and heat transfer, micro- and nanoscale fluids, complex fluids, biotechnology, acoustics, thermodynamics and energy sciences. Materials Science Research Materials Science focuses on a fundamental understanding of the different types of materials and the interrelationship between processing, structure, and materials properties. Research areas include biomaterials, ceramics, metals, polymers, composites, electronic materials, energy materials, and thin films. Solid Mechanics Research The Mechanics of Solids group fosters a balanced program that integrates the perspectives of continuum mechanics, structure of matter, and materials science. Innovation Management and Design Engineering Research Research in technology innovation and entrepreneurship applies a social science lens to decision making relative to technology design, investment, deployment, and adoption.
