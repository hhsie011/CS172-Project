A reception, which includes an open bar with beer, wine, and soft drinks, begins at 2 p.m. and the show starts at 3 p.m. The performance that merges political satire with your favorite tunes, performed by the nation’s top political journalists, has been a Washington tradition since 1885! The Gridiron Club and Foundation skewers Presidents and congressional leaders, political candidates, and journalists at a white-tie dinner on Saturday night with satire and songs. The next day, the club puts on another performance – known as the Gridiron Sunday reprise—for friends, family, and select groups.
