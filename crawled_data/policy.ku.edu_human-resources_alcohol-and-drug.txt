Applies to: Employees and students. Campus: Edwards Lawrence Policy Statement: Prevention of Alcohol & Drug Use On campus and in the workplace and conditions of employment The University of Kansas prohibits the unlawful possession, use, manufacture, purchase, or distribution of alcohol or drugs, or any attempt thereof, by students or by employees on its property or as part of its activities. The University is committed to a program to prevent the illegal or irresponsible use of drugs and alcohol by students and employees. Any student or employee found to be using, possessing, manufacturing, or distributing controlled substances or alcohol, or whose behavior evidences being under the influence of alcohol or controlled substances, in violation of the law on University property or at University events shall be subject to disciplinary action in accordance with policies of the State of Kansas, the Board of Regents, and the University of Kansas. For employees, the University will take appropriate personnel action for such infractions, up to and including termination. See the Policy and Procedures on Substance Abuse. Students who violate this policy will be subject to sanctions which may include completion of an approved drug or alcohol rehabilitation program, disciplinary warning, probation, suspension and expulsion from the University. As a condition of employment, all employees of the University of Kansas shall abide by the terms of this policy statement and will notify the University of any criminal drug statute conviction for a violation occurring in the workplace no later than five days after such conviction. The University will, in turn, notify as appropriate, the applicable federal agency of the conviction within ten days of receipt of notification of conviction. The University will initiate personnel action, up to and including termination, within thirty days of receiving notice of such conviction. Employees may also be required to satisfactorily participate, at their own expense, a drug abuse assistance or rehabilitation program before being allowed to return to work. For purposes of this policy, "conviction" means a finding of guilt (including a plea of nolo contendere) or imposition of sentence, or both, by any judicial body charged with the responsibility to determine violations of the federal or state criminal drug statutes.
