Tchetgen Tchetgen, PhD (Keynote Speaker) Luddy Family President’s Distinguished Professor Professor of Statistics and Data Science The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania Abstract: In this talk, I discuss recent advances at the nexus of Causal Inference, Semiparametric Statistics and Machine Learning in the gilded age of modern data science, with emphasis given to sound and responsible decision-making in Public Health and Medicine. I argue with several recent developments, that important scientific progress can be made more likely by fruitful interaction between these three disciplines than without; however, such success will require constant vigilance to ensure that key foundational principles underpinning each discipline are preserved and respected. For illustration, I consider the potential utility and limitations of several recent advances that are emblematic of this (un)holy union, including Conformal predictive causal inference, Double-debiased machine learning, Credence and the so-called Deconfounder.
