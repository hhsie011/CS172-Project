The definition of the term "resident" may be different from the definitions developed by other agencies. For the purposes of tuition, the general definition of an Oklahoma resident is an independent person who has permanently resided in Oklahoma for 12 consecutive months, not primarily as a student at a post-secondary institution, and provides for their own financial support. Below is a list of resources to assist you in determining whether you will qualify for in-state status: Frequently Asked Questions about In-State vs. Out-of-State Status. OSRHE Policy on In-State/Out-of-State Status of Enrolled Students. Initial In-State/Out-of-State Classification. The Office of Undergraduate Admissions will notify you on your acceptance letter whether you have been classified as either "in-state for tuition purposes" or a "out-of-state for tuition purposes." Students classified as out-of-state for tuition purposes may petition for in-state status if the student believes they have been incorrectly classified as out-of-state. See information on the Petition for In-State Status below. The Graduate College will notify applicants via e-mail of their initial in-state/out-of-state classification when an application is submitted through the Graduate College online application. The classification is included in the acknowledgement e-mail sent shortly after submission of the application. If you believe the classification is incorrect, please contact the Graduate College as soon as possible so that they can review the pertinent information and, if appropriate, make the necessary change. Petition for In-State Status. Students wishing to be reclassified as in-state after their initial enrollment must complete a Petition for In-State Status form and return it with all supporting documentation to the Office of the Registrar before the beginning of the semester in question. While it is strongly recommended that all petition documentation be submitted before the beginning of the semester, final deadlines for receiving petition documentation for a semester in progress are as follows: Fall Semester - October 31 Spring Semester - March 31 Summer Semester - June 30 In-state reclassification (and associated in-state tuition) is not granted on a retroactive basis. If you are receiving scholarships, loans, grants or other financial aid, please seek advice from the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid on how a reclassification to in-state status may affect your scholarships or aid. The process of determining your status should take approximately two-three weeks. Petitions submitted without sufficient documentation will delay processing or result in denial. Once a decision is made, or if additional information is needed, you will be notified via your OSU e-mail address or the mailing address provided on your petition form. Should you have any questions or wish to check on the status of your request, please call the Office of the Registrar at 405-744-6876. OSU Policy on In-State/Out-of-State Status for Tuition Purpose. This document discloses OSU's policy and process for determining in-state/out-of-state (residency) status of applicants and students.
