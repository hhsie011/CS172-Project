Each year we host eight to ten events featuring internationally recognized speakers and culturally diverse educational programs. Many of the events are “one time only”, but the following are some of our recurring annual events. All events are free and open to the public. For dates and other details please visit the Office of International Affairs Events Calendar or contact ICC.reservations@ttu.edu for room rentals. Ambassador's Forum – The annual Ambassadors' Forum which began in 2016, is a collaboration of the American Academy of Diplomacy and the Texas Tech University's Office of International Affairs. It provides the opportunity for the greater Lubbock community to engage in dialogue with a group of distinguished, high-ranking former U.S. diplomats to explore more closely critical foreign policy areas and the role of diplomacy in international relations. This event generally occurs in March. Global Vision Awards –The Global Vision Awards is a recognition to Texas Tech faculty and staff who have undertaken extraordinary efforts to expand our global engagement and the university's global image. Established in 2003, the awards show appreciation for each winner's generosity and continued support of Texas Tech's work to become more globally connected. This event genially occurs in April. Culture Fest – Culture Fest is an outdoor cultural festival that celebrates the diverse cultural heritages of the international community at Texas Tech. Festival events include international music and dance, art projects, food, and family friendly cultural activities. This event generally occurs in October and held in conjunction with International Week. Candlelight/Weihnachtsfest – In early December, the Office of International Affairs hosts a celebration of German traditions in conjunction with the National Ranching Heritage Center's Candlelight at the Ranch. Guests can sample German food and children can participate in family-friendly activities.
