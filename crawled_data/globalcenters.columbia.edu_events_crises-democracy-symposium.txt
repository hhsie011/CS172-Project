The tempo and tone of news cycles, the perceived volatility of the rule of law, and the pervasiveness of legalized zones of lawlessness only increase our anxiety about the state of democracy across the world. While certainly not immune to such anxiety, scholars and artists operate in a distinct space (and at an alternative pace) from which to analyze and speculate about democracy, its crises and absences, and about the technologies, places, and means through which democracy has historically been negotiated. Drawing from alumni members of the Columbia Society of Fellows in the Humanities and in conversation with the Fellows of the Institute for Ideas and Imagination, this workshop explores the relationship between democracy and crisis as it is manifested in the humanities and the arts. Fellows from across fields, institutions, and cohorts are invited to present work on the ways in which ideals and practices of democracy have been debated in theory, probed historically, and produced and contested culturally. Is “crisis” endemic to democracy: a constitutive problem with the demos, with the enemies of democracy, or with the operations of democracy itself? How do the humanities and the arts render democracy and its crises visible? How do they reveal the contemporaneity of historical crises and the historicity of contemporary anxieties? Speakers include: Tina Campt, Elsa Dorlin, Ilana Feldman, Kellie Jones, Hagar Kotef, Whitney Laemmli, Reinhold Martin, Emeka Ogboh, Maria Gonzalez Pendas, Will Slauter, Josef Sorett, Mickalene, Thomas John Tresch, and Andrew Zimmerman. This event is co-sponsored by the Columbia Institute for Ideas and Imagination, Columbia University, Columbia Global Centers | Paris, and the Society of Fellows and Heyman Center for the Humanities at Columbia University.
