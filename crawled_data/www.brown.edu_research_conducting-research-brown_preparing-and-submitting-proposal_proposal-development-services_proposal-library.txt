Proposal Library The Office of Research Strategy and Development maintains a library of recent successful grant proposals written by Brown faculty. Redacted versions of these proposals are available, by request, only to members of the Brown community. If you are interested in receiving proposals that resulted in awards from any of the funding programs listed below, please write to Kate Duggan ([email protected]). For further insights, we also recommend that you speak to colleagues who have had past success with programs of interest. Sample proposals also are available on the NIH National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NEH, and other websites (e.g., Jabberwocky). Currently the library includes proposals to these funding programs. Please let us know if you would like to “donate” a proposal to the library and if you have suggestions for funding programs to add to the list below: AFOSR Young Investigator Research Program (YIP) ARPA-E Open DoD: Army Research Laboratory (ARL) DoD: Army Research Office (ARO) DoD: DARPA regular multiple DoD: DARPA Young Faculty Award DoD: Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI) DoD: Office of Naval Research (ONR) DOE: Basic Energy Science Program NIH: R01 NIH: R21 NSF: Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences (BCS) NSF: CAREER NSF: Cognitive Neuroscience NSF: Engineering Research Centers (ERC) NSF: Expeditions in Computing NSF: Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) NSF: National Robotics Initiative (NRI) NSF: Partnerships for Innovation: Building Innovation Capacity (PFI:BIC) NSF: Research Training Groups in the Mathematical Sciences (RTG) NSF: Scalable Nanomanufacturing (SNM) Conducting Research at Brown Finding Funding Research Strategy and Development (ORSD) Meet the ORSD Team Engaged Scholarship and Broader Impacts Resources Grantsmanship on the Go Writing a Management Plan Writing an Evaluation Plan Proposal Library Preparing and Submitting a Proposal Managing an Award Sponsored Projects (OSP) Research Compliance (IRB, IACUC, COI, Export Control, Research Data Management and Data Use Agreements) Brown Technology Innovations Research Administration Information Systems (RAIS) Research Management Support (RMS) Research Agreements and Contracting International Research & Activities Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) How Do I...? 2022 Research Achievement Award Winners About the Office Newsletter Forms and Policies Training and Outreach Graduate Student Resources Explore Brown University Search Brown Show/Hide Learn More About Brown Academics Admission Research Campus Life Find A to Z Index People Directory Information for Students Faculty Staff Families Alumni Friends & Neighbors Top Destinations Global Brown Watson Institute Graduate School Alpert Medical School School of Public Health School of Engineering Office of the Vice President for Research 350 Eddy Street | Brown University | Box 1937 | Providence, RI 02912 Vice President for Research 401-863-7408 [email protected] Research Strategy and Development 401-863-7999 [email protected] Brown Technology Innovations 401-863-7499 [email protected] Office of Sponsored Projects 401-863-2777 [email protected] Research Administration and Information Systems 401-863-2777 [email protected] Office of Research Integrity 401-863-3050 [email protected] @brownuresearch Giving to Brown Brown University Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA Phone: 401-863-1000 Maps & Directions / Contact Us / Accessibility © 2022 Brown University Connect: [email protected] Facebook Twitter YouTube Instagram iTunes U Google+ LinkedIn SnapChat
