Get Your Estimate What Does Harvard Cost? Harvard costs what your family can afford. We make sure of that. For families who earn between $75,000 and $150,000, the expected contribution is between zero and ten percent of your annual income. If your family's income is less than $75,000, you'll pay nothing.

All students receive the same aid regardless of nationality or citizenship. To learn more, check out our financial aid fact sheet or see the breakdown of the full cost of attendance.
