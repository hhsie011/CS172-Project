History internships are intended to provide students with a meaningful hands-on experience. History internships should: Give students the opportunity to see historians and history in action. Provide students with opportunities to apply analytical, interpretive, expressive, and creative skills developed in coursework to history-oriented projects. Augment students' historical knowledge and skills. Augment students' professional experience and skills. Fulfill individual learning objectives that will aid future study/work plans as outlined by individual students and their faculty advisors. Course Credit Students who undertake history-related internships are encouraged to enroll in the associated academic internship course through the department. HIST 4020 can be taken for up to 12 credits, but only 6 credits can apply to the history major. Internship students enroll in the course based on the hours they plan to work at the internship site. Each 50 hours of work = 1 credit hour. Most students take HIST 4020 for 3 credits and work 150 hours over the course of a semester. The internship course can be taken in any semester, including summer. Internship grades are given on a traditional scale of A-F. For more information, please see the internship contract: Internship Contract (pdf) Internship Scholarships In order to encourage students to take advantage of these outside experiences, the Department of History awards up to three $2000 scholarships per year to students who seek out and complete an approved internship experience. To receive the scholarship, students must procure a history-related internship and enroll in at least 3 credit hours of HIST 4020. Priority will be given to students with strong academic records who work in positions that promote their development as historians and prepare them for future careers and/or graduate study in history.
