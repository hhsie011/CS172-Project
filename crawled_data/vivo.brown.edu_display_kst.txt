Thomas is an Associate Professor of Health Services, Policy and Practice, and a Research Health Science Specialist at the Providence VA Medical Center's Center of Innovation for Long-term Services and Supports. She received her PhD in Aging Studies from the University of South Florida and completed an AHRQ-funded Postdoctoral Research Fellowship at the Brown University Center for Gerontology and Healthcare Research. Dr. Thomas' research focuses on identifying ways to improve the quality of life of older adults needing long-term services and supports (LTSS) through applied health services research. With funding from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the National Institute on Aging, and multiple foundations, she has led research projects and published more than 100 peer reviewed papers examining the organization and delivery of LTSS to meet older adults' medical and non-medical needs. Her research spans the LTSS continuum, ranging from in-home services to long-term care provided in institutional settings.

Full Text PubMed Research Research Overview I conduct applied health services research to inform policies and practices that secure better health and quality of life outcomes for individuals who are aging and disabled, particularly those who require long-term services and supports (LTSS). Broadly, my research focuses on the organization and delivery of LTSS, with an emphasis on measurement and quality. Funded by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the National Institute on Aging, and various foundations, I have led research projects related to the quality of long-term care and the role of home- and community-based services in preventing or postponing nursing home placement. I have over a decade of long-term care research experience and am an expert in using large administrative datasets (e.g., the nursing home Minimum Data Set, the home health Outcome and Assessment Information Set, Medicare claims, Medicaid Analytic eXtract) to ask and answer policy-relevant questions. Funded Research Ongoing Research Support National Institute on Aging: R61 AG070170-01 - Thomas (PI) 09/30/2020 – 08/31/22 Home-delivered meals for persons with dementia: Which model delays nursing home placement? The goal of this pilot study is to test and validate procedures to recruit participants with dementia and evaluate their outcomes in partnership with Meals on Wheels programs. As part of this pilot, we will test the processes for: 1) enrolling persons with dementia on Meals on Wheels programs’ waiting lists to receive one of two types of meals 2) recruiting a subsample of participants and caregivers to participate in telephone interviews 3) extracting and transferring program data to Brown University and 4) linking participant data with Medicare and nursing home assessment data to examine the time to nursing home placement among participants. National Institute on Aging: 1R21AG059120-01 - Thomas (PI) 09/01/2018-06/30/2022 Innovative Approaches to Examine Post-Acute Care Outcomes of Older Adults with Traumatic Brain Injury This grant merges multiple sources of data using probaliistc matching to examine functional and cognitive improvement during post-acute (PAC) rehabilitative care among older patients age 65+ years with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Working with an experienced interdisciplinary team with statistical and clinical expertise, this project has two specific aims: 1) To create a national longitudinal database that follows older patients with TBI across multiple healthcare settings and 2) To identify patient characteristics that predict community discharge and functional improvement during the PAC rehabilitative episode. National Institute on Aging: 1R01AG057746-01 - Thomas (PI) 01/15/2018-12/31/2021 Do State Regulations Affect the Outcomes of Assisted Living Residents with Dementia? This grant examines states’ assisted living (AL) policy environments, applies our novel methodology to identify AL residents, and together with Medicare claims will enable greater understanding of how AL residents’ outcomes are impacted by states’ regulatory decisions. We hypothesize that in order to survive, AL providers adhere to state licensing requirements and respond to changes in the regulatory environment which ultimately impact residents’ outcomes. Our specific aims are to 1) characterize how states regulate AL as it relates to the care of residents with ADRD; 2) test the effect of regulations likely to influence ADRD care in AL on providers’ response and outcomes of AL residents with ADRD over a 10-year period; and 3) compare outcomes between residents with ADRD who reside in AL communities licensed to provide specialized dementia care to residents in non-specialized AL communities. Veterans Health Administration Health Services Research and Development: CDA14-422 - Thomas (PI) 10/01/2016-09/30/2021 Evaluating Cash Benefits for Veterans’ Long-Term Care This is a VA HSR&D Career Development Award to focus on understanding the role of participant-directed (PD) cash benefit programs provided by VA to meet the growing need for LTSS. This research seeks to (1) use administrative data to determine which eligible Veterans being served by which Medical Centers enroll in VA’s PD cash benefit programs, (2) explore reasons for variation in enrollment PD programs across VAMCs with interviews of VAMC personnel (3) conduct interviews with Veterans to describe their experiences with the VA’s PD cash benefit programs and (4) establish the effectiveness of the VA’s PD cash benefit programs in controlling healthcare costs by using sophisticated methodologies to compare Veterans’ healthcare utilization to that of Veterans receiving traditional LTSS.
