However, the Cornell University Police Department (CUPD) will assist both the respondent and the complainant (or any member of the Cornell community impacted by an Order of Protection), by helping the parties understand the availability of an order, the potential content and parameters of an order, and the consequences for violating an order. The CUPD will also assist a protected party in effecting arrest of an individual violating an Order of Protection, if doing so is within the jurisdiction of CUPD. For more information about a New York State court ordered Order of Protection please see the Order of Protection information provided by the New York State Unified Court System.
