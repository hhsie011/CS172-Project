Application requirements vary according to the degree program, college or school; whether you plan to take courses as a matriculated or non-matriculated student; or if you are an international applicant. Use the guidelines provided to help ensure you have all of the information you need to begin the application process. Important Note: The Graduate School at Temple University is an administrative office only. For information about a specific degree program or to inquire further about a program, visit the Graduate Bulletin. What is your graduate path? I want to enroll in a graduate degree program. Matriculated students are those who apply to a program, are admitted, take courses and work to earn a degree. If you plan to pursue a degree at Temple and are ready to start the application process, follow these steps. You can also learn more about your anticipated field of study or attend a graduate recruiting event near you. I only want to take some graduate courses. Non-matriculated students are those who take courses, but who are not officially working toward a degree. Non-matriculated graduate students may take up to nine graduate credits. At that point, the student must decide whether to continue to take courses as a non-matriculated student if working toward a certificate program, or officially apply to a degree program. Any credits in excess of nine not taken as part of a certificate program may not be applied to a degree program later. Non-matriculated students who intend to apply to a degree program should ensure that the program in which they are interested accepts credits earned as a non-matriculated student. Students are strongly encouraged to seek academic advising from the graduate faculty or professional advisors within the program. To take coursework in a specific discipline, non-matriculated students must contact that department for an initial credential review and to be registered for classes of interest. Non-matriculated students who plan to take courses in multiple departments should contact the Main Campus Office of Continuing Studies, which provides advising services and registration assistance to non-matriculated students.
