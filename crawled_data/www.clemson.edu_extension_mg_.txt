To help you decide if you should become a South Carolina Master Gardener, ask yourself these questions: Do I want to learn more about growing plants and solving plant problems? Am I eager to participate in an intense training program? Do I look forward to sharing my knowledge with others? Can I commit the time needed to attend the training and serve as a volunteer? If you answered yes to these questions, the South Carolina Master Gardener program may be for you! Use this link to find your local Master Gardener Coordinator. Please note the South Carolina Master Gardener Program is not a professional certification and should not be used to promote or endorse commercial products and/or services.
