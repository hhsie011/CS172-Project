Further restrictions may be imposed at any time if public health conditions require them. Proof of vaccination does not override Yale's Travel Policy, and note that it is the responsibility of the traveler to investigate and keep updated on country-specific requirements and/or restrictions that may hinder or make impossible travel to that location regardless of Yale's Travel Policy. Yale has provided Travel Guidelines for all faculty, staff, and students. Continuously updated COVID-19 information also can be found on Yale's COVID-19 website.
