Dartmouth College is committed to establishing and maintaining a safe learning, living, and working environment where healthy, respectful, and consensual conduct represents the campus cultural norm. Prohibited Conduct- such as sexual and gender-based harassment, sexual assault, dating or domestic violence, and stalking- undermines the character and mission of Dartmouth and will not be tolerated. On March 8, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order on "Guaranteeing an Educational Environment Free from Discrimination on the Basis of Sex, Including Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity." The Order requires the Department of Education "to review and reconsider all existing regulations and guidance, and issue new guidance as needed to carry out this policy and Title IX's commitment." Dartmouth College is looking forward to receiving additional information and guidance from the Department of Education in the coming months.
