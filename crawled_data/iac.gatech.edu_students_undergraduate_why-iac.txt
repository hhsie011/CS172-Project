Visit the College Frequently Asked Questions Undergraduate FAQ: Academics How does Ivan Allen College differ from liberal arts programs elsewhere? The liberal arts program at Georgia Tech's Ivan Allen College includes the basic strengths of any good liberal arts program, but it offers the Bachelor of Science, not the Bachelor of Arts. The distinction is significant because Ivan Allen students study topics relating to not only humanities and social sciences, but also science, technology, and computing, and the corresponding impact on society, culture, and public issues. Ivan Allen College is in many ways a small liberal arts college located in the midst of a major technological university, so students aquire both the technical expertise characteristic of the institution's graduates on top of the education found in a "traditional" liberal arts education. This has proven to give our students an advantage in many job markets and in graduate school programs. How does the liberal arts program "fit in" with the rest of Georgia Tech? An understanding of science, technology, and computing is essential to a well-rounded education in the 21st century, and either through coursework or by working in the context of Georgia Tech, Ivan Allen students acquire a strong background in many of the "other" areas at Georgia Tech, giving them a distinct advantage in their careers. All Georgia Tech students will graduate with the same core equivalencies. Additionally, Ivan Allen College professors frequently collaborate with science and engineering faculty in research, bringing their cross-discinplinary expertise into their courses.

The Admissions Office makes no distinction between Ivan Allen College and other Georgia Tech colleges in the admissions process What are the math requirements for liberal arts majors at Georgia Tech? Analytical abilities are a fundamental strength of all Georgia Tech students. To help them develop those skills, Tech students are required to take differential calculus, integral calculus, and linear algebra. However, most liberal arts students have an alternative math option more closely aligned with their majors. With the help of their advisors, Ivan Allen students select one of these sequences. About half of the college's undergraduates take each path. Undergraduate FAQ: Beyond the Classroom What major should I choose if I am going to be a pre-law or pre-med student?

What type of jobs and careers do liberal arts graduates at Georgia Tech go on to have? Our graduates are prepared for a wide range of jobs and careers. Unlike engineering and hard sciences where their studies will directly translate into a career field, liberal arts graduates have a more diverse set of options they may pursue. Our students work with private companies, government agencies, and in the not-for-profit sector in fields such as economic development, multimedia design, marketing, policy analysis, public relations, education, consulting, human resources, and financial advising. Often, the internships, research, and international studies that students participate in lead to an inspiration as to what a graduate wants to do for a career. What types of research opportunities are there for liberal arts majors? Ivan Allen College holds a unique advantage over other liberal arts programs due to our location at a tier one research institution. And because of the very favorable student-to-faculty ratio 5:1, liberal arts students at Tech have many chances to get to know their professors well (and vice versa). This generates many opportunities to hear about potential research projects or suggest a research project to an interested professor. Your advisor will periodically send you opportunities for research throughout your time at GA Tech. For financial assistance, many students apply for Georgia Tech's President's Undergraduate Research Awards program, working one-on-one with a professor, usually on a research project largely determined by the students' interests. Additionally, undergraduate students often can choose between receiving academic credit or a stipend for their research activities. Where do Ivan Allen College students intern?

Many liberal arts students regularly intern with local, state, national, and international governments and organizations such as the City of Atlanta, the Georgia Governor's office, US State Department, CIA, United Nations, and US Supreme Court. Others have interned with companies such as Yahoo, CNN, Coca-Cola, Home Depot, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, BMW, and Bank of America.
