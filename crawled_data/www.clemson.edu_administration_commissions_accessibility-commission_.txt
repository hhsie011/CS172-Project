Inclusion and Equity Clemson University Commissions Current: Accessibility Commission Clemson University Accessibility Commission The Accessibility Commission is a group of representatives including faculty, staff, graduate and undergraduate students from different areas across campus. Each member has a passion for making sure that students, employees, and visitors with a diverse range of abilities have the tools needed and an environment to be successful. Meetings with the combined group occur four times a year with the majority of the work being completed by subcommittees who work in specialized areas. Our Purpose The purpose of the Commission is to advise and make recommendations to the University’s Council for Diversity and Inclusion regarding all areas impacting accessibility in a manner consistent with the University’s principles of community and its commitment to equivalent opportunity and access. More specifically, the objectives of the Commission are to: Create a welcoming environment that enables individuals with disabilities to be included and represented in matters pertaining to their specific needs across campus. The Commission, in carrying out its charge, shall not serve as a grievance board or as an advocacy group for any individual. Promote accessibility, equivalent opportunity, and quality of life for individuals with disabilities at the University while strengthening our community through diversity. Identify, evaluate, analyze, and address barriers from physical, technological, and program aspects, as well as other issues, to promote access, advancement, and opportunities for individuals with disabilities. Conduct and analyze information and make recommendations regarding the policies, procedures, and practices that affect individuals with disabilities, with the goal of improving access, creating opportunities, and enhancing inclusion. Partner with the Division of Inclusion and Equity to promote accountability for implementation and execution of the University’s and the Commission’s strategic diversity plans. Collaborate with other entities, including community partners and student groups, to support the vision of the Commission and the University. Clemson University Accessibility Portal Accessibility Commission Blog Members and Meetings The membership of the Commission is comprised of faculty, staff, undergraduate students, and graduate students. The Commission meets four times each year as a combined group. Much of what the Commission achieves is due to the efforts of its smaller, more specialized subcommittees. Each subcommittee meets at various times throughout the year and reports on their efforts during the larger Commission meetings. Subcommittees Accessibility Awareness and Implementation Advancement of accessibility as a part of diversity and inclusion through training, workshops, and programs, including Universal Design for Learning and other approaches to teaching and learning. Digital Accessibility Advocating, raising awareness, and providing assistance for accessible Information and communication technology. Transportation Services and Campus Accessibility Removal of physical barriers to programs and services.

Testimonials from Employees “ “I was having some trouble figuring out how to take care of a few items on some web pages, the Accessibility Commission was there with keen eyes to help me dissect my pages to come up with a solution to make the pages compliant, along with revealing some simple things I had missed. Having such an experienced group working together to help the university stay in compliance is rare, but downright awesome!” CU Web Developer “ “I am grateful to have access to the Office of Access and Equity on a regular basis as a full-time faculty member at Clemson University. With the support of providing auxiliary services/aids, I am able to enjoy all the goods and services that Clemson has to offer. I feel the office has allowed me to feel equal and be "all in" with Clemson family. I am able to utilize services within and outside of my classroom such as sign language interpreters and closed captioning. My favorite feature of this office is to provide me with closed captioning services of Clemson sporting events, and I feel included to say GO TIGERS.” CU Lecturer Clemson University Facebook Instagram Twitter Linkedin Youtube Tiktok Policy/Terms of Use Web Accessibility Ethics/Safety Hotline Privacy Policy Copyright © 2022 Clemson University • Clemson, South Carolina 29634 Clemson University Facebook Instagram Twitter Linkedin Youtube Tiktok Resources A-Z Index Campus Map CU Safety Directory Webcams Apply to Clemson
