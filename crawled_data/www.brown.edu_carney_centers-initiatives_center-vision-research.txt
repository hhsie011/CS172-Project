The Center for Vision Research was formed in 2007 to capitalize on Brown University's rich history and strength in vision research, which dates back to the 19th century. The mission of the Center for Vision Research is to provide training in vision research, promote and facilitate research and unify vision research at Brown, by bringing together investigators from different departments. Faculty members affiliated with the center come from various Brown departments, including Philosophy, Visual Arts, Ophthalmology, Neuroscience and Cognitive, Linguistic, and Psychological Sciences. Vision research at Brown spans all five Carney Institute research themes. The Center for Vision Research hosts colloquia of interest to the broad membership and the wider community in order to foster interactions and discussions that will lead to new research initiatives. The center fosters and facilitates vision research through awards for the support of postdoctoral fellows and small pilot research grants with a focus on innovation and collaboration.
