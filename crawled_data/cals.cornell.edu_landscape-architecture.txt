Agriculture Animals Applied Economics Biology Climate Change Communication Environment Food Global Development Health + Nutrition Plants Department of Landscape Architecture Our mission is to deploy the agency of design to address the critical issues confronting the world’s landscapes through innovative teaching, research by design and creative practice. We view every landscape as an opportunity to create a more healthy, beautiful, socially just, well-crafted and ecologically responsive world. C. Timothy Baird, Department Chair Landscape Architecture at Cornell University Landscape architecture is one of the most exciting fields of study for those interested in addressing issues of critical importance to the future of our planet and its inhabitants. Through development of projects ranging from intimate gardens to parks, towns, cities and broader regions, landscape architects are poised to intervene at a wide range of scales, in myriad contexts and for multiple constituencies. As one of the oldest and most renowned landscape architecture departments in the United States, we are committed to preparing our students to become designers, researchers and future leaders who will direct teams of experts as they address issues of infrastructure, water management, sea-level rise, flooding, cultural heritage and environmental justice. About the department Since its establishment in 1904, the department has achieved national recognition for its progressive teaching pedagogies and forward-looking approach to the field of landscape architecture.
