December 3, 2019 3:00 PM - 5:00 PM Columbia Global Centers | Mumbai, 12-13, Maker Chambers VI, First floor, Jamnalal Bajaj Road, Nariman Point, Mumbai 400 021 Air pollution, from the burning of dirty fuels such as dung biomass and other forms of low efficiency fuels, has been linked to a large amount of deaths, morbidity and mortality, specifically among younger populations. The resulting biomass smoke has been shown to be a significant risk factor for COPD, emphysema, and acute lower respiratory infections, among other pulmonary disorders. Furthermore, the burning of dung biomass fuels contributes to the overall level of pollution in cities that are already burdened by high levels of air pollution. This conference aims to bring together a diverse group of scientists and public policy leaders that are at the forefront of research/policy for reducing the use of dirty burning fuels, including Dr. Jeanine D’Armiento, Professor of Medicine in Anesthesiology and Director of the Center for Molecular Pulmonary Disease in Anesthesiology and Physiology and Cellular Biophysics at Columbia University’s Medical Center. Through two days of lectures and roundtable discussions, the conference hopes to encourage future collaborations between scientists and public health officials interested in tackling the issues of air pollution, biomass burning, and health. This conference is by invitation only.
