Churches across the nation and our world are in the midst of crisis responses, caring for those within their walls and outside of their walls. You, alongside many others in your churches and communities, are making critical decisions every few hours as this situation continues to evolve and adapting everything you do on a weekly basis to reach your congregations. For that, we want to say thank you: for your efforts, for your hard work, for your adaptability, and for your care to others. As we continue to go day by day, know that the C3I team is praying for you. We are in prayer for your churches. We are praying for wisdom and discernment in decision-making. We are praying over easy accessibility and deeply personal connection through the means of technology and phone calls. We are in prayer for those who are extremely vulnerable, physically, emotionally, financially, and socially, in your churches during this situation. We are in prayer for you, both personally and professionally, as you navigate unchartered waters and as you find ways to spiritually encourage and care for your congregations and communities. While we move forward together into the uncertainty and unknowns, may we cling tightly to the One who is our refuge, our strength, and our ever-present help in trouble (Psalm 46:1). May we love, encourage, and lead one another well in patience and compassion.
