How will the global transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy impact the power sector’s generation of electricity? How will the transition from the internal combustion engine to electric vehicles affect the transportation sector? And, most importantly, will these two business transitions be large enough or rapid enough to change the trajectory of emissions to avoid the most dramatic impacts of climate change? This conference—a joint effort by the Tamer Center for Social Enterprise and the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory—brings together climate scientists and business leaders to understand how new advances in climate science can inform investments in specific sectors of the global economy. The forum explores topics that address the value and opportunity of using a science-based approach to inform and guide business and investment decisions.
