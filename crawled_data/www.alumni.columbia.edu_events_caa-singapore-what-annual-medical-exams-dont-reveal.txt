We’re living in a health paradox; despite access to the so-called “best” healthcare, chronic diseases have increasingly become pervasive killers; how can you best avoid becoming a victim? Complying with the motto "Prevention is the Best Cure", the Annual Medical Exam is a golden opportunity for early detection and intervention, yet few of us dare challenge or question the efficacy of the decades-old diagnostic tests on the typical menu. Find out which additional tests you should request to better mitigate and understand the risks of chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases.
