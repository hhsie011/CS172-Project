You can help answer this question by taking part in our study! You will either eat breakfast or skip breakfast for 6 months. If you are in one of the breakfast groups, you will be provided with free delicious breakfast meals every day. At the beginning, middle, and end of the study, we will measure things like body composition, glycemic control, energy expenditure, sleep patterns, & appetite. You will be paid for completing all procedures. You may qualify if you are between the ages of 13-21 years and frequently skip breakfast.
