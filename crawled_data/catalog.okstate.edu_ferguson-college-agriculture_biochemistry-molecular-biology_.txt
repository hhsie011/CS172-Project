Sciences, MS Comparative Biomedical Sciences, PhD Veterinary Medicine, DVM Home/ Ferguson College of Agriculture/ Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Overview Courses Undergraduate Programs Graduate Programs Minors Faculty Biochemistry, the central scientific discipline linking the chemical, physical and biological sciences, exerts a profound influence on the progress of medicine and agriculture. By applying concepts and methods of chemistry and physics to the fundamental problems of biology, biochemists have made great progress in their effort to understand the chemistry of living organisms. Major discoveries concerning the biochemistry of genetic material provide the tools of molecular biology that are essential to contemporary life sciences research. Biochemists and molecular biologists are concerned with living things and thus, must be fluent in the concepts of biological sciences. Since a biochemist's tools include many techniques derived from the physical sciences, he or she must receive sound education in mathematics, physics and chemistry. Our academic programs are designed to integrate these disciplines, preparing students for a wide range of professional careers. Challenging positions for well-trained biochemists and molecular biologists are available in colleges and universities, state and federal laboratories, research institutes, medical centers and in an increasing number of industrial organizations, particularly the pharmaceutical and food industries. Biochemists are involved with research on the chemistry of processes occurring in plants, animals and various microorganisms, and with the discovery and development of antibiotics, vitamins, hormones, enzymes, insecticides and molecular genetics techniques. The Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology administers two BS degree options in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology through the College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources. In 2016, the two BS degree options administered through the College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources became accredited by the American Society of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. This provides students taking these degree options an opportunity to take the American Society of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology certification exam. An honors program is also available in undergraduate degree plans. Also available is a 4+1 Year Masters by Coursework program. The undergraduate curriculum provides a broad background in chemistry and the biological sciences and permits flexibility to meet particular interests of the student. Courses in biochemistry are based on general, organic and analytical chemistry. The undergraduate curriculum also provides students with sufficient background in the basic sciences of mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology needed for graduate study in most disciplines of contemporary science of agriculture or medicine and other allied health subjects, and is excellent for pre-professional students. The Department’s research activities provide opportunities for part-time employment of undergraduate majors to improve their professional competence. Minor in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology This minor is designed to give students a firm background in the fundamentals of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and to develop critical thinking skills for the interpretation of new findings in these disciplines. Students will gain primary knowledge in modern biochemistry through two lecture courses (BIOC 3713 Biochemistry I and BIOC 3813 Biochemistry II). Hands-on training with experimental tools of these disciplines will be emphasized during the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology laboratory course (BIOC 3723 Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Laboratory). The knowledge gained by this minor gives a science educator, a laboratory technician, an industrial employee or a life sciences researcher the ability to apply these disciplines.

Research advisors are selected at the end of the student’s first semester. A non-thesis Master of Science degree is also available. It does not require a research thesis, but requires a report and extensive technical training in the laboratory. The non-thesis MS plan requires thirty (30) credit hours of coursework and two (2) hours of research. The non-thesis MS is not recommended for students wishing to pursue a PhD. The Doctor of Philosophy Degree. The PhD program course requirements are determined with the assistance and approval of the student’s advisory committee and are based on whether a BS or MS has previously been earned: a minimum total of (60) graduate credits are required if a student enters the PhD program having earned an MS in a related discipline; a minimum total of ninety (90) graduate credits are required if a student enters the PhD program having earned not higher than a BS in a related discipline. A formal “Plan of Study” with a minimum of 30 credit hours of graduate coursework, a minimum of 15 credit hours of research, and a minimum total of 60 credit hours, or 90 credit hours must be approved by the student’s advisory committee and submitted to the OSU Graduate College before completing 17 credit hours, or 28 credit hours of graduate study. The student’s advisory committee is selected at the end of the student’s second semester. All graduate students must maintain a B-average in their graduate coursework. A grade of C in a single graduate course can place the student on academic probation. The Department offers research experience in a variety of areas. Formal PhD program graduate coursework includes all of the courses listed for the MS degree, at least four of the advanced graduate courses in biochemistry (6000-level) including BIOC 6740 Physical Biochemistry, and additional courses and lab experience appropriate to the student’s interests. Each student will take a series of preliminary examinations in January of his or her third semester. Each student also presents and defends their research thesis proposal sometime in their 4th-5th semester, and at the end of their program presents their research and defends their dissertation in a final oral examination. The doctoral dissertation must contain a substantial original contribution to the discipline of biochemistry and molecular biology. Bioinformatics Graduate Certificate Program The Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology also offers the Bioinformatics Graduate Certificate Program—a multi-disciplinary program that involves faculty in Departments across the University. This Program’s mission is to train post-baccalaureate students in the techniques required to generate, analyze and interpret complex biologically-derived data sets. The Graduate Certificate in Bioinformatics requires completion of 16 credit hours of coursework eligible for graduate credit. A minimum of 12 credit hours must be at the 5000-level or above. Required courses include 9 credit hours from the core areas of life sciences, statistics and computer sciences. Additional information on this Certificate Program is available online: http://www.bioinformatics.okstate.edu/. Review Process for Admission The Department’s Graduate Studies Committee reviews all eligible applications for the graduate program in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. To be eligible for committee review, each applicant must submit an application for admission to the Graduate College, along with transcripts of all academic records, GRE scores and TOEFL scores if their undergraduate education was in a language other than English. Applicants must submit to the Department three reference letters, a current resume and a statement of purpose. Biochemistry (BIOC), Minor John E.
