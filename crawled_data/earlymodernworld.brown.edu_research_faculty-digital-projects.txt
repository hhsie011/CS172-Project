The Theater That Was Rome Researcher: Evelyn Lincoln This digital humanities research site explores the networks of producers (printers, publishers, patrons, artists, and authors) of early modern books printed in, or about, Rome. The site also hosts documents on the material culture of early modern Roman print shops, including the papers of Francesca Consagra relating to her research on the de Rossi family printing and publishing dynasty.
