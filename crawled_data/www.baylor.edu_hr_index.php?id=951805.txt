A RICH CHRISTIAN HERITAGE Baylor University was chartered in 1845 by the Republic of Texas through the efforts of Baptist pioneers, whose vision was to establish a university that would not only meet the current needs for education, but "would be fully susceptible of enlargement and development to meet the needs of all the ages to come." A rich Christian heritage also inspires the Baylor family to reach out beyond Central Texas. For example, the Baylor School of Social Work co-sponsors the Texas Hunger Initiative, a cooperative effort to alleviate hunger across the state. OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE Baylor faculty and staff have many opportunities to make a difference in the lives of students. In many cases, a Baylor professor or staff member is able to help a student make important decisions about his or her future career and life goals, in conversations that grow out of relationships formed from the students' earliest days on campus. During the first six weeks of classes each fall, volunteer faculty and staff serve as instructors for University 1000, an innovative program that seeks to assist new students with adjusting to college life and laying the foundation for success at Baylor. University 1000 instructors meet each week with a small group of students and lead them through exercises designed to help them meet their goals. Throughout the year, faculty and staff also serve as trusted advisors and sponsors to 260 Baylor student clubs and organizations. AN INVESTMENT IN EMPLOYEE SUCCESS Baylor University is committed to the success of its employees by providing opportunities for enhancing personal and professional growth. Baylor encourages its employees to pursue lifelong learning opportunities by offering free tuition to employees desiring to earn baccalaureate or master's degrees from Baylor. Employees are also encouraged to learn through job-related training programs and participation in professional organizations. HR Learning & Leadership endeavors to build upon the strengths of managers and employees in order to develop a culture of excellence. It fosters an environment of continuous learning, professional growth, and organizational effectiveness through learning and development opportunities and solutions at individual, team and organizational levels. Baylor rewards excellence in its employees through public recognition programs on campus. Each academic year, Baylor honors outstanding faculty and staff through public ceremonies and monetary awards. ACTIVE CAMPUS COMMUNITY As a member of Baylor's campus community of faculty, staff and students, you will have frequent opportunities to get involved with others who share your interests. Each semester, Baylor employees have the opportunity to attend numerous cultural events on campus, as well as NCAA Division I sporting events in 19 varsity sports through Big 12 Conference competition. Baylor sponsors many events throughout the year that bring together faculty, staff and students, including Bearathon, a challenging half-marathon race held each spring to raise money for student scholarships, All University Sing, a 58-year-old tradition that allows students to showcase their performance skills, and Homecoming, a weeklong celebration in the fall that features special events and one of the nation's largest Homecoming parades through downtown Waco and the Baylor campus. Each year, Baylor students, faculty and staff volunteer more than 150,000 hours of local community service. In addition, they join together each fall to help new Baylor students move into university residence halls. And Baylor faculty and staff serve as sponsors and advisors for many of the 260 student clubs and organizations on campus. PRIDE IN WHERE YOU WORK Over the years, Baylor has been ranked favorably as one of the best places to work in surveys by publications including The Chronicle of Higher Education and Computerworld. Baylor employees also show their pride in the university by supporting Baylor athletic contests and by wearing the green and gold to work on Spirit Fridays. OUTSTANDING BENEFITS Referring to Baylor faculty and staff as important members of "the Baylor family" is more than just convenient phrasing. It is an accurate characterization of the way Baylor values and invests in each of its employees during and after their service to the university. Baylor is committed to providing its employees with competitive salaries and benefits. But the advantages of working at Baylor involve more than what is reflected on a paycheck. Faculty and staff enjoy a wealth of additional benefits, including: *Free or reduced price admission to Big 12 Conference athletic events on campus; *Free admission to cultural activities on campus including concerts, recitals, lectures, symposia and art gallery exhibits, and reduced prices for admission to Baylor Theatre performances and annual membership in Baylor's Mayborn Natural Science and Cultural History Museum Complex; *Free use by Baylor employee families of campus sports and recreation facilities including the Baylor Marina and McLane Student Life Center, which includes a 10,000-square-foot fitness center, indoor running track, basketball and racquetball courts and a leisure pool; *Access to cultural and recreational opportunities in Waco, including Cameron Park and the Cameron Park Zoo, Lake Waco, the Texas Ranger Museum and the Texas Sports Hall of Fame. STABILITY For 166 years, Baylor University has remained firm in its mission to educate men and women for worldwide leadership and service by integrating academic excellence and Christian commitment within a caring community. Since Baylor's founding in 1845, the university has survived through the Civil War, the Great Depression and other challenging periods of history, and has maintained its academic excellence and Christian identity through a major relocation and steady growth over the years.
