Lindley Lectures Search Search form Search Welcome to the KU Department of Philosophy Through the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, we offer undergraduate programs leading to either the B.A. or B.G.S. degree. At the graduate level, we have both an M.A. and Ph.D. program, with the possibility of full funding for each. Our faculty has a wide range of interests, offering courses on a number of philosophical topics. Why Study Philosophy? In philosophy we ask big, important questions. While asking such questions is easy, answering them is difficult. Because these questions are often abstract and vague, it is necessary to use precise reasoning and analysis to clarify what exactly it is we are asking. Only then can we attempt to develop answers. For example: What is the morally right thing to do? What is the nature of the mind? When can we know something, rather than merely believing it? Do the sciences exhaust what can be known about the natural world? What is justice? What assumptions do we make when we try to answer questions like these? Plus many, many others... In studying philosophy, you will learn what others have thought about life's big questions. You will also learn to challenge those views, and to develop your own thoughts in a precise, logical manner. Philosophy will help you develop critical thinking skills, enabling you to analyze the underlying logic and assumptions in arguments about a variety of topics. This is a skill that generalizes to virtually every area of life. Read more about the surprising benefits of studying philosophy here: Why Study Philosophy?
