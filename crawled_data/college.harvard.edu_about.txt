About Harvard College From library and museum collections to arts, athletics, and service, Harvard’s campus resources are unparalleled. Teaching and research are integral to Harvard College—students learn from faculty of the highest caliber, conduct their own investigations, and contribute to research in labs and libraries At the heart of Harvard College are the Houses, where students live and learn alongside their peers, faculty members, and graduate students.

Frequently Asked Questions What is a "liberal arts & sciences" education? Commitment to liberal arts & sciences is at the core of Harvard College’s mission: before students can help change the world, they need to understand it. The liberal arts & sciences offer a broad intellectual foundation for the tools to think critically, reason analytically and write clearly. These proficiencies will prepare students to navigate the world’s most complex issues, and address future innovations with unforeseen challenges. Shaped by ideas encountered and created, these new modes of thinking will prepare students for leading meaningful lives, with conscientious global citizenship, to enhance the greater good. Harvard offers General Education courses that show the liberal arts and sciences in action. They pose enduring questions, they frame urgent problems, and they help students see that no one discipline can answer those questions or grapple with those problems on its own. Students are challenged to ask difficult questions, explore unfamiliar concepts, and indulge in their passion for inquiry and discovery across disciplines.
