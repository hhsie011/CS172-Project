PreviousNext Our Graduates Are Our Mission Our mission as a department is defined by the College’s dedication to offering undergraduates a broad liberal arts education. We know that only a small fraction of our majors will eventually become professional historians. Consequently, we recognize that the major part of our mission is to provide a large and diverse student body with a general understanding of the historical foundations and cultural dimensions of the world they live in—an understanding that we are happy to see often grows into a life-long passion for history. But perhaps the most important consequence of studying history is to inculcate and develop basic critical, analytical and communication skills that have a broad application beyond the academy. These include the ability to analyze arguments on the basis of evidence, to understand and evaluate the nature of that evidence, and to communicate arguments cogently, effectively—and even elegantly—through speech and writing. History Majors' Career Data 1972-2001 majors pie chart.jpg In keeping with their liberal arts orientation, Dartmouth's History majors pursue a broad range of careers upon graduation. The figure above summarizes the careers of 2,282 History alumni graduating in the classes of 1972-2001. The date range for this sample was selected assuming that most careers have been defined by the tenth year following graduation and that some alumni are thinking of retirement after the thirtieth. The number of majors going on to graduate school in History is small—in this thirty-year sample, fewer than 4 percent reported receiving PhDs in any field, compared to 32 percent receiving JDs, 18 percent MBAs, and 6 percent MDs. Most of the 246 History alumni listing their field of work as education are either educational administrators or consultants, or work in secondary education, or teach law or medicine. However, those who do attend graduate school in History are being accepted into outstanding programs. In the past decade our students have gone on to Berkeley, Cambridge, Columbia, Harvard, Michigan, North Carolina, Oxford, Princeton, SOAS, St. Andrews, Texas, UCLA, Vanderbilt, Virginia, and Yale. Several former students now teach at some of the most prestigious universities here and abroad. Share Your Story How did you benefit from majoring in History?

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of History Undergraduate Overview History FAQs for First Year and Transfer Students How to Declare a Major or Minor in History Major Modified Major Minor Transfer Credit Policy Course Descriptions First-Year Seminars Introductory Africa, Asia, Latin America & The Caribbean (AALAC) Europe (EUR) Interregional & Comparative (INTER) United States (US) Seminars & Colloquia Independent Study & Honors Course Schedule 2021-2022 Schedule 2022-2023 Schedule 2023-2024 Schedule Course Syllabi Honors Thesis Program General Timeline Guidelines for the Class of 2022 Guidelines for the Class of 2023 Honors Theses By Year Phi Alpha Theta Honors Society Prizes After Graduation Alumni Update Research Overview Faculty Research Initiatives Dartmouth History Institute Student Research Initiatives and Resources The Dartmouth Vietnam Project History Librarian Research Funding Resources Undergraduate Research Database Student Class Projects Foreign Study News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
