Many advanced technology treatments are offered by the Department that are not available elsewhere in the state or the region, including image-guided radiation therapy, radiosurgery, and high-dose remote afterloading brachytherapy. The Radiation Oncology Residency Training Program is one of the oldest in the country, providing clinical training and research experience under the guidance of the Department's radiation oncology and medical physics faculty. Research conducted by the Department has led to a number of developments that translate to more effective treatments for patients including development of short-course brachytherapy for breast cancer, intensity modulated radiotherapy, radiosurgery, and computer-based techniques to precisely calculate radiation doses.
