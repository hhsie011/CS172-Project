Log into iHawk and select "ISS Services for All Students" --> "Copies of Previous Documents". You must pay the $20 fee at the ISS online store BEFORE the request can be processed. Processing times vary depending on the size of the request. Copies will not be available until at least two business days after the request is submitted. Keep in mind it is your responsibility to retain all of your I-20s and it is not the responsibility of ISS to archive official copies of all documents. Duplicate/Replacement Request for Current I-20 If you (or your dependents) have lost your current I-20(s) or it is damaged, you can request a duplicate I-20 for a $20 fee per document. Log into iHawk and select "F-1 Student Services" --> "I-20 Requests". Click on "Start a New Request" then select "Duplicate/Replacement for Current I-20". You must pay the $20 fee at the ISS online store BEFORE the request can be processed. Your request will be processed within 5 business days. Once it is processed, you will receive an email from ISS. If you are planning to travel abroad, please submit this request at least two weeks in advance. Financial Update If your financial support has changed from what is currently listed on your I-20, you should request a financial update to your I-20. Log into iHawk and select "F-1 Student Services" --> "I-20 Requests". Click on "Start a New Request" then select "I-20 Financial Update". Upon submitting this e-form, you MUST meet with an ISS immigration advisor in order to have your request processed.* This can be done during walk-in hours (Monday-Friday, 1:30pm-4pm). *If any portion of your funding comes from KU, please wait until the person who can verify your KU funding submits their portion of the form before coming to ISS. You will get an email that notifies you when you can come to ISS during walk-in hours to have your request processed. I-20 Extension Please refer to the I-20 Extension page for information on how to request an I-20 program extension. I-20 Add Dependent Please refer to the F-2 Dependents page for information on how to request an I-20 for your F-2 Dependent(s).
