Material: tin, mahogany, brass, Bibliography: The Apparatus of Science at Harvard, 1765-1800 DescriptionThe mahogany house is shaped as a church with a small steeple. The sides of the building are hinged to the base. The roof and gables lift off. The roof line is chipped at the rear. A brass wire conductor ascends up the front of the house through the steeple to a lightning rod terminated by a point. There is a removable brass ball on the point. The other end of the conductor ends in a loop, used to attach a chain to take the conductor to the ground. The path of the wire conductor is interrupted by a removable block of wood that contained the continuation of the rod. The block is now missing. The interior of the base has a tin strip (approximately 4.2 x 13 cm) glued down. So does the front wall. The strip links to the exterior conductor by means of nail heads, and is used as a platform for gun powder. A paper oval label on the front wall reads, "6-6-5." There are blank-stamped numerals "6 1" on the roof. Rectilinear stickers are glued to the underside, and read "F & J 1003" and "F & J A1003."
