The number of required PE courses has been reduced to 1 PE course for students graduating in these terms. 2024-2025 academic year: The swim test has been waived for students graduating in 2024 summer, 2024 fall, 2025 winter and 2025 spring. Students graduating in these terms are required to complete 2 PE courses. I missed the deadline to submit my transfer term application. What should I do? The deadline for transfer term applications for summer and fall 2022 has passed. You may wish instead to pursue a transfer term for winter or spring 2023 terms; see the application deadlines and information about Transfer Terms on our website. The faculty Committee on Instruction (COI) will consider late requests for a summer and/or fall 2022 transfer terms. Petitions and transfer term applications with required materials may be submitted to Registrar@Dartmouth.edu prior to and no later than 4 p.m. (EST), July 11, 2022. Note that these requests will not be reviewed on a rolling basis prior to the deadline. The COI will review petitions and transfer term applications shortly after July 11. May I audit a course? Students may only audit if the course has not reached maximum enrollment. Due to classroom and space limitations, there may not be more auditors than spaces left in the course. Dartmouth will not offer auditing of courses to local community members until further notice. May high school students enroll in Dartmouth classes through the Special Community Student Program? High school students are ineligible to enroll in courses currently. Dartmouth is not offering the Special Community Student Program for high school students until further notice. Why am I unable to elect a course? You may: have a conflict, such as a time conflict, prerequisite conflict, etc. that you need to resolve. not have a D-Plan with an “R” for this term and need to change your D-Plan either online or by petition to the Registrar. How may Faculty members change or add a course limit on their course? In lieu of issuing enrollment limit overrides, instructors may submit a request to raise the enrollment limit for their course to the Registrar's Office. This change is due to high enrollments, and limited classroom availability. The Registrar’s Office considers requests to add additional students to the enrollment against classroom capacity. Faculty members are notified if additional enrollment jeopardizes current classroom assignments. If space allows for an increase in enrollment, an IP is placed on the course, the enrollment limit raised, and faculty members and department/program administrators are notified so IP overrides may be issued. When possible, submit all requests to increase enrollment at once rather than multiple requests for individual students in a single course.
