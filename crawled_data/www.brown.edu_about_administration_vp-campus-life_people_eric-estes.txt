The Division of Campus Life supports all students (undergraduate, graduate, and medical school students) and in some cases faculty and staff. The division centers its work on building inclusive intellectual and personal community, providing developmental advising and mentoring, fostering health and wellness, and empowering connections between co-curricular and curricular learning making both more meaningful. The vice president for campus life reports to the president and has responsibilities in four broad areas: institution and division-level visioning and planning related to student support and the student experience; leadership of a large division consisting of 17 offices and departments and more than 450 staff; working with a wide range of collaborative partners to maximize opportunities and address challenges so that students and staff can thrive by equitably accessing their educational and employment opportunities; and perhaps most importantly being highly visible and accessible to students (and staff) in order to hear their hopes and concerns in his role as a senior administrator.
