Additional expenses Buying a computer — The cost of purchasing a computer may be added to the cost of attendance once per academic career. Documentation of the purchase price is required. Health insurance costs — Health insurance expenses are not included in the total cost of attendance. Students who purchase the University’s health insurance plan may contact their financial aid counselor to request the expense be included in their individual cost of attendance. Other expenses may be included in the cost of attendance; Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid advisors evaluate these expenses on a case-by-case basis. Childcare for dependent children and unreimbursed expenses related to a disability are examples of permissible added expenses. The Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid may request documentation in order to evaluate individual circumstances.
