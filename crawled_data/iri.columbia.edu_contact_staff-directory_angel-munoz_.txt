Muñoz is an Associate Research Scientist in IRI’s Climate Program, focusing on climate variations and prediction at multiple timescales. He also leads the Latin American component of the Columbia World Project "Adapting Agriculture to Climate Today, for Tomorrow" (ACToday). Muñoz holds a BS in physics (2002, numerical general relativity), a Master of Arts, a Master of Philosophy and a PhD in climate sciences (2014-2016, Columbia University, Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences). His present research interests are associated with physical processes involved in how climate signals at multiple timescales can interact with each other (cross-timescale interference), and how those interactions impact predictability and predictive capacity; in particular, he's interested in better understanding how cross-timescale interference can be used to diagnose and improve misrepresented processes in a hierarchy of atmospheric circulation models. Muñoz also works on the development of climate services, especially those related to food security (involving models for undernutrition and human migration), vector-borne diseases and lightning activity. Background Muñoz presently serves as co-chair of the Climate Information for Decision Making (I4D) project in the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) Working Group on Subseasonal-to-Interdecadal Project (WGSIP); in the Research-to-Operations (R2O) group of the WWRP/WCRP S2S Prediction Project; in NOAA's Model Diagnostics Task Force (MDTF); in the WMO's Ad-Hoc Task Force on Regional Climate Forecast; and in NOAA's Modelling, Analysis, Predictions and Projections (MAPP) S2S Task Force until August 2020 (the end of that Task Force). He is also a reviewer of US-based and international projects. Before arriving at the IRI in 2018, he was a postdoc at the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (AOS) Program, at Princeton University. He also served as Associate Professor in the Department of Physics of Universidad del Zulia, in Venezuela, for almost 10 years, and acted as deputy director (2007-2009) and then coordinator of the Geosciences Area (2009-2011) at the Center for Scientific Modeling (CMC) of that university. At the CMC he helped create the Latin American Observatory, a regional partnership aimed at improving regional capacities and networking to provide useful, climate-smart products for decision-makers in Latin American countries. The Observatory offered him the opportunity to work directly with decision-makers on different projects for the Interamerican Development Bank; the United Nations; the World Bank; Comunidad Andina de Naciones; the Environmental Ministry of Ecuador; and the national weather services of Ecuador, Peru, Colombia, Bolivia, Chile, and Panama.

More generally, his work at the IRI is related to the study of climate variations at multiple timescales, subseasonal-to-decadal predictability and prediction, and the development of climate services.
