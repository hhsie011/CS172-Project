You will review essential prerequisite material, work on problems, present solutions, discuss and correct solutions, and make plans for further preparation outside of class. Supplemental Review Session Registration Fall 2022 sessions will begin the second week of classes, on Monday August 29th. Students can enroll in MATH 1096 on Catalyst through August 28th for Fall 2022. Starting August 29th, the MATH 1096 (SRS) Late Add Request Form will begin accepting responses. View SRS (MATH 1096) Schedule There are several key points to consider before enrolling in an SRS: Students enrolling in an SRS must commit to attend each week at the same time with the same tutor. Math 1096 is Pass/Not Proficient course graded on attendance and participation. Students are encouraged to attend all sessions, however, you must attend at least 9 sessions to receive a P. Only students who can complete 9 sessions should enroll. Students who have found prior math classes challenging are strongly encouraged to enroll early, as seats are offered on a first-come, first-served basis. Students will not be added to sections that are full. Please have multiple possible sections when attempting to enroll, as sections may be closed.
