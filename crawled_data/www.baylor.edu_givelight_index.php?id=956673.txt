Materials Science research positions Baylor as a leader in technologies that make products faster, stronger, and lighter, providing solutions for enhanced quality of life. Over the past 50 years, Materials Science has played a pivotal role in defining modern society. Our methods of communication, such as computers, smart phones, HD televisions, and other communication systems, rely heavily on advances that have sprung from materials research. Composite materials are increasingly used in the aerospace and automotive industries, revolutionizing the way we travel. Moving forward, advances in Materials Science will play a key role in realizing efficient energy storage and usage such as that required for solar energy and electric cars. Materials research also extends into the medical field, yielding compounds that revolutionize the chemical compatibility of artificial implants and nanoscale materials that offer new alternatives for drug delivery, including cancer treatment. Research in Materials Science has been active among Baylor faculty for several years. Focused collaboration across a range of colleges, schools, and departments will garner greater external funding, provide additional high-impact learning experiences for undergraduate and graduate students, and lead to solutions to challenges facing high-visibility industries.
