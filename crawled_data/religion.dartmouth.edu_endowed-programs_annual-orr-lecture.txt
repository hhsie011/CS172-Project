Past Orr Lecturers include historians, anthropologists, novelists, biologists, and philosophers. In 1972 James H. Orr, a Boston financier and supporter of the Religion Department at Dartmouth, provided the funding in memory of his son, David, for a lecture series now known as the "James and David Orr Memorial Lectures on Culture and Religion." The initial "Orr Lecture" was given that year by Mircea Eliade of the University of Chicago who lectured on "Sacred City, Sacred Time." Past Orr Lecturers include Lionel Trilling, Mary Douglas, Edward Said, Carolyn Bynum, Edward Shils, Rodney Needham, Donald Davidson, Amartya Sen, Gita Mehta, Judith Butler, Karen Armstrong, and Steven Pinker. Thursday, January 13, 2022 "The End of College: Religion Departments and the Battle Over An Ideal" Robert Wilson-Black CEO, Sojourners Founding Board Chair, National Museum of American Religion Thursday, January 13, 2022 4:30pm Location: Moore B03 Free & open to all Abstract: "Religion departments made their way into institutions of higher education in the 1930s to the early 1960s, at a time when significant shifts that transformed the college into the university were occurring. Higher education leaders found they were losing sight of the college ideal and hoped religion as a taught subject could bring back moral formation, a curricular focus on personal piety, and national unity. Protestant Christian leaders created religion departments during this shift in educational ideals—while religion professors themselves attempted to create a legitimate academic subject quite apart from the piety of chapel programs, narrow moralizing, and, above all, the centrality of Western Christian thought championed in the college model. Religion departments at mid-century were a response to the lack of an agreed-upon curricular center in the wake of the very changes that spelled the end of the college ideal, attempting to provide a cultural and religious center that might hold. That hope was never realized. What remained in its wake were specialized religion departments seeking entirely different ends that helped to cement the university model."

Yet, the actual use of capital punishment as retribution for "ordinary" felonies—the execution of convicted criminals—was comparatively rare. Capital punishment, of course, served several functions, and its comparative rarity does not mean it was insignificant either discursively or in the "spectacular" performance of governmental authority (an aspect of statebuilding and preserving the state). But the disjuncture between the low-level use of a penalty and its extraordinary prominence in law codes needs to be addressed."

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Religion Undergraduate Overview Major and Minor Curriculum Course Schedule Dickinson Seminar Focus on Race Non-Western Courses Honors Program Sperry Fellows Program Past Honors Theses Career Information Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Awards and Prizes The Charles Howard Dudley Prize The Dickinson Senior Writing Prize in Religion The Hans Penner Prize The Religion Department Faculty Award The Sperry Writing Prize in Religion Foreign Study Program News & Events Overview Dickinson Distinguished Lecture Forum on Race & Religion Hardigg Family Fund Lecture Past Fellows Orr Lecture on Culture & Religion Past Lectures People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
