CAHME is the only organization recognized to grant accreditation to individual academic programs offering a professional master’s degree in healthcare management education by the Council on Higher Education Accreditation. Creighton is the first university in Nebraska to receive CAHME accreditation and is one of a handful of schools nationally to secure dual CAHME and AACSB (Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business) accreditation. Creighton’s EMBA program attracts students nationwide. The EMBA program is designed for busy professionals who are experienced in healthcare but want to elevate their expertise. “Only 2% of business schools worldwide have earned an AACSB accreditation, and we are proud to distinguish our program further with the CAHME accreditation,” says Anthony R. Hendrickson, PhD, dean of the Heider College of Business. “This program blends two of Creighton University’s strengths: renowned healthcare education and a top ranked business school.” “The rigorous standards for CAHME accreditation validate the highest caliber of faculty, coursework and student outcomes. This ensures our students are well prepared to lead in healthcare,” says Laurie Baedke, MHA, FACHE, FACMPE, director of the Executive MBA in Healthcare Management. The EMBA program in Healthcare Management is a 45-credit hour, 18-month, cohort-based hybrid program. It blends four four-day on-campus instructional residencies that are immersive, didactic and relationship-building sessions, with the convenience of the flexible online learning format. “The academic-practitioner model of Creighton’s EMBA program provides students the right balance of academic rigor while ensuring key practical learning from industry leaders,” says Neel Pathak, MHA, FACHE, associate program director of the Executive MBA in Healthcare Management. Creighton Healthcare Executive Education (CHEE) is housed within the Heider College of Business that delivers degree-granting Executive MBA in Healthcare Management and non-degree Executive Fellowship program in Healthcare Management.
