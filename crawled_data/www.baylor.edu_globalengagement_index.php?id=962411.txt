Attendance at an OPT Workshop is mandatory for all students applying to OPT. Please note that you are required to attend an OPT workshop during your last semester in order to be eligible to apply for OPT. You may attend a workshop earlier than this time, but only attendance at a workshop in your last semester will count for this requirement. Your request to apply for OPT will NOT be approved until after you have attended a workshop. Registering for OPT Workshops All workshops begin at 4:30pm and last until 6:00pm. You must arrive by 4:30pm. If you are late, you will NOT be allowed to enter the workshop and will have to attend a different one. You should also go to the OPT Policies and Procedures Page and review the policy and procedure before attending the workshop. For the spring 2022 semester, OPT workshops will be held virtually on these dates at 4:30pm CT Wednesday, April 20th, Thursday, April 21st. Please use this link to sign up for one of the sessions. *Additional OPT Workshops will be scheduled as needed.
