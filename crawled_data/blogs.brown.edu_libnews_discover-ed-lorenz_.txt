Often witty and playful, Lorenz’s work is deceptively complex, influenced by her travels and informed by research in libraries and archives. The Hay second-floor landing features a selection of Lorenz’s artists’ books exploring historical figures. A display in the Bopp Room showcases materials related to Lorenz’s most recent work, r.ed engender.ed, a graphic novel exploration of ephemera, vintage games and what it means to be an artist. The novel playfully features “r.ed monde,” a curious red figure Lorenz created while studying abroad in Bologna, Italy, in 1985.
