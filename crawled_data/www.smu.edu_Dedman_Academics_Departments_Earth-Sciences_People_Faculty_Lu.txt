Subsidence over Gulf Coast Land subsidence is known to have occurred in plenty of areas over Gulf of Mexico, and caused extensive damages to manufactured constructions and increase in seawater intrusion leading to substantial loss of wetland habitat and more frequent flooding. The causes of the ground instability in the Gulf Coast are variant. Anthropogenic activities (groundwater withdrawal, oil/gas extraction, wastewater injection), and natural processes (sediment compaction and erosion, adjustment of the solid earth in response to changes in loading, and tectonics) have caused differential ground displacements and even activating faults. The Gulf Coast is vast with a size of ~500,000 km2, and bounded by Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. InSAR has the capability to observe the extensive areas using multiple SAR satellites (ERS, ENVISAT, ALOS-1/2, Sentinel-1A/B, TerraSAR-X, COSMO-SkyMed). We have first monitored the ground subsidence over the Houston-Galveston metropolitan and identified the activated faults. Furthermore, we have strived for mapping long-term small and large size deformation over the entire Gulf Coast from InSAR datasets, revealing their causes with supplementary data (GPS, extensometer, wellbore measurements), and understanding geophysical processes. The average ground movement around the Houston area derived from InSAR images obtained from 1995-1998. During that time, the peak land surface drawdown was about 50 mm/year over Harris Country in northwestern Houston [Qu et al., 2015].

Landslide studies Landslide is the downslope movement of soil and/or rock under the influence of gravity, which is an important geomorphologic process, sculpturing the landscapes by transporting large volume of sediment from slopes to catchements through the fluvial system. Particularly, the northwest US undergoes the heavy rainfall in winter, resulting in hundreds of landslides and the expense of federal and state budget for fixing railways, highways, and dams. There has been obvious linkage between two different geohazards (precipitation, landslide), but the analysis of two hazards has been rather fragmented without fully integrating all the associated parameters. We have characterized the major hydrology-driven landslides in the northwest US (Washington, Oregon, northern California) in the large scale with high resolution and accuracy, using radar remote sensing techniques, InSAR, GPM, and SMAP soil moisture. Using multi-frequency SAR satellites (ALOS-1/2, Sentinel-1A/B), we have identified and monitored widespread landslides in northwestern US, which have not been archived to the landslide inventories of the federal and state authorities. Dense vegetation and heavy winter rainfall are major obstacles for landslides studies, but the application of the advanced InSAR techniques has helped unravel previously unidentified landslides from space. In cooperation with USGS, we have successfully completed the state-of-art landslide dynamic modeling for slow-moving and run-out events using D-Claw.

InSAR imaging of Aleutian volcanoes With its global coverage and all-weather imaging capability, InSAR has become an increasingly important technique for studying magma dynamics at volcanoes in remote regions, such as the Aleutian Islands. The spatial distribution of surface deformation derived from InSAR data enables the construction of detailed mechanical models to enhance the study of magmatic processes. To study Aleutian volcanism, Lu and Dzurisin [2014] processed nearly 12,000 SAR images acquired by ERS-1, JERS-1, ERS-2, Radarsat-1, Envisat, ALOS, and TerraSAR-X from the early 1990s to 2010. They combined these SAR images to produce about 25,000 interferograms, which we analyzed for evidence of surface deformation at most of the arc’s Holocene volcanoes. Where surface displacements were sufficiently strong, we used analytical models to estimate the location, shape, and volume change of deformation sources. Snapshots of deformation of historically active volcanoes in the Aleutian arc from InSAR [Lu and Dzurisin, 2014]. The deformation processes at Aleutian volcanoes observed with InSAR include: (1) time-variant volcanic inflation and magmatic intrusion, (2) deformation preceding and accompanying seismic swarms, (3) persistent volcano-wide subsidence at calderas that last erupted tens of years ago, (4) episodic magma intrusion and associated tectonic stress release, (5) subsidence caused by a decrease in pore fluid pressure in active hydrothermal systems, (6) subsidence of surface lava and pyroclastic flows, and (7) a lack of deformation at some volcanoes with recent eruptions, where deformation might be expected. Among the inferred mechanisms are magma accumulation in and withdrawal from crustal magma reservoirs, pressurization/depressurization of hydrothermal systems, and thermo-elastic contraction of young lava flows [Lu and Dzurisin, 2014]. Lu and Dzurisin’s work demonstrates that deformation patterns and associated magma supply mechanisms at Aleutian volcanoes are diverse and vary in both space and time. By combining InSAR results with information from the geologic record, accounts of historical eruptions, and data from seismology, petrology, gas geochemistry, and other sources, they have developed conceptual models for the magma plumbing systems and behaviors of many volcanoes in the Aleutian arc. Even though these models are simplistic, but Lu and Dzurisin hope that they will serve as foundations that will be refined as additional information becomes available [Lu and Dzurisin, 2014]. keywords: Aleutian Islands, InSAR, Deformation modeling, Magma dynamics, Inflation, Magmatic intrusion, Seismic swarm, Subsidence, Hydrothermal system, Flow contraction.
