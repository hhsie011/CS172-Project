Edmund P. Joyce, C.S.C., Awards for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching, and three have been honored with Dockweiler Awards for Excellence in Undergraduate Advising. The awards are presented by the Office of the Provost, and the recipients are selected through a process that includes peer and student nominations. The Joyce Awards, established in 2007, are supported by a gift from the late Father Joyce’s classmates of Notre Dame’s Class of 1937. They honor faculty members who have had a profound influence on undergraduate students through sustained exemplary teaching, and, in particular, recognize professors who create environments that stimulate significant student learning, elevate students to a new level of intellectual engagement and foster students’ ability to express themselves effectively within their disciplines. The Dockweiler Awards, established in 2007 with a gift from the Julia Stearns Dockweiler Charitable Foundation, recognize faculty or staff members who have demonstrated a sustained commitment to Notre Dame undergraduates through outstanding mentoring, academic advising or career counseling services. 2021-22 JOYCE AWARD RECIPIENTS COLLEGE OF ARTS AND LETTERS Kimberly Belcher, theology Ann-Marie Conrado, art, art history and design Blake Leyerle, theology Forrest Spence, economics COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING Edward Maginn, chemical and biomolecular engineering Karel Matouš, aerospace and mechanical engineering Michael Stanisic, aerospace and mechanical engineering Danielle Wood, Dean’s Office COLLEGE OF SCIENCE Giles Duffield, biological sciences Christopher Kolda, physics and astronomy Masaru Kuno, chemistry and biochemistry Laurie Littlepage, chemistry and biochemistry Nancy Michael, biological sciences Robert Rosenbaum, applied and computational mathematics and statistics Molly Walsh, applied and computational mathematics and statistics Kelley Young, chemistry and biochemistry MENDOZA COLLEGE OF BUSINESS Carl Ackermann, finance Shane Corwin, finance Sandra Vera-Muñoz, accountancy INSTITUTE FOR EDUCATIONAL INITIATIVES Michael Macaluso, Institute for Educational Initiatives DOCKWEILER AWARD RECIPIENTS Maureen Dawson, Office of Arts and Letters Undergraduate Studies Alan Huebner, applied and computational mathematics and statistics Michael Stanisic, aerospace and mechanical engineering Posted In: Faculty and Staff Home Latest News Experts ND in the News Subscribe About Us Related May 26, 2022 Heather Christophersen, Anne Griffith appointed to VP positions May 25, 2022 Of faith and reason: Reflecting on Sister Kathleen Cannon’s 32 years at Notre Dame May 19, 2022 Thomas Fuja to serve as interim vice president and associate provost for graduate studies and interim dean of the Graduate School May 19, 2022 Paolo Carozza named to Meta Oversight Board May 12, 2022 Life-threatening baby formula shortage requires fast action, Notre Dame expert says For the Media Contact Office of Public Affairs and Communications Notre Dame News 500 Grace Hall Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA Facebook Twitter Instagram YouTube Pinterest © 2022 University of Notre Dame Search Mobile App News Events Visit Accessibility Facebook Twitter Instagram YouTube LinkedIn
