Grading Options Grading Scale & Grade Point Average Repeating Courses Grade Exclusions Grade Changes Grading Options When you enroll in a course, you may choose how you would like it to count toward your degree. Graded: The course will be graded on the A+…F scale and will count toward your GPA. Credit-Only (Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory): The course will not count toward your GPA. In order to receive a Satisfactory (passing) grade, the equivalent of a C- or better is required. Selected courses can be included only under the free elective category of the specific curriculum in which the student is enrolled. Thus, students in curricula without free electives may not take credit-only courses to satisfy graduation requirements except for Physical Education and other courses authorized to be graded S/U (reference REG 02.20.15 below). Audit: The course will not count toward your GPA or your degree requirements. Audited courses will still be subject to tuition and fees (reference REG 02.20.04 below). Many courses (either required for degree or for Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory grading) require a minimum of a C- (or a “C-Wall”) in order to be considered a passing grade as opposed to a D- or above. Courses requiring a C- will be designated as such in the course description. NOTE: If you wish to audit a course or take it for credit only, confirm with your advisor that you are meeting your degree requirements before you enroll. REG 02.20.04: Audits REG 02.20.15: Credit-Only Courses Grading Scale and Grade Point Average The number of credit hours attempted in a semester or summer session (for which regular grades are received) is divided into the total number of grade points earned to arrive at the grade-point average (GPA). Grade Grade Points A+ 4.333 A 4 A- 3.667 B+ 3.333 B 3 B- 2.667 C+ 2.333 C 2 C- 1.667 D+ 1.333 D 1 D- .667 F 0 REG 02.50.03: Grades and Grade Point Average Repeating Courses Undergraduate students may repeat a course for credit once without permission if the previous attempt was completed with a grade lower than a D+. Students must have permission from the dean of their respective college to attempt a course for credit more than twice. Unless a student applies a grade exclusion (see below), the grades for all course attempts are included in the calculated GPA. REG 02.20.06: Course Repeat Grade Exclusions Students may apply a maximum of two grade exclusions to classes for which they received a C- or lower. Grade exclusions must be applied prior to applying for graduation. REG 02.20.16: Undergraduate Grade Exclusions Grade Changes End-of-course grades are final upon submission to the department of Registration and Records and not subject to change as a result of the instructor’s judgment or on the basis of a second trial (e.g., a new examination or additional work undertaken or completed). Grade changes may only be made to correct: an error in computation or transcribing, or a mistake where part of the student’s work has been unintentionally overlooked. Grade changes must be made within one calendar year after the date final grades were submitted. A Grade Change Report form requires the instructor’s signed statement as to the reason for the change, the approval of the department head, and the approval of the dean of the college in which the course is taught. Such approval is not necessary when changing an Incomplete (IN) or Late Grade (LA).
