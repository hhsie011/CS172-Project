Advanced standing M.S.W. students are required to complete one internship at the concentration level, either Advanced Clinical Practice (ACP) or Advanced Integrated Practice (AIP). This field placement is a minimum of 500 hours and typically occurs across two semesters in one academic year. Students are placed in social work settings for a minimum of sixteen hours a week. The concentration level internship focuses on a deeper understanding of specific knowledge, values, skills, and cognitive and affective processes consistent with each concentration area. ACP students learn to practice as clinical social workers, while AIP students learn to effectively navigate multiple levels of social work practice by engaging in varied professional roles and/or functions.
