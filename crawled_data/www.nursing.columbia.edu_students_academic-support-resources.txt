Click to request an Academic Program Plan. Academic Coaching Academic Coaching is available to degree seeking students in need of additional support in core courses. Columbia University School of Nursing doctoral students are trained as academic coaches and provide weekly small group tutoring and pre-exam review sessions. Academic coaches assist students with mastering course content, time, organization, and study management skills. To begin coaching or tutoring services, submit a request form. If you have questions contact the Office of Academic Services and Reporting, SON-OAE@cumc.columbia.edu. Stop by for drop-in hours early in the semester â€“ not the day before an exam. Leave time to study after your session. RSVP to group sessions so coaches can plan for appropriate space. Email your academic coach questions in advance so you can go over them in your session. Review recent course readings, lectures, and class notes, and come with questions. Bring your class notes, textbook, laptop, and course syllabus. Students who need to cancel a session or change their sign-up are asked to notify their academic coach at least 24 hours in advance. Interested in Becoming an Academic Coach? Academic coaches are Columbia Nursing doctoral students who have successfully completed the Masters Direct Entry (MDE) program. Prior experience in academic support, tutoring, mentoring, or teaching is preferred. Highly motivated students are encouraged to become academic coaches. Interviews are held each semester. Academic coaches must commit to a minimum of four hours per week. Compensation is provided via tuition stipend per semester. Augustus C.

Stellic Stellic is a platform that allows for students and their advisor(s) to easily organize each student's course sequence and keep track of their degree progress. A few things that students can do on Stellic: Plan degree interactively: Drag, drop, and add courses between semesters while keeping track of prerequisites constraints and typical course offerings. Track progress towards degree completion: See completed, in-progress, and remaining requirements for your major. Plan elective courses that fit your schedule: Discover conflict-free sections for the courses students are planning to take next semester. Chat with program advisor(s) without leaving the platform. Stellic can be accessed through the Stellic website using your Columbia credentials. View the Stellic Student Guide. Turnitin Turnitin is a web-based platform that allows instructors and their students to check written work for improper citation or misappropriated content. Turnitin checks submissions against internet sources, publications, and other student papers within the course, at Columbia University, and at other institutions. Each submitted paper receives an "originality report" in which passages of high similarity to another source are highlighted and linked to their original source. Turnitin also offers a suite of additional services, including peer review functionality and an online grade book. Columbia Nursing instructors may submit or request that students submit their assignments via Turnitin instead of or in addition to CourseWorks. Please be advised that the instructor, at his or her discretion, may choose to submit students' written work to either the Columbia repository or Turnitin's universal repository. Questions about this policy should be directed to the Office of Curricular and Academic Support. Columbia Nursing students will also use Turnitin as a learning tool. As a student, you will be able to submit your assignments into a mock course called Columbia University School of Nursing Writing Lab; there you will get an originality report. The report provides a summary of matching or similar areas of text found in a submitted paper that can be considered as plagiarized information. You will be able to check your own work to see where citations and referencing are needed. Further details are available in the Columbia Nursing Student Handbook. To obtain instructions on how to access the Writing Lab in Turnitin, please contact SON-OCAS@cumc.columbia.edu.
