This new eight-year continuum incorporated four years of undergraduate work and four years of professional training into a single course of study. The only program of its kind at the time, it is today still the only combined baccalaureate-MD program in the Ivy League. An application of Brown’s open curriculum concept, the PLME allows students, in exchange for an early decision on their pursuit of a medical degree, to take full advantage of the breadth of a liberal arts education.
