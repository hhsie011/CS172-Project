I want to pull the School of Engineering even closer to the School of Medicine, and work on creating innovative drug delivery systems. Stanford is a powerhouse when it comes to making new technology for early detection and diagnosis of disease, and there’s a huge opportunity for growth in drug delivery.” - Joseph DeSimone, Sanjiv Sam Gambhir Professor of Translational Medicine and Chemical Engineering Meet Stanford Engineers “I wanted to give back to Stanford Engineering to allow other students and researchers to continue to have the same opportunities I was given at Stanford, and to continue to push the boundaries of technology.” -Cory Combs, BS/MS ’09, Mechanical Engineering A face of Stanford Engineering Alaisha Alexander “I stumbled upon this really engaging paper … It turned out that paper came from professor Chris Gerdes’ lab at Stanford, where I’m now working on my PhD. He sort of became a mini academic superstar in my mind …” Read her story WAYS TO GIVE Explore ways to give See how to give to Stanford Engineering.
