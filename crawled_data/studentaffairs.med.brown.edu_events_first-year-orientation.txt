If you would like a new photo, you must visit the Brown Card Office in person during normal business hours to have a photo taken. Students Who Don't Already Have a Brown ID: You need to submit a photo to the Brown Card Office on or before July 30 which will be used to create your ID card. To submit your photo, please log in to the secure area of Banner, go to the Applicant and Student section, and use the link for Brown ID Online Photo Submission.

Student Health Insurance It is important that Brown University students have access to comprehensive medical care while enrolled with us. All students are automatically enrolled in the University's Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP). Participation in SHIP is mandatory unless you are enrolled in another comparable health insurance plan. The effective dates of coverage are July 15, 2021 through August 14, 2022. Each student's account will be charged the $4,169 Health Insurance Fee (assessed entirely in the Fall semester), as well as a Health Services Fee, which covers the cost of basic medical care at Health Services and Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS). If you choose to waive SHIP, you will need to provide proof of comparable coverage and submit an online waiver form by July 30, 2021. If you waive SHIP, you can still receive treatment at Brown Health Services. Schedule of Events Orientation Schedule August 2-9, 2021 Downloadable schedule here.

Peer Mentoring Al's Pals is a student-run program that pairs first-year medical students (M1's) with second-year (M2) pals. Learn more Canvas Course Web Site Classes will begin during Orientation week. Canvas is the course management system used by Brown. You will be notified once you can access the Canvas site for the MD25 class. Community Mentor As part of the Doctoring Program, you will spend a half day each week with a community-based physician mentor, practicing with your mentor's patients the clinical skills you learn in class. Mentor site placements in Year 1 are random, unless you indicate that you are willing/able to commute to your site. Mentor placements range from about .5 miles to 40 miles from AMS. Most sites outside of Providence do not take more than 20 minutes by car. We advise that you have access to a car at least one day per week to travel to your mentor site, but recognize that this is not possible for all students. In July, you will receive an optional survey, to be completed only if you opt to commute to your mentor site in which you may indicate your specialty preference for a mentor (which will be strongly considered given mentor availability but not guaranteed). If you do not opt to drive to your site, you will receive a mentor placement in the Providence area accessibly by shuttle or bus. Year 1 placements will be assigned in late August. In your second year of Doctoring, you will be assigned to a different mentor. You will also have the opportunity in Year 2 to indicate preferences for your placement (i.e., geographic location, clinical setting, Spanish-speaking population, or mentor specialty). Computer Requirement All exams are administered electronically on ExamSoft; therefore, students are required to have an iPad or other device (e.g., laptop, tablet, etc.). You can view ExamSoft's minimum system requirements for iPads, Macs, and PCs their website. Individual tech support from the Office of Medical Education will be available to students during orientation. It's perfectly acceptable to bring what you have and then wait until orientation (or later!) to make a decision on what works best for you. Discounts at the Brown Bookstore are available to you as a medical student (with your Brown ID). Diagnostic Equipment for Doctoring I It is required that each student have their own diagnostic equipment for the Doctoring course by early September for vital signs practice. For your convenience, there will be vendors available at AMS for a â€œDiagnostic Equipment Overview/Demonstration" - date to be determined. List of Required Equipment available soon. More about Doctoring coming soon. I-9 If you have any plans to work - IT fellow, peer tutor, admissions tour guide, etc. - more info available soon. Lockers Students will receive their combined locker/mailbox 4-digit number during Orientation.

Parking and Shuttle Information The Alpert Medical School of Brown University has a parking garage adjacent to the building. Parking spaces can be purchased once you have your Brown ID Card. If you wish to acquire a University parking space in the garage, you will need to first register your student and vehicle information on the Transportation Office's webpage. Once completed, you can visit the University's Transportation Office. Please bring your Brown ID, along with a valid vehicle registration and insurance card, and inform the staff that you are a student at the Alpert Medical School and that you are there to get your parking assignment for the garage. You will be issued a University sticker for your vehicle and an access card that will be required for you to get in and out of the garage. By registering for University parking, you will be responsible for compliance with all University parking regulations, which may be found on their webpage. Please note that the garage has a maximum number of available reserved spaces, so parking may not be available.
