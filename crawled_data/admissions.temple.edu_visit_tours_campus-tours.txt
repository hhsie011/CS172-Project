We have limited availability for group visits during our Summer Session. If you would like to inquire about scheduling a group tour for the summer please email visits@temple.edu and include your group name, number of students, and contact information. At this time we are not scheduling group visits for the Fall semester. We will begin scheduling those later this summer, in August. Group Tour requests are made on a first-come, first-served basis. Availability is limited and visits tend to fill up quickly. Please submit your email request at least three weeks before the day you would like to visit. After your request is submitted, our office will contact your group within 10 business days. Once the request is approved, you will receive a confirmation email, typically within one week of the approval. Guidelines Please keep the following in mind as you plan for your group visit. Due to the high volume of visitors on Temple’s campus, group tours are only offered during select months of the year based on the Office of Undergraduate Admissions’ discretion. Group tours are only available Monday through Friday during regular business hours. Group tours are not offered during weekends, holidays and select weeks throughout the calendar year. We are unable to accommodate group requests from middle schools due to the volume of high school requests we receive. Groups cannot exceed 40 total students. For every 10 students, 1 adult chaperone must be present. The group contact, if scheduled for a date, must confirm the date and time offered no later than five business days after receiving a group visit offer email. Due to the high volume of requests, groups cannot exceed the five business day confirmation period. Group tours are not guaranteed.
