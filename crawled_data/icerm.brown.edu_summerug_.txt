Every year, faculty organizers develop a variety of topical research projects that are interdisciplinary in nature. They begin the program with brief introductory talks about each project. Throughout the eight-week program, students work on their assigned projects in groups of two-to-four, mentored by faculty advisors and teaching assistants. Students meet daily, give regular talks about their findings, attend mini-courses and guest talks, and participate in professional development seminars. Students learn how to collaborate mathematically while attending Summer@ICERM, and they work closely with their teammates to write up their research into a poster and/or paper by the end of the program. ICERM provides an excellent research environment; students and their faculty and TA mentors have access to shared offices and collaborative space throughout the institute. They also have access to ICERM’s computer facilities and specialized software. ICERM staff provide logistical support for students and help build community through fun activities and events. Program Details Funding Includes $3,800 stipend Dormitory housing Meal plan Travel support within U.S. Applicants must be matriculating undergraduate students at the time of the Summer@ICERM program. Funding is available for a very small number of students who are not US citizens or permanent residents. Upcoming Summer@ICERM programs are posted in the fall of each year. Deadline Mid-February Summer@ICERM Upcoming Programs Summer@ICERM 2022: Computational Combinatorics Jun 13 - Aug 5, 2022 Undergraduate Research Summer@ICERM 2022: Computational Combinatorics Jun 13 - Aug 5, 2022 × The Summer@ICERM faculty advisers will present a variety of research projects on the combinatorics of parking functions. This overarching theme will allow participants to study and analyze parking functions by leveraging computational techniques and theory. Faculty will also guide the development of open-source computational tools for analyzing parking functions and their statistics, with time devoted to creating a database of parking functions and their generalizations. Throughout the eight-week program, 18-22 students will work on their projects in groups of two to four, supervised by faculty advisors and aided by teaching assistants. Students will meet daily, give regular talks about their findings, attend mini-courses, guest talks, and professional development seminars, and will acquire skills in free software development. Students will learn how to collaborate mathematically, working closely in their teams to write up their research into a paper. Organizing Committee Susanna Fishel Pamela E.

By modeling nanostructures with discrete graphs, efficient DNA self-assembly becomes a mathematical puzzle. Faculty will also guide the development of computational tools which can be used to aid in answering fundamental questions that arise in this field. Throughout the eight-week program, students will be introduced to the research topic with interactive lectures. Afterward, students will work on their projects in assigned groups of two to four, supervised by faculty advisors and aided by teaching assistants. Students will meet daily, give regular talks about their findings, attend mini-courses, guest talks, and professional development seminars, practice coding, and Tex typesetting, and will acquire skills in free software development.
