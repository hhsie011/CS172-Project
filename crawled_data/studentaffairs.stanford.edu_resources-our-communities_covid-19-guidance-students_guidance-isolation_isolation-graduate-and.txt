Here’s what to do if you test positive while living on campus Students and postdocs who live in Stanford housing with private bedrooms and single-occupancy bathrooms will be isolating in their assigned housing. This means you will be isolating in your own space until Vaden Health Services releases you from isolation. If you have not already done so, complete this form to report your positive test results. Then read the information below to become more acquainted with the expectations and resources in place for you. If you are experiencing worsening symptoms, contact Vaden Health Services at 650-498-2336. Here is how to reach Vaden after hours. CDC guidance can be found here. What does it mean for you to be in isolation? Being in isolation means preserving your health, safety, and well-being along with that of your community. The isolation period is necessary anytime a student tests positive for COVID-19. Although you will be in “isolation,” our goal is for you to still feel connected and well-supported. What if I have one or more apartment-mates? There are a limited number of spaces available for healthy apartment-mates who share common space with a student who has tested positive for COVID-19. Here's how to contact us to request a space. What should I do when my isolation period ends? You will be cleared to end your isolation period by Vaden Health Services, which will provide any further instructions. What should I do if I'm sharing an apartment with someone who has tested positive? We've posted additional guidance. Learn More Isolation expectations Do not leave the space. Do not use laundry rooms. Do not go to any in-person classes, events, meetings, social activities, shared dining spaces, common rooms, or other group activities. If you have questions about leaving your space, please contact Stanford Vaden Health Center. Do not go to work. Communicate with your supervisor and HR to explore working from home options, if appropriate. During your period in isolation, you may only leave to seek medical attention or with permission to do so by Vaden Health Services. If you are cleared to leave your room by Vaden, you MUST wear a face mask fully covering your nose, mouth, and chin. You MUST return to your room immediately after. You MAY NOT have visitors. Do not have others come to your space for visits of any kind. Daily needs: meal delivery, medical care, your campus resources Throughout this process, it is our hope that you will continue to engage in academics (to the extent the severity of your illness allows it and if applicable) and practice a daily routine that includes tending to your health, well-being, dietary needs, and non-in person social communication. Please contact the EVGR-B Housing Service Center for everyday essentials you may need to replenish. We are here to ensure you have access to appropriate campus resources so that you are well supported. Meal delivery for students in Stanford housing Meals will be tailored for dietary restrictions and allergies based on the information you have submitted when you completed this form.
