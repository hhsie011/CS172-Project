To that end, the University has adopted the following policy (the “Web Privacy Policy”) to articulate the terms and conditions of the collection, use, and dissemination of any information the University may receive from the users of Creighton.edu and pages within Creighton.edu (the “Website”). Creighton University reserves the right to modify this privacy policy at any time. We encourage visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to this Web Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change. Section 1: Privacy Statement Creighton University is required by state and federal laws to keep certain information confidential. Privacy and confidentiality are balanced with the need for the University to manage and maintain its networks, keep all members of our community safe, and provide the services requested by our students and their families. Therefore, to comply with the law and perform transactions requested by authorized users of the Website, University officials may have direct access to personally identifiable information as identified in this Web Privacy Policy. Section 2: Kinds of Information Collected INFORMATION GATHERED AUTOMATICALLY When you visit the Website, the University may collect and store digital information sent by your web browser, such as IP addresses (i.e., the internet address of your computer or device), geolocation, the web browser used for the connection, the device operating system, unique device identifiers, and other digital property, such as pages visited, length of visit, and terms searched. The University does not link IP addresses or cookies to any personally identifiable information such as individual names. To protect the University’s electronic assets, the University routinely monitors its network for signs of malicious activity. While the University may investigate malicious activity, the University does not store personally identifiable information related to the normal use of its network. Section 3: Cookies Creighton, our partners, and users of our services deploy cookies, the following few sections describe what are cookies, how they are used and your options for controlling cookies. WHAT ARE COOKIES? Cookies are small pieces of data, stored in text files, that are stored on your computer or other device when websites are loaded in a browser. They are widely used to “remember” you and your preferences, either for a single visit (through a “session cookie”) or for multiple repeat visits (using a “persistent cookie”). They ensure a consistent and efficient experience for visitors, and perform essential functions such as allowing users to register and remain logged in. Cookies may be set by the site that you are visiting (known as “first party cookies”), or by third parties, such as those who serve content or provide advertising or analytics services on the website (“third party cookies”). Websites may also contain other tracking technologies such as “pixels.” These are typically small transparent images that provide Creighton with statistics, for similar purposes as cookies. They are often used in conjunction with cookies, though they are not stored on your computer in the same way. As a result, if you disable cookies, pixels may still load, but their functionality will be restricted. HOW WE USE COOKIES Creighton uses cookies for a number of different purposes. Some cookies are necessary for technical reasons; some enable a personalized experience for both visitors and registered users; and some allow the display of advertising from selected third party networks.
