Inform–Discover–Translate: Knowledge about the needs of the elderly from geriatrics is used to inform basic research on the biology of aging and translated through clinical research into interventions to improve the aging human condition. As it becomes increasingly evident that many diseases are profoundly influenced by age, more and more medical scientists around the world recognize the importance of understanding the biology of aging. The Brown Center on the Biology of Aging brings together a group of faculty in an organized effort to study the basic biological processes that are associated with aging. In addition to our own research programs we have mounted educational and outreach activities, the cornerstone of which is the Molecular Biology of Aging (MBoA) graduate curriculum track leading to a Ph.D. degree. The Center also runs a monthly Providence Area Aging Research Forum, an extramural Aging Seminar Series, and the annual Colloquium on the Biology of Human Aging. Graduate MBoA Our objective is to train the next generation of scientists engaged in interdisciplinary research to discover and implement therapies that alleviate the suffering caused by age-associated degenerative processes.
