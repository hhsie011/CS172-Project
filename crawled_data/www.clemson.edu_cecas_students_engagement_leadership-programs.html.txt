Hambright Annual Leadership Program in Engineering was established by Mr. Robert Benjamin Hambright, Class of 1970, and Mrs. Susan Bindseil Hambright. The mission of this merit-based leadership program is to create awareness of the power and impact that can be achieved through leadership. Students who benefit from this program should demonstrate leadership qualities in learning agility, humility, strong character, and demonstrated leadership characteristics in academic areas, student organizations, and community activities. The annual program awards $4,000 to eligible junior and senior engineering students to attend leadership conferences and programs. The events encourage accelerated leadership development and awareness for the candidate(s), of which $3,000 will be used to fund leadership-related activities, and $1,000 will serve as a merit award.
