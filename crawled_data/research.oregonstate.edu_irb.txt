All research projects involving human subjects must be submitted for IRB review. Projects must be approved by the IRB or receive an exempt determination prior to the initiation of any study activities, including recruitment or analysis of existing data. NOTE: Please note the HRPP continues to work through staffing changes and appreciates your patience while we train our new team members. We are continuing to take steps to reduce turnaround time and will provide updates here. If you are preparing a new submission, please take a moment to review this information to ensure your application is “Review-ready” to help facilitate a shorter turnaround time. Focusing our Efforts: We commonly receive calls and emails for “status checks” and “rush” requests for submitted studies. Understandably, the volume of such calls and emails impacts our ability to devote time to processing your studies. Please allow at least 48 hours for us to respond to specific questions.
