Why do you give students the opportunity to self-report their academic information? Does this mean Iowa State’s freshman admission requirements have changed? What happens if I was admitted based on my self-reported academic information, but my final transcript shows I do not meet Iowa State’s freshman admission requirements? What about my ACT or SAT scores - do they still need to be sent to the Admissions Office? Are other types of applicants (e.g., transfer, international, graduate) permitted to self-report their academic information instead of submitting an official transcript?
