This exhibit showcases some of the varied work created over the last two years using the printer and the artwork of Zak Ziebell ‘19, currently studying painting at RISD and Symbolic Systems at Brown University. He began working for the Rockefeller Library’s Center for Digital Scholarship in 2016, and was the Studio’s artist-in-residence over the summer of 2017. For more information about the Sidney E.
