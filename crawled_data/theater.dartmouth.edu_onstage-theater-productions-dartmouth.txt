PreviousNext About our Production Program Theater is one of the oldest undergraduate activities at Dartmouth; our production program is built on a tradition dating back as far as 1779. The first Director of Theater was appointed by the College in 1928, and the Department of Drama (now the Department of Theater) was formally established in 1967. The department's production program includes a wide variety of forms and genres ranging from traditional scripted plays to musicals to experimental devised pieces. It also embraces the development process of new work, allowing playwrights to hear their work in readings, workshops, and full productions. This heterogeneous mix provides countless production opportunities for our students throughout the academic year. The department produces a faculty or guest-directed and designed MainStage production each fall and winter term; we also produce any number of student-driven performances and productions each term: works conceived, directed, performed, and/or designed entirely by undergraduates. Summer months are given over the annual Summer Theatre Lab, which includes the Frost & Dodd Student Play Festival, VoxFest, and the performances of the New York Theatre Workshop's annual Dartmouth residency. The creative arts are at the core of a liberal arts education, and we are passionately committed to openness as a department. Production involvement, both onstage and backstage, is available to all Dartmouth students regardless of either previous theater experience or major. Non-majors regularly participate in our productions as actors, run crew members, assistant stage managers, designers, playwrights, and more. During the first week of each term, the Department of Theater hosts a Theater Showcase in the Bentley Theater. Open to all students, the Showcase is an opportunity for students across campus to learn what productions and performances are in the works for that term, and how they can get involved either onstage or behind the scenes. For additional information on production opportunities please visit the "Get Involved" section of this website, or email Department Administrator Milena Zuccotti or Production Manager Brianna Parry.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Theater Undergraduate Overview Equity and Inclusivity Peer Advisors and Student Representatives The Major Major Requirements Honors Thesis The Modified Major Modified Major Requirements Modifying another Major with Theater The Minor Minor Requirements Courses: offerings by term Course Descriptions Instructor Permission Courses Independent Study Off-Campus Exchange National Theater Institute For Prospective Students Onstage Overview Get Involved Performing and Auditions Directing and Designing Playwriting Stage Managing The Scene Shop The Costume Shop Now Onstage: Upcoming Productions Season Archives: Past Productions Production Photos About Student Productions Workshops and Full Productions Studio Lab: Exploring Theatrical Boundaries YourSpace: Performance Spaces for Creative Minds Student Work in the time of COVID About MainStage Productions Opportunities Overview Summer Theater Lab: Cultivating New Work VoxLab Frost and Dodd Play Festival New York Theatre Workshop Residency The VOICES Program Experiential Learning with Northern Stage Testimonials Student Funding Opportunities Kingsdale Fund Need-Based Funding Goldner Mini-Fellowship Other funding opportunities Funding for Graduate Studies Internships, Fellowships, and Graduate Programs The Neukom Institute Literary Arts Award in Playwriting Foreign Study News & Events All News and Events MainStage Production News Student Production News Honors Thesis Productions Summer Theater Lab News Faculty News Student News Visiting Artist News Alumni News People Faculty and Staff Visiting Artists Alumni Tell Us Your Story Theater and Performance Studies My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
