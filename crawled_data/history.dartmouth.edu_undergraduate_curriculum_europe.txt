Wonder did not imply passivity: from the disintegration of the Roman Empire to the emergence of early nation states, through crusades, the expansion of trade, religious reformation, and advances in scientific thinking. Europeans drew on their experiences to develop new concepts of representative government, individual liberty, and religious meaning. Dist: SOC; WCult: W. View Winter 2022 course trailer.

HIST 3.02 Europe in the Age of Discovery This course introduces students to an age of discovery during which Europeans encountered worlds, real and imagined, far beyond the realm of the familiar. Between the latter half of the 14th century through the late 18th century European society, economics, politics, ideas, and culture were altered in ways that increasingly took on aspects of modernity. From the aftermath of a pandemic crisis through a period punctuated by religious reformations, civil wars, and revolutionary regicides, Europeans steadily adopted more modern attitudes to property, authority, community, work, family, the body, nature, and supernatural forces.

HIST 3.03 Europe in the Age of Violence The last two centuries were an era of dramatic transformations and contradictions: while Europeans enjoyed unprecedented prosperity, technological advances, and social mobility, they also unleashed and experienced empire, terror, total war, foreign occupations, and mass murder. Throughout these 100 years, contrasting visions of a new society ushered in a range of different regimes—monarchical empires, liberal republics, murderous and racist dictatorships, Communist autocracies, and a democratic welfare states—yet these visions also led to the emancipation of women, the development of a new consumer society, the creation of environmentalist movements and new counter-cultures, and the transformation of everyday lives.

HIST 8.07 The History of Equality This course will examine key shifts in the understanding and deployment of notions of "equality," including moral, legal, political, social, racial, and gender equality. Primarily a course of intellectual history with a focus on European and American sources and texts, it will nevertheless encourage the consideration of non-western perspectives and will draw on relevant literature in other disciplines, including anthropology, psychology, and economics.

HIST 9.07 Sex and Gender in Modern Europe Sex and gender have been central to the making of modern Europe. Over the last 250 years, Europeans constantly debated fundamental questions such as the "appropriate" roles of men and women; the definition of "healthy" and "deviant" sexualities; and the relationship between biology and social norms. By exploring a wide variety of historical sources, including essays, etiquette books, speeches, and memoirs, we will examine how these discussions profoundly shaped European thinking about politics, economics, imperialism, immigration, and everyday life.

HIST 10.05 Latin Paleography Working with manuscripts is one of the most exciting experiences in research on the Pre-Modern era, a direct link to the past, its people and its ideas. But it can be daunting to approach a material literary artefact. This course is an introduction to the basic methods and skills of Latin paleography, from the Roman scripts of Late Antiquity to the Humanist scripts of the Renaissance. It is designed to introduce students to the skills and knowledge needed to work with Latin-language manuscript material produced (mainly) before the advent of the printing press. It will also examine how technologies of writing and communication changed as a product of political, religious, and social change. The course will cover paleography, codicology, and diplomatics. The course will meet in Rauner Library (or, occasionally in the Book Arts Studio). Students will work closely with manuscripts in the College collections, supplemented with digital images of manuscripts held in other libraries around the world. As a practicum, the course is a hands-on introduction to the work of the paleographer, and students will learn to assess, transcribe, translate, and interpret manuscripts in their historical context as pieces of historical evidence.

HIST 41.01 Empires and Nations in Modern European History The history of Europe has generally been told through the stories of its constituent nations. Yet most Europeans over the past three centuries lived in empires. This course will place empire at the center of the history of modern Europe, focusing both on land empires within Europe and the overseas empire, and view the nation as a challenger whose ultimate victory was – and is – far from certain. Beginning with the emergence of modern national ideas in the late 18th century, we will trace the complex relationship between European nation-states and empires until the present day. Topics covered will include the consolidation of European nation-states in the 19th century, overseas imperial expansion, multinational land empires, the two world wars, decolonization, and the question of American and Soviet empire in the 20th century.

HIST 42; X-LIST WGSS 22.01 Gender and European Society from Antiquity to the Reformation This course examines the roles of women and men in Western Europe from Antiquity through the Reformation period. Emphasis will be placed on the intellectual and social structures that had a long-term effect on the concept and role of gender in European society. Topics included are biological and mythological foundations of gender concepts, attitudes toward the body and sex in pre-Christian and Christian culture, sin and ecclesiastical legislation on sex and marriage, family life and education, the individual and kinship, heresy and charismatic religion, and the impact of social-economic development on gender in professional life. We will discuss the textual and visual sources for our inquiry, as well as the changing contemporary views on gender roles in pre-industrial Europe. Dist: TMV; WCult: CI.

HIST 43.01 European Intellectual and Cultural History, 400-1300 A course on the intellectual and cultural origins of European civilization, from the fall of Rome to the advent of the Renaissance. After a review of the Judeo-Christian, Greco-Roman, Celtic, and Germanic components of medieval culture, we will examine the rise of the Christian Church and its impact on values and behavior of Europeans during the middle ages. Of special interest will be the relationship between medieval thinkers and the society in which they lived, the role of ritual, ceremony, and magic, and the persistence of heresy. Along with the products of high culture associated with such intellectuals as Augustine, Peter Abelard, Hildegard of Bingen, and Thomas Aquinas, we will thus review the fundamental values of medieval society at large and explore ways in which popular and elite culture converged or contrasted.

HIST 90.17 Templars, Teutonic Knights, and the Medieval Military Crusading Orders This course explores one of the most radical experiments of the European Middle Ages: the military crusading orders. The members of these organizations were imagined to constitute a "new knighthood" of monkish warriors, theoretically living according to a strict monastic rule and dedicated to the protection and expansion of Christian society as the military branch of the church. These institutions–and the Middle Ages more broadly–have resurfaced as one contested site in a raging culture war over race, power, and identity in the United States and abroad. This course takes this recent trend as a prompt for placing the military orders within their medieval context, beginning with their emergence from a longer history of Judeo-Christian holy war. More broadly, we will also take the military orders as a case study for historical questions about the intersection of religious belief, group identity, and acts of violence in human societies. Given the place of the military orders in the modern imagination, from conspiracy theories to far-right ideologies, a central goal of this course is to equip students with the skills to evaluate historical sources first-hand and also to engage critically with a wide range of historical arguments.

HIST 96.39 Seminar: Saints and Relics in the Middle Ages This course surveys the critical role and importance of saints – and their remains (relics) – in medieval European history, from the rise of Christianity to the eve of the Reformation. The saints were the link between the human and the divine, and after their death they continued to play an active role in the affairs of the world. Their remains (relics) were powerful, valuable commodities that were revered, bought, and traded; for which the great cathedrals were built; and to which the faithful travelled for thousands of miles, on pilgrimage. Study of saints and their relics permits evaluation of faith, belief, narrative, ritual, art and aesthetics, materiality, gender, ideology, power, and politics throughout the Middle Ages.
