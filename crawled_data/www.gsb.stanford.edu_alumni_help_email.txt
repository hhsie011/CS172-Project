How do I get a Stanford GSB alumni email account? To get a Stanford GSB alumni email account, you must be a Stanford GSB alumnus/a (MBA, Sloan, MSx, PhD, or SEP certificate holder) and register for an alumni username and password. As part of the registration process, you will be asked if want a Stanford GSB alumni email address. Check the box and you will be able to access your Stanford GSB alumni Google mail account after you complete the registration process. If you have already registered for the website, you can access your alumni email account directly from any page in the Stanford GSB Alumni site, by using the “Email” button in the horizontal red bar at the top of the page. How can I access my Alumni Email account? If you have already registered for the website, you can access your alumni email account directly from any page in the Stanford GSB Alumni site, by using the “Email” button in the horizontal red bar at the top of the page. If you want to access your alumni email through Gmail.com, you must log in with username @ alumni.gsb.stanford.edu (even if you use username @ alumni.stanfordgsb.org). You can also access your email via mobile device (e.g., iPhone, Droid, Blackberry) or email program (e.g. Outlook, Apple Mail). Mobile or email program access will require that you set up a separate Google Apps password. To learn more about how to do that, read below: “How can I get my alumni email on my phone or in my preferred email program?” How do I enable email forwarding? Gmail lets you automatically forward incoming mail to another address. To forward your mail, select the gear in the upper right-hand corner of your mail screen. Select the “Forwarding and POP/IMAP” tab. Your Forward setting will be the first item in the list of options. In addition to forwarding the message to another account, Gmail can keep a copy in your mailbox. You can decide if the copy should be kept in your Inbox, All Mail (archive), or Trash folder. Learn how to set up forward settings. If you forward your Stanford GSB email to another Gmail account, you will not be able to test that the forwarding is working by sending a message from the destination Gmail account. This is because Google mail servers automatically detect and prevent email loops. Test the forwarding by sending from a different personal account, or by having a friend send a test message. How can I get my alumni email on my phone or in my preferred email program? First, log into your alumni email from a browser to set up alternate access Log in to the Alumni Network and select “My Account” Select “My Profile” on the left hand-side Select the “Alumni Email” tab. Under “Stanford Alumni POP/IMAP Password” create a separate password to use for POP or IMAP. Next log in to your GSB alumni email (the “Email” link at top of all alumni website pages). Under the gear icon in the top right of page, select “Settings” and the “Forwarding and POP/IMAP” tab. Select the radio buttons to enable POP/IMAP. Configure your mobile or email program.

Your username @ alumni.stanfordgsb.org or username @ alumni-gsb.stanford.edu email addresses will not work. You must use the POP/IMAP password you set up in the above steps, or you will receive an error during your set up. What if I also have a Stanford Alumni Email account? Stanford GSB and Stanford alumni email accounts will remain separate. However, you’ll use the same alumni username and password for either account. Visit the Stanford Alumni Association’s website to log into your @ stanfordalumni.org alumni email account. I have an @alumni.stanfordgsb.org or @alumni-gsb.stanford.edu email address. Why does the email address in the right corner of my alumni mail screen say username@alumni.gsb.stanford.edu? The primary domain for Stanford GSB alumni is @alumni.gsb.stanford.edu. Alumni with @alumni.stanfordgsb.org and @alumni-gsb.stanford.edu email addresses can continue to send and receive email with these domains, but aliases have automatically been set up for you in @alumni.gsb.stanford.edu. How do I switch from an @alumni.stanfordgsb.org to an @alumni.gsb.stanford.edu address? Once logged in to the Alumni Network, go to “My Profile.” Select the “Alumni Email” tab. Scroll down to “Change email domain.” A few things to know if you decide to switch to an @alumni.gsb.stanford.edu address: This changes how your email address appears in your Directory Alumni Profile. You will still be able to receive email sent to @alumni.stanfordgsb.org (replies will be sent from @alumni.gsb.stanford.edu unless you change “Send mail as” located in “Google Settings,” the “Accounts” tab). Once you change to @alumni.gsb.stanford.edu, the change cannot be undone. I have an @alumni.stanfordgsb.org email address. When do I need to use username@alumni.gsb.stanford.edu? Even if you continue to use @alumni.stanfordgsb.org as your email address, you must use username @ alumni.gsb.stanford.edu when: You are asked for your POP/IMAP username. Mail sent to @alumni.stanfordgsb.org will be delivered. You log in directly via a Gmail or Google account page. You will be redirected to the Stanford login page.
