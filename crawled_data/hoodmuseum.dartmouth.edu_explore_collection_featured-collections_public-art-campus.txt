Dartmouth College has a distinguished collection of works of public art throughout its campus. The works have enriched the environment in which we live, work, and study, and have played a vital role in exposing Dartmouth students, faculty, and the wider community to a diverse range of contemporary art. Outdoor sculptures include Ellsworth Kelly's stunning Dartmouth Panels (2012), a major site-specific work consisting of five monochromatic aluminum panels, each painted in a single block of radiant color, designed for the east façade of the Hopkins Center's Spaulding Auditorium, facing the Black Family Visual Arts Center. More recently, the College unveiled Kiki Smith's shimmering stainless steel sculpture Refuge (2014) on the adjacent Maffei Arts Plaza. These join works by such internationally recognized artists as Mark di Suvero, Allan C. Houser, Luise Kaish, Beverly Pepper, George Rickey, Richard Serra, Joel Shapiro, and Ursula von Rydingsvard. On view in Baker Library is the remarkable fresco mural cycle by José Clemente Orozco titled The Epic of American Civilization, which the noted Mexican modernist artist painted from 1932 to 1934.
