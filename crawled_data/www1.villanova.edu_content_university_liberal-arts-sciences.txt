Thanks to a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF), a group of interdisciplinary researchers will be developing high-tech sandboxes to provide hands-on learning for students. The technology is based around projecting a colorful augmented reality display onto sand in a real sandbox. The box was originally used in public exhibits for science education but has since been adopted by universities and research centers around the world. MORE... BIGGER THAN BASEBALL After months of uncertainty and a historic stoppage of play, 14 teams took the field on Major League Baseball’s Opening Day. But before the first pitch was thrown, Jennifer Joyce, PhD, associate teaching professor, Department of English, met with students from her long-running Baseball, Justice, and the American Dream course. The conversation was hardly about the dozen-plus teams getting back on the diamond. “To me, I think baseball operates as a microcosm for the larger understanding of American society,” she said. MORE... BEATING BACTERIA Disinfectants have been one of many methods deployed to try to stave off infection, with household items during the COVID-19 pandemic. But another public health concern is appearing, antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Bacteria change over time, and the increased use of everyday antimicrobial products only speeds up their ability to survive the disinfectants that have been around for decades. A team of students in the lab of Kevin Minbiole, PhD, professor and chair of Chemistry, is preparing chemical compounds that will kill off these resistant bacteria. MORE... SCIENCE AND STORYTELLING Christina Winterton, PhD, assistant teaching professor of Biology, adds a welcome flair to the study of genetics in her course Heredity and Human Affairs. In the course, students focus on the social/ethical impacts of genetics, including but not limited to: genetic engineering, assisted reproduction, artificial wombs, cloning, fetal stem cells and gene therapy. The class offers a lot of academic variety. So, for the students’ midterm projects, Dr. Winterton gave them options—one of which was to create a storybook. MORE... STUDYING SLEEP Less than 10 percent of college students get eight hours of sleep per night, but healthy sleep schedules are very important. So, Irene Kan, PhD, associate professor in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, created the course, “Neuroscience of Sleep,” to delve into the many facets of sleep and how it impacts our behaviors. In the course, students debunk prior misconceptions about sleep and learn about the impact of sleep on cognition, physical and mental health. MORE...
