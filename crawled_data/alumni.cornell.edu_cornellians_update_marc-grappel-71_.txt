Hope you are all well. It’s been a very interesting and sinuous road to the present, and the story is still unfolding. My best memory, aside from those wonderful Big Red sunsets, was my discovery of the sculpture garden concrete creations from those early ’60s architecture students, and I visit them every year I return to Ithaca, mainly to take in the car races at Watkins Glen, as well as the state park there. Peace and love to you all. marcvette1949@yahoo.com Contact 312 College Avenue Ithaca, NY 14850 (607) 255-2700 cornellians@cornell.edu About Cornellians: Cornell’s new, digital-first alumni publication FAQ Alumni Advisers More Information Alumni Services Volunteer Events Cornell Store Come back to Cornell Reunion Homecoming Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions Copyright Website Accessibility Row Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter
