Home Home Students Parents Faculty & Staff Alumni College of the Environment Marine Biology 208 Fishery Sciences 206-543-7426 Website Faculty Website marbiol@uw.edu Marine Biology is a program sponsored by the College of the Environment to immerse undergraduate students in the study of marine organisms and ecosystems. Drawing upon the courses, faculty expertise and fields of Aquatic & Fishery Sciences, Biology, Friday Harbor Laboratories and Oceanography, students enhance classroom learning with field and research experiences. Undergraduate Programs Program of Study: Major: Marine Biology Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Marine Biology Undergraduate Program Marine Biology 208B Fishery Sciences 206-543-7426 marbiol@uw.edu Program of Study: Major: Marine Biology Program Overview Marine biology involves the study of life processes of organisms inhabiting the ocean's environments, drawing on courses offered by Aquatic and Fishery Sciences, Oceanography and Friday Harbor Laboratories. The degree integrates core materials on marine aspects of biodiversity, organismal processes, and ecology and ecosystems, examining their relationship with physical processes and ocean change. Graduates of Marine Biology are prepared for careers in management agencies at the local to international levels, environmental consulting, non-profit organizations and a range of educational settings. This program of study leads to the following credential: Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Marine Biology Recommended Preparation Suggested First- and Second-Year College Courses: Recommended courses for first-year students: FISH 250/OCEAN 250/ BIOL 250; English composition; calculus; CHEM 120 and OCEAN 295; BIOL 180. Recommended courses for second-year students: OCEAN 210, BIOL 200, and FISH 270/OCEAN 270/MARBIO 270; Q SCI 381, MARBIO 305. Admission Requirements Students in good academic standing may declare this major at any time, including on the application for admission to the UW. After notification of admission and before registration, new students should contact the Student Services Office for help in program planning.

Back to Top Additional Information Student Outcomes and Opportunities Learning Objectives and Expected Outcomes: Content: Students will understand, apply, and evaluate: Basic biological science content (Ecology, evolution, cell and molecular biology) Basic biological science content, with a marine focus Basic oceanography to understand influence of unique characteristics of marine environments on marine life Mechanistic understanding of how processes occurring within organisms interact with higher-level organization. Contributes to students's ability to understand and test cause-and-effect and to use both reductionist and integrative approaches to solving marine biology problems Integrated perspective on evolution and biodiversity of marine organisms, and relationship with changing marine environment. In depth for select taxa and trophic groups. Enhances advanced application of evolutionary theory and practice in the marine sciences. Integrated approaches to studying population ecology, marine habitats, and ecosystems. In depth for select habitats or ecosystems. Contributes to student's ability to work in biology across scales, to use integrative skills to understanding the influence of the marine environment on population dynamics, and the influence of marine life on abiotic processes. How and why oceans change. This area includes reciprocal connections between humans and the environment, in the context of other drivers and scales of variability. Provides students with not just a list of problems, but also empowers them to see how to create and implement solutions. Skills: Students will demonstrate the ability to use: Quantitative approaches to collecting and understanding information Written and oral approaches to communicating information, in order to share one's work with a variety of audiences, including scientific community and general public Collaboration to work together effectively in teams to solve problems Instructional and Research Facilities: Marine Biology students study and research at labs and classrooms in the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences, the School of Oceanography, and marine field station the Friday Harbor Labs. Honors Options Available: None Research, Internships, and Service Learning: Opportunities for research, internships, and service learning are shared with all undergraduate students via departmental website and email lists. Department Scholarships: Contact adviser for more information. Student Organizations/Associations: The UW SeaDawgs are a registered student organization with the goal of building a community of students who are passionate about marine science through social events, volunteer-work, academic seminars/research, and other projects.
