12:30 PM Online The Summer 2022 Collaboratory: The Amazon Region We Want is a virtual global program exploring the current state of the Amazon ecosystem and its communities. Through four seminars given by experts and locals in the field, participants will have the opportunity to learn, discuss, and raise awareness about the state of the Amazon region. This session presents the major ideas, actors, and practices that have shaped the Amazon’s current development and deforestation dynamics. It highlights how Amazonians have continuously adapted to changing circumstances while fighting to advance their own proposals for conservation and equity in development. Speakers: Susanna Hecht (USA, demographic changes in the Amazon) Erika Berenguer (Brazil, impacts and drivers of deforestation and degradation) Marina Hirota (Brazil, tipping points) Reading: Chapter 14 in Brief (English / Portuguese / Spanish) Chapter 19 in Brief (English / Portuguese / Spanish) Chapter 20 in Brief (English / Portuguese / Spanish) Chapter 21 in Brief (English / Portuguese / Spanish) Chapter 24 in Brief (English / Portuguese / Spanish) >> Register here.

Dr. Hecht was born in Utah, USA, and earned her Ph.D. in Geography from the University of California, Berkeley, on soils impacts of forest conversion to pasture in Amazonia. Dr. Hecht has worked in eastern Amazonia on livestock, non-timber forest products and Terra Preta soils and indigenous knowledge; on the expansion of soy in Brazil and Bolivia, on clandestine economies in Colombia, and a more general set of studies on Amazonian development, environmental history and humanized landscapes of the tropics. She has also worked on the forest transition, the dynamics of tropical urban/rural livelihoods and the political ecology of tropical land use change, and in central America and Mexico on remittances and forest resurgence. Erika Berenguer is a Brazilian Senior Researcher Associate at the University of Oxford and Lancaster University. Originally from Brazil, she moved to the United Kingdom to pursue her Ph.D. degree on the degradation of Amazonian forests from Lancaster University. Specifically, she addresses the effects of different types of anthropogenic disturbance on carbon stocks and plant diversity in the Brazilian Amazon. Dr. Berenguer has more than 50 publications on tropical deforestation and its consequences on biodiversity, including recent scientific contributions to the prestigious scientific journals Science and Nature. Dr. Berenguer is also one of the coordinators of the Rede Amazônia Sustentável, a large research network focusing on human-modified landscapes. Marina Hirota is a Brazilian Assistant Professor of Meteorology at the Federal University of Santa Catarina, Brazil. Dr. Hirota has built up her academic career through a very interdisciplinary background with a Bachelor degree in Applied Mathematics, a M.Sc. in Computer Engineering, a Ph.D. in Meteorology from the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), and postdoc studies with theoretical ecologists. Such variety defined Dr. Hirota’s current research field in Earth System Sciences, more specifically, trying to understand the processes and interactions involved in biome shifts within tropical zones of the planet, using dynamical system concepts such as resilience, tipping points and hysteresis. Dr. Hirota is particularly focused on searching for multi-scale and synergistic mechanisms within the atmosphere and the biosphere to deepen, quantitatively and qualitatively, the scientific basis of tipping points in South American tropical ecosystems.
