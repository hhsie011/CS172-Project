Yale is investing in the arts, humanities, social science, and sciences, as well as reinforcing its commitment to supporting faculty and students. We are investing boldly in science and engineering. Some of the most significant human problems of the day will only lend themselves to scientific and technological solutions. These challenges must be addressed at Yale. The University Science Strategy Committee (USSC) was charged to identify the most promising opportunities for investment across scientific disciplines. The committee was asked to recommend priorities and mechanisms for better coordinating science at Yale. The members of the committee were also asked to dream big, but to prioritize ideas and make difficult choices among many possibilities.
