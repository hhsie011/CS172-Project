Co-organizers: The Fulbright program was founded in the United States in 1946 to promote mutual understanding through international educational exchange. It is the most prestigious educational grants program supported by the US government. A French-American Fulbright Commission was launched in 1949. It is jointly funded by the US Department of State and the French government. The Commission has provided grants to over 20,000 students, scholars, teaching assistants and professionals from France and the United States to study or conduct research in the other country. The Columbia Institute for Ideas and Imagination hosts scholars, writers, and artists whose work has the potential to transform the way we think about the world. A presidential global initiative of Columbia University, the Institute aims to foster collaboration across the creative arts and scholarly disciplines through residential and short-term fellowships, workshops, conferences, exhibitions, and artistic events. Its primary goal is to enrich academic modes of presenting ideas by drawing together the scholarly and the artistic imagination. ***IMPORTANT*** ON-SITE INFORMATION REGARDING COVID-19 In compliance with French regulations, in order to enter Reid Hall, all guests must provide a pass sanitaire with proof of either full vaccination or a negative Covid test taken within the previous 72 hours.
