On June 15, the Chilean Parliament resumed discussions on the matter after its status was upgraded to urgent by the Government. In that context, the Santiago Center joined a group of 30 national and multinational organizations in Chile to support the initiative. Diversity, inclusion, respect, and non-discrimination are values that our organizations value and seek to defend. We do this not only because it is the right thing to do, but also because it makes both our companies and societies stronger and more sustainable. Studies have proven that a diverse workforce is more creative, engaged, and happier. Policies that support and promote diversity and inclusion also help companies in Chile to attract and retain the best talent that we need to continue excelling in the global economy. For these reasons and many others, everyone in Chile deserves the same rights, regardless of their sexual orientation. As organizations that share similar values, and because we firmly believe that all human beings have the same rights, we say “I DO!” to same-sex marriage in Chile and invite more actors to join us in providing their support. Society and the economy are stronger when we put aside our differences and find strength in what brings us together. The following organizations subscribe to this statement: Accenture, Accor, Adidas, Aes Chile, Aramark, BEAT, Beiersdorf, Cervecería AB InBev, Columbia Global Centers | Santiago, Compara Online, Deloitte, Empresas SB, Google, IBM, Identidad Corporativa Comunicaciones, Impronta Chile, Johnson y Johnson, Manpower Group, Medtronic, Mercado Libre, MGC Consulting, Microsoft, Oracle, Pride Connection Chile, Reebok, Roche, Siemens, Uber, Walmart, WOM.
