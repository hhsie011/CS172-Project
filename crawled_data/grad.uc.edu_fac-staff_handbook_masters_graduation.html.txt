Graduate Council Membership Roster Meeting Schedule and Minutes New Programs Committee Committee Schedule Graduate Leadership Group Membership Roster Meeting Schedule Graduate Program Review Graduate Fellows Mentoring Award Award Winners Support for Editors Previous Recipients Graduation One semester prior to the semester in which a student anticipates graduating, the student should: confer with his/her program office staff; consult the Graduate School's website for deadlines, instructions on submitting his/her electronic thesis; visit the Graduate School's website to determine if he/she is defined as a thesis or non-thesis student or consult with his/her program. Application to Graduate Students must: (1) complete academic requirements and (2) complete the official online Application to Graduate by the deadline for the semester in which they expect to graduate. NOTE: for all graduate students, the application for graduation is started at the Graduation page, and not within Catalyst. Start an application for graduation early in the semester you plan to graduate. Deadlines posted on the Graduation Deadlines website are firm and failure to meet them will delay students’ graduation until the following semester, when they must then submit a new application for their revised graduation date. A student graduating from a dual degree program must make a formal application for graduation for each program (see below). All students applying to graduate will be assessed a non-refundable graduation application fee. The fee will be assessed each semester a student applies for graduation. Students who have applied for graduation and learn later they will not be graduating must be removed from the graduation list before they can apply again for any future semesters (programs must notify the Graduation Program Director to remove a student). When the application for graduation is complete, the student receives an email receipt for payment of the graduation application from the registrar’s office. If this receipt is not received, promptly notify your program, as your graduation application may not be completed. Some PhD programs incorporate a master’s degree. Students should contact their program for help in adding this additional degree. Graduation from Dual Degree Programs The online Application to Graduate will allow a student to apply for graduation from both degree programs in an official dual degree program. Each of the two programs must follow and complete the certification processes and procedures necessary to facilitate a student’s graduation from their own program. In dual degree programs, students must be registered for at least one graduate credit that contributes to degree requirements in one of the two programs (as determined by the program) during the academic year in which they graduate with their dual degrees.
