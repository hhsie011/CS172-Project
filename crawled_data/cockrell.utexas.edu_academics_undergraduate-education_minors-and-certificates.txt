Students may also pursue minors and certificate programs offered by other colleges and schools at The University of Texas at Austin. A minor or certificate is not required for completing an engineering degree. Minors Cockrell School Minor: Materials Science and Engineering The Texas Materials Institute, in the Cockrell School of Engineering and the College of Natural Sciences, administers the new materials science and engineering minor for students who are majoring in chemistry, physics, electrical and computer engineering and mechanical engineering. Cockrell School Minor: Sustainable Energy The Hildebrand Department of Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering in the Cockrell School of Engineering administers the new sustainable energy minor for students who are majoring in architectural engineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering, electrical and computer engineering, environmental engineering, geosystems engineering and hydrogeology, mechanical engineering, and petroleum engineering. Students outside the Cockrell School who are majoring in chemistry, environmental science and geological sciences are also eligible for the sustainable energy minor. Minors at UT Many Texas Engineering students pursue other minors offered at UT Austin, in foreign languages, business foundations or other disciplines across campus. Planned carefully, pursuing a minor will not extend the time to degree for students in the Cockrell School of Engineering. Each minor requirement varies between 15 and 21 hours.

Certificates Computational Science and Engineering Steady growth in computer capabilities and enormous expansion in the scope and sophistication of computational modeling and simulation have added computation as the third pillar of scientific discovery and have revolutionized engineering practice. Computational science and engineering can affect virtually every aspect of human existence, including the health, security, productivity and competitiveness of nations. The computational science and engineering certificate provides in-depth study and research in computational science and engineering, including computational and applied mathematics, numerical simulation, scientific computation and visualization. Humanitarian Engineering The humanitarian engineering certificate takes engineering for society to a new level, providing undergraduate students with a rewarding, multidisciplinary program that allows them to focus their learning around communities that need their help the most — from low-income populations to people with special needs. The program combines technical and non-technical coursework with project-based initiatives and includes course options in the colleges and schools of Liberal Arts, Communication, Natural Sciences, Engineering and more. National Academy of Engineering Grand Challenges Scholars Program The National Academy of Engineering set forth 14 Grand Challenges to address the world's most pressing societal issues that can be solved with innovative engineering, such as access to clean drinking water, restoring and improving urban infrastructure and making solar energy economical. This certificate program is tailor-made to fit participating UT Austin students and is designed to be complementary to a student's academic journey. Bridging Disciplines Program Through the UT School of Undergraduate Studies, this certificate program, which offers 11 certificate options, includes a course of study that integrates classroom, research and internship experiences. Students may focus in areas such as Digital Arts and Media, Ethics in Leadership and Health Care, Public Policy among many other areas.
