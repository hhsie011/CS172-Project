They capitalize on their extensive experience in the corporate world to develop course content that addresses the conditions and challenges of today’s business environment while anticipating tomorrow’s business needs. Our faculty members are world-renowned for their cutting-edge research and impact on current business practices. Watch Faculty Profiles > Astounding Adjuncts To this exceptional group of full-time faculty members, we add in practitioners: adjunct professors who come to the School directly from the world of business (sometimes, just a short subway ride away). They apply real-life experiences to their teaching, creating precisely the right environment for students’ professional and personal growth. Top Executives Our faculty assets don’t stop there. The Executives in Residence program brings senior executives to the School to hold regular one-on-one advising sessions with students, as well as to teach classes, participate in student-run conferences, or organize informal lunches for groups of students with common interests. Working in our six main divisions — Accounting, Management, Marketing, Finance, Economics, and Decision, Risk, and Operations — or across divisions through our Cross-Disciplinary Areas in Competitive Strategy and Decision Making and Negotiations, faculty members give MBA and EMBA students an extraordinary education that will prepare them to become exceptional leaders.
