In summer 2015, the Graduate School Office of Inclusion & Student Engagement established a partnership with DPE to launch a June offering of the Colman Leadership Program open to Ph.D. and M.F.A. students from across all graduate fields. Every January and June, the Colman Leadership Program seeks to enroll up to 30 students in an intensive four-day program focused on providing participants with skills and knowledge that will support their development as leaders in graduate school and beyond. Although students with the fellowships and affiliations listed below receive priority consideration for enrollment in the program, the Colman Leadership program has the capacity to serve a broader base of students. Therefore, students from all backgrounds (domestic and international) and disciplines are strongly encouraged to apply.
