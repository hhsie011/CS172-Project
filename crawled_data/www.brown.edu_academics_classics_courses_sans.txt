This course will introduce students who already have a foundation in the Sanskrit language to the distinctive language of technical musicological literature and notation, as well as to the lyrical poetry set to music in these traditions. There is no requirement for students taking this course to have any background in musicology or performance, though students who do have a background in music are welcome to incorporate performance into the final project for the course.
