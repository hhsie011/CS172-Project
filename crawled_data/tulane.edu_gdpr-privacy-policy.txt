Finally, third parties serve cookies through our Services for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below. Cookies served through our Services The specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Services and the purposes they perform are described in further detail below: Essential Cookies These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our Services and to use some of their features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the Services, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our Services function. Performance and Functionality Cookies These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our Services but are non-essential to their use. However, without these cookies, certain functionality may become unavailable. Analytics and Customization Cookies These cookies collect information that is used to help us understand how our Services are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our Services for you in order to enhance your experience. Advertising (Targeting) Cookies These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests. For more information, see the Targeted online advertising section below. Other tracking technologies We and our third-party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, pixels (or “clear gifs”) and other tracking technologies. These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Services, or in the case of web beacons, opened an email that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Services to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have reached our Services from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns. While you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly; accordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair functioning of these technologies. Targeted online advertising We work with a variety of advertisers, advertising networks, advertising servers, and analytics companies (“Ad Partners”) that use technologies to collect data about your use of our Services (such as pages visited, ads viewed or clicked on) as well as your IP address, device identifier, or mobile advertising identifier, in order to deliver relevant advertising. These technologies may include the placement on our Services of cookies or web beacons, and other tracking technologies (as described in the Data We Automatically Collect section of our Privacy Notice) by these Ad Partners to track how our Services are being used, to track where users go and what they do after their leave our Services, and to link various devices you may use, and to serve you more relevant ads. These advertisements may appear on our Services or other services that you visit. In addition, our Ad Partners use the information collected by the technologies on our Services for purposes such as (a) in conjunction with advertising that appears on our website or other websites, (b) to report website traffic, statistics, advertisement data and other interaction with ads and the websites on which they are served, and (c) to measure the effectiveness of web-based and email ads. Please note that this Policy does not cover the practices of our Ad Partners. For more information about how Ad Partners use the information collected by the technologies on our Services and your options to opt out of such collection, please visit https://www.aboutads.info/choices/. You may also opt out of additional third party advertising networks by going to the Network Advertising Initiative’s website and following the directions. The opt-outs described above are device- and browser-specific and may not work on all devices. If you choose to opt-out through any of these opt-out tools, this does not mean you will cease to see advertising. Rather, the ads you see will just not be based on your interests. How can you control cookies and similar technologies? Browser Controls: Most web browsers allow some control of most cookies through the browser settings. For more information about how to reject, disable or delete cookies, please review your browser’s help menu or visit www.aboutcookies.org or www.allaboutcookies.org. If you choose to reject cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of certain features, services, applications or tools available through the Services that are only available through the use of these technologies. Disabling Most Targeted Online Advertising: As discussed above, advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of targeted online advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit https://www.youronlinechoices.com. You can opt out of having your mobile advertising identifiers used for certain types of targeted online advertising, including those performed by us, by accessing the settings in your mobile device and following the instructions. Do Not Track: Some Internet browsers, such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari, include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” or “DNT” signals. Since uniform standards for “DNT” signals have not been adopted, our Services do not currently process or respond to “DNT” signals. We take privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard. To learn more about “DNT”, please visit All About Do Not Track. Links to Third Party Sites and Social Media The Services may include links to websites and digital services operated by third parties.

We encourage you to review the privacy policies for those third parties to learn about their information practices. The Services may feature “like” buttons and widgets hosted by other companies.

The login feature may also transfer information to the social network or third party, such as your username and password, to authenticate you. The social network or third party may also automatically collect information such as your IP address, information about your browser and device, and the address of the web page you are visiting on our site. The login feature may also place and read cookies from that third party that may contain a unique identifier the social network or other third party assigns to you. The functionality of and your use of the login is governed by the privacy policy and terms of the party that provided the login functionality.
