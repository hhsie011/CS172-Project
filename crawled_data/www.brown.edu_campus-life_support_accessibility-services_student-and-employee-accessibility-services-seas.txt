Students (including graduate students) who may need accommodations or services due to a disability or medical condition should contact Student Accessibility Services to discuss their needs and begin the registration process. Disability related requests for accommodations and services are evaluated individually, based on documentation and completion of the registration process. In compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, an individual with a disability is defined as a person who "has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more major life activities of such an individual; has a record of such an impairment; or is regarded as having an impairment." Services for students with disabilities are provided by many offices of the University and are coordinated through SAS. The SAS office is also available to meet with any student who may be wondering if they have a disability and seeking an evaluation or additional information to assist them. Employee accommodations are through Human Resources. Employees can contact them via [email protected] with questions.
