Updates March 3, 2021 We are working closely with University leadership and are committed to strengthening our IT security. New Harvard requirements and standards will help prevent intruders from gaining access to our systems, and will also allow us to detect and track any intruders who may infiltrate our virtual borders. HMS IT will help ensure that every lab, classroom, department, and office at HMS is successful in adopting these new levels of protection. We are asking for your diligence in addressing information security risks to your own work and that of your colleagues across the School. These new Harvard University information security requirements apply to all individuals and technologies across our HMS Quad environment, including employee, postdoc, trainee, and lab computers, as well as classrooms, servers, and third-party software providers. Review the required protections and learn how to implement them on Information Security for the HMS Community. January 27, 2021 The eCommons platform and associated applications remain offline while HMS IT addresses the security of the environment. HMS‚ÄØ IT is working with stakeholders to identify immediate workarounds for critical functions, processes, and workflows and to deploy new systems and applications wherever possible. We have shifted the workload of many of our IT staff members toward implementing these short-term solutions, including implementing manual processes that may affect response times. January 25, 2021 The technical teams at Harvard have been working around the clock and have secured all the known areas of unauthorized access to Microsoft 365 email at Harvard. The intrusion appears to have affected a small number of individuals within the Harvard community. We are working directly with those individuals we have identified, and we continue to monitor activity closely. We are continuing our analysis of the eCommons platform outage, which has affected access to applications and services. January 22, 2021 In response to the recent intrusion into the Microsoft 365 email service, Harvard University Information Technology (HUIT) is enabling new security measures within our email system. As a result of this work, you will be required to re-authenticate, or sign in again, to access your Microsoft 365 account. If you receive this request, it is safe to proceed. Given our shared services' complex nature, you may be asked to authenticate several times over the next few days. January 20, 2021 In response to the recent security intrusion affecting Microsoft 365 accounts at Harvard, we are taking several important steps to defend against future attacks: We recommend that you reset your HMS account (eCommons) password to secure your account ‚Äì To reset your password, visit the password reset page, then follow the prompts. We have expanded the HMS Virtual Private Network (VPN) to protect additional websites and services ‚Äì If you experience issues accessing an HMS website or service, install the VPN client, connect to the VPN, then try again. This does not apply to applications affected by the eCommons outage. We will enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for Microsoft 365 on all accounts by the end of this week ‚Äì Harvard University now requires 2FA for all users. If you have an exception, we will contact you to help you secure your account.
