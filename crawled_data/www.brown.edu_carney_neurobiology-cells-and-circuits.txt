With a transformative $25M gift, we established the Center for the Neurobiology of Cells and Circuits to coalesce work in this area, including investigating the causes of autism spectrum disorders, teasing apart the molecules, cells, and circuits underlying addiction and reward, and creating a novel technology to map neural circuits.
