CALENDAR enabling DISCOVERY Data Science holds the key to tackling many of society’s greatest challenges by enabling discovery and innovation. Leading-edge scientific and computational approaches can extract hidden knowledge and generate fresh insights from large and complex datasets. The University of Miami Institute for Data Science and Computing (IDSC) is focused on tapping the extraordinary potential of this new field. We believe in a collaborative approach that brings together talented minds in multiple disciplines, and leverages our Institute’s state-of-the-art technology, including an AI-ready supercomputer and 5G+ edge computing environment. Our goal is to catalyze data-intensive research in fields ranging from medicine to earth sciences, urban planning, digital humanities, and business. IDSC also strives to enhance Data Science understanding among our students and the public—helping individuals of all ages including underrepresented minorities—develop the STEM skills needed for professional success in the 21st century. As a member of the University of Miami’s Frost Institutes of Science and Engineering, IDSC supports basic and applied research initiatives throughout the University of Miami as well as other leading institutions around the world. We are committed to developing strong partnerships with industry, government, and nonprofit institutions in south Florida, while building bridges to the Caribbean, Latin America, and beyond. We welcome the opportunity to explore how our powerful resources in data science and computing can help you achieve research, training, and business goals.
