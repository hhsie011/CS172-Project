This is the actual street address: 1401 S. 4th Street Waco, TX 76798 Google Map Link Parking There is an outdoor visitor parking in an open lot just outside our building at the corner of Speight Ave and S. 4th Street. This is the best option. There is also a parking structure off of 4th street. Visitors can obtain a permit here. Finding the GGP Offices From the outdoor visitor parking lot a white building labeled “Cashion Academic Center” is visible. We are in that building on the first floor. Technically, we are in a building called “Hankamer Academic Center-Cashion Academic Center” (not to be confused with the Hankamer School of Business, which is a completely different building). Cashion and Hankamer are two buildings that are connected by a common lobby. We are just off the lobby in between the two buildings. We are in the following offices: Center Director: H170.01 Student Success Managers: H260 Faculty Office Suite: H262 The second floor offices are difficult to find, so we recommend you go to the international offices on the first floor (just off the main lobby) and tell them you’re here for the Global Gateway Program. They’ll point you in the right direction. The Center Director's (Dr. Menking's) office is directly in front of the Center for Global Education's main doors.
