About the Program The Summer Research Training Program has been in place at the College of Veterinary Medicine since 1995. The cornerstone of the program is the summer research project that each student conducts under the direction of a faculty mentor in a research laboratory at Oklahoma State University or other affiliated institution. The project is designed so that it can be completed during the summer and so that the results warrant presentation at a national meeting or publication in a scientific journal. At the conclusion of the summer the students present the findings from their research projects to the veterinary college community during our annual Research Day; participating students also have the opportunity to attend a national research symposium where they interact with faculty and students involved in similar programs at other veterinary schools in North America. The program also holds a weekly seminar series that exposes students to critically important research topics such as research ethics, experimental design, and analysis and presentation of data. Training is provided on career development, with topics ranging from preparation of an effective curriculum vita to achieving a satisfying balance between professional work and personal life. Students who have participated in the program in the past have given it high marks for being fun, exciting and beneficial to their career development.
