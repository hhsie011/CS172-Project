The goals of the Applied Mathematics Departmental Undergraduate Group (AMDUG) are to bring together Brown students who have a common interest in Applied Mathematics. The goal of the AMDUG is to share resources and talent, develop relationships with faculty and each other, and organize lectures and inspiring events. Since Applied Mathematics is inherently cross disciplinary, the AMDUG welcomes students from all concentrations which involve some aspect of a mathematical nature. It is hoped that by developing and nurturing a vibrant community of students with diverse interests, unified by mathematics, the Brown undergraduate experience will be made much richer and more fulfilling. AMDUG event (Friday 3/18/22 4-5:30pm) Come join the AMDUG (Applied Mathematics DUG) for our kickoff mixer! Meet faculty and current and prospective students in APMA, and enjoy some Kabob and Curry on us :) The event will take place Friday, 3/18 at 4pm on the lawn in front of 170 Hope St., and food will be provided in room 108. Hope to see you all there! AMDUG is also looking for a leadership board for the 22-23 academic year.
