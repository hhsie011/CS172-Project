Who May Borrow? Iowa State University Libraries are open to the public and all collections (print and electronic) may be used freely on-site. Patrons wishing to borrow physical items from the library, however, must have a valid ISUCard, ISU Library Visitor Card, or a valid official ID from a participating TRAC (Two Rivers Alma Collaborative) institution. ISU Students, Faculty, Staff, Affiliates, Retirees, and Spouses obtain an ISUCard from the ISUCard Office in 0530 Beardshear Hall (515-294-2727). While Alumni and Visitors obtain their card by coming to the Main Desk at 102 Parks Library and filling out an application (515-294-3961, email circdesk@iastate.edu). ISU Distance Learning students might not receive a physical ISUCard but do receive credentials required for remote access to library resources.
