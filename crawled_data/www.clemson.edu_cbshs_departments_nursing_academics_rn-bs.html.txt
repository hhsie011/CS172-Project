Social and Health Sciences Academics School of Nursing Degrees Current: RNBS Completion Program RNBS Completion Program Curriculum Progression Prerequisites RNBS Handbook For Out-Of-State Students Academic Program Fee Apply Now The RNBS Completion Track allows registered nurses with an associate degree in nursing to earn a bachelor’s degree in nursing. The RNBS Track is offered in a fully online format only. Students who enroll in a full-time plan of study are able to complete their Bachelor of Science, Major in Nursing degree in 12 months. Part-time plans of study are available to meet the needs of working students. The School of Nursing has established relationships with area technical colleges, which allows for seamless transition for the associate degree prepared registered nurse entering this track. Because these students come to the track as licensed, experienced registered nurses, the RNBS Track focuses on socializing the RN to the role of the baccalaureate prepared nurse, emphasizing the values of ethical decision making, intellectual curiosity, critical thinking and interdisciplinary collegiality. The curriculum expands the RNs’ current knowledge base, including courses in professionalism in nursing, community and family nursing, health care genetics, leadership and management in nursing, and research in nursing. Students are admitted to the track in fall and spring semesters of each year. Objectives Upon completion of the track students will be able to: Use communication skills to interact effectively and appropriately with individuals, families, groups in the community, and other members of the health care team. Demonstrate personal and professional responsibility and accountability for personal nursing practice in accordance with the highest standards and codes of the profession. Use critical thinking to provide community based professional nursing care for diverse populations across the life span in multiple settings. Employ leadership and management skills and knowledge of health policy to enhance the quality of nursing care. Program Delivery The RNBS Completion Track program is fully online Classes are offered in a fully online format. Orientation day on Clemson University campus in Clemson is required prior to beginning classes.
