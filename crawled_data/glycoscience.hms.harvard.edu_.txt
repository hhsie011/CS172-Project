The Co-Directors are Dr. Richard D. Cummings and Dr. Robert Sackstein. Dr. Cummings was recruited to the Department of Surgery at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) from Emory University School of Medicine, where he was Chair of the Department of Biochemistry. Dr. Cummings is the Director of the National Center for Functional Glycomics (NCFG) and is the Chair of the Consortium for Functional Glycomics, a worldwide group of over 600 principal investigators exploring glycoconjugate functions. He is an expert in the field of Glycosciences and Glycomics, with a main focus on biological interactions with glycans. Dr. Sackstein is an a basic scientist and clinician whose work has been instrumental in understanding the molecular mechanisms of carbohydrates in human biology and disease, and in particular, in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). His work is focused on utilizing structural information for the rational design of drugs that disrupt key adhesion molecules in tumor cell growth and metastasis, and of agents/technologies that may improve immune effector cell infiltration of tumor tissue. News Dr. Richard D. Cummings (Director of the NCFG and the HMS Center for Glycoscience) receives 2019 IGO Award Dr. Richard D. Cummings receives the 2019 IGO Award from the International Glycoconjugate Organization for his exceptional contributions to the field of glycobiology.
