The Ministry of Health’s National AIDS and STI Control Program is committed to expanding training facilities that provide antiretroviral therapy (ART) services such as differentiated testing, linkage, differentiated ART delivery, retention in care, and viral load monitoring to strengthen service delivery through the whole cascade of HIV care. Ghana looks forward to learning from other countries that are implementing DSD in similar settings, especially when it comes to managing national aids policy.
