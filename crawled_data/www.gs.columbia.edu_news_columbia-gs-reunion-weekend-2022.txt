Enjoy conversations, updates, and performances that are open to all. May 27, 2022 Related Content Register for Reunion Alumni Gather Virtually for Reunion 2021 Support GS Students The weekend begins on Thursday, June 9 with an exclusive screening of Calendar Girl, a documentary executive produced by GS alumna Kikka Hanazawa '00 that tells the story of Ruth Finley, a woman who became the queen of the fashion industry in the 1930s while she was a young mother by creating the iconic pink Fashion Calendar, a publication that continues to influence fashion today. After the screening, join your fellow GSers at Mel's Burger Bar for an informal get-together with food, drinks, and GS swag giveaways. On Friday, enjoy a late start to the day and join us for our Afternoon Tea Party, where you will again have the chance to mingle with fellow alumni and students while enjoying refreshments and hors d'oeuvres. Or, if you're a recent graduate, please join us for a special reception that will include a celebratory toast and officially welcome you to the GS and Columbia alumni communities. The evening concludes with a popular annual event open to all, A Celebration of the Performing Arts at Columbia, which will feature student performances and a conversation with Alicia Graf Mack '03, Dean and Director of Dance at The Juilliard School, and Michael Novak '09, Artistic Director of the Paul Taylor Dance Company. Saturday kicks off with a special champagne breakfast celebrating anniversary class years, and all alumni are welcome. Then, join us for a sit-down lunch where you'll hear from current GS students about their experiences and meet the amazing members of our Office of Development and Alumni Relations. The afternoon continues with a fascinating lecture by alumnus Steve Brozak '82, Managing Partner and CEO of WBB, a boutique investment bank and financial research firm specializing in biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and medical device companies. He'll delve into the COVID-19 pandemic and what might come next, offering unique insights based on his experience in the healthcare field. After the lecture, GS is hosting a reception for veteran alumni and students, where attendees will have the opportunity to connect while learning about the University's support for veterans, and in particular, the Center for Veteran Transition and Integration. All are welcome to attend. Next, alumni and students from our Dual and Joint Degree Programs, as well as from our Postbac Premed Program, are each invited to join their peers for a reception where we will celebrate the unique natures of these groundbreaking programs. Lastly, don't miss the biggest GS alumni event of the year—the annual Reunion Dinner. At this special event, attendees will hear from Dean Rosen-Metsch, and the Owl Award will be presented to this year’s recipient. Following dinner, join alumni from all schools at the Starlight Reception on Low Plaza. To learn more and register, visit the Reunion Weekend page on the GS website. We hope to see you there!
