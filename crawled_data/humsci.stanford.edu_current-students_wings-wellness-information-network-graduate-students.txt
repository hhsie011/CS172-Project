WINGS (Wellness Information Network for Graduate Students) is a collaboration between the H&S Office of Graduate & Undergraduate Studies and doctoral students in the School of Humanities and Sciences (H&S). What started as a limited pilot in 2016-17 has now expanded to include all H&S doctoral programs that wish to participate. Conceived of by our graduate students, the motivation for WINGS is the belief that health and wellness are vital foundations for student academic success. WINGS objectives are to reinforce the importance of well-being and wellness promote campus wellness resources reduce stigma and misconceptions surrounding mental health by normalizing stress, the need for coping skills, and help-seeking Each year, H&S doctoral programs are invited to identify a graduate student wellness representative (aka WINGer). Functioning as local-level information resources, student representatives leverage their relationships and peer network and work within their program’s pre-existing structures to meet the above objectives. WINGers are not peer advisors or counselors. There is no required commitment of time associated with WINGS. This is a voluntary activity, and each student representative determines how they wish to interpret the role. In recognition of their commitment, each WINGer will receive a small stipend for the year. Students interested in being a WINGer should reach out to the current WINGer in their program to learn more. Doctoral programs are asked to support local WINGS activities; this might include providing snacks for meetings or a workshop or helping to identify space for meetings. We also ask that faculty and staff be open to feedback provided by WINGers as it relates to student wellness and well-being.
