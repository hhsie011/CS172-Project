How can I determine if a course I want to take elsewhere is equivalent to a Baylor course? Course equivalencies can be found using the Equivalent Course Tool. 2. When will I know how my credits transfer to Baylor? Undergraduate Admissions will review your coursework after you have been accepted to Baylor. A Transfer Credit Evaluation will be posted in your goBAYLOR account once the review is completed. 3. If a course I intend to take IS found using the Equivalent Course Tool (ECT), do I need to submit an Equivalent Course Request (ECR) in order to take the course? No. Once you have found the course you intend to take using the Equivalent Course Tool, you should use the print feature to print a copy of the equivalency for your records. Before enrolling in the course, however, you need to make sure that you have read all transfer credit policies carefully to ensure that you are eligible to complete any additional transfer courses. 4. What do I do if a course I want to take is NOT found using the Equivalent Course Tool? If the course you want to take does not appear, the course will be evaluated once we receive an official college transcript. 5. Does Baylor accept online courses? Courses taught electronically or in hybrid (meaning partly electronic or partly face-to-face) format are acceptable provided that they meet all other expectations with regard to the course characteristics used to determine equivalencies. 6. How does Baylor determine which courses are equivalent? Equivalent courses are determined by department chairs based upon the following course characteristics: course description, textbook, course objectives, assignments, number of credit hours, course prerequisites and program quality (determined based on a process designed by Institutional Research and Testing in consultation with the relevant department chair and the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education). Courses found using the Equivalent Course Tool have already been determined as equivalent. 7. One of the course characteristics used to determine course equivalencies is program quality. How is that determined? Program quality is determined based on a process designed by Baylor's Institutional Research and Testing (IRT) department in consultation with department chairs and the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education. The process tracks how students perform in subsequent courses when they have completed prerequisite courses elsewhere and then transferred them to Baylor. In most cases, the process is initiated by department chairs who wish to see how students transferring prerequisite courses from a particular institution are performing in subsequent courses at Baylor. 8. When I click on the link for the Equivalent Course Tool, my browser keeps spinning and nothing comes up. Is there something wrong with the Equivalent Course Tool? No. If this occurs, the problem is with the browser that you are using, not with the Equivalent Course Tool. If you experience this problem, you need to clear the history in your browser, including the "cookies." Once you have cleared the history and all cookies (which will empty the cache), restart the browser and try the Equivalent Course Tool again. That should fix the problem. If you are using Mozilla Firefox or Internet Explorer as your browser, switching to Safari or Google Chrome may fix the problem as well. If you experience further difficulties, contact the Baylor HELP desk at (254) 710-HELP (4357). 9. The transfer credit policies use the terms "pre-matriculation" and "post-matriculation." What is the difference? Pre-matriculation means before enrolling as an official Baylor student. Post-matriculation means after a student has officially enrolled at Baylor. A student's matriculation date is the date they begin coursework at Baylor. 10. Can I earn credit by exam at Baylor? The office to contact at Baylor regarding credit by exam originally earned at another institution is Student Testing Services at (254) 710-2061.
