June 08, 2017 Provost John H. Coatsworth has announced the fifth round of grants from the President’s Global Innovation Fund (PGIF) on June 1, 2017. 11 projects received awards this year after being selected by a review committee of senior faculty drawn from both the Morningside and medical campuses.The projects all make use of the network of Columbia Global Centers and provide opportunities for faculty and students to address pressing global issues. Projects that received awards focus on a diverse array of topics, ranging from religion and populism to wildfires and deforestation to urban poverty. Many are highly collaborative, with faculty members working across University departments and schools, and partnering with other academic institutions, non-governmental organizations, and research consortia. The following projects involve the Amman Center: Religion & the Rise of Populisms: Difference, Dissent, and Tolerance – Katherine Ewing Mental Health and the Psychological Impact of War on Individuals, Families, and Communities in Yemen: A Project to Advance Research, Services, and Advocacy –Sarah Knuckey and Lindsay B. Stark Review a full list of funded projects The purpose of the PGIF is to support faculty who are developing projects that increase opportunities for research, teaching, and service around the world. A total of 61 projects have been supported through the President’s Global Innovation Fund in the past 4 rounds of grants. Together, these and future projects will play an essential role in realizing the potential of the Columbia Global Centers to create new opportunities for faculty and students, and defining what it means for Columbia to explore new channels of knowledge in the 21st century.
