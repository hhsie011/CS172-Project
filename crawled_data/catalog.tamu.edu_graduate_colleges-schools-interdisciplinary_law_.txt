The legal system, as such, touches every aspect of our lives. At their best, lawyers serve as advisors and advocates in managing their clients’ business and personal affairs, minimizing complications and avoiding unintended consequences, facilitating desired transactions, and resolving conflicts and disputes that inevitably arise. At Texas A&M School of Law, our innovative JD program offers students a firm grounding in the substance of the law, even while emphasizing the increasingly complex range of real-world skills that are necessary for legal practice and effective leadership in the global community today. Texas A&M’s graduate law degrees – its Master of Legal Studies (MLS) and Master of Laws (LLM) – offers students carefully designed and rigorous classroom and online educational experiences, experiential learning opportunities, research and writing skills, and a wide range of professional development and networking opportunities designed to prepare students for success in their chosen profession. Texas A&M School of Law offers opportunities for combination JD/MPH and JD/MMAL degrees, and dual JD/MBA and JD/MST degrees. Additionally, undergraduate students at Texas A&M University and certain other institutional partners may apply for the School of Law’s early admission program, under which qualifying students may begin the JD program after completing 75% of the credit hours required for their undergraduate degree. A student admitted into this program may apply up to 30 credit hours of JD coursework towards the requirements for completion of their undergraduate degree, with the approval of the participating undergraduate department or program.
