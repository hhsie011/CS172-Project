Summer Research Institute 2019 Beckman Scholars The Beckman Scholar Award is awarded to one or more students in select science majors per year. Recipients work with a mentor over two summers and the academic year on a scientific research project and attend a conference in their field. Clare Boothe Luce Scholars The Clare Boothe Luce Scholars Program provides students with computational research opportunities in the physical sciences, pure and applied mathematics, and computer science. Scholars receive stipends for research work conducted over the summer and the following academic year, as well as support for materials, equipment, and conference fees. Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellowship The Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellowship (MMUF) program supports students with a demonstrated commitment to racial diversity in their pursuit of academic careers. Scholars of Distinction The Barbara Silver Horowitz ’55 Scholars of Distinction Program was established to help educate extraordinary young women bound for achievement. Selected during the admissions process, these students have a unique four-year scholarly experience, with the opportunity to work with faculty mentors, attend research talks, and pursue a research project on a topic of personal interest. Science Fellows Science Fellows help students get to the heart of what they want to communicate about their scientific research. Science Pathways Scholars Program (SP)² This program offers support for Black, Native American, Latina, and first-generation college students who wish to pursue a scientific major. Summer Research Institute (SRI) SRI is for Barnard students who want to conduct scientific research during the summer, working either with on- and off-campus faculty or with researchers at partner institutions throughout the city. Students’ research experiences are supplemented with academic and real-world skill-building experiences, lectures, social events, and a capstone poster event at the end of the summer. Additional Resources In addition to the on-campus programs listed here, the Dean of Studies and Beyond Barnard provide information and assistance on applying for externally administered or postgraduate fellowships. Department websites are also excellent resources for research opportunities. Students in the Field “Barnard provided me an outlet to freely explore my passions. Because I’ve held on to the sense of confidence and purpose Barnard instilled in me, I decided to pursue my wildest dreams and make the jump from neuroscientist to biotech entrepreneur.” —Jennifer Perusini ’10 “The Department of Biology has provided countless opportunities to explore my field of interest and delve into more independent investigation, through Guided Research & Seminar and hands-on courses like Lab in Physiology.” —Alice Sardarian ’21 “Since I stepped foot on Barnard’s campus, I was encouraged to pursue my inquisitive nature. In all my classes, science or not, I was taught to speak up and ask questions. As a Beckman Scholar, I utilized these questioning skills to delve deeper into my research and advance science.” —Rachel Nordlicht ’20 Site Footer Footer About the College Back Offices & Services Back Communications Back Contacts Email Signatures Copyright and Image Use Design and Production Digital Signs Faculty Working with the Media Media Relations Social Media Guidelines Templates Writing/Messaging Purchasing Back Citizens Bank MasterCard Purchasing Procedures & Forms Ombuds Office Back About the Ombuds Finance & Operations Mail Services Back Addressing Incoming Mail Breaks, Leaves & Graduation Incoming Mail Local Mail Outgoing Mail Outgoing Mail Privacy Policy Prohibited Items Receiving Your Mail and Packages Printing at Barnard Human Resources Back About HR Benefits Compensation Employment Opportunities at Barnard Employment Diversity and Inclusion Policies News and Announcements Accounts Payable Bursar Back Tuition & Fees Policies Understanding your Bill Payment Options Tuition Refunds Perkins Loan Information 1098-T Tax Credits Tuition-related forms Facilities Back Service Information Job Opportunities Visit Back Directions Campus Map Local Resources Back Parking Restaurants Accommodations Diversity & Inclusion Nondiscrimination & Title IX Privacy Policy Copyright © 2022 Barnard College | Columbia University | 3009 Broadway, New York, NY 10027 | 212.854.5262
