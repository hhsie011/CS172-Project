1:30 PM Online, Columbia Global Centers | Tunis, Columbia Global Centers | Nairobi Registration link: http://bitly.ws/ofiW In partnership with the African Development Group at Columbia University and the Columbia Alumni Association, Columbia Global Centers | Tunis and Columbia Global Centers | Nairobi are organizing this webinar to expose Columbia students and affiliates to possible careers on the continent through direct interaction with Columbia alumni who are working in those careers. Many Columbia students and affiliates are interested in working on the African continent but do not know where to begin. Since many Columbia alumni already work on the continent working in governments, international organizations, companies, and NGOs, their expertise could benefit many of our members seeking to work on the continent in various capacities. Bridging the gap between the African diaspora and those working to solve the continent's challenges is one of the main goals of the African Development Group, and this event would allow Columbia students to see where they could be after graduation. Learning from alumni is essential to determining paths after college because they went through many of the same challenges we are now in determining what to do after graduation what programs to apply for, among many other issues. The relationships developed in these interactions could be invaluable to our future. At the end of the webinar, Columbia students and affiliates will leave with a concrete understanding of where they could end up after graduation and the paths to follow to get there. They will also have the added asset of the contact information of alumni working in influential positions on the African continent. Careers can be very overwhelming, but the goal of this event is to bring the challenge down to the personal level. These personal interactions will give students a better idea of life after college and hopefully make the prospect less scary. Link to the Facebook Event.
