While mainstream mass media continues to largely follow the framing and terminology that have been firmly established for decades, a new tone that is sympathetic toward the plight of Palestinians has been emerging. This is even more noticeable in online media, where there has been an unprecedented outpouring of sentiment expressed across social media platforms. This virtual webinar invites experts to explore the shifts and future trends in the media landscape, with special reference to reporting on Palestine and Israel. Panelists will discuss the intersection of the local and international political landscape with mainstream media, alternative media, and citizen journalism. The way news is framed and consumed has evolved significantly, due in part to the availability of digital technologies and enhanced global digital literacy that can amplify protest movements and communities of solidarity.
