Hubs are strategically placed, concentrated pockets of Cornell engagement that connect the entire university with strong international peer institutions and their communities, countries, and regions. No two Hubs are identical, but all share Cornell’s academic distinction, educational verve, and civic responsibility—under the umbrella of One Cornell. Global Hubs Salon Series This spring, the Mario Einaudi Center for International Studies hosted a series of eight interdisciplinary Global Hubs salons on a variety of research themes representing cross-college strengths at Cornell and our Hubs partners. The salons featured Cornell faculty hosts in conversation with faculty representing partner institutions. Listen to the conversations Hub Locations Partnerships with institutions in Australia, China, Ecuador, Ghana, India, Mexico, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, United Kingdom, and Zambia are in process and additional partnerships in Denmark, Morocco, and Turkey are being investigated. Hub partnerships are based on geographic diversity, the institution's reputation, faculty interest and collaborations, potential opportunities for our students, and the reciprocal interest of the partner. Why Hubs? Global Hubs create more diverse, long-term opportunities and support for students and faculty to study, research, teach, and engage around the world by providing institutional connections in key locations. Global Hubs supplement—not replace—existing or future faculty and college activities. This university-level initiative does not interfere with college-specific exchanges or collaborations. Hubs complement and, where appropriate, augment colleges’ work. Hubs enable more students and faculty to go abroad to geographically diverse locations by lowering barriers to access quality semester-long and short-term programs, including learning and research opportunities embedded with local partners and communities. Global Hubs coordinate Cornell’s presence in these places, bringing students and faculty together with partners, prospective students, and alumni.
