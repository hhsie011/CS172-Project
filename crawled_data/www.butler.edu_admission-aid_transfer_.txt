We love transfer students at Butler. Because at this point in your college career, you know exactly what you’re looking for. And you’re willing to put in the work to get it. In fact, that’s a pretty good description of a lot of the people you’ll meet here: focused, ready to work, and not put off by doing something challenging—especially when the rewards are there for the taking. We know that transferring means extra work for you, and we want to make it as simple as possible. Applying as a Transfer Student To submit a transfer application, you must have already completed 12 or more credit hours of college coursework at a regionally accredited university after graduating high school, or be seeking a second bachelor’s degree.
