CARE counselors are located within the colleges they serve. They are licensed mental health professionals and work with students who have been referred by faculty and staff. CARE’s primary mission is to provide access to mental health support for students who are struggling emotionally and/or academically. Our presence normalizes the counseling process and makes us readily available for services. We decrease barriers by assisting students in a location that is familiar and convenient for them.
