This year's Forum series focuses on a pressing pedagogical need: how we can best support our international students. Drawing on both student and faculty expertise, this series features five topics delivered through five face-to-face sessions, each followed by an extended discussion online (see attached announcement for details). Adjunct instructors are welcome; please pass on this message.
