Keeping TTU and the state of Texas at the heart of the design with the inscription Alumni translated from English to Spanish, Alumnos, to show pride as alumni and our culture. The banner with the inscription, DESDE AQUI, ES POSIBLE, is the translation of From Here, It's Possible to represent the possibilities that our community achieved and will continue excelling by earning a degree from TTU. Congratulations, on your upcoming graduation! For the past twenty-three years, the Raiders Rojos Alumni Network, has hosted the Hispanic Graduation Convocation to celebrate this accomplishment. May and August 2022 graduates must REGISTER HERE for the 6:30 p.m. event on Thursday, May 12, 2022 at the McKenzie-Merket Alumni Center. Registration will close once the capacity for the facility is reached. Due to limited seating, please keep guests to no more than two. Thank you for observing this request. Looking out at that crowd, I imagined those who had not yet arrived, minority students who, in years to come, would make this multitude of faces, the view from where I now stood, a little more various. If they could have heard me, I would have confided in them: As you discover what strength you can draw from your community in this world from which it stands apart, look outward as well as inward. Build bridges instead of walls.― Sonia Sotomayor, My Beloved World Division of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Like Division of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion on FacebookLike Division of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion on Facebook Follow Division of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion on twitterFollow Division of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion on twitter Subscribe to Division of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion on YouTubeSubscribe to Division of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion on YouTube Follow Division of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion on InstagramFollow Division of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion on Instagram Address P.O.
