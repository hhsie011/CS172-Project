Here are some simple guidelines to do so in the best way possible. Begin with “BC” or “Boston College” when creating a name for your Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or other social media account to make it easy to search. Maintain consistency as much as possible across your platforms. (e.g. "BostonCollege" is used on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter) Use the icons provided by the BC social media team as your account profile images (avatars).  Never use the Boston College seal or the BC Athletics logo as your profile image. Use the images provided as your background or cover image. If you would like to choose your own, make sure it is sized correctly and you have permission to do so.  Photos work best due to various screen sizes (versus graphics with text). Use related or complementary elements and colors throughout the rest of your profile for a more polished feel.  (This is not mandatory but recommended.) More on the BC colors. Thinking about a new social media channel? Contact Us. Email social@bc.edu Social Media Icons It is important to stay consistent over time and across platforms. This will help your followers easily identify you over time. The use of the official BC profile images provided to you also ensures that followers and potential new audiences know you represent an official BC account. Schools & Colleges To make it easy for the BC community to identify the Boston College schools that maintain social media channels and to ensure brand consistency, these accounts should always display the college's official social media avatars given to you by the OUC social media team. The avatar consists the name of the college underneath the BC seal in the college’s colors of maroon and gold. No other groups should use this avatar. Academic Departments & Student Life To ensure all Boston College academic and administrative departments’ social media channels are easily identifiable and have a cohesive look, the avatars are the same maroon and gold color but use the Boston College wordmark with the department name underneath. Institutional Departments & Centers Boston College’s institutional department, centers, and other official accounts are identified with a maroon and gold color scheme and a large BC watermark. The use of an eagle icon with the name of each department or center signifies it is an official BC account.
