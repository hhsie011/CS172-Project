It’s the point of origin for the nation’s public policy. The home base for some of the most powerful men and women in the country. And a magnet for world attention. It’s also home to a thriving Syracuse University presence. Whether you’re a Syracuse University alum, a prospective student, a friend, or a fan, we hope you’ll find ways to engage with the Orange by attending professional and social events and activities in the region. Some Facts and Figures The greater Washington area has the University’s second-largest alumni base in the world—nearly 15,000 alums and counting. The Syracuse University schools and colleges with the greatest number of DC-area alumni are the College of Arts and Sciences (3,960) and the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs (1,479). About 500 accepted students per year move from the greater Washington area to Syracuse, New York.

Syracuse University undergraduate and graduate students can take part in a number of DC-based programs offered by the College of Law, the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications, and the College of Visual and Performing Arts, as well as interdisciplinary programs that cross disciplinary boundaries. In 2013, Syracuse University's Maxwell School launched a far-reaching collaboration with the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). CSIS’s world-class facility provides space for Maxwell-in-Washington programs, houses staff and visiting faculty from Syracuse, and provides enhanced opportunities to conduct symposia, workshops, meetings, and expanded executive education programs.
