Our faculty represents a broad range of topics and approaches, with particular strengths in early modern and colonial literature, modern and contemporary Latin American narrative, poetry and transatlantic studies. Class sizes are kept small, to ensure close interaction between students and faculty during the five years of the program, and students receive careful guidance on individual plans of study, professional issues, and job placement. Additional Resources We encourage our students to take advantage of the many opportunities for disciplinary exchange and collaborations that characterize intellectual life at Brown, especially through the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies, the Cogut Institute for the Humanities, the Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women, and the Program for Renaissance and Early Modern Studies. Excellent general scholarly resources are available through the David Rockefeller Library, while the John Carter Brown and Hay libraries contain extraordinary holdings in special materials. Finally, our students also have the opportunity to take courses at neighboring institutions such as Harvard and Yale, or to study abroad at the Universidad de Salamanca.
