Read analytically. Communicate confidently. The Department of English at Clemson University focuses on the analysis, creation and history of textual production in its various formats. At every level, our students leave their coursework having analyzed and created a wide range of textual representations from an informed historical and international perspective. We believe that in the process our students imagine new possibilities for themselves and for the world around them, and that they will go on to represent these new possibilities in a variety of career and citizenship settings.
