As silicon technology marches on towards ultimately scaled devices, we are pursuing alternative technologies based on either different physical mechanisms (such as tunneling or hot-electron effects), different materials (Ge, III-V materials, amorphous conducting oxides), and different geometries (nanowires, quantum dots, ultrathin SOI) that could provide added functionality. Current projects include: Tunneling and band-modulation devices in SOI (collaboration with INPG/Minatec and Fudan University) Quantum dot photodetectors (with Pacifici lab at Brown and NIST) Amorphous indium-zinc-oxide and copper-iodide devices (with Paine lab at Brown) Nitride hot electron and tunneling transistors (with MIT Lincoln Laboratory) Cryo-CMOS and transistor-based biosensors (with NIST) In the past our group worked in other areas, including: Noise-immune ultimate CMOS design (with Bahar lab then at Brown) Si and SiGe nanowire tunneling transistors (collaboration with LANL) Carbon nanotube devices (with Xu lab at Brown) Flexible metal interconnects (with Crawford lab then at Brown) Resonant tunneling in 2DEG and Si/Ge (with IBM Yorktown and Goldman lab at Stony Brook) Students graduating from the Zaslavsky laboratory -- our most significant product by far -- are well-equipped for future semiconductor R&D by acquiring a full skill set, from device fabrication to characterization and modeling. They have moved on to a range of semiconductor companies (from Micron to Applied Materials, to GlobalFoundries, to Synopsys), government labs (from NIST to CNRS to Paul Scherrer Institute), and major industrial companies (EMC and Apple). Latest news and publication highlights Elahe Rezaei completes her post-doc and moves to Qualcomm Technologies in San Diego (Dec. 2019). Sue Shi graduates with ScM in Electrical Engineering (May 2021). A 2021 APL paper on capacitorless one-transistor cryomemory was chosen as an AIP Scilight.
