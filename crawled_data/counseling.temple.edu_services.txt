Past groups have included an alcohol/substance use risk reduction group and an ACOA group. For a list of our current group offerings and descriptions, please go to http://counseling.temple.edu/group-counseling Psychiatric/Medication Services For some students, the use of medications can assist in the recovery process. Our psychiatrists are available to evaluate students for the use of medication such as buprenorphine (Suboxone, Zubsolv), naltrexone (Vivitrol), acamprosate (Campral) and other medications approved to assist in recovery. A psychiatric evaluation may also be useful for students who have psychiatric symptoms. Co-occurring psychiatric disorders are common in students with substance use disorders. A psychiatric evaluation can help determine if symptoms are related to the substance use or another psychiatric disorder. In cases of psychiatric disorders, psychiatrists can discuss medication options with the student. In those discussions, the student's recovery is always taken into consideration and medications with abuse potential (e.g. benzodiazepines, hypnotics) are avoided. Individual Psychoeducational Sessions (i.e., the Track 3 session) These sessions are specifically for students who have violated Templeâ€™s Student Code of Conduct and who have been asked to complete a Track 3 psychoeducational session with a counselor in the CASA unit. Consultation/Referral Services Consultation and referral coordination are provided to individuals in need of treatment that is beyond the scope of what is available at TCS. Potential referrals may include those to other departments within the University, outside agencies/organizations, sober-living environments, and support groups that meet off campus (e.g., AA, NA, ACOA, OA, and GA).
