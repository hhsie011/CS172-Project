The Financial Aid Office determines students eligiblity to receive a TEACH Grant. Learn more about the TEACH Grant eligibility and process or view the TEACH Grant Fact Sheet. As a condition for receiving a TEACH Grant, you must sign a TEACH Grant Agreement to Serve in which you agree to (among other requirements) teach in a high-need field at an elementary school, secondary school, or educational service agency that serves students from low-income families for at least four complete academic years within eight years after completing (or ceasing enrollment in) the course of study for which you received the grant. IMPORTANT: 1. If you do not complete your service obligation, all TEACH Grant funds you received will be converted to a Direct Unsubsidized Loan. You must then repay this loan to the U.S. Department of Education, with interest charged from the date the TEACH Grant was disbursed (paid to you or on your behalf). 2. You must certify the completion of your service commitment on an annual basis. If you have accepted a TEACH Grant, the Loan Office will send you detailed instructions about completing the Agreement to Serve and counseling requirements.
