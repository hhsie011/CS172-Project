The department provides linguistic preparation in Spanish, Portuguese, and Catalan, and offers a flexible program to study manifestations of the Hispanic and Lusophone worlds in all historical periods—from the medieval to the globalized present—and in a variety of cultural contexts: the Iberian Peninsula, Latin America, the former colonies of Portugal, and the United States. Students can enter the program at any level of linguistic and cultural preparedness. The department offers a placement exam to determine the level at which students may either begin or continue study. Majors and concentrators in Hispanic studies and Portuguese studies are typically double majors who bring insights and methods from fields such as history, political science, women's studies, anthropology, economics, Latino studies, Latin American studies, etc., which fosters engaging discussions. Academic Programs The department offers two majors. The major in Hispanic studies gives students a well-rounded preparation in the history and culture of the Hispanic world. The second option, a major in Hispanic studies with specialization, allows students to study the Hispanic world through a number of fields, among them Latin American studies, gender studies, political science, economics, history, and sociology. The department also offers two concentrations: Hispanic studies and Portuguese studies. The language and major programs have also been designed in close consultation and cooperation with Barnard's Department of Spanish and Latin American Cultures. All courses taken in one program may be used to fulfill the requirements of the other. Hence, Columbia and Barnard students may move freely between departments of both institutions for courses that best fit their intellectual interests and schedules. Advanced Placement The department grants 3 credits for a score of 5 on the AP Spanish Language exam, which satisfies the foreign language requirement. Credit is awarded upon successful completion of a 3300-level (or higher) course with a grade of B or higher. This course must be for at least 3 points of credit and be taught in Spanish. Courses taught in English may not be used for language AP credit. The department grants 0 credits for a score of 4 on the AP Spanish Language exam, but the foreign language requirement is satisfied. The department grants 3 credits for a score of 5 on the AP Spanish Literature exam, which satisfies the foreign language requirement. Credit is awarded upon successful completion of a 3300-level (or higher) course with a grade of B or higher. This course must be for at least 3 points of credit and be taught in Spanish. Courses taught in English may not be used for language AP credit. The department grants 0 credits for a score of 4 on the AP Spanish Literature exam, but the foreign language requirement is satisfied. Study Abroad The department strongly recommends that all Hispanic and Portuguese studies majors/concentrators study abroad. Most courses taken abroad can be used to fulfill the requirements for the major and concentration, and with adequate planning, even some of the requirements for a second major or concentration. A maximum of four (4) courses taken abroad may be applied to the major, and a maximum of three (3) to the concentration in Hispanic or Portuguese studies. All students are strongly advised to take either SPAN UN3349 Hispanic Cultures I: Islamic Spain through the Colonial Period or SPAN UN3350 Hispanic Cultures II: Enlightenment to the Present before studying abroad. Actual or potential majors and concentrators in Hispanic or Portuguese studies should seek tentative approval of their programs from the director of undergraduate studies before their departure. The Hispanic Institute The department hosts the Hispanic Institute at Columbia. Founded in 1920 as the Instituto de las Españas, the Institute sponsors and disseminates research on Hispanic and Luso-Brazilian culture. Since 1934, the Institute has published the Revista Hispánica Moderna, a distinguished journal in Hispanic criticism and theory. In Fulfillment of the Language Requirement For students with no knowledge of Spanish, Portuguese, or Catalan, at least four terms of the language are required: UN1101-UN1102 (or UN1120) and UN2101-UN2102 (or UN2120). All courses must be taken for a letter grade to fulfill the language requirement. Students with prior knowledge of Spanish who plan to continue studying Spanish are required to take the department’s on-line placement examination before registering for courses. Students with prior knowledge of Portuguese or Catalan should speak with the director of language programs. Students may be exempted from the language requirement in one of four ways: Present a score of 4 or 5 on the AP Spanish Language or Spanish Literature Exams. Students who receive a score of 5 in either exam are awarded 3 AP credits upon successful completion of a 3300-level (or above) course with a grade of B or higher. AP credit is not granted for a score of 4. Present a score of 780 or above on the SAT Subject Test. Students with a score lower than 780 should take the department's on-line placement exam and follow the placement advice received. Present a score of a 7, 6, or 5 on the International Baccalaureate Higher Level Exam in Spanish. Obtain a score of 625 or higher in the department's on-line placement exam. If the score in the on-line test qualifies a student for exemption from the language requirement, they are required to take a written version of the placement exam during orientation (for entering students) or during the semester (for continuing students). This written exam is offered every year on the Thursday before the beginning of classes in the fall semester from 10:00 a.m.- 2:00 p.m. in Room 352 of the International Affairs Building (the Language Resource Center Computer Lab). Students do not need to make an appointment to take the exam. Departmental Honors Beginning in Spring 2015, the department put in place a new timeline and training program for juniors, to assist students with planning and completing the Honors Thesis during their senior year. The Honors Thesis is an excellent option for any student interested in pursuing a Master's degree or Ph.D.; but, above all, it is a highly formative research and writing experience—one that can bear unexpected fruits toward any path the student decides to take in the future. All students pursuing a major through the department may apply to write an Honors Thesis. The department envisions the thesis as an intellectually challenging and rewarding experience that crowns four years of undergraduate studies with an original contribution in the field chosen by the student. The department supports students in shaping their research topic and provides frequent advising throughout the research and writing process. The timeline is as follows: During the junior year, students take into consideration the possibility of writing an Honors Thesis in the following year. The topic of the Honors Thesis may likely originate in an advanced course taken during the junior year; students may also choose to develop ideas discussed or papers written in courses taken in previous years. Juniors schedule a meeting (or, if the student is studying abroad, a Skype conversation) with the director of undergraduate studies to discuss their proposed topic and faculty adviser. By May 15, juniors who have decided to write an Honors Thesis in their senior year send a formal proposal to the director of undergraduate studies, which includes: A title and a one-page abstract; The name of the proposed faculty adviser; An application for departmental partial funding support (for those who would like to pursue research during the summer). By May 30, the Honors Thesis committee reviews the proposals and informs the students of its decision. In the fall of the senior year: Seniors selected to write the Honors Thesis enroll in a Supervised Individual Research section (SPAN UN3997 or SPAN UN3998) with their faculty adviser and write the Honors Thesis during the entire senior year under the direction of their adviser. For the purposes of the major, this independent study counts as a 3-point course towards elective courses. Faculty advisers organize Honors Thesis Workshops to discuss students' ongoing projects and provide advising on research tools, methodological and theoretical frames, and overall writing process. In the fall of the senior year, students enroll in a Senior Seminar. By April 15 of the senior year, students complete and submit a PDF of the Honors Thesis via email for consideration towards departmental honors and prizes. To be considered for departmental honors, a student must write an Honors Thesis and maintain a GPA of at least 3.6 in major courses. Normally no more than 10% of graduating majors receive departmental honors in a given academic year. Undergraduate Prizes The faculty awards an undergraduate prize every year: Susan Huntington Vernon Prize Established in 1941 by a member of the noted family of New York Hispanophiles, it is given to the Columbia College senior major who has demonstrated excellence in the study of Spanish, Portuguese, and Latin American languages and cultures. Dr. Antonio G. Mier Prize Awarded for excellence in Hispanic Studies to a major degree candidate in the School of General Studies at Columbia University. Professors Carlos J.

Prerequisites: SPAN UN2101 or a score of 380-449 on the Department’s placement examination. This is an intensive course in Spanish language communicative competence with an emphasis on oral interaction, reading, writing, and culture at an Intermediate II level with focus on health-related topics in the Spanish-speaking world. In an increasingly interconnected world, and in multilingual global cities such as New York City, the study of a foreign language is fundamental not only in the field of the humanities but also in the natural sciences. This interdisciplinary course analyzes the intersection between these two disciplines through the study of health-related topics in Iberian and Latin American cultural expressions (literature, film, documentaries, among other sources) in order to explore new critical perspectives across both domains. Students will learn health-related vocabulary and usage-based grammar in Spanish. Students will develop a cultural understanding of medicine, illness, and treatment in the Spanish-speaking world. Finally, students will be able to carry out specific collaborative tasks in Spanish with the aim of integrating language, culture, and health. * This course fulfills the last semester of the foreign language requirement. Therefore, students who have taken SPAN UN 2101 (Intermediate Spanish I), or have a score of 380-449 on the Department’s placement exam, and are interested in health-related topics may proceed and enroll in SPAN UN 2103 (Intermediate Spanish II: Health-Related Topics in the Spanish-Speaking World). Pre-med and pre-health students, as well as those students majoring in the natural sciences—including biology, general chemistry, organic chemistry, biochemistry, and physics—will be given registration priority.

CC/GS/SEAS: Partial Fulfillment of Global Core Requirement This course surveys cultural production of Spain and Spanish America from the eighteenth to the twenty-first centuries. Students will acquire the knowledge needed for the study of the cultural manifestations of the Hispanic world in the context of modernity. Among the issues and events studied will be the Enlightenment as ideology and practice, the Napoleonic invasion of Spain, the wars of Spanish American independence, the fin-de-siècle and the cultural avant-gardes, the wars and revolutions of the twentieth century (Spanish Civil War, the Mexican and Cuban revolutions), neoliberalism, globalization, and the Hispanic presence in the United States. The goal of the course is to study some key moments of this trajectory through the analysis of representative texts, documents, and works of art. Class discussions will seek to situate the works studied within the political and cultural currents and debates of the time. All primary materials, class discussion, and assignments are in Spanish.

From the beginning of the XXth Century some of the key figures of Spanish contemporary culture, writers, filmmakers or architects, had a very close relationship to New York, sometimes as travelers, sometimes living in the city for long periods of time. That transatlantic contact, far from anecdotal, turned into an essential element of the self-understanding of those authors and a crucial presence in their work. The contact with New York modernity would be an unavoidable component in their own versions of modernity but their presence would also leave an important trace in the city. As yet more Spanish cultural travelers got in contact with the city a different phenomenon developed: from the 1950’s, New York would be used as a privileged stage to project a certain institutional idea of Spain, to sell a refurbished image of the nation as sophisticated and modern after decades of international marginalization under Francoism. This course will develop a comparative study of both processes as seen in literary sources, film and architecture (García Lorca, Camba, Dalí, Tápies, Buñuel, Loriga, Sert, Calatrava…) SPAN UN3366 Unseen Things: Fantastic Narratives in Contemporary Spain. 3 points. This course is a survey of Spanish literature and cinema that offers a glimpse to the Spanish canon through the cultural topology of “Fantasy”. By conceiving fantasy as a historically produced—and therefore historically changing—notion, we will travel across five centuries to examine how phenomena associated with the supernatural and the paranormal were understood in their time and how they are understood today. Haunting memories and spaces, ghosts and imaginary representations, supernatural events, monsters, spiritistic practices, and phantasmagorias will parade before our eyes as we try to come up with a comprehensive account for what we could call the “Spanish uneven development”. The discussions over differential temporalities, social and political imaginaries, collective memories, the role of fiction and symbolic representations, and the connection between fantasy and the economic, political, and ideological practices in a determinate social formation will be interrogated in our seminar from different historical vantage points. Readings (most of them by major authors) will be the center of the discussion, whereas visual materials, documentary, art and movies will do their part to illustrate the readings. Several questions will be raised (and hopefully answered) along this journey: How can we explain proliferation of fantastic narratives in Contemporary Spain? And, finally, how can we examine the recent boom and success of Spanish fantastic, supernatural and horror pieces, particularly in film and in the novel? Is there such thing as a “Spanish fantastic” genre? SPAN UN3731 Environment and Citizenship: Cultures of Nature in the Iberian Peninsula. 3 points. This course examines the role of nature and the environment in both contemporary literature and the arts, and attempts to explore a conceptual framework for the definition of environment as a cultural and material production. Environmental peculiarities and historical discontinuities and continuities have created social and political conjunctures in the Iberian Peninsula in which questions concerning nature, space, landscape, and urban and rural experiences have become central to the cultural and the critical imagination in the 20th & 21st Centuries. From the debate over the privatization and erosion of communal rights and the environmental dispossession (and repossession) of the resources to the history of the constructions of nature(s) in literary and cinematic landscapes, the guiding question is how cultural and social practices interfere in the production of what Rob Nixon has called ‘slow violence’, that is, the incremental dynamics of environmental violence that intensify the vulnerability of populations and natural ecosystems. To address this issue, we will not only read a number of novels, essays, poems, short stories and theoretical production, but also engage in the study of artwork and new Iberian democratic experiences, and the development of the cultural environmental studies and ecocriticism in literature and the arts today. The class will be conducted in Spanish and all written assignments will also be in that language.

Prerequisites: Intermediate reading knowledge of Spanish This course considers how language has traditionally shaped constructs of national identity in the Caribbean vis-à-vis the US. By focusing on language ‘crossings’ in Latinx Caribbean cultural production, we critically explore how various sorts of texts–narrative, drama, performance, poetry, animated TV series, and songs–contest conventional notions of mainstream American, US Latinx, and Caribbean discourses of politics and identities. Taking 20th-century social and historical context into account, we will analyze those contemporary styles and uses of language that challenge monolingual and monolithic visions of national and ethnolinguistic identities, examining societal attitudes, cultural imaginaries, and popular assumptions about the Spanish language in the Greater Caribbean and the US. SPAN G4030 Spanish Pragmatics. 4 points. In one sense, Pragmatics is concerned with how we use the language, why and how the speakers communicate in social interactions. The interpretation of meaning in context is probably the main field of study of this multidiscipline, considering the speaker-meaning as the central point of departure. The term Pragmatics refers to a broad perspective on different aspects of communication, including linguistics, but also cognitive psychology, cultural anthropology, philosophy, sociology and rhetoric among others. Through this course we will study chronologically and apply in specific cases of study of the Spanish language the most meaningful pragmatic theories, such as: Context, Deixis, Speech acts, Implicature, Cooperative Principle, Politeness, Relevance, Pragmatic markers, Metaphors and Cross-cultural pragmatics. Pragmatics, as we know, is a most helpful criterion in the interpretation of many different types of texts. As a course within our Department’s curriculum this instrument of rhetoric analysis is a basic tool in the comprehension of our students’ discourse in their literary, cultural, and critical papers. This discipline goes beyond the analysis of strictly forms or verbal utterances, hence its multidisciplinary applicability to a wide range of fields of studies in Spanish. Whichever the student’s field of study might be, Pragmatics provides a valuable and accurate vocabulary that can be applied to any textual interpretation. In this course, the pragmatic perspective is a starting point to delve into the processes of communication in Spanish. After this first approach, the student will gain an insight into new aspects of the linguistics of language use in general and the use of Spanish in particular. CPLS GU4810 Theories of the Subject. 4 points. This seminar will revisit some major texts and concerns in the theoretical humanities that develop genealogical, psychoanalytical or political theories of the subject, roughly from Marx until today. The goal is to come to a critical understanding of the centrality of this notion of the subject as one of the founding concepts of modernity, as well as to draw out all the consequences of its crisis in radical humanistic (or even so-called posthumanist) thought today. Thinkers to be discussed further include Freud, Foucault, Badiou, Butler, Althusser, Rozitchner, Žižek and Zupančič. Portuguese PORT UN1101 Elementary Portuguese I. 4 points.

Prerequisites: SPAN UN2101 or a score of 380-449 on the Department’s placement examination. This is an intensive course in Spanish language communicative competence with an emphasis on oral interaction, reading, writing, and culture at an Intermediate II level with focus on health-related topics in the Spanish-speaking world. In an increasingly interconnected world, and in multilingual global cities such as New York City, the study of a foreign language is fundamental not only in the field of the humanities but also in the natural sciences. This interdisciplinary course analyzes the intersection between these two disciplines through the study of health-related topics in Iberian and Latin American cultural expressions (literature, film, documentaries, among other sources) in order to explore new critical perspectives across both domains. Students will learn health-related vocabulary and usage-based grammar in Spanish. Students will develop a cultural understanding of medicine, illness, and treatment in the Spanish-speaking world. Finally, students will be able to carry out specific collaborative tasks in Spanish with the aim of integrating language, culture, and health. * This course fulfills the last semester of the foreign language requirement. Therefore, students who have taken SPAN UN 2101 (Intermediate Spanish I), or have a score of 380-449 on the Department’s placement exam, and are interested in health-related topics may proceed and enroll in SPAN UN 2103 (Intermediate Spanish II: Health-Related Topics in the Spanish-Speaking World). Pre-med and pre-health students, as well as those students majoring in the natural sciences—including biology, general chemistry, organic chemistry, biochemistry, and physics—will be given registration priority.

CC/GS/SEAS: Partial Fulfillment of Global Core Requirement Prerequisites: This is an advanced class in Spanish. Between 1400 and 1600, in the context of the Iberian conquest and colonization of the “four parts of the world," artifacts were looted, melted, and destroyed; other objects traveled between continents in physical and textual forms. They were sent and offered as proof of the new territories, desired and collected. The powerful subtlety of unexpected artistic forms, media, and monuments triggered a new space of inquiry. Novel materials, techniques, and ideas about artistry were observed far and near—in the Americas, in Asia, in Africa, and in Europe. They were also described, compared and analyzed in letters, histories, or inventories. All around a sphere that could now be mentally embraced, missionaries, collectors, historians, and artists felt under the power of novel creations: intricate shell jewelries, wood and stone sculptures, turquoise masks, feather mosaics, painted manuscripts and folding screens, ivory spoons, carved temples, monumental cities, and so on. These splendid artworks deeply challenged conceptual boundaries such as those between: idol and image, beautiful and frightening, civilized and barbarian, center and periphery, classic and modern, and ancient and new. The artworks and their descriptions contributed to define humanity as immanently creative and to conceive artistic creation as a distinctive form of thought.

From a cognitive and operational point of view, this course aims to reflect on the theoretical and, mainly, practical limits of traditional grammar explanations, contributing with a new meaningful, experiential and representational understanding of Spanish as a human mean of communication. Within this framework, some of the most representative aspects of the grammar of Spanish will be studied from a fully practical perspective, favoring the comparison with the grammar of English. In each case, the reflection will lead to turn the traditional rules and their exceptions, into operational laws without exceptions, as well as to highlight the natural logic underlying every single grammar decision in the use of language. SPAN UN3533 Women, Culture, Activism & Gender in Latin America. 3 points. The course focuses on women, culture, and activism in contemporary Latin America through the discussion of manifestos, essays, visual works, films, literature, blogs, music, and new cultural experiences. We will approach two main demands of women on the streets: claims against violence (“femicidios”) and the expansion of rights. Students will be introduced to theoretical writing on Latin American feminisms in different contexts (mainly Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Mexico, Chile, Peru). This course will provide students with an accurate understanding of some of the topics of contemporary Latin American feminism and activism related to new subjectivities, politics, and culture. The course develops a wide range of cultural practices and includes topics as practices of resistance, representation of violence, gender as spectacle, and new phenomena such as urban protests. We will also trace a relevant genealogy of women struggles in Latin America. The class will be conducted in Spanish and all written assignments will also be in that language.

Industrial modernization often went hand-in-hand with the constitution of a new kind of national-popular culture during the twentieth century in Latin America .For many such projects, becoming a political subject meant being a worker. This course will interrogate the ways in which labor and culture informed and produced one another, from the Mexican muralists’ use of industrial materials and techniques in the 1920s in the constitution of a their spectators to the creation of the “credit card citizen; of consumption in the late 1990s. Class discussions and writing assignments will analyze novels, essays, short stories, chronicles, films and works of visual art in order to pose and answer some of the following questions: How is work imagines and represented at different historical moments and what ideaological role might such representations play? How do artists and writers think about the nature, organization and political import of their work in relation to other kinds of intellectual and manual labor? In what ways and in what contexts do labor and labor movements become the protagonists of radical political change? Alternatively, to what extent do the tactics of political revolution imply a laborious exercise of their own? How do such artists, writers and thinkers conceive of work before and after capitalism? Authors to be studies may include Diego Rivera, Alfaro Siqueiros, Jorge Luis Borges, Eduardo Coutinho, José Carlos Mariátegui and Ernesto Guevara, among others.

Students register in this course while they pursue independent study work under the supervision of a faculty member during the spring semester. SPAN GU4011 Conversation in Spanish: Practice and Analysis. 3 points. This is a course in Spanish conversation. Students will study and practice features of social interaction in Spanish that are crucial to participate in the new culture. This means the course has two learning objectives: One is learning to engage in regular conversations in Spanish; the other is to understand how conversation works. We will cover conversational issues such as gesture, narratives, intonation, opening and closing interactions, turn taking, etc., both in linguistics and social terms. Practice and analysis will be connected: Every week we will consider an aspect of oral interaction in Spanish. We will study those features in naturally occurring conversations among native speakers and we will practice in actual conversations inside and outside the classroom, by means of role play, simulation, film making, debates and interviews. We will use topics of conversation to provide a meaningful environment for the conversation practice.

Corequisites: PORT UN1220 An intensive exposure to advanced points of Portuguese grammar and structure through written and oral practice, along with an introduction to the basic principles of academic composition in Portuguese. This course is required for the concentration in Portuguese Studies. "This course is intended to improve Portuguese language skills in grammar, comprehension, and critical thinking through an archive of texts from literature, film, music, newspapers, critical reception and more. To do so, we will work through Portuguese-speaking communities and cultures from Brazil, to Portugal and Angola, during the twentieth and twenty-first century, to consider the mode in which genre, gender and sexuality materialize and are codified, disoriented, made, unmade and refigured through cultural productions, bodies, nation and resistant vernaculars of aesthetics and performance, always attentive to the intersections of gender with class and racism.

Prerequisites: PORT W1220. This course focuses on three elements: 1) the main elements of formal discourse in Portuguese (grammar, vocabulary, expressions, etc.); 2) discourse genres, based on the theoretical bases laid out by Textual Linguistics and Discourse Analysis; 3) cultural, economic, social, political themes related to the reality of Brazil or other Portuguese-speaking countries. However, students should be able to define their areas of interest and shape their experience in the course according to them. Such an approach takes advantage of the diversity in the classroom, stimulates participation, and promotes independent academic research. Therefore, students will start a weblog, where their writing activities will be posted, so that their colleagues may read and comment on them. The mandatory genres-forms for all students are in the modules of discourse genres and academic writing, and the corresponding forms, the pronominal system and semelfectives. Students will then choose one more genre among biographical texts (resumé, facebook, biography), lyrical texts (music, poetry), subjective texts (description, narrative, commentary, editorial), and journalistic texts, as well as the corresponding forms assigned to those modules: indirect speech, mandates, past verbal tenses, conjunctions, redundancy/repetition, and semelfactives (conditionals). Every student will study and practice all genres and forms, but they will be responsible for larger assignments (module notes, to be posted on their blogs) on the two mandatory modules and the optional one. At the beginning of the semester they will choose a thematic topic for the course (in their field of study or area of personal interest), and will select a literature list with the assistance of the instructor. All assignments in the course must be related to the chosen thematic topic and will involve research based on the literature list. At the end of the semester, they will produce an essay on their thematic choice. PORT UN3330 Introduction to Portuguese Studies. 3 points. This course presents the students with the information and basic tools needed to interpret a broad range of topics and cultural production from the Portuguese-speaking world: literary, filmic, artisitic, architectural, urban, etc. We will use a continuing cross-disciplinary dialogue to study everyday acts as a location of culture. This course will center on interpretation as an activity and as the principal operation though which culturally sited meaning is created and analyzed. Among the categories and topics discussed will be history, national and popular cultures, literature (high/low), cultural institutions, migration, and globalization. Students will also acquire the fundamental vocabulary for the analysis of cultural objects. This course is required for the concentration in Portuguese Studies.

This course will examine the historical period of gradual emancipation to free labor in Brazil. Course readings include literary and cultural production as well as historical narratives and literary theory. We will question how ideas of racial labor transform alongside new notions of freedom and nation. By drawing mostly on literature, history, and film, this course investigates the issue of cultural memory as related to the history of slavery, racial formation, and national forgetting. Our course discussions will center on questions as, how is the history of slavery remembered or forgotten? How do we ethically remember a past that we can never understand completely? Is it possible to separate cultural representations of race, ethnicity, sexuality and gender from their political and economic contexts? How are “race,” “liberty,” “property” and “life” understood during slavery, and how do those ideas continue to influence the post-slavery nation? Although the course will focus heavily on the Brazilian historical context, we will also comparatively examine how these histories are remembered and forgotten in the U.S. and other parts of Latin America. PORT UN3350 Lusophone Africa and Afro Brazilian Culture. 3 points. CC/GS/SEAS: Partial Fulfillment of Global Core Requirement This course focuses on Lusophone African and African Brazilian cultures and the relations, continuities, ruptures and influences between them. Brazil is the result of the miscegenation of Ameridians, African and Europeans, and this means that is also a cultural mélange of these groups. The African cultural contribution to Brazilian culture and grand-narrative is the primary focus of this course, however, to understand Brazil one needs to understand the cultural diversity found in Lusophone Africa, with which Brazil has had a long relationship. The readings for this course include texts from different disciplines and genres. We will study texts, movies and other forms of visual arts from the following authors: José Eduardo Agualusa, Pepetela, Mia Couto, Jorge Amado, Achille, Mbembe, Hilton Costa, Jocélio Teles dos Santos, Livio Sansone, José Luis Cabaço, Benedita da Silva and Solano Trindade.
