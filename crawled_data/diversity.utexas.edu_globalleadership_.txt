This past Saturday, May 15th, 2021 DDCE Global partnered with the WorldWalker Foundation and the Texas Rowing Center to do a community clean-up on the shores of Lady Bird Lake. The Texas Rowing Center allowed for volunteers to kayak along the river free of charge. After a lunch break, DDCE students and staff from the Fearless Leadership Institute as well as the Heman Sweatt Center walked along the banks of the river picking up trash and contributing to their local environment.

October 2, 2020 Black Students Must Experience Black Life Outside of the U.S. Black Students Must Experience Black Life Outside of the U.S. In this article from Diverse magazine our very own Dr. Devin Walker highlights the importance of studying abroad for Black Students. Dr. Walker begins by reflecting on the experience of being a Black Student in the United States, how this experience is one that is shaped by neglect and distortion. Dr. Walker then speaks on how study abroad can be used as a tool to reflect on students‚Äô feelings of liberation from the constraints of being Black in America, not to runaway from the problem, but to better understand it. As the director of Global Leadership and Social Impact at The University of Texas at Austin, Dr. Walker is a witness to these experiences his students have while abroad. A moment I often relive, happened while dining at Mzansi‚Äôs restaurant in Langa, Cape Town. As we were listening to the sounds of a local band, the owner, Nomonde walked over to our table and told us, ‚ÄúYou are home. This is your home.‚Äù As I glanced around the room, many were in tears. In this moment ‚Äì they felt seen, they felt whole, they felt fully human. We all did. ‚Äì Dr. Devin Walker September 23, 2020 Gilman Scholarship The Gilman Scholarship Program, sponsored by the U.S. Department of State‚Äôs Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs is an undergraduate program for U.S. citizens of limited financial means to enable them to study abroad, thereby internationalizing their outlook and better preparing them to thrive in the global economy.
