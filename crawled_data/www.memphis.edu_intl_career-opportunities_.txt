Yet in many respects it is also the wrong question to be asking. Like most undergraduate majors, International Studies is not an "apprenticeship" program that dictates a single career pathway. Though the IS major can provide you with useful knowledge and skills that many organizations may find desirable, your major is only a portion of what makes you employable. Thus a more productive way to approach this issue is to examine: "What do I want to do for a career? What types of work do I find exciting and/or engaging?" "Will an IS major help me obtain the necessary tools for this career?" "Do I enjoy my field of study? Do I find the courses intellectually challenging and stimulating?" In other words, your choice of major should be examined in light of your long-term goals, the relevance of your major towards attaining these goals, and your personal interest in the subject matter.
