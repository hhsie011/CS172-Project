For good or ill, there is no denying that social media has transformed the policy-making process. The potential of social media to benefit democracies are profound: it creates unprecedented opportunities for governments to report on their inner workings, as well as the possibility for updates with greater frequency and in more accessible terms than pre-Information Age press releases and policy documents. Yet questions remain: is social media helping or harming the policy-making process as a whole, and the health of our democracies themselves? Do self-reported social media declarations about policy-making -- by the policy-makers themselves – indeed equate to greater transparency? Has the casual nature of social media conversations made government more understandable to the people, or simply diminished the quality of our civic discourse? And perhaps most importantly, are our citizens ultimately better informed and more civically engaged as a result of social media-mediated policy-making? Or are Twitter feeds and selfies simply fostering a dumbed-down and distracted democracy, ever less capable of focusing on the substantive work at hand? This open lecture by Dr. Alexis Wichowski, Professor at the School of International and Public Affairs, will explore these questions, examining both the potentials and perils of policy-making in the social media era.
