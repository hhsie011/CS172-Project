Skip to main content Academics Departments Physics Welcome Physics is the study of space, time, energy, and matter. Physicists try to ask and answer, in a verifiable and reproducible way, the deepest questions about the origin, nature, and fate of the universe. The Department of Physics at SMU offers a Bachelor of Science in Physics, a Bachelor of Science in Biophysical Science, and a Bachelor of Arts in Physics degree via our physics major program. We also offer a physics minor. In addition to undergraduate degrees, our globally recognized Ph.D. program offers a focus on particle physics and astrophysics, including collider physics, cosmology, neutrino physics, and particle astrophysics. Undergraduate and graduate students are heavily involved in conducting research at forefront experiments in the field. Our alumni have an outstanding record of success in finding jobs after earning their degrees. We invite you to explore our website further to learn more about our people, our research, and our opportunities for students. Interested in becoming a physics or biophysical science major?
