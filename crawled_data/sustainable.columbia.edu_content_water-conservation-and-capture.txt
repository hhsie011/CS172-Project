New York City drinking water is world-renowned for its quality. Each day, more than 1 billion gallons of fresh, clean water is delivered from large upstate reservoirs—some more than 125 miles from the City—to the taps of nine million customers throughout New York state. Expand all Collapse all Goals and Strategies Expand awareness of water usage. Work with sustainability groups on campus to develop water reduction campaigns for students in residence halls. Encourage students, faculty, and staff to use the campus as a living lab to drive water reduction solutions that are supported by evidence. Set and then incorporate water reduction goals throughout key campus planning efforts, including campus design and development activities, establishment of landscape management practices, and procurement practices. Explore ways to support equitable water distribution and protection of the watershed that provides NYC water. Explore carbon offset opportunities to support organizations that protect farms near the watershed from development. Expand all Collapse all Progress to Date In calendar year 2019-2020, spearheaded by the School of the Arts, Columbia celebrated the “Year of Water” with art exhibits, concerts, lectures, and symposia focused on the Earth's most precious resource in all of its social, political, cultural, economic, and environmental complexities. As part of this initiative, the University examined and published the relative environmental burdens of various types of water packaging options for use during Commencement, and to arm individuals, schools and departments with the information needed to make purchasing decisions. Additionally, an undergraduate student capstone looked at opportunities on campus for water reduction and suggested communications campaigns to help raise awareness among all University constituents.
