It touches everything around us. It drives innovation. And it has the power to make life better for everyone. An Update on the Allred Gallery Floor The floor of the Allred Gallery in Kamphoefner Hall was inspired by the work of well-known architect Le Corbusier. As we learn more about the history of this designer from contemporary research, we are learning more about his unfortunate ties to groups that excluded and persecuted others. The values held by Le Corbusier, particularly those of homophobia, misogyny, and fascism, are not held by the College of Design. Our mission is to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for any individual who enters our space to work and learn.

It All Adds Up: Alumnus Doug Bennett Reflects on a Lifetime of Giving Doug Bennett attended the College of Design during an “explosive period” in our nation’s history, starting in 1965 and graduating with a Bachelor of Architecture in 1970. Throughout his time in the school, he was able to serve as the business manager on the Student Publication, and that was his first foray into philanthropy. After graduating, he served in the U.S. Navy, and started a lifetime of giving. Bennett likened his continuous giving to a habit. He started giving, initially, modest donations to the College of Design and kept up with annual donations ever since.

Graphic design students at the College of Design partnered with @redhatinc to create solutions for a world dominated by driverless vehicles. Throughout the studio, students had to imagine a future in which the public no longer had access to personal vehicles. Then, they had to ideate how autonomous vehicles can fit into various human factors such as family needs, career specializations and security concerns.

Open Take-out food has been a culinary staple for decades, but traditional plastic and foamed polystyrene containers end up in landfills and are not sustainable. 🥡🍟🥤 To combat packaging waste, the College of Design worked alongside @eastmanglobal to create environmentally-friendly food packaging using a new compostable material. Eastman enlisted the College of Design to transform a new biodegradable and compostable material the company had created. Senior industrial design students created take-out containers with the entire supply chain in mind — containers that are easy to assemble, pack, eat from and dispose of. The end result promises added sustainability in the restaurant industry. ➡️ Read the full story in our bio. 📸 Master of Industrial Design student Madelyn Lammert holding a prototype designed for the Eastman studio at the College of Design. ... 180 2 💌 Something good is waiting in your mailbox 💌 📖 Check out the latest issue of Designlife Magazine for ...

Open “Being in the architecture program at State has been the most challenging thing I’ve probably ever done, but I really have learned and grown so so much from it. I remember being in first year not having a clue what I was in for, but each semester pushed me more than the last. Looking back my confidence grew so much between those late nights staying up in studio, making huge models, and designing beautiful presentations. My favorite memories have to be with my studio mates. I’ve watched them grow side by side with me and go from strangers to friends over these past five years. They all have taught me so much. Also football games. Football games are the best haha. Go Pack! A lesson I have learned would be to give yourself grace and patience. Going through this program normally is hard and challenging anyway, but when you throw in a pandemic and other personal matters that can get in the way, it can be even more difficult to make everything perfect and reach that deadline. If I could tell myself one thing first year, or second year it would be to do what you can on your project but give yourself some time away. Make time for some day-trips, to go to football games, enjoy your friends. Not every project has to be perfect. If it’s the best you can do while giving yourself some patience and grace, it’s a win. If I were to name everyone who’s helped me along the way the list would be too long. To start, I’m lucky I was able to find my niche in what kind of architecture I want to design through Bryan Bell’s public interest design classes. Because of his classes and studio, I have a sense of direction. My family also helped me stay the path. When it got hard they were behind me every step shoving me forward. Finally, I am beyond lucky to have found so many wonderful people here, friends, great teachers, and I’ve been lucky to have found my beautiful partner here as well, who has always cheered me on. I will continue to look at State fondly for bringing these beautiful people and experiences into my life. I’ll miss NC State immensely.” - Ariel Hills [B.Arch.

Open "The most enjoyable and difficult moment I remember while studying architecture was when I stayed up all night preparing for a review with my studio friends. We were close to each other during the moments, and we spanned almost 20 hours a day. We were encouraging and leading each other, and also we were eating and chatting together. When I look back on my five years of journey at the studio, the moments where I thought I was very discouraged and frustrated were actually the most shining day of mine. The studio is always up and on 24/7. The studio lighted up those days for 5 years like moonlight in the night. Five years of NC State made a big turning point in my life. It had new programs that I could experience and met new people that I could make social with people who have various communication with many topics, so it became a steppingstone of the opportunity the experience abundantly and develop my future carrier and my future about the architecture. After I graduate, I will develop my career further by training in architecture, which is the beginning of my life as a newcomer to society. I am about to marry my loved one, a new beginning that will come soon. I am so thankful to my beloved parents, my sister Jane, my husband Young, my precious friend Leah and Sky. Also, Ashely helped me finish school well by having Chipotle time, and studio mates who spent the time with the studio stayed over each night. I realized that there were many people I was thankful for until graduation day." - Soya Kim [B.Arch.
