Developed a people-oriented energy management program at each of the OSU campuses. Promotes conservation of electricity, chilled water, steam condensate, gas, and water. Reduce consumption mechanically by adjusting heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system run times to match events and occupancy in buildings. Worked to increase energy awareness of faculty, staff, and students through presentations, promotional materials, website and Facebook interaction. Emphasizes reductions during unoccupied times and promoting behavior changes of "energy consumers" to "energy savers." Established Energy Management and Conservation Policy #1-0520. and OSU Energy Guidelines with web access. Energy Managers (EM) Key to the success of the Energy Conservation Program. Gather data and monitor energy consumption. Apply knowledge about the operation of the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems. Determine the occupancy patterns in each of the buildings. Work to educate the occupants of each building on ways their efforts can contribute to reducing energy costs at OSU. Perform energy audits in assigned buildings to look for energy savings opportunities around the clock, especially during predominantly unoccupied times of the day, including weekends and holidays. Generate energy reports to building administrators, custodial staff, and others who may then share that information with building occupants to promote behavior changes that contribute to energy savings. What the ECP does NOT do Does NOT compromise the university's research and education mission. Does NOT limit laboratory operations. Energy reduction measures do NOT purposely disrupt classroom comfort. Expectations All students, faculty and staff are asked to do their part to conserve and help create a culture of conservation at Oklahoma State University and our campuses in Stillwater, Tulsa, Oklahoma City, and Okmulgee. OSU strives to become a model of thoughtful stewardship through energy management and conservation, not only for the benefit of natural resources and the environment but also for taxpayer and tuition dollars. Through the efforts of OSU energy managers, and with the cooperation of OSU faculty, staff, and students, the Energy Conservation Program is expected to save more than $22 million within the first seven years (2007-2014).
