It features a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter to assist in reducing airborne droplets and aerosols in small spaces up to 600 square feet.

How does my portable air cleaner work? The AeraMax DX95 utilizes a four-stage air purification technology that has been especially developed by Fellowes to effectively purify your indoor air and protect you from harmful allergens and pollutants.

What should I do if the air cleaner is not working? Check to make sure it is plugged into a working power outlet. You can plug something else in that works in another outlet to check this. Check to make sure the lights are illuminating when pressed. Make sure the filter tray on the side of the unit is securely pressed in. The unit will not work if the filter tray is dislodged.
