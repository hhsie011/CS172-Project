CRES provides students with rigorous training in methods of critical inquiry that are relevant to the most pressing social, political, and cultural challenges we face in the 21st century and their historical antecedents. CRES faculty members are a diverse community of socially engaged scholars with expertise in the fields of Critical Race & Ethnic Studies across the Humanities, Social Sciences, the Arts, Law, Education, and the Natural and Health Sciences. Underlying the CRES curriculum is a commitment to generating transformative knowledge about the dynamics of social power and inequity, the social implications of cultural, racial, and ethnic diversity, and the ethical mandates of equity and social justice. Critical Race & Ethnic Studies focuses on social justice issues that are shaped by race, ethnicity, class, dis/ability, gender, sexuality, and other contemporary and historical forms of group differentiation. It also looks to the political struggles of systematically and structurally marginalized people in exploring innovative strategies for social transformative action. Critical Race & Ethnic Studies prides itself on the diversity of its students, faculty, and staff, all of whom are committed to academic excellence in teaching and research, and to providing programming and mentorship that advances our university’s Vincentian mission to be a model of diversity, inclusion, social justice, and equity.
