Field and modeling approaches to understanding and maximizing ecosystem services in salt marshes As coastal communities grow more vulnerable to sea-level rise and increased storminess, communities increasingly turn to nature-based solutions to bolster coastal resilience and protection. Marshes have significant wave attenuation properties (among many other pivotal ecosystem services) and can play an important role in coastal protection for many communities. This talk will discuss both field and modeling approaches to understanding how marshes respond to major storms, as well as how marsh restoration can be used to bolster coastal protection and other relevant ecosystem services. About the speaker Dr. Katie Castagno is a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Coastal Studies in Provincetown, MA. Katie’s research interests include the impacts of storms on the resilience of coastal communities, including the effectiveness of shoreline stabilization strategies, marsh restoration, and other adaptations to an uncertain climatic future. Katie received a Ph.D. in geological oceanography from the MIT-WHOI Joint Program in Oceanography and Applied Ocean Science and Engineering and a Master's in marine affairs from the University of Rhode Island.
