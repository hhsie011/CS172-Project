The DJCL is intended to be a platform for Dartmouth undergraduate and graduate students to present interdisciplinary and transnational critical writing on literature, film, art, and culture. Pieces submitted for publication on the website by the end of the Spring 2022 term can fall under one of two categories: 1) catastrophe or 2) termly miscellaneous. Works that fall under the category of 'catastrophe' could undertake an analysis of literature/film/art/culture that concerns crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, or war – these are but a few examples and by no means an exhaustive list of possible subjects. Miscellaneous submissions fall outside the termly theme, which for 22 Spring is 'catastrophe'. All submissions must adhere to the standards of Dartmouth's Academic Honor Principle. The criteria that will be considered for acceptance are: What is the comparative aspect of the piece? (For example, a piece may compare two or more works of literature/film/art/culture, it may compare two or more theoretical frameworks in the analysis of one or more work[s], or it may make a comparison between different translations of one work.) What original argument does the author introduce? If the piece is submitted under the catastrophe category, what is the catastrophe in question? How does the author define and justify their use of the term 'catastrophe'? If the piece is multimedia, what literary aspects are present? The two managing editors of the DJCL can be contacted by email at: hannah.r.kadin.23@dartmouth.edu and samantha.d.hysa.22@dartmouth.edu if you have questions about submitting a piece and/or are interested in joining the DJCL club. We look forward to your submissions!

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Comparative Literature Program Undergraduate About the Program Courses Courses Recommended For First Year Students Course Descriptions Major How to Apply Minor in Translation Studies Honors Thesis Program Thesis Timeline Past Theses Awards & Prizes Undergraduate Alumni Undergraduate Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Graduate Overview About the Program Current MA Students How to Apply Degree Requirements Courses Graduate Alumni Graduate Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Academic Achievement Award COLT MA Graduate Handbook News & Events Overview Annual Hoffman Lecture Annual Zantop Memorial Lecture People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
