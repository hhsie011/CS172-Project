The committee works to build community among our graduate students and postdocs by hosting events such as a weekly Journal Club and monthly socials. The committee comprises two students from each year of graduate study, years 2-5. Mission Statement: The Chemistry Graduate Student Leadership Committee (Chem-GSLC) aims to create a supportive community through which graduate students may find camaraderie, a means to strengthen their bonds with their peers, and a means to voice their opinions in a confidential environment. Chem-GSLC accomplishes this mission by adhering to the following tenets: Through our work we aim to maintain the morale of our department and the passion for chemistry which has guided each student to pursue higher education. It is our belief that adhering to the tenets above will ensure the success and happiness of our peers. Our 2022-2023 GSLC members are: Jonathan Chellali: G5, Robinson Group (Lead Director) Katelyn Rioux: G5, Delaney Group (Events Director) Audra Woodside: G4, Robinson Group (Lead Director) Giovannia Barbosa: G3, Delaney Group (Communications and Events Director) Timea Kolozsvary: G2, McDonald Group (Activities Director) Meg Shieh: G2, Xian Group (Communications and Events Director) To contact GSLC, please reach out to any of the members directly, or email [email protected]. The Chem-GSLC aims to strengthen interpersonal bonds between students by hosting and encouraging participation in social events and research based activities, such as trivia nights or journal club. The Chem-GSLC serves as a mediator between students and faculty. We function as a mouthpiece for the student body by ensuring all concerns are confidentially reported to staff and addressed seriously. The Chem-GSLC aims to ensure that the entirety of the student body is made to feel welcome and ensure none are alienated. This is accomplished not only through efforts to maintain a diverse representation in Chem-GSLC as well as direct partnerships with the departmental diversity and inclusion committee and coalition for international scholars.
