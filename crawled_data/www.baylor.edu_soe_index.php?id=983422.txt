Consumer information about School of Education programs is reported on the TEA website at the “Consumer Information” link below, and below that, we have provided information for navigating the site and links to pages of specific interest. Consumer Information about Educator Preparation Programs Pages within this site of particular interest: • Accountability System for Educator Preparation (ASEP). This dashboard provides a ranking for each program in Texas. On this page, scroll to Baylor University within the box on the left under “ASEP Accreditation Statuses.” Below is a screen shot of this chart with Baylor highlighted. For 2020, the State of Texas declared a natural disaster due to COVID, and all programs received the status of “Accredited - Not Rated.” • Certification exam pass rates for all Texas programs — PPR are also available on the TEA site HERE. To find Baylor, look in the light yellow bar just under the words “Pedagogy and Professional Responsibilities (PPR) Exam Pass Rates.” On the far right, click "Filter by EPP Name” and choose Baylor. (EPP is Educator Preparation Program.) The Pedagogy and Professional Responsibilities Exam is the general exam for certification. Below is a screen shot for Baylor for 2019, the most recent year posted currently. (Jan. 3, 2022) Exams for specific subject matter and for administrator certification are listed separately in a similar chart HERE. The filter for EPP is second from the left, and then you may filter by separate “Content Pedagogy Exam.” The chart will show you the number of candidates statewide, how many passed statewide, and then the same data for the program you select. Baylor has a 100% rate in all categories except one, which has a 99% rate. Below is the data for 2019 (latest year available) for “Core Subjects EC-6,” typically referred to as Elementary Education: About At a Glance Contact the School Office of the Dean Dean's Biography Dean's Office Directory Dean's Office Directory Centennial Events Featured Profiles Impact Living-Learning Center Mission of the School of Education Outcomes Consumer Information Why Baylor School of Education Learning Spaces Marrs McLean Science Learning Resources Center (LRC) Location and Hours Check-Out Procedures Media Lab Mathematics Education Lab Impact Living-Learning Center Apply Now Make a Gift Contact Us Visit Campus Show More General Information Colleges, Schools, Libraries & Research Admissions Administration Gateways For...
