The idea of 3 Day Startup is simple: start a technology company over the course of three days. We reserve work space for an entire weekend, recruit 40 students with a wide range of backgrounds, cater food and drinks, invite top-notch entrepreneurs and investors, pick the best idea for a startup during the Friday brainstorming session, and release a minimal prototype by Sunday night. The goal is to build enough momentum among a network of motivated people to sustain the company beyond the weekend. Who? Passionate students with an entrepreneurial drive, including Computer Science (PhD, MS, undergraduate), MBAs, law students, graphic designers, PR, business undergraduates, etc. We are looking for strong candidates that can fill the following roles: Software Engineer Business (Finance, Marketing, Biz Dev) Graphic Design (Web, Print) Advertising, PR Legal Other: Wildcards, Raw Passion When? Deadline to apply: Friday, October 13, 2017 Friday, Nov. 10, 2017 at 2 p.m. until Sunday, Nov. 12, 2017 at 9 p.m. Where? Station Houston 1301 Fannin Street Houston, TX 77002 Why? We know many people with great ideas who fail to execute on them for a variety of reasons: lack of time or money, no access to the right people, or not enough confidence to make the plunge. We provide all of the resources to bring an idea to life with the help of 39 other highly skilled and motivated individuals. 3 Day Startup is a great way to get the community excited about entrepreneurship and to spend an intense weekend with creative people who want to actually bring an idea to life as opposed to sitting back and listening to YATAE (yet another talk about entrepreneurship). It’s also a social and business experiment to see how much a group of passionate people can accomplish over the course of 60 hours. If you'd like to stay in touch and be notified of future programs, please connect with us via our contact page. Apply Now 3 Day Startup is only open to accepted participants and a small number of selected mentors. The final pitches are open to the public.
