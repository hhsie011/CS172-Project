Designed by Boora Architects to meet the needs of 21st century teaching, research and sustainability, the new buildings set a modern tone that looks forward as it recalls the legacy of Stanford’s original sandstone facades and arch-lined arcades. The Jen-Hsun Huang Engineering Center, with its octagonal rotunda, occupies the SEQ in the southeast corner. In the southwest corner is the Jerry Yang and Akiko Yamazaki Environment and Energy Building, also known as Y2E2. In the northeast corner is the The James and Anna Marie Spilker Engineering and Applied Sciences Building. The final building, completed in 2014, is the Shriram Center for Bioengineering & Chemical Engineering. The Dean’s Office and Administration are located in the Jen-Hsun Huang Engineering Center: 475 Via Ortega [map of area] Stanford, CA 94305-4121 The school occupies many buildings in and around the Quad. Stop by our campus to embark on a self-guided tour or spend an hour with a student guide exploring the highlights of Stanford’s beautiful campus. Requests for group guided tours of the Huang Engineering Center and the Science and Engineering Quad can be submitted via email to seq-services@stanford.edu. Please allow several weeks for us to find a suitable docent for your tour.
