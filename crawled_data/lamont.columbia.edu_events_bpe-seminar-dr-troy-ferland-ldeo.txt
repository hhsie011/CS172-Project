Climatic influences on Pleistocene fire activity at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania Morphologic evidence suggests that hominins had access to cooked foods ca. 2 million years ago, though evidence for controlled burns (e.g., hearth sites) didn't come about until ~1.2 million years later. Natural fires in Pleistocene East Africa contextualize the evolution of fire use behaviors by hominins, yet Pleistocene paleo-fire records from the region are sparse. Using organic geochemical markers of fire (PAHs), In this talk, I investigate the pacing of paleo-fire recorded by a ~100kyr sequence of lacustrine sediment deposited by the paleolake Olduvai in northern Tanzania. I will illustrate possible climatic mechanisms for the observed patterns of paleo-fire using sea surface temperature reconstructions from coeval Indian Ocean marine core sediments. I will further compare these Pleistocene records to preliminary data from an investigation of modern precipitation patterns across East Africa.
