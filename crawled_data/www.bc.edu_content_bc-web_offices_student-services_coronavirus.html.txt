CARES Act I, or HEERF I The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act established an approximately $14b Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF), which allocated 75% of the funding to institutions of higher education based on the number of each institution's Pell Grant recipients and the remaining 25% based upon each institution's remaining total student's Full-Time Enrollment. Under this metric, Boston College was allocated approximately $6.4m. Pursuant to the CARES Act, institutions are obligated to use at least half of their allocated funding for emergency student financial aid grants. The remaining portion of an institution's CARES Act funding may be used for certain other expenses relating to the disruption of campus operations due to COVID-19. The Department of Education has made the student portion of this CARES Act funding available first. As a condition to receiving the emergency student financial aid portion of its CARES Act funding, the University signed and returned to the Department of Education a Certification and Agreement affirming that Boston College will, in accordance with the requirements of the CARES Act, use no less than 50% of its total CARES Act funding to provide emergency financial aid grants to students. That Certification was signed by Boston College on June 5, 2020. On August 6, Boston College received the approval to receive the funding from the Department of Education and the funds will be received by the institution in late August. Per the CARES Act, this portion can only be distributed to students who are eligible to participate in federal financial aid programs under Section 484 in Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, were enrolled for the full spring semester and were not enrolled in a fully online program. Boston College had 6,680 students who submitted a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for the spring 2020 semester, 4,683 of whom were undergraduates.

Specifically, these grants were given to undergraduate students whose family contribution toward educational expenses as calculated by the FAFSA, was $10,000 or less during the 2019–2020 academic year. Boston College has also distributed grants of up to $550 to 703 graduate and law students with the highest demonstrated financial need, as calculated by the FAFSA, to cover expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to the COVID pandemic for a total of $386,645.

Under the Emergency Broadband Benefit Program, eligible households can receive up to $50 per month to help pay for broadband internet service. According to the FCC, verification that the individual is a Pell Grant recipient can come from the student’s financial aid award letter, paid account statement, FAFSA Student Aid Report (SAR), or a written/electronic confirmation from the school documenting the Pell Grant amount received in the current award year. More Students Eligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) During Pandemic Under regular SNAP rules, students enrolled at least half-time in an institution of higher education are ineligible for SNAP benefits. However, beginning January 16, 2021, the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2021 temporarily expands SNAP eligibility to include students who either: Are eligible to participate in State or Federally financed work study during the regular academic year, as determined by the institution of higher education, or Have an expected family contribution (EFC) of 0 in the current academic year. Students who meet one of the two criteria outlined above may temporarily receive SNAP if they meet all other financial and non-financial SNAP eligibility criteria. The new temporary exemptions will be in effect until 30 days after the COVID-19 public health emergency is lifted. State SNAP agencies may contact institutions of higher education to request verification of students’ eligibility for work study or EFC of 0. With prior written consent of the student, the institution is allowed to provide a student’s FAFSA data (including aid awarded to the student based on the student’s calculated EFC from the FAFSA form for the respective award year) to a State or entity for the purposes of applying for or receiving State or Federal means-tested benefits, which include SNAP benefits. Students may also provide a copy of their financial aid award letters to State SNAP agencies.
