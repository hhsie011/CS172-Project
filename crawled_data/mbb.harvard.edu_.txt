The Mind Brain Behavior Interfaculty Initiative (MBB) was introduced in 1993 to encourage an interdisciplinary community of faculty from across the University to engage in research and other academic activities aimed at elucidating the structure, function, evolution, development, aging, and pathology of the brain in the context of human behavior, genetics, and society. Since then, our initiative has expanded to include all members of the Harvard community who have a connection to the study of the mind, the brain, or behavior.

Students outside these concentrations, or students in these concentrations who do not wish to pursue these integrated honors tracks, may pursue a secondary field in Mind Brain Behavior. Upon completing course requirements for this program, the MBB secondary field will be noted on student transcripts.
