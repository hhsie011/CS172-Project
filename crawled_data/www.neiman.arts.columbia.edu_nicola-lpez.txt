She produced projects at the shop in 2018 and 2019 both of which derive from an ongoing interest in rethinking and reconfiguring the contemporary landscape. While Lopez’s work has focused primarily on urban environments, the works made at the Neiman Center look to more remote locations. Apparition I-III, for instance, overlay imposing architectural scaffolds, printed using the collagraph technique, on digital images of the barren dunes at White Sands National Monument. The collagraphed structures, though abstract, recall the steel tower constructed at the Trinity test site 60 miles north of White Sands upon which the world’s first atomic bomb was detonated. López (b. 1975) received her BA and MFA at Columbia University in 1998 and 2004, respectively. Her work has been exhibited widely both in the United States and internationally at institutions including the Museum of Modern Art, NY; Los Angeles County Museum of Art, CA; Denver Museum of Art; and the Museo Tamayo, Mexico City. López’s work has been the subject of solo exhibitions at the Chazen Museum of Art, Madison, WI and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, NY. She was commissioned to create a temporary site-specific work for The Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2013.
