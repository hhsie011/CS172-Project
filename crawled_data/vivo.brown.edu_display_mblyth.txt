Rhodes Center for International Economics and Finance, William R. Rhodes Professor of International Economics, Professor of International and Public Affairs Overview I am the William R. Rhodes '57 Professor of International Economics and Director of the Rhodes Center for International Economics and Finance at Brown University. I have appointments in Brown's Watson Institute for International Studies and in the Department of Political Science. I grew up in Dundee, Scotland. I received my PhD in political science from Columbia University in 1999 and taught at the Johns Hopkins University from 1997 until 2009. My research interests lie in the of field international and comparative political economy and aims to be as interdisciplinary as possible, drawing from political science, economics, sociology, complexity theory and evolutionary theory. My work falls into several related areas: the politics of ideas, how institutions change, macroeconomic regimes and growth models, and why people believe certain economic ideas despite buckets of evidence to the contrary.

Full Text Research Research Overview I published, Angrynomics (Columbia University Press) in 2020, which examined the economic stressors and dislocations behind the global surge in populism (with Eric Lonergan). It was named a book of the year by the Financial Times. In 2022 I shall publish, along with Jonas Pontusson and Lucio Bacarro, a multi-autored volume with Oxford University press called The New Politics of Growth and Stagnation. That is, how countries specialize and grow, or fail to grow, in the global economy, and the political coaltions that underpin such models. Prior to these projects I most recently wrote a book called Austerity: The History of a Dangerous Idea (Oxford University Press 2015), which has been translated into 16 languages and was named a best book of the year (economics list) by the Financial Times. I have a continuing interest in the politics of ideas, finance, and European politics and an increasing interst in the distributional politics of climate change. Research Statement The Politics of Ideas Growing up in the UK under Mrs. Thatcher, the politics of ideas, that is, how politics alters peoples' conceptions of what they should want, was always on the TV screen or on the front pages of the newspapers. Yet when I came to grad school in the US, the idea that how people think about the world may matter for how they act in it was treated with deep suspicion (and still is in some quarters). Here, interests - unproblematic, given, and transitive - were the order of the day. I'd like to think that my work has moved the debate along a bit in that regard. A few key publications in this area are: "Any More Bright Ideas? The Ideational Turn of Comparative Political Economy." Comparative Politics 29 (1) January 1997 pp. 229-250. "The Transformation of the Swedish Model: Economic Ideas, Distributional Conflict and Institutional Change" World Politics 54 (1) October 2001 pp. 1-26.

Specifically, if people get their preferences from their institutional context, then where do they get the preference to change that context? My answers also have to do with ideas and can be found below. Great Transformations: Economic Ideas and Institutional Change in the Twentieth Century (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 2002).

How Disciplines Change Related to my work on how institutions change is a fun sideline on how academic fields change. By this I mean the self-understandings academics have of their own work and how the fields of knowledge they are part of evolve and change over time.

Political Parties If my work on ideas (and institutions) was an attempt to work out what made Mrs. Thatcher possible, then my work on political parties was my attempt to understand what made Blair, Schroeder and Clinton and the current populist moment possible.

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/gov.2018.43 The Politics of Finance (and Governing Complex Systems) Given the recent global financial crisis there has been an explosion of interest in this area. My interest here is a bit more longstanding. Following the dot-com burst and the demise of the hedge fund LTCM I became interested in how banks and the like think about risk. And the more I looked into this the more worried I got. I published a piece back in 2003, which suggested that LTCM was just the beginning and that the way banks calculate risk was going to blow up the world. Nothing of the sort happened. And then the world blew up. I am also interested in finance because it's a great example of how humans deal with complex systems - badly.
