On March 18, Columbia SIPA Center on Global Energy Policy (CGEP), Columbia Global Centers | Beijing, and Columbia Global Centers | Mumbai jointly hosted a webinar titled "Emerging Asia and the Global Energy and Climate Challenge" with CGEP experts Dr. Pierre Noël and David Sandalow, and Laszlo Varro, Chief Economist of the International Energy Agency. This event marks the launch of the global seminar series on energy and climate policy that invites Columbia University students to discuss common climate change challenges across East Asia as well as differences between countries. As one of the student-centric thematic programs initiated by the Beijing Center in partnership with university affiliated research centers in the spring semester of 2021, this new series is designed to enhance Columbia students' understanding via in-depth comparative analyses of energy and climate issues, and train their analytical and research skills through cohesive lectures, panel discussions, and Q&As with leaders in industry, academia, and government. The first session focused on the relationship between economic growth, energy consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions. Speakers reviewed the history of Asia's economic emergence and what it has meant for global energy markets and GHG emissions. They also reviewed the history of emerging Asian countries in the global climate change negotiation, highlighting the change in approach from the Kyoto (1997) regime to the Paris (2015) one. Our next session will happen in April. Stay tuned for further updates and information.
