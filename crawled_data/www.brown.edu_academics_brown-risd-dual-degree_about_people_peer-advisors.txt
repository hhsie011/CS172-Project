Peer Advisors also advocate the student voice to campus administrators, represent the Program on our campuses, and organize community events for all Dual Degree students across the academic years. Incoming first-year Dual Degree students are assigned a Peer Advising Family led by Peer Advisors in their second and third year of study and a Peer Mentor in their third or fourth year of study. Second-year Dual Degree students select a Peer Advisor for second-year students. Third-year Dual Degree students are advised by a team of Peer Advisors in their fourth or fifth year of study.
