Two major agreements codify the University's commitment to new investment in our local community. They are the Community Benefits Agreement, in partnership with the West Harlem Development Corporation, and the Declaration of Covenants and Restrictions with Empire State Development (ESD). Highlights of the agreements include: $76 million to fund community benefits for the West Harlem community through the West Harlem Development Corporation $20 million to an affordable housing fund Up to $4 million in housing legal assistance for West Harlem residents $20 million to the Harlem Community Development Corporation (HCDC), an Empire State Development (ESD) subsidiary that plans and facilitates community revitalization More than $470 million paid to date to minority-, women- or locally-owned (MWL) construction trade firms Reporting The following agreements contain the University's commitments for Manhattanville project-related amenities and benefits: Declaration of Covenants and Restrictions (DCR) DECEMBER 14, 2011 Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) MAY 20, 2009 These commitments are monitored and periodic updates on the University’s progress are submitted to ESD. In recognition that the University is committed not only to ESD but also to the local community in general, it was determined that progress reports would be made available for anyone wishing to see them.
