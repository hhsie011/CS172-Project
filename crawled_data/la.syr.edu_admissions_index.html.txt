We also sponsor a wide range of activities for students and parents, including programs by individual colleges, auditions and portfolio reviews, information sessions, interviews, and parent workshops. While none of these can take the place of a campus visit—which is really the best way to learn about Syracuse University—they do offer you firsthand information about Syracuse University. Since space is limited, please make your reservations at least one week in advance. Personal Interviews Personal interviews are available for high school students in the fall of their senior year. An interview is not required, but may strengthen your candidacy. For you, it is a chance to talk with a member of the Admissions Committee and share your goals, interests, and academic information. Interviews are conducted from mid-September through December and must be scheduled in advance by registering via the Admissions website. To schedule an interview: Select "Schedule Online" Select Interview and date range, then register You will receive an email confirmation Portfolio Reviews and Auditions We hold required portfolio reviews and auditions for students applying to the architecture, art and design, acting, musical theater, and design/technical theater programs. Typically, transfer students audition or have portfolios reviewed on the main campus in Syracuse. However, you should call the Office of Recruitment and Admissions in the College of Visual and Performing Arts at 315.443.2769 to see if it is possible to present your portfolio at the Syracuse University Los Angeles office. Please call ahead to make an appointment for portfolio review or audition. Important: Our thoughts are with students and their families who have been affected by the California fires or recent hurricanes. If you have been impacted by any of these natural disasters, we'll be happy to work with you as you complete the application process. If you need additional time to submit your application and/or supporting documentation, please contact us at orange@syr.edu or 315-443-3611.
