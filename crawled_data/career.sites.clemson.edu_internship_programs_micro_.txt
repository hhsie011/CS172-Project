Unlike traditional internships, micro-internships are not suited to those seeking academic credit for their internship experience, but they can take place year-round, typically range from 5 to 40 hours of work. Internships are great, but traditional programs are limited by the number of opportunities they can offer and the talent they can attract. Micro-Internships are scalable, easy to implement, and create a pathway into your existing programs” (Parker Dewey). We see micro-internships not as a replacement for internships, but rather as a non-academic option that provides students the tools, talking points, and networking often leveraged in securing that next level internship. With that as a backdrop, Clemson University’s Center for Career and Professional Development has partnered with the team at Parker Dewey to offer micro-internships in companies ranging from those in the Fortune 100 to emerging start-ups, and go across departments including sales, marketing, technology, HR, finance, and more.
