That email provides a comprehensive update of many COVID related policies for this summer and fall. There are a few clarifications I would like to make. Face Coverings and distancing: Face coverings must be worn indoors by all persons through August 2, regardless of their vaccination status. In addition, six-foot distancing must be maintained. Beginning August 3, face coverings continue, however, distancing is not required for those who are vaccinated. Beginning September 9, it is not necessary for vaccinated persons to wear a face covering or distance, as long as they are not in patient-facing areas, or areas where research on human subjects is being conducted. Unvaccinated persons must wear face coverings indoors and out. Face coverings must be worn at all times, regardless of vaccination status, in NYP buildings. For the most part, if you are vaccinated, after September 9 you will not have to wear face coverings in any CUIMC building except in common areas such as elevators or lobbies. All buildings leased or owned by CUIMC or NYP are listed below. Three buildings on this list are under the jurisdiction of NYC or NYS, and their respective rules apply. Visitors: For clarification regarding visitors this summer, see https://covid19.columbia.edu/content/guidelines-visitors-participating-academic-activities. Department heads no longer need to go to Dr. Shelanski’s committee to seek approval of visitors but must follow the aforementioned guidelines. Fall guidelines can be found at https://covid19.columbia.edu/content/visitor-guidelines-fall-2021 Donna Lynne, DrPH Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Columbia University Irving Medical Center University Covid Director CUIMC Buildings 154 Haven Ave. Residence 390 Fort Washington Ave. 50 Haven Ave. 83 Haven Ave. 51 Audubon Ave. Allan Rosenfield Building 722 W. 168th St. Alianza Dominicana 530 W 166th Street Georgian Building 617 W. 168th St. Hammer Health Sciences Center 701 W. 168th St. Irving Cancer Research Center 1130 Nicholas Ave. Lasker Biomedical Research Center 3960 Broadway Mailman School of Public Health 722 W. 168th St. NYC Department of Health 600 W 168th St. (NYC) New York State Psychiatric Institute 1051 Riverside Drive (NYS) NYSPI–Kolb Research Building 40 Haven Ave. (NYS) Primary Care Nurse Practitioner Group 516 W. 168th St.* Roy and Diana Vagelos Education Center 104 Haven Ave. Russ Berrie Medical Science Pavillion 1150 St. Nicholas Ave. School of Nursing 560 W. 168th St. Tower 1 60 Haven Ave. Towers 2 and 3 100 Haven Ave. Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons 630 W. 168th St. William Black Building 650 W. 168th St. NewYork-Presbyterian Buildings* 21 Audubon Ave. Edward S.
