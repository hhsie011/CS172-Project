Yet, the role of city diplomats remains relatively unknown. This webinar will offer a conversation between the author of City Diplomacy and five distinguished city diplomats from some of the world's most influential cities. DISCUSSION CHAIRED BY Doctor Lorenzo Kihlgren Grandi (@KihlgrenGrandi), author of City Diplomacy (Palgrave Macmillan, 2020), instructor of City Diplomacy at Sciences Po, École Polytechnique and Columbia University SPEAKERS Prof. Paul-David Régnier, Head of Paris’ International Relations Department Ms. Leah Kreitzman, London’s Mayoral Director for External and International Affairs Ambassador Nina Hachigian, Los Angeles' Deputy Mayor for International Affairs Ms. Penny Abeywardena, New York City's Commissioner for International Affairs Ms. Luz Amparo Medina Gerena, Head of Bogotá’s International Relations Department Q&A MODERATOR : Aliénor de Thoisy ABOUT THE SERIES Reimagining cities. Exploring global trends towards a new (urban) normal Hit hard by what was revealed to be primarily an urban pandemic, cities across the world have been harnessing the potential of their proximity with residents, the private sector, and civil society to deploy rapid, innovative, and cost-effective solutions. Most of this innovation is likely to continue as part of a broader movement led by numerous mayors committed to boldly re-direct urban development towards environmental sustainability, social equality, and resilience. Designed by Dr. Lorenzo Kihlgren Grandi, instructor of City Diplomacy at Sciences Po – PSIA, the École Polytechnique, and Columbia in Paris, this conference series aims at engaging distinguished mayors, scholars, practitioners, and students in a global discussion on the future of urban life in a post-pandemic world. Co-organized with Sciences Po Paris School of International Affairs and Columbia Undergraduate Programs in Paris. Co-sponsored by the Alliance Program and Urban Flag.
