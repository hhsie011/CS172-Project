Each unit is its own research entity, as well as a partner to other Jackson School units. Collaboration happens frequently between units, and professors and research scientists often hold appointments in more than one unit. Research opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students are available across units. Bureau of Economic Geology, BEG Established in 1909, the Bureau of Economic Geology is the oldest and second-largest research unit at The University of Texas at Austin. It also functions as the state geological survey of Texas. Research at the BEG focuses on questions at the intersection of energy, the environment and the economy. The bureau’s labs and offices are located at the J.J. Pickle Research Campus in North Austin. BEG Website Department of Geological Sciences, DGS Founded in 1888, the Department of Geological Sciences is the main academic unit of the Jackson School. It’s among the largest and most academically diverse programs in the world, with a strong emphasis on global field work. Research in the department spans across the Jackson School’s nine research themes, with a particular focus on understanding fundamental geologic processes. The department’s labs and offices are located on the main UT Austin campus. DGS Website Institute for Geophysics, UTIG Started in 1972, the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics is known for expeditionary-scale research. Scientists from the institute are leading ongoing research in the Arctic, Antarctic, and on missions to study other planetary bodies, including Mars and Jupiter’s moon Europa. Its research expertise is in climate, energy, marine geosciences, tectonophysics, and planetary and polar geophysics. The institute’s labs and offices are located at the J.J. Pickle Research Campus in North Austin.
