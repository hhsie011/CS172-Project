Read the article Black women aren’t paid fairly–and it starts as early as age 16 For every dollar a white man makes, a Black woman makes 63 cents. This pay inequality begins early. From age 16, Black girls are consistently paid less than boys, and the disparity follows them throughout their careers. While this is a systemic issue, beginning your career with an eye on pay equity can help close the gap. Do your research. Track and understand your salary in the context of your industry and your company. Your company may have salary ranges by bands available for you to access. Prepare. Use the data you have gathered to initiate an informed conversation about your salary with decision-makers at your company. Conversations about money can be hard, so role-play with a friend or mentor before you have them. Have the conversation. You next step is to have a conversation with HR. Lay out the case for why you deserve to be paid more using data to back your argument. Be your own advocate. If you’re a high performer, armed with evidence about your work, it’s difficult for the employer to say no.
