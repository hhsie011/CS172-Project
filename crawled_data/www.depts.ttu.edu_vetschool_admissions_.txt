Overview The TTU SVM will begin accepting applications for its second class starting May 3rd, 2021 through the Texas Medical and Dental School Application Service. The TTU SVM received its Letter of Reasonable Assurance from the American Veterinary Medical Association Council of Education on September 16, 2020 enabling the School to offer admission and to matriculate its first class. Recently, TTU SVM received it's letter of Provisional Accreditation in April 2021 from the American Veterinary Medical Association Council of Education after filling the inaugural class. The TTU SVM program is a four-year curriculum. The first three years will be located in Amarillo, Texas, and include classroom and laboratory-based instruction. Students will have a significant amount of their time focused on development of clinical and professional skills, and involved in critical-reasoning and problem-solving activities to prepare students for our hybrid distributed clinical fourth year. The fourth year is described as ‘hybrid' because it will occur both on-campus and in with our clinical affiliates to enable students to hone their skills and knowledge in real-world settings. The goal of the curriculum is to prepare competent and confident students for rural and regional Texas veterinary practice. The TTU SVM admissions committee consists of TTU faculty and clinical affiliate veterinarians. The admissions committee makes recommendations to the Associate Dean for Academic and Student Affairs (ADASA) for students to admit to the program. The ADASA, in conjunction with the Admissions Committee, will approve the final selection of students for admission.
