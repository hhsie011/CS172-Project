Off-campus opportunities — Study abroad, summer research opportunities. Research Opportunities for Undergraduates - Want to work with a professor on an ongoing research project? Check out the possibilities. Directed Reading Program - This program pairs undergraduate students with graduate student mentors to read and explore a mathematics topic or text over one term. The goal of the program is to enable undergraduate students to study mathematics at a deeper level than can be done in the classroom, to increase diversity in mathematics by involving undergraduates from various backgrounds, and to foster a supportive environment for students seeking to go into mathematics. Undergraduate Poster Session — All undergraduates who have done research projects in pure or applied mathematics in the current academic year are invited to present a poster at the Department of Mathematics Undergraduate Poster Session. Prizes are awarded for best projects based on information in the poster. Thayer Prize — Dartmouth College's Mathematics Prize Exam for First-Year Students.
