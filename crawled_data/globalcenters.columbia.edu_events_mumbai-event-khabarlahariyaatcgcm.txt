Marking Dalit History Month 2022, Columbia Global Centers | Mumbai invites you to an online panel discussion on the journey of Khabar Lahariya, an award-winning women-led media organization and subject of the recently Oscar-nominated documentary, ‘Writing with Fire’. As part of the Center’s Writing Indian Stories series, the discussion will address the challenges and decisions encountered by Khabar Lahariya’s team of journalists. Panelists will reflect on the editorial vision that guides the organization’s documentation and storytelling activities, the impact that Khabar Lahariya has had on the lives of its community of women writers and staff, and on the larger landscape of independent coverage on rural India.
