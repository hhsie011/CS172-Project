Transfer applications will be accepted on a space available basis after November 15 for spring enrollment. Although the transfer application deadline for the fall semester is July 1, we encourage you to apply earlier. The earlier you apply, the earlier you will be notified. It is in your best interest to apply earlier for the fall semester as transfer students are admitted on a rolling basis beginning in late February and some programs are limited in space. **Spring enrollment is not available for the School of Architecture, the Newhouse School of Public Communications or the Whitman School of Management and very limited for programs in sport management, health and exercise science, music, design, and transmedia. ***For further instructions on submitting your audition/portfolio for the College of Visual and Performing Arts (VPA), please visit the VPA website. Prescreen audition is required for Acting and Musical Theater programs. If you have further questions please contact the College of Visual and Performing Arts at admissu@syr.edu or 315.443.2769. ****For further instructions on submitting your architecture portfolio please visit the School of Architecture website.
