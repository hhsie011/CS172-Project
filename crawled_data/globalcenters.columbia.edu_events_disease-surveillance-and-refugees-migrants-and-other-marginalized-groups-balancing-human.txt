11:30 AM New York (Online Webinar) The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic increase in disease surveillance efforts around the world and a surge of interest in new digital technologies for tracking disease spread. However, advocates and experts have raised concerns that these public health tools carry risks of harm and the potential for misuse and abuse, and evidence of government overreach and abuse is already emerging. Without doubt, the harmful impacts of disease surveillance will be disproportionately felt by marginalized groups, including refugees, asylum seekers and undocumented migrants. This panel will explore the practical, legal and ethical challenges around disease surveillance among displaced populations, including specific issues of trust, privacy, consent and data security, and the implications for human rights, public health and immigration enforcement.
