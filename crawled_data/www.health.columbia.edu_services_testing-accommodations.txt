Testing accommodations are provided for students whose disabilities impact their ability to complete exams under standard conditions in the classroom. Students must register with Disability Services so staff can determine eligibility for this accommodation. Courses that do not require professor signatures Disability Services (DS) works closely with professors of courses that have multiple DS students enrolled to facilitate access to testing accommodations. For these courses: Accommodation letters are not needed.

Students are encouraged to confirm the specific arrangements with their faculty at least one week prior to the exam date. Please see below for a full list of these courses, as well as the appropriate Master TARFs to submit for each. Courses that DO require professor signatures For any course not listed below, students may request accommodations by submitting a completed TARF (for exams) or QARF (for quizzes). All forms due 3 weeks prior to first test/exam date. Incomplete forms will not be accepted. Please note that professors must fill out and sign the Instructor Section.

Expand all Collapse all Frequently Asked Questions What if my extended time accommodation results in a conflict with another class? Speak with professors to arrange alternate dates or times for exams. If a student is unable to reschedule a conflicting exam, the student should notify Disability Services at [email protected], and staff will make an effort to coordinate alternate exam times. What if I miss an exam because I am sick? Students must inform Disability Services prior to an exam that they will be unable to take it due to illness; student must also contact professors to ask for permission to reschedule an exam. Students should be aware that the professor’s make up/missed exam policy may apply. If permission is granted, Disability Services will coordinate an alternate exam date and time per the professor’s instructions. If a student informs Disability Services during an exam that they cannot continue due to illness, Disability Services will contact the professor to ask whether it is permissible to reschedule the exam.

Students taking classes at Barnard should follow the same instructions for scheduling an exam with Columbia by filling out and submitting a TARF with Disability Services at least two weeks in advance of the exam. Disability Services will coordinate administering the exam with the appropriate accommodations.
