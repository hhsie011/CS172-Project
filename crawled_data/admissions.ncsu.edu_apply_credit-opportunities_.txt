An official evaluation of your credits will not be completed until you apply and submit your official transcript. A transfer credit summary will be available to admitted transfer students. Newly enrolled first-year students taking dual enrollment courses in high school or attending an early college should submit an official final college transcript by July 15. We will then evaluate your courses and apply transferable credit towards your degree. During the semesters associated with COVID-19 (spring 2020 – summer 2021), NC State will honor pass/fail (or satisfactory/unsatisfactory) grades from any regionally accredited institution. During the application process, pass/fail grades will be reviewed but will not be calculated into the applicants cumulative GPA, which we consider in the application review process. Transfer credit will be awarded for a “pass” final grade. No transfer credit will be awarded for a “fail” final grade. Consistent with our current policy, if students choose to keep their letter grades, courses with a C- or higher will be eligible for transfer credit. A course-by-course evaluation for each applicant will be conducted of all courses to determine transfer ability and if credit will be awarded at NC State for each transferable course as an elective or direct equivalency. Each academic department determines how these credits are awarded to a students degree plan if they enroll.
