Essays or personal statements are a great way to showcase your writing skills while allowing the admissions committee to hear directly from you. *Texas Tech University values high school students who push themselves, are intellectually curious and are interested in learning. We understand and appreciate that a greater number of students are engaged in rigorous, college-level coursework such as Honors, AP or IB courses. Because we believe that these experiences can elevate the high school experience, it is our policy to make academic rigor a factor in consideration for admission to Texas Tech. Students are expected to perform well in these and all other courses in high school in order to demonstrate their college readiness. Let's get started. STEP 01 Complete an application for admission.
