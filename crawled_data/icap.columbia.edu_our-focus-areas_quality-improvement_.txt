As the global response to HIV advances, and as programs mature from an emergency to a sustained response, greater focus is being dedicated to quality in order to improve population health. Quality improvement (QI) is a systematic approach that uses the scientific method to analyze and improve health system performance based on appropriate standards of care. Quality improvement uses a specific methodology to continuously plan, implement, and adapt solutions that lead to improved outcomes. Learn more about ICAP’s QI work ICAP’s Focus on Quality Improvement Aligning our priorities with PEPFAR’s aim to achieve the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets through improving quality of care, ICAP’s QI approach is consistent with national guidelines in PEPFAR partner countries and supports activities to: Increase access to HIV prevention, treatment, and testing services Improve linkages within and between programs Support retention in care and adherence to treatment for people living with HIV ICAP collaborates with ministries of health and other stakeholders to develop and implement data-driven HIV programs and support QI in low-resource settings. ICAP uses a flexible, evidence-based approach to QI that is supportive of national guidelines and strategies, including two well-known methodologies: the Model for Improvement (MFI), which includes the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle, and the QI Collaborative (QIC) approach.
