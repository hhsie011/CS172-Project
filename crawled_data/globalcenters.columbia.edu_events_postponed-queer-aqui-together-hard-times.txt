We will meet to discuss the times we live in from the vantage point of insights offered by queer and feminist theories of the state, of thriving and survival, of aesthetic strategies, of sound and vision. Convened by the Queer Theory: Here, Now, and Everywhere working group at Columbia University, Queer Aqui stages a series of conversations and workshops between US-based and Brazil-based thinkers, makers and doers. With panels on anti-gender theories, queer voices, and alternative knowledge production in trans Black contexts, and featuring presentations by artists Carlos Motta discussing work by Jota Mombaça and others, and workshops on queer film and queer performance, these two days will offer a lively, dynamic and politically situated set of discussions for local participants and audiences. The event will also feature a tribute memorial in memory of murdered feminist activist Marielle Franco, and in the spirit of her legacy, we will foster and foreground the knowledges of marginalized groups and southern theories of bodies, praxis and transformation.
