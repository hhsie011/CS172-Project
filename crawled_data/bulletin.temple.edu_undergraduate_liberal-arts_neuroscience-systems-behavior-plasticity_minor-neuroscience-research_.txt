The required courses in the Neuroscience Research Minor focus on basic neuroscience, neuroanatomy, cellular neuroscience, and conducting research. In addition to formal coursework, students are required to take two neuroscience elective courses. The students have options to take independent study courses that result in a research project as electives. The Neuroscience Research Project is a unique project developed over two semesters of independent study. This research project may not overlap with projects for other programs (e.g., Honors). Because of some overlap in coursework, the students must choose to minor in either the Neuroscience Research or the Cognitive Neuroscience minor.
