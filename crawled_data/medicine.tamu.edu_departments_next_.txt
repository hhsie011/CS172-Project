Winzer-Serhan, PhD Associate Professor 2100 Medical Research and Education Building winzer-serhan@tamu.edu About Neuroscience & Experimental Therapeutics Welcome to the Department of Neuroscience and Experimental Therapeutics (NExT) at the Texas A&M University College of Medicine. Our main office is located on the 1st floor of the Medical Research and Education Building on the Texas A&M University campus in Bryan, Texas. The Department has 16 full-time faculty members and is one of four basic science departments within the College of Medicine. Its faculty participates in medical courses both in the 1st and 2nd years of the medical curriculum. Faculty also direct nationally recognized laboratories that are funded by agencies such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Science Foundation (NSF) and other private foundations. Program strengths within the department include brain development, cellular/molecular basis of drug addiction, circadian biology, ocular pharmacology and experimental therapeutics, neurobiology of aging, neurodegenerative diseases such as stroke and Alzheimer's disease, neuro-oncology and neuroteratology of alcohol, nicotine and other drugs of abuse. Faculty within the department are also affiliated with university-wide interdisciplinary faculties including the TAMU Faculty of Neuroscience and our clinical science partner, the Texas Brain and Spine Institute. The department is also home to the Women's Health in Neuroscience Program, consisting of interdisciplinary research faculty and a clinical advisory group aimed at developing a cohesive preclinical approach to the impact of puberty, pregnancy and menopause on brain development, mental health and brain disease. The Department of Neuroscience and Experimental Therapeutics also participates in an interdisciplinary graduate program in the Medical Sciences that leads primarily to the PhD degree with special emphasis in interdisciplinary training in Neurosciences or Pharmaceutical Sciences. The PhD program in Medical Science usually requires 4-5 years to complete. Graduates from our program are prepared for leadership roles in research and teaching in academic, industrial, or governmental positions.
