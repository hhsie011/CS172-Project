Mellon Foundation's Higher Education and Scholarship in the Humanities program is focused on: training scholars and producing scholarship in the humanities broadly conceived, and thereby contributing to culture and society. In practical terms, this means helping institutions and professional organizations respond to the economic, demographic, financial, and technological challenges affecting higher education, supporting initiatives designed to enhance the learning experience of both undergraduate and graduate students in the humanities, and fostering collaborations within and among institutions that support disciplinary innovation, foster practices of diversity and inclusion, and promote the social value of the humanities. https://mellon.org/programs/higher-learning/ Articles Yes, Race and Politics Belong in the Classroom Chronicle of Higher Education Articles on Diversity The Case for Inclusive Teaching Knowing Your Students Better: A Key to Involving First-Year Students (The Center for Research on Learning and Teaching, The University of Michigan) Religious Diversity & Inclusion Nurturing Interfaith Leaders Bringing Students of Different Religions Together Religious Diversity is Diversity Religious Diversity as Cornerstone of College Education Resources from other Educational Institutions supporting Diversity & Inclusion in the Classroom: Yale Center For Teaching and Learning The Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning at Harvard Notre Dame's Kaneb Center for Teaching and Learning Class Handout Writing an Effective Teaching Philosophy Statement Cornell University Center for Teaching Innovation's Faculty Institute for Diversity: Train the Trainer Workshop Association of American Colleges and Universities' Diversity, Equity, and Inclusive Excellence National Center For Faculty Development and Diversity TED Talks Embracing Otherness, Embracing Myself What It's Like to Be Muslim in America An Artist's Unflinching Look at Racial Violence Books and Movies Required Reading Around the World Train & Learn Students Staff & Faculty Cultural Events Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day Community Events General Information Colleges, Schools, Libraries & Research Admissions Administration Gateways For...
