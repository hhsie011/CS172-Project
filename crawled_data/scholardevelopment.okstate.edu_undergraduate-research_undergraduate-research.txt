Our office’s mission is to expand and enhance student-faculty research partnerships across all disciplines at OSU. Faculty mentors at OSU have the foresight to see the immense potential that engaging in undergraduate research, regardless of the discipline, have on a student’s ability to engage with the world’s challenges. We understand that students who graduate without research experience have not taken full advantage of all that a comprehensive research university has to offer, so OSU leads the way in supporting undergraduate research in all fields of study. Our students who engage in undergraduate research often find their experience to be invaluable in choosing a career path, improving their likelihood of success in the workforce, and in applying for graduate school. Explore Opportunities Online Now Opportunities For some students, their undergraduate research experience at OSU begins with our award-winning Freshman Research Scholars Program, funded by the Robberson Trust. Sixty incoming freshmen across all six undergraduate colleges extend their education beyond the classroom by engaging in cutting-edge research under the guidance of innovative faculty members. Students who complete the program not only receive a $1,000 scholarship, but are also well prepared to apply for further research funding offered through our office. For sophomores, juniors, and seniors, our office, in partnership with the Lew Wentz Foundation. The Lew Wentz Foundation, provides up to fifty $4,500 Wentz Research Grants to accomplished undergraduates who have written a compelling research proposal under the mentorship of an OSU faculty member. Further, the Niblack Research Scholars Program, coordinated through the Office of the Vice President for Research, provides $8,000 research grants to students in the laboratory sciences. Many individual colleges and departments also offer undergraduate research opportunities. In addition to scholarship support for undergraduate research, our office also coordinates other programs aimed at enhancing the research experience. We offer the "Undergraduate Research" Transcript Designation, and two major annual undergraduate research symposiums. Students interested in any of these scholarships or opportunities should not hesitate to contact our office for individual guidance and support.
