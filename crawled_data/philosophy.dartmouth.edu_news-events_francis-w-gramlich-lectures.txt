Gramlich Lectures Dr. Francis W. Gramlich (1911-1973) began his career at Dartmouth College in 1940 as an assistant professor. During WWII, from 1942-1946, Dr. Gramlich was an officer and clinical psychologist in the Navy. In 1946 he returned to Dartmouth, where he was promoted to full professor, and in 1960 named the Stone Professor of Intellectual and Moral Philosophy, and held this position until 1973. He was chair of the Philosophy Department for a total of sixteen years, serving various terms from 1947 to 1971, and was responsible for rebuilding the department after a series of retirements. Dr. Gramlich was educated at Princeton University, earning his BA summa cum laude in 1933, his MA in 1934, and his Ph.D. in 1936; his dissertation was titled “Symbolism and Meaning.” He was co-editor of two textbooks: “Philosophic Problems” and “Problems of Ethics.” Dr. Gramlich was the founding director of Philosophy’s foreign study program at the University of Edinburgh; founding director of Dartmouth's Comparative Studies Center; and a former director of the East Asian Language and Area Studies Center at Dartmouth. Dr. Gramlich’s courses, “Philosophy of Human Nature” and “Philosophy of Mind,” were among the most popular on campus. The Francis W. Gramlich Fund was established in memory of Dr. Gramlich through gifts from former students and colleagues (and Dartmouth matched all gifts on a one for two basis); the fund supports a public lecture in Philosophy and a student prize awarded annually by the philosophy faculty to the philosophy major who best exemplifies those qualities of mind and character that Professor Gramlich sought to develop in his students.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Philosophy People Curriculum Overview Major and Minor Course Schedule Honors Past Honors Theses Foreign Study Logic Software Foreign Study News & Events News & Events Student Prizes Gramlich Prize Winners Story Prize Winners Philosophy Faculty Prize Winners Lecture Series Gramlich Sapentia Race, Gender & Justice Workshops Philosophy & The Struggle Against Racism Social Justice Research Grants My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
