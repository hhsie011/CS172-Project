of Individual Study Accreditation General Education Athletic Programs Mission Facilities The History Oklahoma State University was founded as Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical College on Dec. 25, 1890, just 20 months after the Land Run of 1889. When the first students assembled for class on Dec. 14, 1891, no buildings, books or curriculum existed. For more than 130 years, this land-grant institution has held true to its mission of instruction, extension and research. Land-grant universities were made possible by the Morrill Acts of 1862, 1890 and 1994. The first granted federally controlled land to states to establish “land-grant” colleges. They were designed to be a departure from the typical liberal arts curriculum and a response to the industrial revolution. Land-grant colleges were designed to improve the world through education and research in agriculture, military tactics and mechanical arts. In 1894, 2½ years after classes began in local churches, 144 students moved into the first academic building, later named Old Central and still located on the southeast corner of campus, housing the Honors College today. In 1896, Oklahoma A&M held its first commencement with six male graduates. The Smith-Lever Act of 1914 created a cooperative extension service associated with each land-grant institution. Oklahoma State University has 77 Extension offices, one in each county. They provide practical, research-based knowledge for improving lives and communities. On July 1, 1957, Oklahoma A&M College became Oklahoma State University. Technical branches were established in Okmulgee in 1946 and in Oklahoma City in 1961. In 1990, these two technical branches were renamed OSU-Okmulgee and OSU-Oklahoma City; and in 2008, OSU-Okmulgee was renamed OSU Institute of Technology. OSU-Tulsa was formed in 1999 from a consortium of universities that were originally established in 1982. In July of 1988, the Oklahoma College of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery (in Tulsa) became the OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine. In 2001, it became part of the OSU Center for Health Sciences, which also has an affiliation with its primary teaching hospital — the OSU Medical Center. Oklahoma State University College of Osteopathic Medicine and the Cherokee Nation established the nation’s first tribally affiliated college of medicine in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, which opened in August 2020.

Research Research has been one of the three essential components of the OSU mission since the University’s inception. Research adds richness, depth and broader impact to the other mission components of teaching and outreach. In the sciences and engineering, basic research advances the frontiers of disciplinary knowledge; whereas, applied research improves quality of life and economic prosperity by bringing new products, processes and medicines to the marketplace. Research and creative innovations within the arts and humanities enhance how human beings view and understand the world we live in. OSU’s faculty and students are engaged in research across the full spectrum of human endeavor and inquiry, including areas of state and national priority. In addition to disciplinary research in virtually all academic units on campus, OSU is strong in several areas of interdisciplinary research. Researchers involved in next generation sustainable energy span agricultural innovation, nutrition, engineering, toxicology, geosciences, economics and the social/behavioral sciences. OneHealth is an interdisciplinary framework that recognizes the interconnections between human health, animal health and a healthy planet. OSU OneHealth includes research as diverse as pandemic preparedness, veterinary medicine, ecology, psychology, exercise science and bioengineering—as well as basic research in the bench sciences. Unmanned systems research (including unmanned aircraft) brings researchers from several engineering disciplines together with experts in production agriculture, computer science, information systems and aviation education to create platforms, sensors, data management tools and new applications for this burgeoning field. Such interdisciplinary research strengths are enhanced by big data solutions, including OSU’s high performance computing facilities and advanced analytical expertise. Other strength areas include transportation, rural renewal, wheat and sod science, and factors associated with the opioid crisis.

In spring 2015, OSU opened the Bert Cooper Engineering Laboratory for structures and materials engineering with new geothermal systems for energy efficiency. The grand opening of EXCELSIOR, an unmanned systems innovation laboratory, was celebrated on Nov. 2, 2019. The new lab houses multidisciplinary research and education programs for the Unmanned Systems Research Institute in the College of Engineering, Architecture and Technology. The facility offers a recognized emphasis in instruction and research in unmanned aircraft systems and supplies hands-on analysis, design, construction and flight testing of UAS platforms. Students focus on projects that include flight testing and operations. Research opportunities include UAS design, aerodynamics, flight path management and airspace integration, sense and avoid, controls, structures, aeroacoustics, propulsion, communications and operations, and sensors and payloads. The Boone Pickens School of Geology dedicated the new Gary F. Stewart Core Research Facility in November 2019. The facility serves as a “one-stop shop” for treatment, storage and analysis of core samples (cylindrical rock samples obtained by drilling), a needed service in the region. The building includes a grinding and polishing lab, thin section preparation, an area designated for coloring, porosity and permeability, significant layout and review space, as well as office space and a conference room. More than a repository, the facility houses active research. It is located in the northwest section of campus, near the corner of McElroy Road and North Willis Street. Academics Providing the quality facilities for a foundation of success for our students is an overarching goal at Oklahoma State. From smaller renovations to update buildings to constructing new facilities, academic buildings are well cared for as part of the overall building plan. The McKnight Center for the Performing Arts is a world-class epicenter for the arts, attracting celebrated national and international programs featuring notable productions and artists. The New York Philharmonic opened the McKnight’s 2019-2020 season. The center will allow the university and the center’s supporters to express — and be recognized for — their passion for the arts on a global stage. The 93,000-square-foot facility opened in 2019 along the southwest corner of University Avenue and Hester Street, boasting 1100 seats in the Performance Hall and 250 in the Recital Hall. The 1,000-seat outdoor plaza features a massive, high-definition screen that can show events taking place inside the Performing Arts Center or telecasts from around the world. The Division of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resource’s new Greenhouse Learning Center opened in August of 2019 and serves students in Oklahoma State University’s College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources in a new facility that will better prepare them to enter the professional workforce. The Greenhouse Learning Center, a $6 million facility, will replace and improve functions of OSU’s existing teaching greenhouses that have been in use for decades. Greenleaf Nursery, one of North America’s largest wholesale nursery growers and long-time partner and supporter of OSU’s horticulture programs, has committed $1 million toward this new project. The Greenhouse Learning Center will feature six greenhouses, including an isolated entomology greenhouse, and head house, which includes a classroom, office space and plant-preparation area, as well as storage space for soil, equipment and chemicals such as fertilizer and pest-management materials. A large foyer will provide space for student club meetings. It also will house cutting-edge irrigation systems, intense climate and humidity control and other technology standard in today’s horticulture industry. The new home for the Spears School of Business on Hester Street opened in spring 2018. The $72 million building is unique in design and shape, a “Crescent Masterpiece” that brings all of Spears Business together for now and in the future. Spears Business is designed to promote collaboration and hands-on, experiential learning to best prepare graduates for success in the modern workplace. The north wing of the College of Human Sciences building opened in fall 2016 and houses hotel and restaurant, design and other programs. Also in 2016, OSU opened a new veterinary medicine academic center and the Charles and Linda Cline Equine Teaching Center. OSU opened several renovated buildings in 2009. Thanks to a gift from the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation, OSU doubled the size of its School of Architecture building. The Psychology Building, built as a women’s dormitory in 1933, was renovated to house seven departments from the College of Arts and Sciences. The North Classroom building, funded in part by the state’s Higher Education Capital Bond Program, opened on the north side of the Stillwater campus in 2009. The facility offers the latest in teaching technology and features an eco-friendly eatery. Athletics One of the most tradition-rich programs in college baseball has a new state-of-the-art home. O’Brate Stadium was scheduled to hold its first game in March 2020, but the unveiling to Cowboy fans was delayed due to the battle against the coronavirus. The revolutionary facility features an expansive clubhouse and operations center, including a "training triangle" with an indoor facility, pitching lab and practice infield. The ballpark includes 3,500 permanent seats that can be expanded to 8,000 as needed. The renovation of the west end of Boone Pickens Stadium created one of the premier collegiate football facilities in the country. The university also completed several athletic projects north of Boone Pickens Stadium. OSU opened the Sherman E. Smith Training Center for indoor training and a new outdoor track in 2013. The Michael and Anne Greenwood Tennis Center opened in early 2014. The new tennis center features six indoor and 12 outdoor courts and is one of the leading collegiate tennis facilities in the country. Gallagher-Iba Arena continues to be a staple of athletics at OSU. In 2001, the university constructed the new Athletic Center on the site of Gallagher-Iba. The top of the original building was removed, and the Athletic Center was built completely over and around Gallagher-Iba, expanding its seating to approximately 13,600. Historic Gallagher-Iba continues to exist as the arena within the Athletic Center. Women’s Soccer has a new home. In 2018, the Cowgirls played their first season in Neal Patterson Stadium. The $20-million project is a showcase for college soccer with club seats, plaza and upper bowl gathering areas and a north end zone terrace area and seating designed specifically for OSU students. Team facilities include locker rooms, meeting areas, kitchen facilities, sports medicine areas and equipment rooms. After undergoing extensive upgrades, the OSU Cross Country Course opened in its current form in 2019, when OSU hosted the NCAA Midwest Regional Championship. The course was on full display when it hosted the 2020 NCAA Cross Country Championships. It is scheduled to host the national championships again in 2022. Karsten Creek has been consistently ranked as one of the best college golf courses in the country and has hosted multiple NCAA events, including two national championship tournaments. Karsten Creek once again played host to the nation's best with the NCAA Division I Men's and Women's Golf Championships in 2018. Life At OSU, we also have an eye on comfortable and convenient living, ranging from residence halls and transportation to incorporating art into the campus. The university has been on the forefront of replacing outdated residential halls with apartments and suite-style accommodations for nearly two decades. Multiple upgrades have opened, giving on-campus students new opportunities for better living and community within the halls. The University Commons, a traditional-style residence hall, opened for the fall 2015 semester. Located north of the Colvin Center on Hall of Fame Avenue, the facility was enhanced a year later with the nearby North Dining Facility, which features seven distinctive dining choices that offer a focus on healthy, fresh options. Parking and Transportation have also seen significant changes in recent years. The Multimodal Transportation Terminal and 1,100-space Monroe Street Garage opened in the fall of 2009. The facilities provide a central point of contact for the various modes of transportation serving OSU-Stillwater and its branch campuses, as well as the community and surrounding areas. OSU has added two more multilevel parking garages — the Wentz Lane Garage opened on the southwest corner of campus in the spring of 2013, and the Fourth Avenue Garage opened in fall of 2016 adjacent to the McKnight Center for the Performing Arts. OSU has expanded campus bus service for both the Stillwater community and the OSU-Stillwater campus. To reduce energy costs and emissions, OSU converted its entire fleet of campus buses to compressed natural gas in 2010. From stunning sculptures enlivening the Stillwater campus of Oklahoma State University to striking landscaping designed to welcome one and all, art is taking its place in the public realm — some of it in America’s Brightest Orange. The university has seen the installation of pieces from renowned sculptor Allan Houser; yearlong exhibitions by Bill Barrett; the commemoration of Nancy Randolph Davis, the first African-American to attend the university when it was Oklahoma A&M College; and many more. The sculptures co-exist with the brick-and-mortar architectural landscape and integrate art into everyday life. OSU opened its Postal Plaza Gallery in 2014 as the home of the OSU Museum of Art, showcasing the university’s extensive art collection and strengthening its connection to downtown Stillwater. Infrastructure OSU completed work on a state-of-the-art Central Plant to replace its inefficient 1940s power plant. The facility will reduce OSU’s environmental footprint, save energy costs and feature an 80-person classroom. The first phase of a campus wide electrical upgrade project across campus has also been completed. The upgrade replaced aged underground piping and cabling that served many buildings’ electrical power. In addition to the underground infrastructure, Facilities Management is also nearing the completion of a new power distribution center, otherwise known as the PDC. The PDC acts as an indoor switching station between two OG&E substations, that allows power to be distributed throughout campus. These infrastructure projects provide more capacity, offer better resiliency, and renew the life of the electrical system serving campus for decades to come. OSU is a leader in network computing resources. The university has applied the student technology fee in concert with other resources to create a second-to-none networking system on campus that includes maintenance of large-scale computer laboratories, high-speed inter-laboratory connectivity and a virtually seamless interface to the internet across campus. Improvements continue in the university's outdoor spaces as well, and a landscape architectural master plan developed in 2010 is guiding those efforts. Major east-west streets Hall of Fame Avenue and University Avenue have been greatly updated, and the university has completed a total redesign and reconstruction of Monroe Street, which runs north-south through the heart of the campus. A series of landscape projects near student residential facilities have occurred in recent years. In the summer of 2005, the Edmon Low Library plaza was restored by installing a new surface on the main upper plaza and the lower area. Completed in 2013, Legacy Walk provides a scenic pedestrian thoroughfare in front of the library, connecting to Hester and Monroe streets. In the fall of 2016, OSU unveiled an impressive Welcome Plaza outside the southeast corner of the Student Union. The plaza is an inviting garden area featuring statues of a galloping mare and her foal. Other facilities of note Lake Carl Blackwell, located eight miles west of Stillwater, is owned by OSU. The area includes approximately 3,350 acres bordering the 3,000-acre lake that provides the water supply for OSU. It is also used for research activities in addition to being a popular regional recreational area.
