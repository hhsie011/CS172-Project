Students seeking these opportunities at Temple University should have a demonstrated record of academic excellence, and an expressed interest complete an advance degree after their Bachelor’s degree. Temple University offers several Accelerated Degree Programs arranged between undergraduate and graduate or professional schools and colleges. The PSM programs have been seeking accelerated paths to program completion for all Temple undergraduate students who meet qualifications to enter these program in the junior year of their course of study. Obligations of College of Science and Technology Ensure that all candidates for the 4+1 program meet the guidelines for admission to the accelerated program, which are: have a minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.25 in at least 45 credits of coursework taken at Temple; two letters of recommendation from full-time faculty to support the student’s admission into the 4+1 program; have at least 12 credits of electives in their degree program see grids for specific programs below in Appendix 1. apply in the spring of their sophomore year for the following fall; be able to complete their undergraduate degree in four full-time semesters (beginning with their first semester taking a graduate course as an undergraduate); and be able to complete the graduate degree in one additional year, which follows directly after graduating from the undergraduate degree. Provide 12 credits of graduate coursework, designated to fulfill 12 credits of electives for the candidate’s undergraduate degree, which uniquely reflect the requirements of the Professional Science Master’s (PSM) program of Bioinnovation. Students will take no more than one graduate course in any one undergraduate semester (See grids in Appendix 2 for the complete undergraduate-graduate sequences). Process of applying to 4+1 degree Student should express interest and reach out to CST advisor and PSM program Coordinator for guidance. This student will be sent to CST advising. All student ware to officially start this process in CST advising. CST will vet students to see if all all criteria are met for GPA, number of credits as listed under the section Obligations of CST above. CST will ask student to provide two letters of recommendation and will refer student to Seema Freer who will schedule an interview with specific PSM program. If the interview and applciaiton process is successful, Seema will contact CST so that Tom Price will add the cohort codes on Banner. Student will initiate 4+1 coursework. In the Senior year student will apply to graduate school. Program administration- CST Advising (Tom Price) Update DARs Apply Cohort Code Ensure that student is not registered for > 18 credits per semester. Ensure no more than 16 applicants for Bioinnovation and Biotechnology and no more than 10 applicants for Bioinformatics. Forensics Chemistry, Scientific Writing and Cyber Defense and Information Assurance have not specified a maximum number.
