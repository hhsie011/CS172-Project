These procedures address common elements, objectives and goals across the ten research collections. Individual collections may also have departmental policies that are focused on discipline-specific concerns including protocols based on their particular holdings. Non-Harvard personnel (including volunteers and interns) using Harvard research, laboratory or collection facilities are required to register pertinent information. This data is acquired by filling out two forms, the Acknowledgement of Risk and Release and Emergency Contact Information. These documents are kept on file in OEB Administration. Minors require a special form allowing for parental or guardian approval. For more information, please read the MCZ Collection Management Policy which was prepared in 1996 by the Curatorial Associates, and reviewed and approved by the Director in conjunction with the Faculty-Curators. _dsc0587.jpg Resources Database Ernst Mayr Library Genetic Resources Shared-Use Facilities Policies & Procedures Destructive Sampling Exhibition & Other Loans Film & Digital Media Permissions & Copyright Privacy | User Agreement Harvard Museums of Science & Culture Organismic and Evolutionary Biology https://www.instagram.com/mczharvard/ https://twitter.com/MCZHarvard https://www.facebook.com/MCZHarvard/ d327872e00f44e2d502b313399641a26 Admin Login OpenScholar Copyright Â© 2022 The President and Fellows of Harvard College | Accessibility | Digital Accessibility | Report Copyright Infringement
