Records Forms University Seal Grades The Office of the University Registrar is responsible for the official collection, recording, and maintanence of grades. All grades are posted via Enroll & Pay. Student questions about a grade should start with the instructor or department, while faculty with questions should reach out to our office. Policies regarding grades can be found in the KU Policy Library. Grade Point Average (GPA) The GPA is a quotient determined by dividing the number of grade points earned by the number of credit hours attempted and graded A, B, C, D and F. The GPA, that appears on a student's official transcript will reflect only course work taken in residence at the University of Kansas. This GPA will exclude course work transferred from other institutions, generally undergraduate course work taken in KU's Continuing Education Independent Study program, academic credits earned by examination and course work taken while classified as a non-degree seeking student. Individual schools (e.g., School of Social Welfare, Business, Education, etc.) may calculate GPA for admission or advancement differently. A full description of GPAs and the types of courses included in them is available on the Grade Point Averages page of this website. Grading System Undergraduates should refer to the University Senate Rules and Regulations and the Undergraduate Catalog. Graduate Students should see the Graduate School Catalog. Law Students should refer to the Law School Catalog. Medical Students should refer to Guidelines for Medical Student Evaluation.
