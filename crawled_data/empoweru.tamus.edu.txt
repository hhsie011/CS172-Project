Creating a Culture of Student Completion & Equipping Educators Learn more The Challenge Every year, over 18,000 students enter The Texas A&M University System institutions as freshmen who are studying fulltime for their first time in college. Unfortunately, about one third of those students have not yet graduated six years later. It is our challenge to increase the percentage of completers within six years and thus decrease the percentage of those who do not complete. It is our challenge to assure that every student who does not complete has been provided every possible opportunity to be successful.
