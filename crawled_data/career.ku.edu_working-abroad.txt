If you're considering an international career, you should ask yourself some questions first: Why are you interested in an international career? Consider your answer to this question carefully. Not only will it help guide your job search, it will also prepare you for the interview process. Ask yourself: What is my purpose for wanting to go abroad? (travel, new experience, build a career) What do I rate as most important? (job, location, pay) Why am I drawn to an international career? (emphasize the positives) What do I hope to achieve? What skills do you have? Communicate your value to prospective employers by emphasizing the skills you bring to the table. Hiring an employee from a foreign country can be a considerable risk for any organization, so it's important to demonstrate your value and commitment.
