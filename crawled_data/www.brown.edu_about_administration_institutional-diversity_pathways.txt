Pathways to Diversity and Inclusion: An Action Plan for Brown University, known as the DIAP, is Brown University’s comprehensive strategic plan to create and sustain the diverse and inclusive community necessary for the advancement of knowledge, learning and discovery. The DIAP — along with DIAP Phase II, developed five years after the original plan — details concrete, achievable actions that Brown is implementing to make the University more fully diverse and inclusive. The strengths of the plan are its concrete goals, University-wide engagement to achieve the goals, and commitment to accountability. It is imperative that all members of our community — regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, political views, physical ability and other aspects of their identities — are accepted, valued and provided with equal opportunities to thrive at Brown. Our challenge and opportunity as a community is to work together as students, faculty and staff to ensure we are living up to our ideals.
