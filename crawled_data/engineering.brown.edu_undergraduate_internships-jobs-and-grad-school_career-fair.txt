Our fair is a boutique fair, limited to 30 companies total and meant to foster a more engaged experience for companies and students. Our fair emphasizes Brown alumni attendance from particpating companies, which is both effective for engagement, but also helpful for students planning their career paths ahead of them. Students from related areas of strong quantitative and analytical skills including physics, chemistry, applied mathematics, computer science and biology are invited to attend as well. Typically, over 250 students attend this event, with the majority being engineering undergraduate and graduate students. Employers seeking further details and online registration information should contact Associate Dean Jennifer Casasanto at jennifer_casasanto@brown.edu with any questions or concerns. Why Hire Brown Engineers? Our education prepares students for any career they can imagine. We have concentrations in mechanical, electrical, biomedical, chemical and biochemical, environmental, materials, and computer engineering, and our students learn mechanics, electronics, design, analysis, fabrication, research, leadership concepts, writing, presentation, entrepreneurship, and more. Breadth and depth: our students are trained in critical thinking and lifelong learning from their liberal arts foundation, which they then build on to form a solid understanding engineering principles that gives them the ability to adapt as technology evolves Engineering plus something else - our students study engineering, and have the ability to study across other complimentary areas to build nuances into their undergrad training. Experiential learning - Our students have hands-on elements in all of their engineering courses, they take their learning beyond the classroom into their sophisticated co-curricular activities, such as building a car or designing a satellite. Our students have an excellent balance of foundational theory and experiential practice. Undergrad laboratory experience - our students engage in summer-long or semester long research positions in our faculty labs. They learn and work alongside experts in a range of fields which prepares them for real world complex problems Our students are above and beyond collaborative, the Brown learning environment creates a wonderful balance of self-directed learners who are excellent colleagues. Brown students engage, support, and form networks with students and faculty throughout Brown in all that they do.
