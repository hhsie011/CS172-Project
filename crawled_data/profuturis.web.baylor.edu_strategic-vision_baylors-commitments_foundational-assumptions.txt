Assumptions grounded in faith will make our academic programs both distinctive and excellent, bring greater visibility to the University, and provide a framework for integrating our academic programs, our scholarship and learning, and our community relationships. The foremost of these are: That human decisions should be guided by God as His will and nature are revealed in the crucified and risen Jesus Christ; That all truth is open to inquiry, though many truths will elude us and others may be accessible only through divine revelation; That human life has a meaning and a purpose that is not simply a matter of human choice; That we have a fallen nature that needs both healing and direction; That we are a created part of nature but have been given responsibility as stewards — made in the image of God — for its care and management; That we find the highest order of personal fulfillment in working constructively for the betterment of others, and that we have an obligation to do so; That we need to be active, regularly worshiping members of the body of Christ as a context of our spiritual growth, as a source of encouragement, and as a partnership in the work of God’s kingdom; That human beings flourish best in a functional and beautiful physical environment and among colleagues who respect, love, forgive, and support one another; and That a university can be such a physical and social environment.
