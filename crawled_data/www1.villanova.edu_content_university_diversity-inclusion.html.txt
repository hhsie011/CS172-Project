We believe that an inclusive community fosters an understanding and appreciation for diversity among our students, faculty, staff and administrators. We are committed to cultivating an academic environment that is marked by genuine curiosity about different perspectives, ardent receptivity to knowledge generated through intercultural connections, and a genuine sensitivity to the variety of human experiences. DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION AT VILLANOVA VILLANOVA'S DIVERSITY STATEMENT OUR COMMUNITY Community is at the core of the Villanova experience. It is through a diverse community of scholars and students—representing various viewpoints and experiences—that the Catholic intellectual tradition is best accomplished. The Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion works to address issues of equity and justice throughout our community. Villanova continues to work proactively to expand our welcome to all, embracing diversity in its multitude of forms, including race, gender, ability, ideology, orientation and socioeconomic status. MEET OUR STAFF COMMUNITY DEMOGRAPHICS AEQUITAS: PRESIDENTIAL TASK FORCE ON RACE CONNECTING ACROSS DIFFERENCE Villanova actively seeks to foster an environment in which different perspectives are respected, and all voices are valued. The Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion currently offers a variety of workshops and lectures for faculty, staff or students that encourage self-reflection, understanding and individual growth. Students, faculty and staff can also participate in Intergroup Relations (IGR), an innovative program developed on the core belief that it is only through a process of sustained and meaningful dialogue that people will understand one another better through cultural misunderstandings and personal differences.
