Published 07.08.2020 Share Share this page on Facebook Share this page on Twitter Share this page on LinkedIn Copy Link In 1978 Parker became director of Oakland's Feminist Women's Health Center and in 1980 she founded the Black Women's Revolutionary Council, a group of revolutionary feminists intended to educate people about the effects of racism, classism, and sexism. Her other works included Womanslaughter (1978), Movement in Black: The Collected Poetry of Pat Parker, 1961–1978 (1978), and Jonestown and Other Madness (1985). In this recording, Parker reads the title poem from Jonestown and Other Madness, which alludes to the mass murder-suicide that took place at the People Temple Agricultural Project in Guyana in 1978 at the behest of charismatic cult leader Jim Jones. About 70 percent of the number of victims in Jonestown were Black.

Transcript of audio recording [start of track] [Pat Parker speaking] This next poem is a title poem for my next book, which will be called Jonestown and Other Madness. [noise from audience] This poem is the title poem from my next book which will be called Jonestown and Other Madness. And depending upon [pause] what I feel about a contract that's in my briefcase, and what they feel about the rest of the poems that are included in the book, it will probably be published by a local women's press that has the same initials as I do. [laughter, applause] Now did y'all figure that out? [laughter] As a child in Texas race education was simple was subtle was sharp The great lone star state sharply placed me in colored schools with colored teachers and colored books and colored knowledge I shopped in white stores and bought colored clothes ‘Keep the colors loud and bright so they dazzle in the night No matter where a nigger’s bred they love yellow, orange and red’ I used colored toilets and road colored buses home I went to colored churches with colored preachers and prayed to a white God begged forgiveness for Cain and his sin and his descendants us lowly colored sinners and the message was simple and sharp there is a place for niggers but not among good white folk At home race education was simple was subtle facts gleaned by differences The white man who jumped free-fell in the sky was quietly dismissed ‘white folks are crazy’ the white man who turned somersaults on Sports Spectacular skis was quietly dismissed ‘white folks will do anything for money’ [laughter from crowd] the white man who shot and killed his wife and children and then himself received a headshake and a sigh and the simple statement ‘white folks are crazy’ And the messages fell in place white folks went crazy and went to nut houses Black folks got mad and went to jail white folks started wars Black folks died in them white folks owned America Black folks built it As I grew into adulthood many messages were discarded many were forgotten but one returns to haunt me Black folks do not commit suicide Black folks do not Black folks do not Black folks do not commit suicide November 18, 1978 more than 900 people most of them Black died in a man-made town called Jonestown Newscasters’ words slap me in my face people's tears and grief emanating from my set and I remember the lessons reheard a childhood message Black folks do not commit suicide I thought of my uncle Dave he died in prison suicide the authorities said "Boy just up and hung himself" and I remembered my mother her disbelief, her grief ‘Them white folks killed my brother Dave didn't commit no suicide’ and the funeral a bitter quiet funeral his coffin sealed from sighters and we knew Dave died not by his hands some guard decided that nigger should die And I stare at the newscaster he struggles to contain himself it's a BIG BIG story and he must not seem too excited ‘American troops made a grizzly discovery today in Jonestown, Guyana’ my innards scream as the facts unfold ‘a communist preacher’ and I see old Black women my grandmothers communist NO little old Black ladies do not believe in communists [laughter from crowd] they believe in God and Jesus yet, the newscasters’ words a commune a media storm of words and pictures interviews with ex-members survivors, city officials the San Francisco Chronicle had a problem with its presses erratic delivery of the morning paper and in two days the Chronicle publishes a book Eyewitness Account of a staff reporter who survived the airport attack and the story grows bigger STEP RIGHT UP STEP RIGHT UP Ladies and Gentlemen have I got a tale for you we got these men two men a congressman & a preacher & a supporting cast of hundreds the congressman went to investigate the preacher and wound up dead the preacher wound up dead the supporting cast wound up dead and all the dead are singing to me Black folks do not Black folks do not Black folks do not commit suicide My phone rings the newscaster mistakenly says Patricia Parker not Parks died on the airstrip a friend wants to know are you alive? Yes I am here not there festering in a jungle with bloated belly not a victim in a dream deferred not a piece in a media puzzle not a member in the supporting cast. Yet I am there walking with the souls of Black folks crying and screaming WHY WHY Black folks why are you here and dead? tell me how you willingly died did the minister sing to you ‘Kool-aid Kool-aid tastes great I like Kool-aid can't wait’ I see Black people beautiful Black people in lines in front of a tub of twentieth-century hemlock The guards with guns guns why guns? and the pictures continue to flow images of a man a church man he cures disease NO he's a fake hired people in treated liver he loves God NO he's a communist he talks many messages revolution to the young God to the old he believes in the family NO he destroys the family fucks the women fucks the men and the media continues to tell the tale An interview with a live one. Newscaster. ‘You were a member of People's Temple?’ Man, ‘Yes, I was.’ ‘Why did you join?’ ‘Well, I went there a few times and then I stopped going, but Reverend Jones came by my house and asked me why I quit coming. I was really surprised. No one had ever cared that much about me before.’ No one had ever cared that much about me before and it came home the messages of my youth came clear the Black people in Jonestown did not commit suicide they were murdered they were murdered in small southern towns they were murdered in large northern cities they were murdered as school children by teachers who didn't care they were murdered by policemen who didn't care they were murdered by welfare workers who didn't care they were murdered by shopkeepers who didn't care they were murdered by politicians who didn't care they didn't die at Jonestown they went to Jonestown dead convinced that America and Americans didn't care they died in the schoolrooms they died in the streets they died in the bars they died in the jails they died in the churches they died in the welfare lines Jim Jones was not the cause he was the result of 400 years of not caring Black folks do not Black folks do not Black folks do not commit suicide Thank you.
