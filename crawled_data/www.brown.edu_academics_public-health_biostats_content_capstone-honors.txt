The Concentration is based on several premises: that statistics is a scientific discipline in its own right, with specialized methodologies and body of knowledge; that it is essentially concerned with the art and science of data analysis; and that it is best taught in conjunction with specific, substantive applications. To this end, the Concentration is designed to provide foundations that include basic statistical concepts and methodologies, and to expose students to the role of statistical thinking and analysis in interdisciplinary research and in the public sphere. The Concentration prepares students for careers in industry and government, for graduate study in statistics or biostatistics and other sciences, as well as for professional study in law, medicine, business, or public administration. Diversity Statement: The Department of Biostatistics has a deep respect for the views of all people. We welcome and, indeed, seek differences in opinion, experiences and individuals. The Department is dedicated to an open and welcoming environment where diverse cultures and lifestyles can converge and work together to strengthen, inform and develop the science of statistics. We encourage the infusion of our undergraduate concentrators to enrich and strengthen the education, research and collaborative spirit within Brown University’s Department of Biostatistics and the School of Public Health. Concentration Advising Direction and advising can be sought from the Statistics Concentration Director, Associate Professor Roee Gutman, who can be reached at [email protected]. Administrative support and general assistance can be sought through the Academic Department Manager, Denise Arver ([email protected]), or the Student Affairs Coordinator, Rose Benar ([email protected]). Capstone & Honors The capstone experience enables students to participate in an extensive data analysis project or in the development and evaluation of statistical methods. The usual format is a semester-long independent study under the supervision of one of the professors in the Department of Biostatistics or affiliated departments. During the independent study, students are expected to work with a professor on research projects that include major statistical components. When the supervising professor is outside of the Department of Biostatistics, the Director of the Undergraduate Statistics Concentration oversees the capstone experience to ensure it includes a substantial statistical component that fulfills the intentions of the Concentration. An example of recent capstone project includes an analysis of the United States Renal Data System to identify whether doctors tend to increase the doses of Erythropoiesis-stimulating agent towards the end of life. Another example is an evaluation of a method designed to identify pairs of Veteran Administration nursing homes with similar past hospitalization and mortality rates that will be randomized within pairs in a future clinical trial. Honors in statistics requires the completion of a senior thesis and a superior record in the program. Concentrators who choose to write honor thesis are required to write a manuscript that describes a major project of statistical data analysis that they performed or a simulation study to evaluate the performance of a statistical method. Students that decide to write an honor thesis will generally integrate their capstone project into their thesis. Examples of recent honor thesis include a comparison of the performance of Integrated Nested Laplacian Approximation to Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for missing data imputation, and A Bayesian multinomial logistic regression analysis of the influence of genetic predisposition for risk-taking and perceived behavior of role models on Mexican-American adolescent alcohol use.
