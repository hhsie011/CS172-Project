Our programs and curricula receive global recognition for their strength and continued contributions to the field of marketing. For more information visit the Department of Marketing website. Marketing involves developing goods and services to satisfy customers’ needs and then making them available at the right places, at the right times and at competitive prices. Marketing also provides information to help customers decide whether specific goods and services will meet their needs. Recent changes in social and economic systems have created new challenges for marketing professionals. Increasingly, they must focus on both domestic and global opportunities and the explosive changes that new technology brings. They must also be continually responsive to cultural differences, quality concerns and ethical issues. The Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) in Marketing prepares students to work effectively in corporate and nonprofit organizations that are part of a global economy. Marketing students will be proficient in marketing analytics, digital marketing, customer experience management, and creativity and brand management. Students completing a degree in marketing choose between five tracks: advertising strategy, analytics and consulting, healthcare marketing, professional selling and sales management, and strategic retailing. A career path in marketing typically begins in an entry-level position in advertising, retailing, marketing analytics, marketing consulting, professional selling, or healthcare marketing. Opportunities are available in manufacturing, wholesale and retail, as well as nonprofit organizations such as universities, government agencies, relief agencies and charitable organizations. Success in marketing requires understanding a number of fundamental concepts, principles, theories, tools and techniques. Courses are designed to help students acquire this knowledge and to develop competencies needed throughout a marketing career. Marketing Academic Advising Academic advising and career guidance for upper division marketing majors is available in the Department of Marketing office, Suite 220 Wehner Building, (979) 845-2309.
