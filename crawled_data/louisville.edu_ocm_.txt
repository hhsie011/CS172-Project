The Office of Communications & Marketing (or OCM for short) serves the University by providing branding, strategy, messaging, and creative production for marketing and communication projects and initiatives throughout the university. Start a project Quick help How can we help? Messaging Messaging is what shapes perception and it's at the foundation of everything we do. Telling our stories in an exciting way while maintaining the authenticity at the core of our culture can be difficult, but we're here to help you do just that. Strategy While our primary charge is university-wide strategy, we also assist units on campus with their individual marketing and communication initiatives. We can make sure your content gets delivered to the right audience at the right time. Production We maintain a growing list of assets, templates, and services that can assist in your marketing and communication efforts. Review the various types of campus support we provide and let us know how we can better help you reach your goals.
