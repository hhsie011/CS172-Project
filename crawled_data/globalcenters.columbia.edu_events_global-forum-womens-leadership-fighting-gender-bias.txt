6:00 PM Museu do Amanhã (Praça Mauá, 1 - Centro, Rio de Janeiro) Bias is everywhere, beacuse it is often unconscious. >> Check out the full program On December 08, the Global Forum on Women’s Leadership: Fighting Gender Bias will discuss the importance of representation to fight gender bias by bringing together outstanding women leaders. Speakers will discuss how this issue transforms workplaces and lives in three major areas: environment and sustainability, education and technology. We can all make biased judgments, decisions and arguments almost without being aware. However, by actively focusing on counter-stereotypical role models in our environment and relationships, we can change our mindsets and those of others as well. Representation, for example, plays a big role in this process. Seeing women in leadership positions changes the way we think about the role of women in society. Come join us on this discussion at the Museu do Amanhã in Rio de Janeiro. This first edition of the Global Forum on Women's Leadership is an integral part of the Columbia Women’s Leadership Network in Brazil. The program selects and trains up to 20 senior level professionals annually with the goal of creating a growing network of women who will contribute to the transformation of public service in Brazil. Designed by the Columbia Global Centers | Rio de Janeiro, the program is sponsored by Instituto Humanize and Instituto Republica. >> Simultaneous translation will be provided >> Participation certificates will be provided Institutional Support: Fundação Lemann, Museu do Amanhã and Câmara de Comércio França-Brasil do Rio de Janeiro. >> Confira a programação completa No dia 08 de dezembro, o Global Forum on Women’s Leadership: Fighting Gender Bias vai discutir com grandes lideranças a importância da representatividade feminina para combater o viés de gênero inconsciente. Palestrantes vão debater como essa questão é capaz de transformar os locais de trabalho e vidas em três grandes áreas: meio ambiente e sustentabilidade, educação e tecnologia. Quase nunca estamos cientes do viés de gênero que influencia muitas de nossas escolhas. Estamos tão acostumados com determinados padrões que não percebemos os critérios que utilizamos. A consequência disso é que menos mulheres acabam ocupando os cargos de liderança e poder. Desfazer essas armadilhas não é fácil, mas a boa notícia é que existem caminhos possíveis. Um deles é o aumento da representatividade feminina. Convidamos você para participar dessa discussão no Museu do Amanhã. Esta primeira edição do Fórum faz parte do Columbia Women’s Leadership Network in Brazil. O programa seleciona anualmente 20 profissionais de nível médio-sênior com o objetivo de desenvolver uma crescente rede de mulheres que contribuirão para a transformação do serviço público no Brasil. Organizado pelo Columbia Global Centers | Rio de Janeiro, o programa é patrocinado pelo Instituto Humanize e o Instituto Republica. >> Haverá tradução simultânea >> Ofereceremos certificados de participação Apoio Institucional: Fundação Lemann, Museu do Amanhã e Câmara de Comércio França-Brasil do Rio de Janeiro.
