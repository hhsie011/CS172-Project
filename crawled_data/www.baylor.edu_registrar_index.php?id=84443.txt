DARS is a computerized system that monitors a student's progress towards graduation. DARS produces a degree audit to track the completion of degree requirements as specified by the Baylor University Catalog. What are the benefits of DARS? Provides immediate, updated access to a student's progress toward graduation. Access is available to students, advisors and graduation check-out personnel. Provides accurate advisement information via paper audits or on-line access for each student. Allows for program simulation for major changes. Students can ask "What If..." and get immediate information about the effect of changing majors. Provides clarity and consistency of degree requirements. Provides automatic calculation of major GPA's for degree check-out. How do I get a degree audit? Degree audits may be obtained through the Office of the Registrar. Simply present your student ID and ask the Records Office personnel for your degree audit. Students may also access degree audits through BearWeb. How to read the audit. The key to reading the audit is to scan the "YES" and "NO" column on the far left side. All requirements that are complete will have a "YES". (Some will have a "NA". These are also considered complete.) Incomplete requirements will show a "NO". In BearWeb you can click on the box next to the "YES" or "NO" and the audit will take you directly to that requirement. Each requirement will list how many sub-requirements have been completed and how many are still needed. A "+" means the sub-requirement is complete. Incomplete sub-requirements will have a "-". Some audits will have a "WORK NOT APPLICABLE" section. These courses are counting in the total hours and GPA; they're just not needed for the particular degree plan. What if I have questions? Any questions or concerns regarding the degree audit may be directed to the DARS Coordinator in the Office of the Registrar or to a degree planner in the appropriate school.
