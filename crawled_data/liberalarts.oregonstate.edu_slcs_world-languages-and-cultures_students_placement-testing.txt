The test is computer based, multiple choice, and adapts to proficiency as you go. We offer this test for the following languages: Chinese, French, German, Russian, Italian and Spanish. Keep in mind the following before taking the test. All tests must be taken within 30 days of signing in for access to the placement exams. You can take the test only one time per language during your OSU affiliation; only the first attempt will be recorded, no exceptions. Only take it if you know you will be taking language courses in the current academic year, otherwise your results will be outdated for the following school year. Degree/credential-seeking students, not sure if you have to take the placement test? If you're doing a BS, and you are not planning on taking language courses, you do not have to take the test, unless you need to take language courses for the admissions language requirement. All students interested in taking language courses and those fulfilling the BA language requirement, who do not have AP/IB, or college credit, are required to take a language placement test before enrolling in a language course. If you have AP/IB, or college credit, an academic advisor can recommend a course once your credit has been added to MyDegrees. You can hold off on taking the placement test for now. Once your credits have been added to MyDegrees, contact the WLC advisor. See advising section below. Non-degree students need to take the placement test. Please note that we do not review transcripts. Prospective students can take the placement test. Where it prompts you to enter a student ID, you may enter 000000000, although your score cannot be recorded and you will not be able to register for a class until you provide your OSU ID#. Using your OSU email account, you may send a note to Helen Wilhelm with this information. To prepare for the test, please read below: Have your OSU ID# ready to enter at the testing portal. If you do not have an ID, contact the Office of Admissions. Prospective students enter a 000000000. Provide your OSU email address, and only this address. Don't have one? Create one here. Prospective students enter a personal email address where you can be contacted. This test takes anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour. Please make sure you only have the testing window open. By taking the test, you also promise not to cheat. Resources cannot be used. Doing so will violate the Code of Student Conduct at Oregon State University To begin your test please go to http://bit.ly/30igpE4. No passwords are needed. Additional Test Information Students seeking a Japanese placement exam should email Etsuko Sisley. Ecampus students inquiring about the Japanese placement test should email Mika Archer.
