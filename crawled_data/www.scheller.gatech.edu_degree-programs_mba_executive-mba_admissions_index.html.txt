Executive MBA Events Meet Us Executive MBA Admissions Georgia Tech Scheller's Executive MBA program (EMBA) can act as a catalyst for career advancement and personal growth. Our 17-month, on-campus program features Friday evening and Saturday classes on select weekends, allowing you to balance work, life, and a life-changing MBA experience. Unlike a traditional full-time or evening MBA program designed for young professionals early on in their careers, an Executive MBA program is ideal for seasoned professionals looking to propel their career. An EMBA program is intended to teach a current or soon-to-be leader how to be a more effective manager and focuses on increasing leadership skills. The average Executive MBA student has about 10 to 15 years of full-time, professional work experience. Because this type of student tends to have significant work obligations, Executive MBA course schedules are designed to accommodate demanding lives and careers. Students bring a wealth of knowledge from a vast array of industries and functional areas into the classroom, creating an unparalleled environment for learning and networking. Executive MBA graduates earn the same MBA degree as their traditional full-time and evening MBA counterparts but do so on select weekends within an expedited 17-month format. The program enrolls once a year with classes beginning in the fall. The program is now accepting applications for Fall 2022, with classes starting August 2022. Prospective students are encouraged to request their admissions interview prior to applying to determine standardized test waiver eligibility and program fit. With five application deadlines to choose from, you can lay out a self-paced plan to prepare and apply for the program when the time is right. The earlier you apply, the quicker you gain access to the benefits of the Executive MBA program prior to the first day of class. Schedule a one-on-one consultation with a member of the admissions team to discuss the program, receive help assessing your MBA goals, understand the admissions process, and plan your application timeline. Start your application Application Deadlines Application Deadline Interviews Decision Release Deposit Due Round 1 November 15, 2021 Can be completed before or after application has been submitted.
