This program will enable you to work alongside other students and professors to prepare you for a career in litigation. A student who receives the Certificate in Advocacy demonstrates knowledge of fundamental principles of trial and appellate advocacy, as well as competence in the skills essential to a career in litigation. In turn, Certificate in Advocacy graduates are attractive to law firms seeking to hire litigation attorneys who enter the practice of law with practical training. For more information about the Certificate in Advocacy program, please contact Prof. Barbara Kritchevsky at bkrtchvs@memphis.edu or (901) 678-3239. Curriculum Students in the Certificate in Advocacy Program not only take courses that teach legal rules and principles in a traditional classroom setting but also put those ideas into practice through client representation, skills courses and participation in Moot Court, Mock Trial and Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) travel teams. The out of class component enables students to work with practicing attorneys and make contacts in the legal community. Certificate Requirements Certificate requirements are available on the Certificate Comparison Chart here.
