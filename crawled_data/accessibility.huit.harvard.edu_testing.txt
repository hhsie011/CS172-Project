There are simple ways to check content with automatic tools and non-technical tests to see if your content is accessible and inclusive to everyone. You can also check mobile accessibility with Android Talkback and iPhone. As you test, track your findings in a report to streamline remediation. Automated Tools for Testing Automated tools evaluate a website’s code and content, flag accessibility issues, and often provide guidance on how to fix the issues. These tools save time for both developers and content creators, and they often catch errors that might not be obvious. Harvard-Licensed Tool: Siteimprove Siteimprove breaks down accessibility issues into manageable tasks, tracks progress toward compliance, and provides recommendations and guidance. Free Automated tools There are hundreds of helpful accessibility tools, so we’ve selected a few of our favorites that we recommend to evaluate the accessibility of websites. Qualtrics Forms Accessibility Qualtrics is web-based survey software to support teaching and research at Harvard. Qualtrics provides a range of guidance on accessibility. Manual Testing Methods While automated tools are a huge help in accessibility testing, they can’t catch every error, since they can’t understand context or evaluate content quality. So after you’ve done a first pass with automated tools, you’ll need to follow up with manual testing to make sure your website is inclusive and accessible.
