Policies and procedures may change with approval of the appropriate university officer. No employee may rely on or otherwise interpret a statement or promise by a supervisor, manager or department head as constituting a change in policy, nor will any such statement or promise constitute an agreement between the university and an employee. Employee Manual The Employee Manual was prepared to help you become familiar with Temple University’s policies and procedures. Please read it carefully. If you have questions or concerns, please speak with your supervisor, who should be able to answer your questions or direct you to someone who can. Rules of Conduct The Rules of Conduct supplement the Employee Manual by providing further guidance on expected conduct and performance. This document is not intended to, nor does it create, any contractual relationship between any employee and Temple University with respect to the conduct the university may prohibit or the discipline the university may impose. At-will Employment An at-will employee may end their employment at any time, for any reason, with or without notice to Temple University, with or without cause. Likewise, Temple University may terminate an at-will employee at any time, with or without notice, for any reason, with or without cause. Further, an at-will employment relationship with Temple University does not create an express or an implied agreement for continued employment for any period of time. Unless otherwise covered by a collective bargaining agreement or written contract with fixed terms of employment, all Temple University employees are what the law terms at-will employees, and nothing in the Employee Manual and Rules of Conduct changes their at-will employment status.
