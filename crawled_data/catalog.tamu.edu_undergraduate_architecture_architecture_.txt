The four-year Bachelor of Environmental Design (BED) degree prepares students for challenging careers in industries supporting the built environments. The program produces graduates who are prepared to influence society with informed and visionary designs—designs that ensure sustainability by responding to cultural, social, economic and ecological factors. Students interested in professional registration as an architect must complete a National Architectural Accreditation Board (NAAB) accredited Master of Architecture program in addition to the four-year undergraduate Bachelor of Environmental Design degree. Enrollment in Environmental Design Architectural Studies Upper Level Program Students must have satisfactorily completed at least 54 hours of coursework with a minimum GPA of 2.5 for those courses completed at Texas A&M University. Students must satisfactorily complete the following courses as part of the 54 hours of coursework with a minimum of a 2.5 GPA to apply for upper level.

The application is to be submitted by the following date. March 1 for Summer and Fall admission Students applying for upper level must submit a portfolio that provides documentation of the applicant’s design representation and creative problem solving ability. Portfolios will be reviewed as evidence supporting design ability. Guidelines are outlined on the application form and in the Student Services office. Students will be admitted according to available space. Preparation for Professional Studies in Architecture Although the four-year BED degree at Texas A&M University is a pre-professional degree and is not accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB), those who have completed this pre-professional degree can apply to an accredited Master of Architecture program, which is offered at Texas A&M University. In the United States, most state architectural registration boards require, as the prerequisites for licensure, a degree from a National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB) accredited professional degree program, the fulfillment of the National Council of Architectural Registration Board’s (NCARB) Internship Development Program (IDP), and the successful completion of NCARB’s Architectural Licensing Examination (ARE). The NAAB, which is the sole agency authorized to accredit U.S. professional degree programs in architecture, recognizes three types of degrees: the Bachelor of Architecture (BArch), the Master of Architecture (MArch), and the Doctor of Architecture (DArch). Students should consult the Texas A&M Master of Architecture, NAAB and NCARB websites for additional information. Transfer and Change of Major Students Transfer and change of major students (students currently enrolled in another major at Texas A&M University) who are admitted to the Department of Architecture are classified as lower level (EDAL). Transfer students who meet all the criteria for admittance to upper-level studies may immediately apply for admittance to upper level. Transfer students who have completed at least 24 graded transferable hours, and change of major students who have completed at least 12 graded transferable hours are encouraged to participate in a 10-week summer module offered by the Department of Architecture. The summer module is designed to provide an intensive first-year design studio sequence along with support coursework that will enable change of major and transfer students to qualify for sophomore design studios the following semester. This summer module can enable Transfer and Change of Major students to complete the four-year degree in a more efficient and timely manner. Transfer students accepted into the Bachelor of Environmental Design degree program must submit a portfolio to the Department of Architecture to receive credit for drawing and design studio classes taken at another university or college, unless the course is listed as an equivalent under the Texas common course numbering system. The review of the portfolio will ensure appropriate studio placement. Additional information may be found on the Department of Architecture website.
