"Time, Life, & Matter..." features many important instruments that helped make those contributions possible. Five themes serve as the framework for exploring interconnected ideas across disciplinary and chronological lines: Colonial Science Natural Philosophy Astronomer’s Time Mind and Body Physical Matters Highlights of the exhibit include a multitude of stories told in part by such items as a geometric sector designed by Galileo, electrical experimentation apparatus purchased on Harvard's behalf by Benjamin Franklin, a suite of clocks illustrating the development of modern synchronized time-keeping, medical apparatus designed, in part, by Charles Lindbergh (yes, that Charles Lindbergh), and the artifacts of top-secret research conducted by Harvard scientists during World War II. Have a close-up look at the instruments featured in "Time, Life, & Matter..." using Waywiser. Faculty Director Peter Galison offers an exhibit overview on CHSI's YouTube channel. _________________________________________________________________ Ongoing Permanent Exhibit The Putnam Gallery, Science Center 136 Exhibitions Current Exhibitions The Putnam Gallery Time, Life, & Matter: Colonial Science Special Exhibitions Gallery The Interpretation of Drawings: Freud & the Visual Origins of Psychoanalysis Satellite Exhibitions Past Exhibitions The Collection Online Gallery Guide for Time, Life, & Matter "Telltale Apparatus," Harvard Magazine 2006 _______________________________ Join Our Mailing List I Contact _______________________________ The Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments 1 Oxford Street, Cambridge, MA 02138 chsi@fas.harvard.edu p. 617-495-2779 • f. 617-496-5794 _______________________________ The CHSI is one of the Exhibition Hours The Putnam Gallery (Science Center 136) : Sunday through Friday 11:00am - 4:00pm.
