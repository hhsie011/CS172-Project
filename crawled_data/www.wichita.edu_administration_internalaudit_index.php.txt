Internal Audit provides independent, objective internal audit and consulting services that help Wichita State University achieve its objectives and fulfill its vision. As required by the Kansas Board of Regents' Internal Audit Policy, the Director of Internal Audit has a direct reporting line to the University President on all audit matters. WSU was the first state university in Kansas to undergo a Quality Assurance Review (QAR). A QAR is a peer review of an internal audit function similar to an academic program or college accreditation visit. The WSU internal audit function received the reviewers' highest rating. "My goal as Director of Internal Audit is to help foster a risk-intelligent community that is alert to and proactively manages risk at WSU."
