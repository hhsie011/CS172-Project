Students from diverse disciplines work directly with clinicians and healthcare professionals to address their engineering design challenges. In the last five years, our students have worked closely with more than 32 clinicians at RIH, Women & Infants, and beyond to produce 41 collaborative projects and in the process have filed at least 4 patents and won 3 recent design competitions. A huge part of our success so far is due to the connections we have made with clinical faculty to identify clinical needs and provide expert guidance to students. If you have an idea for an an unmet need that you would like to collaborate on and see reduced to practice, please submit a design proposal.
