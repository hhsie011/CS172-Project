College Credit for Heroes is a partnership between the Texas Workforce Commission, the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board and Texas colleges and universities. The College Credit for Heroes (CCH) program seeks to maximize college credit awarded to veterans and service members for their military experience. CCH is designed to recognize the knowledge and skills gained by military service members and to award college credit for military experience, enabling veterans to more easily re-enter the workforce. Each participating institution retains the right to determine applicability to specific degrees and certificates. Texas Tech University (TTU) is a partner institution in the CCH program. Texas Tech University as a participating Texas university in the CCH program agrees to accept college credits recommended through the College Credit for Heroes System where appropriate. Recommended college credits may be applicable to some programs of study but not applicable to others.
