The exhibit explores how puppets have captured our imagination by examining specific puppets, universal characteristics, international aesthetics, and local puppet companies. It also asks a playfully provocative question: What makes a puppet? The diversity of puppet styles and techniques displayed provides the opportunity for visitors to think more broadly about an art form that transcends cultural boundaries, while also demonstrating how puppets work.
