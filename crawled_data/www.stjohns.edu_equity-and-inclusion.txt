Employee Resource Groups Click to Open In the Fall of 2020, the University announced the launch of formal Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) at St. John’s. ERGs are voluntary, employee-led groups that help to foster an equitable and inclusive workplace, as well as cultivate a greater sense of belonging. ERGs are open to all St. John’s University faculty, administrators, and staff. An ERG may form around a shared identity, a shared interest or concern, or a professional/career affiliation. Preference in the initial launch will be shown to ERGs that support minoritized social identities in our workplace. An ERG Proposal Form and Getting Started Guide, along with a comprehensive ERG Guidebook and other program resources, are available on St. John’s Connect. To learn more, login to St. John's Connect and click on Campus Resources. From the Resources header, click the "Employee Information" icon and then "Employee ERGs." Employees who are interested in starting a group are encouraged to review the ERG resources, and then identify two coleaders to complete the required proposal information online.
