Requirements to transfer (as a current NC State student) into specific College of Education majors are listed below. This includes students who desire to change their major, as well as those who want to add an Education major. Students must meet the listed “Minimum Requirements” in order to submit an online CODA application to transfer (see CODA Application). These requirements must be complete at the time the application is submitted. All admission is competitive and based on space availability in the specific program. Meeting the requirements does not guarantee admission to the desired major. If you have questions about transferring to programs in the College of Education, contact the College of Education Student Success and Advising Center, or call 919-515-0595. *Note: Beginning in 2021, rising juniors interested in the Elementary Education program should submit a CODA by the February 1st CODA deadline. Department of Teacher Education and Learning Sciences Education General Studies Minimum requirements for Education General Studies, Learning Design & Technology: Completion of 12 or more NC State graded credit hours, and Cumulative GPA must be 2.5 or above Elementary Education Beginning in 2021, rising juniors should submit a CODA by the February 1st CODA deadline. Minimum requirements for Elementary Education: Completion of 12 or more NC State graded credit hours, and Cumulative GPA must be 2.75 or above Preferred requirements for Elementary Education: Admission to the Elementary Education program is competitive. Because the program is a cohort model, space is limited to 60 students per classification. Meeting minimum and/or preferred requirements does not guarantee admission into the program due to space limitations. Students are admitted in part due to outstanding academic performance in STEM courses, as well as other factors. Response to the CODA essay should include evidence of commitment to working with K-5 students. This could include any of the following: work and volunteer experience with children, involvement with SAY Village, and commitment to diversity and innovation. If a student is granted admission, it cannot be guaranteed that his/her classification in the Elementary Education program will be the same as his/her university classification. This means that although the university may classify a student as a sophomore according to the number of hours completed, a student may be classified as a first-year student within the Elementary Education program, depending on individual transcript review.
