Analytics Carroll School of Management Accounting Business Analytics Business Law and Society Finance General Management Information Systems Management and Organization Marketing Business Analytics The Department offers undergraduate and graduate courses in the areas of business analytics and operations management. Undergraduate concentrations are offered in both Business Analytics and Operations Management. Business Analytics Courses Business Analytics Faculty Business Analytics Website Print Open All Close All Co-Concentration in Business Analytics Co-Concentration in Business Analytics Business Analytics is the emergent capability for organizations in the twenty-first century. All organizations, regardless of industry, size, or operating environment generate and manage large volumes of data and information that, used well, inform the decision making and competitive capabilities of the enterprise. The emerging area of analytics is focused on using business data to examine what already happened, to determine or predict what will happen, and to explore or model what should happen. Successful managers across functional areas, whether finance, marketing, operations, human resources, or information systems, need to be able to understand and utilize business analytics in order to manage and lead effectively. Business Analytics draws upon a portfolio of methods and tools including statistics, forecasting, experimental design, data mining, and modeling to turn data into information and insights. The business analytics field includes descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics. Descriptive analytics help organizations describe what has happened in their operating environment and includes gathering, organizing, tabulating, and communicating historical information, e.g., how many online subscribers do we have? Predictive analytics helps organizations understand what to do by uncovering relationships and associations in the available data and uses techniques such as probability and forecasting to reveal the likelihood of outcomes. For example, the number of online subscribers increases when we have banner advertising on search sites. Prescriptive analytics is focused on understanding the causal effects that can be discerned from data sets and strives to predict what will happen, given a particular course of action. For example, if we increase our banner advertising and provide one-click subscribing, how will the number of subscribers change? The Business Analytics co-concentration builds upon the Carroll School of Management core. The co-concentration is designed to align with a variety of functional disciplines making Business Analytics an excellent complement to other concentrations including Accounting, Operations Management, Finance, Marketing, Information Systems, or Management and Leadership. Objectives of the Undergraduate Co-Concentration in Business Analytics The objectives of the undergraduate co-concentration are to develop managers who: possess a broad and deep understanding of theories and concepts in business analytics are adept at data management and analysis understand and utilize quantitative techniques for historical analysis, predictive analysis, modeling, and simulation are capable of applying analytical skills and knowledge to address management problems across disciplines and industries Careers in Business Analytics Rather than simply answering questions about what, how, when, and where things have happened, todayâ€™s business analysts are able to push the use of data further, find out why things are happening and what will happen if identified trends continue, and model how an organization can use this information to optimize outcomes. Careers that utilize the skills and knowledge of business analytics continue to emerge and grow in all fields and business disciplines. Students with this co-concentration may pursue careers in consulting, financial services, healthcare services, accountancy, technology management, government, manufacturing, and not-for-profit organizations. The demand for managers with these skills is strong and will increase as firms continue to recognize that they compete not only with new products and services, but also with a high degree of competence in managing their data, information, and business intelligence.

Highly integrative, Operations Management determines how an organization executes its mission and goals. Operations Management is both an art and a science, tying together quantitative analytical skills with cognitive problem solving. The Operations Management concentration provides students with knowledge of current issues in the Operations Management discipline. Intense competition in fast-paced global environments makes competencies in this field critical in both service and goods-producing organizations. This concentration is applicable in many industries and organizations, combining knowledge in business analytics, process design and analysis methods, project management, and operations management issues. The curriculum recognizes environmental, ethical, and social issues. The pedagogy entails lectures and discussions, case studies, field studies, and analytical modeling. The Operations Management concentration builds upon the Carroll School of Management core, particularly complementing courses in statistics, organizational management, and economics. Our courses emphasize analysis and decision making and are explicitly designed to deliver the skills and knowledge required to successfully manage people, processes, and systems in today's competitive environment. The concentration is designed to intersect with other functional disciplines making Operations Management an excellent complement to other concentrations including Accounting, Business Analytics, Finance, Marketing, Information Systems, or Management and Leadership. Objectives of the Undergraduate Concentration in Operations Management The objectives of the undergraduate concentration are to develop managers who: possess a broad and deep understanding of theories and concepts in Operations Management are capable of applying skills and knowledge to address management problems understand and utilize quantitative and qualitative analysis in decision making appreciate the role of operations in an organization and the interrelationships among functional areas Careers in Operations Management Operations managers manage both processes and people, with a highly integrative career path tying together analytical decision making with strategic perspectives and the needs of employees and other stakeholders. Our graduates have successfully attained positions in process management and analysis in major companies such as Accenture, Boston Beer, Deloitte, EY, Fidelity, General Electric, Goldman Sachs, IBM, JPMorgan Chase, and UBS. Students with this concentration may pursue careers in consulting, financial services, healthcare services, retail, transportation, technology, government, manufacturing, and not-for-profit organizations. Students with an operations management concentration are typically hired into positions such as Operations Analyst, Project Team Member, Supply Chain Analyst, Consultant, Process Designer, and Management Trainee, as well as positions on the corporate planning staff. The demand for managers with these skills is strong and will increase as firms continue to recognize that they compete not only with new products, good marketing, and skillful finance, but also with a high degree of competence in managing their operations. Salaries for majors in Operations are and will likely remain competitive with all other concentrations in management.
