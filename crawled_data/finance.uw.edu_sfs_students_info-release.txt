This is to protect your privacy. The complete university policy on student education records and the location of such records may be found in the Washington Administrative Code under WAC 478-140. Additional information is available from the Office of the University Registrar here. Manuals containing the Code are available at Reference Stations on campus and at the Visitor's Information Center. Authorizing Others for Online Access to Your Tuition Account Information Students are able to authorize online access to their statement for up to five people by logging on to MyUW and completing the online Information Release Authorization. This authorization will also allow these individuals to obtain information about your tuition charges over the phone, by email or in-person. When you sign someone up for online access to your account, an email will be sent to them with a temporary password and a link to log into your account information. They will not log into the same MyUW site that students use. In order for the person to access your account information, they will need to know your seven-digit student number. This will NOT be included in the email for security purposes. Online Tuition Statement Login for parents or other authorized users. Authorizing Additional Access to Your Tuition Account Information From your tuition statement on MyUW, you may authorize up to five additional people for phone, email or in-person access to your tuition account information. If you have NOT authorized your parent, spouse or other individual to access your account, tuition information will NOT be given to them.
