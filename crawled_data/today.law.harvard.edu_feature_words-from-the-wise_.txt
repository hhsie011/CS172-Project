The faculty selected as this year’s speakers were Nikolas Bowie ’14, Molly Brady, Stephanie Robinson ’94, and Jon Hanson. Jon Hanson: ‘Recommit to your childhood dreams of justice’ Credit: Lorin Granger In the first of this year’s Last Lectures, Professor Jon Hanson challenged students to think about what justice really means — and whether it’s truly provided by the American legal system or even taught in law school. “The law needs to sell justice like McDonald’s needs to serve burgers,” said Hanson, who is the faculty director of the Systemic Justice Project at Harvard Law School.

But there is, and you can.” Read more and watch the lecture. Stephanie Robinson: ‘Storms can bring you blessings between the raindrops’ Credit: Martha Stewart There were no surfboards in evidence when Stephanie Robinson ’94 delivered the final installment of this year’s Last Lectures. But Robinson, a Harvard Law School lecturer on law and former chief counsel to Massachusetts Senator Edward Kennedy, suggested that soon-to-be Harvard Law School graduates could take some life lessons from the philosophy of that sport.
