Whether you plan to eat in the dining centers often or just once in a while, there's a plan for just about every preference. When you're busy, flexibility is key. With your meal plan, you can eat at any of Syracuse's two food courts, five residential dining centers and fourteen campus cafés. Residential dining centers are “all you can eat” with one meal plan swipe, and each plan comes with guest meals for when you have visitors or if you just want to treat a friend. Meal Plan Eligibility As is stated in the Terms and Conditions of Student Housing, a meal plan is required for all students living in on-campus residence halls. Students residing in campus apartments are not required to purchase a meal plan. Various meal plans are available to students based on earned credits/class standing. Meal Plan Dining Dollars Most meal plans come with an established amount of Meal Plan Dining Dollars. This versatile payment method can be used at various locations on campus, including residential dining centers and campus cafés.
