We advise, teach, and support students in Dean's Scholars, Health Science Scholars, and Polymathic Scholars, the college honors programs that serve all majors in the College of Natural Sciences (CNS). In CNS, honors opportunities fall into three categories: college programs, departmental programs, and academic distinctions. If you are a student, visit our "Frequently Asked Questions" page to learn more. If you are a prospective donor who would like to support CNS students, please visit our giving section. College Honors Programs CNS's college honors programs allow students to take full advantage of the richness and resources of one of the largest and most productive science colleges in the world. Each program is designed to foster faculty-student collaboration and to promote exploration of academic, cultural, and social interests. Students can apply to one of three cohorts: Dean's Scholars Health Science Scholars Polymathic Scholars In addition to their regular coursework, freshmen take a two-semester seminar taught by their program's faculty director. Most semesters thereafter, students join with those in the other two programs in small, learning-for-learning's-sake weekly seminars on a wide range of topics. Recent subjects include science in literature, medical quackery, the 2020 Presidential election, even the history of the banjo (which included the loan of 15 banjos, one for each student). Departmental Honors Programs Departmental honors programs in the College of Natural Sciences are: Turing Scholars (Computer Science) Honors in Advanced Nutritional Sciences (Human Ecology) Honors in Advanced Human Development and Family Sciences (Human Ecology) Texas Honors Computer Science and Business (Texas CSB) Academic Distinctions and Honors Events Academic distinctions and honors events celebrate and recognize exceptional achievement through departmental honors, honors societies, and special events.
