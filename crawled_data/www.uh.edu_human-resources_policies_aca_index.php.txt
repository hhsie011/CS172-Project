The Health Insurance Marketplace was designed to provide individuals/families with a tool for comparing health plans, obtain answers to questions, research tax credit eligibility for private insurance or health programs like the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and the ability to enroll in a health plan that meets their needs. The Health Insurance Marketplace is intended for people who do not have affordable employer-based insurance. The State pays 100% of health insurance premiums for full-time state employees (30 or more hours per week), so they are considered to have affordable insurance and are not eligible to purchase insurance through the Marketplace. ERS has answers to employee's common questions about the ACA. If you have additional questions, more information is available at Healthcare.gov or call (800) 318-2596.
