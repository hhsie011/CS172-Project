For this reason, the College maintains a robust core curriculum across diverse academic disciplines such as the sciences, social sciences, humanities, and fine arts. The unified core curriculum gives the College of Arts & Sciences the chance to offer the best general education in America, and our diversity requirements, which are designed to enhance students’ analytic sophistication and moral understanding about issues related to diversity and inclusion, and foster the interpersonal skills necessary for engaging with diverse populations within the United States and throughout the world, are central to this objective.
