Exercises are intended to test emergency plans, processes, and procedures. TAMU departments and units are highly encouraged to participate in at least one exercise per year to test departmental-level emergency and continuity plans. As a department or unit, you can run your own tabletop exercise to discuss an emergency that applies specifically to your organization. A tabletop exercise is a discussion-based exercise designed to allow you to talk through your policies and procedures surrounding a given situation. While designing an exercise can seem overwhelming, the Emergency Management team is here to help. Below are several resources including online training and relevant documents to assist you in designing and facilitating a tabletop exercise.
