Our subject specialists and curators are available to collaborate with instructors on assignment design and learning objectives, offer in-class instruction in support of course assignments, and meet individually with faculty and students as they engage in their scholarship. The Libraries provide additional support to teaching faculty and researchers in the form of online tutorials, research guides, exhibition programs, and a regular schedule of workshops, office hours, open labs, and public events. The Libraries approach to supporting teaching and learning aims to foster critical literacy with sources and systems in a context of equitable access and inclusive participation. We leverage world-class general and distinctive collections, local and global partnerships, and deep subject expertise to empower learners and advance scholarship. We look forward to partnering with you.
