PreviousNext About the Awards The Neukom Institute Literary Arts Awards "What does it mean to be human in a computerized, digital world?" In an effort to understand, promote, and honor the convergence of art, science, and real life, The Neukom Institute for Computational Science at Dartmouth announced in late 2017 the establishment of the Neukom Institute Literary Arts Awards, a global award program to honor creative works around speculative fiction. The program includes three distinct categories, including one specifically for playwriting. The Neukom Institute is dedicated to supporting and inspiring computational work, and the Literary Arts Awards is part of the Institute's initiative to explore the ways in which computational ideas have an impact on society. The annual award comes with a $5,000 honorarium; winning plays are also workshopped in a two-stage development process over the course of the subsequent year. Staged reading performances take place as part of the Department of Theater's annual summer VoxFest residency and during New Works Now, the annual January festival of new plays at Northern Stage, a LORT-D theater in White River Junction, VT led by Artistic Director and Dartmouth Professor Carol Dunne. The 2021 Award in Playwriting Submitting your work Submissions are now being accepted for the 2021 Neukom Institute Literary Arts Award for Playwriting. Submissions of full-length plays and other full-length works for the theater will be accepted; all submissions must address the question "What does it mean to be a human in a computerized, digitized world?" Playwrights with either traditional or experimental theater pieces, including multimedia productions, are encouraged to submit works to the award program. As in the past, the award comes with a $5,000 honorarium as well as a support for a two-stage development process with table readings at local arts festivals/organizations. Note that works that have received a full production are NOT eligible for the competition. The deadline for all submissions is January 15, 2021. The awards will be announced in the spring of 2021. Submissions must include: An anonymized (blinded) copy of the piece Playwright resume/bio Production history of the piece One-page statement of purpose that answers the following questions: How does your piece address the theme of exploring humanity in our computerized, digital world?" What are your goals for the piece in its current form? How would you use the two-part development process to achieve these goals? The winning piece will receive two readings, at Dartmouth's VoxFest in July 2021 and at Northern Stage in White River Junction VT, during their 2021/2022 season.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Theater Undergraduate Overview Equity and Inclusivity Peer Advisors and Student Representatives The Major Major Requirements Honors Thesis The Modified Major Modified Major Requirements Modifying another Major with Theater The Minor Minor Requirements Courses: offerings by term Course Descriptions Instructor Permission Courses Independent Study Off-Campus Exchange National Theater Institute For Prospective Students Onstage Overview Get Involved Performing and Auditions Directing and Designing Playwriting Stage Managing The Scene Shop The Costume Shop Now Onstage: Upcoming Productions Season Archives: Past Productions Production Photos About Student Productions Workshops and Full Productions Studio Lab: Exploring Theatrical Boundaries YourSpace: Performance Spaces for Creative Minds Student Work in the time of COVID About MainStage Productions Opportunities Overview Summer Theater Lab: Cultivating New Work VoxLab Frost and Dodd Play Festival New York Theatre Workshop Residency The VOICES Program Experiential Learning with Northern Stage Testimonials Student Funding Opportunities Kingsdale Fund Need-Based Funding Goldner Mini-Fellowship Other funding opportunities Funding for Graduate Studies Internships, Fellowships, and Graduate Programs The Neukom Institute Literary Arts Award in Playwriting Foreign Study News & Events All News and Events MainStage Production News Student Production News Honors Thesis Productions Summer Theater Lab News Faculty News Student News Visiting Artist News Alumni News People Faculty and Staff Visiting Artists Alumni Tell Us Your Story Theater and Performance Studies My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
