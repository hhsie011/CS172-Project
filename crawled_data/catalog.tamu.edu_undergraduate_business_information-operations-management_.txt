The INFO department offers two undergraduate degree programs: a Bachelor of Business (BBA) in Management Information Systems and a BBA in Supply Chain Management. Management Information Systems (MISY) is a people-oriented field with an emphasis on service through technology. The BBA MISY degree program is the study of people, technology, organizations, and the relationships among them. MISY professionals help firms realize maximum benefit from investment in personnel, equipment, and business processes. This major is designed for students who have an interest in technology and have the desire to use technology to improve people’s lives. Supply Chain Management (SCMT) includes all the activities that must take place to get the right product into the right consumer’s hands in the right quantity and at the right time – from raw materials extraction to consumer purchase. The BBA SCMT degree program is primarily concerned with the efficient integration of suppliers, factories, planning and forecasting, purchasing, product assembly, moving, storage, distribution, sales, and customer service. This major is designed for students who have an interest in problem solving, are detail-oriented, and a desire to help businesses achieve a sustainable competitive advantage by building and delivering products better, faster and cheaper. In each degree program, students learn how to use technology to make businesses more efficient, effective, and competitive. Coursework includes both the technical and managerial aspects of MISY and SCMT to ensure that students are well-equipped for successful careers in the dynamic, global business environment. A list of recommended courses for each degree program is available from the Department of Information and Operations Management undergraduate advisors, Room 330, Wehner Building.
