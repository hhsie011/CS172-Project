OFDDE assists in faculty recruitment and retention efforts to ensure that Stanford has an excellent and diverse faculty. The office works with deans, chairs and search committees in their outreach efforts to develop talented and diverse applicant pools and to enable equitable review processes. OFDDE also serves as a central resource for faculty recruits, newly hired faculty and early career faculty in their transition to the Stanford community and on their journey towards tenure. We hope that you and your loved ones are staying safe and healthy in these exceptional times. Please visit the OFD COVID-19 Resources and keep in mind the services of the Faculty Staff Help Center and the WorkLife Office, albeit limited by current public health ordinances.
