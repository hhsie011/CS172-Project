This incredible fact explains why there is any water left in the oceans, controls the shape of the large sheets of ice near the Earth’s poles, and excites and confounds glaciologists trying to understand sea level rise. This talk will introduce ice flow and use high school math and physics to explain the shape of the ice sheets. Presenter: Jonny Kingslake, Assistant Professor, Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences Target Audience: Grades 10-12 (and undergraduates) This event is free but registration is required.
