APPLY GET INVOLVED Search this Website Search Fine Arts Parents Council As the parents of young artists and creatives, you are dedicated to supporting your children - driving them to rehearsals and lessons, paying for art supplies and instruments, and cheering them on every step of their journey. Sending your child to college is both exciting and challenging. As they begin the next chapter of their lives, the Fine Arts Parents Council offers a way for families to stay connected with the college, meet other parents, and support all Fine Arts students by raising funds for scholarships. ABOUT THE PARENTS COUNCIL The Fine Arts Parents Council is a special auxiliary group of the Fine Arts Advisory Council. This partnership provides Fine Arts parents with access to all of the benefits of the Advisory Council as well as special programming created just for them. Founded in 1957, the Fine Arts Advisory Council is one of the oldest and largest councils at The University of Texas at Austin. With more than 150 members, this group assists with fundraising, advocacy for the arts and arts education, and advising the dean of the college, Doug Dempster. Under the umbrella of the Advisory Council, Fine Arts parents will be invited to two meetings annually: an all-day business meeting on the UT campus in the fall and regional meetings in major Texas cities in the spring. They will also receive regular news and insights from Dean Dempster and Executive Director of Development Sondra Lomax.
