Students Summer LEAD Program UConn Alliance Pathway Connect Request Information Meet Our Staff Admissions Chat Apply to UConn Making the decision to apply to the University of Connecticut means you understand the importance of a UConn degree and where it can lead. You've taken countless steps to get here, and the entirety of your college application is a testament to who you are, all that you have accomplished along the way, and the many interests and passions that drive what's next. First-Year Applicants International First-Year Applicants Transfer Applicants International Transfer Applicants Our Review Process Every year we strive to create an incoming class of the highest quality, a diverse student body comprised of intellectually curious, highly motivated, and academically accomplished individuals of strong moral character. Our goal is to select future Huskies who will contribute to our inclusive community across the state and around the world, not only through their academic pursuits, but also through their leadership, integrity, and perseverance. Each application is reviewed through a holistic approach for both first-year and transfer applicants. This means no one piece of information-whether it's grade point average, class rank, essays, extracurricular activities, letters of recommendation (optional), or standardized test scores (optional)-will determine if you would be a good fit for our community. Instead selection is based on a comprehensive review of all the information you provide on your application, both academic and personal. This allows us to gain a full understanding of an applicant's potential to thrive at UConn. These are a few areas we consider when reviewing your application Rigor We verify whether you have completed our admission requirements and consider the range and challenge level of the courses you have taken each year Performance We evaluate your GPA, assess trends in grades over time in each subject, and review standardized test scores should you choose to provide them. Involvement We review your strengths, interests, and passions through your contributions to the clubs, organizations, and communities you are a part of. Personal Qualities We consider what we learn about your character and motivations through demonstrated appreciation of multiculturalism, responsibility, and empathy for others. Additional Factors We seek to understand the circumstances that have impacted your course selection, performance, and involvement. If you have ever enrolled full-time at a post-secondary institution and have completed 12 or more credits after graduating from high school, you are considered a transfer applicant. Students looking for non-credit programs, general interest courses, professional development/career enhancement opportunities, or specialized fine arts programs are encouraged to explore UConn's Bachelor of General Studies degree or non-degree credit study. If you were previously enrolled at any UConn campus as a degree student, and are interested in readmission, contact UConn's Dean of Students Office at (860) 486-3426. Students applying to programs in which professional licensure/certification is required are encouraged to review UConn's Program by State Look-up to determine if the program curriculum meets the educational requirements for licensure in your state.
