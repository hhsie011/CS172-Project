Landing pages should be used when you need to: Control page layout Pull in information from elsewhere on the site Create media or info cards NOTE: Because of it's flexibility, Landing Pages are more time consuming to create than Basic Pages. If you do not need to above functionality, we recommend using the Basic Page template. From the top navigation menu, click on Shortcuts > Add Content. From the Add Content menu, choose Landing Page. Select the type of landing page to create. NOTE: This example goes through Create New. Create New allows you to set up your Landing Page from scratch The other options - Homepage, Documents, Events, News, Services, and Staff Directory - create a duplicate of the selected landing page which originally "shipped" with your site. Use this if you accidentally deleted one of these landing pages and need to re-create Once created you can edit the page as needed Add the page title. Start building out the Landing Page Content. Many options in this dropdown are found on other page types: Add image carousel Add single image Add video display Several options in this dropdown are unique to Landing Pages: Add Page Section Add Hero Add Views Display Add Map Location IMPORTANT: All content entered using this dropdown (e.g. images, videos, heros, etc...) will span the entire width of the screen, bleeding off the page. Content must be added within a Page Section to be confined to the width of "normal" column layout.
