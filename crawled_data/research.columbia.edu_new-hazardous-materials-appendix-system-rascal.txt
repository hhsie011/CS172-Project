This affects research that involves in vivo (or in some cases in vitro) use of hazardous chemicals, biological agents, controlled substances, lasers, and/or radiation, which requires the attachment of an Appendix to an IACUC or IRB protocol or for direct submission to EH&S Safety Officers. New Appendices must be created to reflect hazardous materials work for new submissions, renewals or modifications. Old Appendices will not be lost; they will be available as a “snapshot” PDF for researcher’s reference. Weekly Training/FAQ Sessions will be held at EH&S or other Locations.
