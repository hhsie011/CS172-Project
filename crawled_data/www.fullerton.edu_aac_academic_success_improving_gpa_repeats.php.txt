Students may repeat a total of 28 units maximum (16 units of Grade Forgiveness and 12 units of Grade Averaging) for courses where a grade of “C-“ or below was earned. A single course may be repeated twice, for a total of 3 attempts maximum. As of Fall 2016 the application of the repeat policy was automated. At the end of each semester after grades are posted to student records a program is run to apply repeat policy to courses that have been repeated in that semester. The original and repeated courses must be taken here at CSUF. Before repeating a course, ask yourself some questions: Is successful completion of this course required for my major or GEs? Will I be changing my major? Will I be more likely to earn a passing grade this time around? If I am using Financial Aid, will the tuition for the repeated course be covered? Be sure to consult with the Financial Aid department before repeating courses, if you are currently receiving financial aid (University Hall 146, 657-278-3125).
