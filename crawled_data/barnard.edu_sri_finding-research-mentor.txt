It is each student's responsibility to contact faculty, discuss the possibility of working in their lab, and secure confirmation of faculty interest. Steps to Finding a Mentor Identify Your Broad Area of Interest Think about interesting classes you took, or something that you read about in the news, heard about from faculty and friends, or through social media. Perhaps you thought, “This is really cool – I’d like to hear more about it.” This is a good indication that you would enjoy working on this topic longer term. You can also consider whether you want to work with humans, animals, or cells (for example). Do you want to work in a large or small lab? Find People Who Work in this Field Look at faculty profiles on websites at Barnard/Columbia and beyond. Often the best way is to talk to your academic advisor or the SRI representative in your department. They know a lot of people and probably can point you in the right direction. Approaching Your Potential Mentor Approach the potential research mentor by email, express your interest in their work and ask if they have room for an undergraduate student in their research group. Don’t be shy – all those people know that it is your job to look for research opportunities and they will expect these requests. When you contact them, be specific about your interest in their work so they realize that you have done your homework and know what you are talking about. Follow up on their response and ask them for an appointment. If you have not heard back after one week, it is reasonable to call to ask if the potential mentor has had a chance to review your request. In case you reach only voicemail, leave a brief message confirming your name, your hope to be able to work with him/her and that you will resend your original email in the event that it had not been received. Then resend your email. Meeting with Your Potential Mentor Meet with the potential mentor and discuss possible opportunities. Be flexible in terms of your project ideas – the students/mentor partnership works best when both sides are excited about the project. Talk about the SRI timeline and whether there is an opportunity to build a senior thesis on the summer project in the subsequent year if that is your interest. Talking about Funding If you are planning to work with an external mentor, do mention that there are limited funds at Barnard to support students over the summer through the SRI program and that any contribution your mentor can make will help the overall program to fund more students. Again – all mentors know that research costs money and you don’t need to feel that this is an awkward question. If they have no funds to help support you, say that you hope that the Barnard SRI will be able to cover you. Remember that there are several funding sources that support SRI students. Reaching Out to Multiple Potential Mentors Don’t hesitate to be in touch with multiple potential mentors at the same time. Some may never respond to you because they are away or currently have no opportunities and/or are too busy to respond. Additional Support & Questions Remember that your SRI Departmental Representatives are sources of insight and ideas about mentors. Students are encouraged to reach out to them. You may also send questions about the selection process to sri@barnard.edu. Finally, if you would like additional advice about reaching out to mentors, you can schedule a conversation (or complete a walk-in appointment with a Peer Career Advisor) at Beyond Barnard. Mentors at Barnard & Elsewhere Mentors at the College and their Research Areas About 50% of SRI students in a given summer work with mentors whose academic home is at Barnard College. The other half work with mentors at Columbia (including the Medical School, Mailman School of Public Health, Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the Zuckerman Institute, and others), NYU, the Icahn School, The Rockefeller University, and many others across New York City. Below, find a list of Barnard mentors participating in SRI this year: Biology Bauer, Elizabeth, ebauer@barnard.edu (Neural mechanisms underlying emotional memory) Callahan, Hilary, hcallahan@barnard.edu (Ecological genetics) Glendinning, John, jglendin@barnard.edu (Chemical senses, ingestive behavior, food likes and dislikes) Lopatkin, Allison, alopatki@barnard.edu (The spread of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations) Mansfield, Jennifer, jmansfield@barnard.edu (Developmental genetics, Vertebrate development) Miranda, JJ, jmiranda@barnard.edu (Genome organization of human viruses associated with cancer) Morton, Brian, bmorton@barnard.edu (Evolution of plastid DNA) Pischedda, Alison, apischedda@barnard.edu, (Evolutionary Genetics & Animal Behavior) Snow, Jonathan, jsnow@barnard.edu (The cellular stress responses of the honey bee) Chemistry Buzzeo, Marisa, mbuzzeo@barnard.edu, Biological Physical Chemistry (The Buzzeo group uses electrochemical techniques to study fundamental properties and develop sensing applications of redox-active biological molecules.) Campbell, Michael, mcampbell@barnard.edu, Inorganic Chemistry (The Campbell group studies structure/function relationships in transition metal complexes and materials, for applications including catalysis and chemical sensing.) Chatterjee, Subhasish, schatter@barnard.edu, Biophysical Chemistry (Students who work with Dr. Chatterjee apply computer-simulation methods and spectroscopic techniques to investigate the structural and dynamical properties of bioinspired materials. Research interests include molecular self-assembly and the chemical origin of living systems.) Crowther, Andrew, acrowther@barnard.edu, Physical Chemistry & Nanoscience (The Crowther Group uses laser spectroscopy and microscopy to investigate the fundamental structural, electronic, and optical properties of nanostructures.) Donegan, Rebecca, rdonegan@barnard.edu, Biochemistry (The Donegan lab studies how bacterial pathogens acquire essential metals and metallonutrients from the host and incorporate these nutrients into their metabolism.) Liu, Suqing, sqliu@barnard.edu, Teaching Lab Experiment Development (Dr. Liu and her students will develop and test new experiments for the General Chemistry Laboratory curriculum. This work will involve writing and validation of experimental procedures, including use of instrumentation.) Rojas, Christian, crojas@barnard.edu, Organic Synthesis (Rojas and his students develop and apply new reactions for organic chemical synthesis, especially in the area of amino sugar synthesis. Another current interest is working with Prof. Christina Vizcarra's group on the synthesis of small-molecule inhibitors of actin assembly) Vizcarra, Christina, cvizcarra@barnard.edu, Biochemistry (The Vizcarra lab studies the biochemical mechanisms of proteins that regulate the cytoskeleton, with wide-ranging applications in metalloneurochemistry, the auditory system, and drug discovery.)

Each department at Barnard has specific resources, and can provide specific insights, about labs that have previously hosted SRI students. In addition, a great resource are the lists of previous mentors found in the booklets for previous Lida Orzeck '68 Poster Sessions (found on this page). General questions about identifying a mentor at an institution outside of Barnard can be addressed to SRI@barnard.edu.
