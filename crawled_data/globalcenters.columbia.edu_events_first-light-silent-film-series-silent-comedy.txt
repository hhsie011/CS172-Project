10:30 PM Paris Come celebrate the summer with “First Light,” a richly curated selection of classics of the international silent cinema, many featuring live musical accompaniment by students of Jean-François Zygel's piano improvisation class at the Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique et de Danse de Paris. Too few are aware that the silent cinema was a period of almost incomparable artistic creativity; the lack of sound, rather than a hindrance, was actually a kind of inspiration for the era’s finest filmmakers, who found ingenious ways to expand the visual expressiveness of their works. Not surprisingly, the great silent filmmakers—from Méliès to Griffith, from Eisenstein to Buster Keaton—continue to influence and inform contemporary artists across the disciplines. Silent Comedy: Max Linder, Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd Perhaps no area of silent cinema is more beloved than that of the era’s brilliant comedians, who offered touching and perceptive views of society while making their audiences howl with laughter. Works by Max Linder, Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd. With live piano accompaniment by Adelan Nisi from the improvisation class of Jean-François Zygel at the Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique et de Danse de Paris. Created 15 years-ago by Jean-François Zygel, the piano improvisation class at the Conservatoire Supérieur de Musique et de Danse de Paris (CNSMDP) assembles a dozen pianists (undergraduate and masters students) who are engaged in exploring all of the artistic and musical avenues of this ever-expanding field. Whether accompanying performances in dance, theater or silent cinema, piano improvisation requires excellent listening skills and great versatility, as well as in-depth knowledge of musical styles and genres.
