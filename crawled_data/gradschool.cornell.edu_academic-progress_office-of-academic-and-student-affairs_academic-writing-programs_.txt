Do you want to become a more productive writer to meet your goals and deadlines for completing your proposal, thesis, or dissertation? If so, we encourage you to apply for one of the Cornell Graduate School’s Writing Boot Camps, including a Dissertation Writing Boot Camp, Thesis Writing Boot Camp, and Proposal Writing Boot Camp. Each Writing Boot Camp includes group meetings, individual coaching and writing support, and at least four hours of writing each day. Dissertation Writing Boot Camp: The Dissertation Boot Camp is designed for post-A exam students who have an approved dissertation proposal, who have completed their dissertation research, and who are writing chapters of their dissertation. Thesis Writing Boot Camp: The Thesis Writing Boot Camp is designed for master’s students who have an approved thesis proposal, who have completed some or all of their research, and who are writing chapters of their thesis. Proposal Writing Boot Camp: The Proposal Writing Boot Camp is designed for students who have an approved thesis or dissertation topic and who are writing their proposal or prospectus. Participation in Boot Camp requires submitting an application to Jan Allen (Jan.Allen@cornell.edu). Students who are selected to participate will be notified as soon as possible and will receive materials prior to the start of the event. Students who are selected are expected to attend all sessions of the Boot Camp. Productive Writer Newsletter Sponsored by the Cornell Graduate School, the Productive Writer is free and open to all, especially graduate students writing papers, proposals, theses, and dissertations. Once you sign up, you will begin receiving biweekly messages about managing your time for greater writing productivity, reducing distractions, staying motivated, revising and editing, binge writing, communicating with your advisor, dealing with writer’s block, and managing procrastination and perfectionistic tendencies. We hope you will join us to become a more productive writer! Write-Ins Graduate Write-Ins occur Monday through Friday mornings, 8:00 to 11:00 a.m. in the Big Red Barn, so that graduate and professional students with writing goals and deadlines can write in a quiet, supportive environment. Students can be more productive and accountable while writing with a supportive community. Coffee and tea provided. Additional Graduate School Writing Programs Writing Consultations: The Graduate Writing Service provides peer tutors offering one-on-one consultations for graduate students seeking feedback on all kinds of written work. From formal essays to reading responses, from lab reports to personal statements, from PowerPoint presentations to grant applications, tutors support writers at all ability levels in their efforts to communicate more effectively in academic and professional contexts. Writers may visit just once to discuss questions or short projects or visit multiple times to sharpen drafts and build more effective writing skills. There are tutors available who specialize in supporting ESL writers. Writing Support for International Graduate Students: The English Language Support Office (ELSO) offers writing courses, tutoring, and workshops. These services are designed to support graduate and professional students in diverse programs, from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds, and at diverse points in their graduate careers. Land Acknowledgement Cornell University is located on the traditional homelands of the Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' (the Cayuga Nation). The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
