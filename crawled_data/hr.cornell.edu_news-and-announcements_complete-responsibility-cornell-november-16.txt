Go to CULearn All Cornell faculty, staff, and student employees are required to complete Responsibility@Cornell through our internal learning management system, CULearn. This program meets the New York State annual sexual harassment training requirement for all employees as well as federal requirements for new employees. This 45-minute online training program has been redeveloped for 2021 by the Office of Institutional Equity and Title IX (OIETIX) through eCornell and features scenario-based monologues from the Cornell Interactive Theatre Ensemble. The course provides important information about our responsibilities to prevent and respond to sexual harassment in the workplace and about consensual relationships between faculty members, staff members, or others in positions of authority and students or postgraduates. Responsibility @ Cornell includes updates based on Interim Policy 6.3: Consensual Relationships and Interim Policy 6.4: Prohibited Bias, Discrimination, Harassment, and Sexual and Related Misconduct. This training will become available August 25, 2021 and must be completed by October 15, 2021. New employees will have 30 days from their date of hire to complete the training. Note: "Responsibility @ Cornell" is distinct from, and in addition to, the "Advancing Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion" staff training series. You are encouraged to review the following documents in conjunction with this training: Interim Policy 6.3: Consensual Relationships Interim Policy 6.4: Prohibited Bias, Discrimination, Harassment, and Sexual and Related Misconduct Procedures for Resolution of Reports Under Interim Policy 6.4 Additional Resources & Information Office of Institutional Equity and Title IX: 607-255-2242, titleix@cornell.edu Find Your HR Representative Print as PDF Cornell University Working at Cornell Site map About HR Contact HR Facebook YouTube Glassdoor LinkedIn DIVERSITY INITIATIVES Learn more about the university's initiatives and activities focused on creating a more inclusive and welcoming campus.
