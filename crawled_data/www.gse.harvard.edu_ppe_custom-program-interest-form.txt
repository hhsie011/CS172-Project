Contact Us Professional Education collaborates with districts, schools, higher education institutions, departments of education, and other educational organizations to develop learning experiences for the client. We use the same instructional methodologies, curricula, and expert faculty that have established the Harvard Graduate School of Education as a world-class provider of professional development for education leaders and practitioners. Custom programs can be delivered on Harvard’s campus, online, or on-site at a client’s location. We can also create a blended model that incorporates all of these options. It is recommended that the cohort size be at least 50 people. Given the nature of custom programs, the planning process from concept to delivery typically requires at least six months. A Collaborative Approach to Design Your Program Step 1: Conduct Initial Needs Assessment Step 2: Draft Program Outline Step 3: Create and Sign Contract Step 4: Assemble Team, Design Program, and Develop Curriculum and Materials Step 5: Deliver the Program Step 6: Assess the Program, Looking Ahead Have Something Else in Mind?
