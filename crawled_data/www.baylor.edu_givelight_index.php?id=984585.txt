The Fudge Football Operations Center will add more than 100,000 square feet of new space for the Baylor Football Program, creating space within Baylor Athletics' other buildings for greater use by the University's other 18 collegiate athletic programs. The Fudge Football Operations Center will connect to the Allison Indoor Practice Facility, expanding the 80-yard indoor turf field to 100 yards. The Fudge Center will include offices for coaches, equipment staff, medical trainers and a locker room for student-athletes, as well as a medical training room, equipment distribution room, a strength and conditioning weight room and a large team meeting room.

Jeremy Fudge earned a B.A. magna cum laude from Baylor University in 1997. He currently serves as managing partner for Berry Appleman & Leiden LLP, the leading U.S. corporate immigration law firm. He leads the firm's operations, casts vision and strategy and drives the firm's mission and culture. Kristy is a graduate of the University of Northern Colorado. She and Jeremy are parents to four daughters: Brynna, Addison, Calley and Delaynie. Kristy is an active community volunteer, serving on the board of the National Charity League, as well various other committees and boards at their daughters' schools. Kristy became connected to Baylor through her husband and was recognized recently as a new Alumna By Choice in 2021. Jeremy and Kristy, who are members of the Baylor Bear Foundation, previously provided the first endowment gift to Baylor Athletics' Baylor Built program, dedicating to Preparing Champions for Life by providing workshops and seminars to student-athletes to enhance their development and character formation alongside their academic and on-field success. The Fudges are also generous in giving of their time to the University. As at-large campus representatives committed to the success of the Give Light campaign, Jeremy and Kristy provide support to the campaign and serve as Baylor ambassadors within their community.
