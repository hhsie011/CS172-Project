Johnson School of Public Affairs offer a dual degree program leading to the Master of Community and Regional Planning (MSCRP) and the Master of Public Affairs (MPAff). Many leadership positions in government and the nonprofit sector demand both knowledge of substantive community and regional planning issues and innovative approaches to policy analysis development and public management. The program is structured so that students earn both Masters' degrees simultaneously in three years instead of four by eliminating duplicative course work in certain analytic areas and in general electives. Students may choose to start in either program, although they are encouraged to take courses in both schools throughout their time in the dual degree program. Applying to the Dual Degree Program Students must apply to the Graduate School of the University of Texas for admission to the Dual MPAff and MSCRP programs. The admission process includes completion of the GRE examination, transcripts, and an admission form. Applicants must select the correct dual degree code for the PA and CRP programs on the ApplyTexas application. This will route application materials to both programs. Applicants must be accepted by each School's admissions committee. For further application instructions, see the CRP admissions page. A student may apply to the dual degree program after having been admitted to either the MPAff. or MSCRP program, as long as the student has not yet matriculated from either program. The decision to accept a dual degree applicant will be jointly made by both schools' admission committees. Students in the dual degree program may, at any time, request a change of major from the dual degree program to either the MPAff or the MSCRP program. Students who exercise this option may not reenter the dual degree program. Program Structure Public Affairs 21 credit hours required Public Affairs core courses* 6 credit hour Policy Research Project (two-semester course) 6 credit hours public affairs relevant electives 3 credit hours public policy summer internship** Community and Regional Planning 21 credit hours required CRP core courses* 6 credit hour CRP Practicum 6 credit hours CRP or CRP relevant electives Professional Report or Thesis 3 credit hours Professional Report*** OR 6 credit hours Thesis Total Credit Hours Needed: 69 credits * Two of the core courses offered in CRP and LBJ have similar content. Students do not need to take overlapping courses, so plan accordingly: If students take PA 391-Public Financial Management, they must take 3 extra hours of elective credits in CRP. If they take CRP 381-Financing Public Services, they must take 3 extra hours of elective credits in LBJ-Public Affairs. If students takes PA 397 Introduction to Empirical Methods in Policy Analysis, they are not required to take CRP 381M 1-Quantitative Methods. NOTE: Currently, CRP 381M 1-Quantitative Methods does not substitute for PA 397 Introduction to Empirical Methods. **Internships may be counted for elective credit. Students are required to take the following courses before completing the 400-hour public policy internship in LBJ-Public Affairs: Introduction to Empirical Methods, Applied Microeconomics, Public Financial Management and one upper level public policy elective. *** If the first reader of a student's Professional Report is an LBJ faculty member, the student may register for the LBJ Public Affairs Professional Report (PA 398R PROFESSIONAL REPORT). If the first reader is a CRP faculty member, follow the CRP PR/Thesis process and register for the CRP Professional Report (CRP 398R MASTER'S PROFESSIONAL REPORT). http://lbj.utexas.edu/community-and-regional-planning-and-mpaff Programs Architecture Architectural History Community and Regional Planning MSCRP Program Dual Degree and Certificate Programs CRP/Latin American Studies CRP/LBJ School of Public Affairs CRP/LBJ Alumni CRP/LBJ Contact CRP/LBJ Students CRP/School of Law CRP/Sustainable Design CRP/Urban Design PhD program Program Strengths Faculty City Forum Lecture Series CRP Student Organization Resources Career Prospects 2015-16 Strategic Plan Performance Measures Support CRP International Students Student Financial Support Historic Preservation Interior Design Landscape Architecture Sustainable Design Urban Design Quicklinks The University of Texas at Austin School of Architecture 310 Inner Campus Drive B7500 Austin, TX 78712-1009 512.471.1922 UT Privacy UT Web Accessibility Get Adobe Acrobat
