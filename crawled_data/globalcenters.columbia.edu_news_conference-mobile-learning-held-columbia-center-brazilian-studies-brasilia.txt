To do so, the speakers discussed several mobile learning experiences outside of Brazil, and how those experiences can be integrated to Brazilian's policies and improve the country's capacity to develop education, in terms of infrastructure, digital content and teacher training. During the conference there was the launch of the report Mobile Learning in Brazil: management and implementation of current policies and future perspectives, which is based on a study carried out by the Center for Brazilian Studies. The Center, in Columbia, is a part of the Institute for Latin American Studies and it is directed by Gustavo Azenha. The Center works very closely with the Columbia Global Centers | Rio de Janeiro to expand the knowldge exchange between Brazil and Columbia University. The Mobile Learning Conference had keynote speakers such as Cristovam Buarque (Senator), Daniel Barcelos (Undersecretary of Strategic Affairs in the Presidency of the Republic) and Manuel Palácios (Secretary of Basic Education in the Ministry of Education). Several names from the private sector also took part in the discussions, which lasted a day and a half.
