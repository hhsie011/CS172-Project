The Event Management team is here to support you through the process, from booking space, to navigating policy, and connecting you with campus resources needed for your activities - big and small. Make sure to consult resources for student event planning before you get started. Recognized Student Groups need an Event Management System (EMS) account to book space and services.

Special Event Categories There are certain activities that are fun for the community - but also have procedures or policies to be followed as part of organizing. Events with Alcohol Hosting an on-campus event with alcohol service requires careful attention and prior planning. BBQ Events BBQs are permitted in specified outdoor spaces on Columbia's campus - but proper training is required before hosting. Learn more about hosting a BBQ.
