From the Khyber Pass to the Suez Canal, Ahmed’s core research and teaching engage questions of human mobility, travel, and migration; students, scholars, and networks of learning; and the intersections of constitutionalism, citizenship, and diplomacy. His first book, Afghanistan Rising: Islamic Law and Statecraft between the Ottoman and British Empires (Harvard University Press), received the American Historical Association’s John F. Richards Prize in 2018 and is currently being translated into Turkish, Persian, and Pashto. Professor Ahmed’s current research explores historical ties and engagements of the Ottoman Empire in the Americas, with a focus on social, economic, and legal connections to the United States and Canada during the long nineteenth century. Ahmed is also co-organizer with colleagues Michael Vorenberg, Emily Owens, and Rebecca Nedostup of the Brown Legal History Workshop and Brown Legal Studies collaborative. He is a member of the Brown Faculty of Color Network and as of July 1, 2020, is the Brown History Department’s current Director of Graduate Advising.
