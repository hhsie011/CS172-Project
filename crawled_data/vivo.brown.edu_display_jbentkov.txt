Full Text PubMed Research Research Overview As a health economist and health policy analyst, Dr. Bentkover's research is devoted to the following areas: identification and quantification of costs and benefits associated with various therapeutic interventions, evaluation of various public health programs and interventions, assessment of the impact of specific health care policies on the delivery and financing of medical care related to cost, quality, and access, healthcare leadership. Research Statement As a health economist, Dr. Bentkover's research is directed towards the quantification of the costs of illnesses and the value of various interventions. She identifies and analyzes the outcomes of specific treatments including pharmaceuticals, devices, procedures, treatment regimens, diagnostic technologies and prevention programs. She evaluates the impact of medical technologies from the perspective of the payor, provider, patient, caregiver, and society. She often undertakes comparative effectiveness research of alternative treatments. Her work related to medication adherence considers the role of the pharmacist, patient-centered medical home, and other organizational and structural factors. This work involves working with physicians, patient data, and claims data in order to ascertain the impact of involving a pharmacist in the patient-centered medical home. Another study related to medication adherence relates to the patient-reporting of their adherence behavior. Her research related to Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders relates to the disease progression and related costs and expenditures. She uses the Brown database of Medicare Part A linked Medicare claims and nursing home Minimum Data Set records. Her recent research is focused on mental health policy issues, including PTS and TBI. Her current research is devoted to health care leadership and the transformation of healthcare. Scholarly Work Bentkover J, Beresford J, Preblick R, Rogers B, Schachtner A, Swensen A. (2008, May).

However, the basic methods and applications can be applied to any type of healthcare intervention. The course will cover the background and common applications of various economic methodologies, beginning with an introduction to medical economic assessments. Consequently, there are no prerequisites for enrollment in this course. The course focuses on case studies in different disease areas, which serve to highlight key methodological and strategic issues in the field. Subject to availability, the course will attempt to include guest lectures in order to inform the various perspectives (e.g. product manufacturer, healthcare provider, healthcare payer) regarding the "real world" use of these methods in:  Pharmaceutical industry  Managed care organizations  International health care organizations Course Objectives Upon successful completion of this course, students will  Possess a technical understanding of the methods underlying pharmacoeconomics and health care technology assessment analyses  Have the ability to understand, interpret, critically review, and determine the usefulness of pharmacoeconomics and other medical technology evaluations published in peer reviewed literature or presented to them in various settings  Be prepared to undertake various types of economic evaluations of technology, given real world constraints of time, data, and budget Executive Master of Healthcare Leadership Program: Healthcare PolicyHealthcare Policy: Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow In this course, students appraise past and current political, legal, technological, and economic U.S. healthcare policy developments. Students critically examine the implementation of alternative methods of health services delivery and financing within multiple global healthcare systems. Participants question assumptions, think creatively, and consider integrated patient care solutions to prepare for change and new paradigms within the global healthcare sector. On completion of this course, students will be able to compare and contrast U.S. healthcare policies to those of other nations, and explore the potential applications of importing and exporting these practices to demonstrate how political, economic, social, and cultural determinants have shaped the evolution of current national, regional, and local healthcare policies. Throughout this course, students collaborate to develop projects and a healthcare system model focused on integrated patient care. Data-Driven Decision Making: The Structure, Conduct, Review and Evaluation of Research This course provides an overview of the methods and applications of therapy economics, biostatistics and epidemiology in healthcare decision-making. Specific topics include: pharmacoeconomics, decision analysis, comparative effectiveness research, and technology assessment; program evaluation; the critical review and interpretation of published epidemiological studies, institutional oversight of epidemiological research programs; the key four steps of statistical analysis (identification of scientific programs or problems of interest, collection of the required data, analysis and summary of data, and generation of a conclusion). The primary goal of this course is to enhance each participant's ability to conduct, supervise, and review health-related program, procedure, and product research, based on fundamental concepts and pragmatic applications of epidemiology, biostatistics, decision analysis, and economics. There is an emphasis on the critical review of professional reading as a method to enhance the ability to process conflicting study results and correctly appraise published printed and electronic information. Upon completion of the course, students will be prepared to supervise and collaboratively undertake various types of economic evaluations of technology when confronted with the real- world constraints of time, data and budget. Specifically, students will be able to explain and apply basic terminology, concepts, and definitions of epidemiology, health economics, and statistics, interpret measures of disease occurrence and measures of effect, understand the advantages and disadvantages of common study designs in statistics, pharmacoeconomics, health care technology assessments, comparativeness effectiveness research, and epidemiology.
