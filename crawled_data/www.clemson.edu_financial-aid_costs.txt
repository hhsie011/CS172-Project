Fees include all required charges for full-time enrollment plus average lab fees. This figure does not include differential fees, such as college-specific fees, nor does it include optional fees, such as parking and honors. See the explanation of fees.

Estimated expenses by major can vary. Housing: The figure quoted in the first column is the average bed cost for on-campus housing. Visit the Clemson Home website for individual charges. Board: The figure in the first column is based on the charge for Unlimited Access to on-campus dining facilities for undergraduate students. Visit the Clemson Home website for information on available meal plans. Transportation: For commuters, this figure estimates the cost of driving to campus daily. For on-campus residents, this figure allows for several round-trips to home per year. Personal: This figure is calculated by the College Board regarding expenses for laundry, toiletries, entertainment and other miscellaneous expenses. Loan Fees: This figure is based on the average loan fee paid by borrowers in the prior academic year. Laptop: Includes an allowance of $1,885 for a laptop computer for all entering freshmen. (Note from survey data: Housing, board, transportation and personal expenses for students living in on-campus housing and for students living in off-campus housing (not with parents) average the same amount.)
