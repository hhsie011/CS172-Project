CHARTERS AND STATUTES OF THE UNIVERSITY In 1754, George II granted a royal charter to the Governors of the College in the Province of New York making them a corporate body to erect and maintain a college to be known as King's College for the instruction and education of youth in the learned languages and the liberal arts and sciences. The University Statutes are Columbia's primary administrative code. The Trustees must formally approve any new (or amend any existing) statute. The Statutes specify the academic and administrative structure of the university, as well as the responsibilities of the president, deans, faculties, and academic departments. The Statutes also specify the different kinds of academic officers and their duties. 211 Low Library535 West 116th Street, Mail Code 4324 · New York, NY 10027 Contact Us secretary@columbia.edu Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
