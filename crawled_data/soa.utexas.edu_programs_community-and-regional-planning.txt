The students, faculty and staff of the Graduate Program in Community and Regional Planning (CRP) Program at The University of Texas at Austin welcome you. The CRP Program ranks as one of the top 15 programs in the nation and is housed within The University of Texas at Austin School of Architecture (UTSOA), itself consistently ranked as one of the top ten schools of architecture in the nation. Our program draws upon the full resources of a top-ranked, tier-1 research university to offer a course of study combining cutting-edge research and practice where students engage in real world projects. The CRP Program provides its graduates with the theoretical foundations, specific skills, and practical experience to succeed in professional planning and related policy careers. We strive to create a diverse student body and program, and are deeply committed to building a professional planning community that resembles the communities in which our students and faculty work. What makes the Community and Regional Planning Program at UT Austin unique? We are a small and friendly program of about 100 graduate students housed in a major tier-1 research university. Our student faculty ratio is under 9:1. CRP has a storied 50-year history, and our students and faculty have had major influences on the planning field locally, nationally, and internationally. Our program has a strong focus on sustainable development processes and practices. We seek development paths that balance growth with improved environmental performance, while expanding opportunities for all segments of the community. These principles inform our curricula and research. CRP faculty and students are involved in an array of innovative research and practice activities in sustainability through our major research center, the Center for Sustainable Development. The CRP Program carries out exciting research and project work in our local community and around the world. In the past year we have worked in neighborhoods in Austin and small towns in the larger metropolitan area, highland areas of Mexico, rapidly growing cities in China, and informal settlement communities in the Dominican Republic. We have an excellent student placement office with a stellar record of placing graduates in professional positions in local, state, and federal agencies, community organizations, and private companies across the U.S. and internationally. Our tuition and the local cost of living are reasonable, especially compared to our peer institutions. The CRP Program encourages applications from individuals who have the desire, leadership qualities and skills to understand and influence the growth and development of cities and regions. The program offers a Masters in Community and Regional Planning, five dual master degree programs, and a Ph.D. in Community and Regional Planning. Austin: A nice place to live and a great place to learn about planning Austin is a vibrant state capital city, with over 1.8 million people in the metro-region. Austin offers a rich, diverse cultural scene linked to a dynamic high-technology economy. For graduate students, the city offers a bounty of interesting and exciting things to do--a great live music scene, beautiful parks, natural swimming areas, diverse artistic and cultural events, and UT Longhorn sports. The city also serves as an important laboratory for our courses and research projects. Austin and the surrounding region offer a unique breadth of real-life planning problems and challenges. Planning and decision-making in Austin takes place within a context of high environmental consciousness, citizen awareness, and community participation. Most decisions concerning the economic, demographic, and geographic development of the Austin region involve a high degree of community engagement and advocacy. In addition to local planning decisions, Austin, as state capital, is the central forum for state level issues. The result is a unique setting for community and regional planning, where there are diverse opportunities for planning related academic study and engagement. Austin is now the eleventh largest city in the nation, with a population over 840,000. As one of the fastest growing metro areas in the U.S. in a rapidly growing state, the region provides an attractive job market for planners and for a variety of allied professions. The Austin region has a very young demographic profile with a median age of 32 years. Of the top 50 U.S. metro areas, Austin has the second highest share of 25- to 34-year-olds who have completed at least a four-year college degree. Austin and the university community At the heart of the Austin community, The University of Texas at Austin is a site where creative minds live side by side with the leading innovators in scientific, technological, and cultural fields. It's no accident that companies like Dell, IBM, National Instruments, Intel, Apple, and Whole Foods have established headquarters or major operations in Austin. The university community provides a wealth of youthful energy and independent spirit that drive Austin's art and music scene. Known as the 'Live Music Capital of the World,' the city is home to unique events like the Austin City Limits Music Festival and South by Southwest Music, Film and Interactive Festival. The city keeps its "weird"authentic vibe alive with unique local events including Eeyore's birthday party, Spamarama, the Chilympiad, the Dia de los Muertos parade, and more recent additions HONK!TX, Fun, Fun, Fun Fest, and much more. Students also enjoy the city's eclectic shops, art scene, restaurants, and coffee houses. Austin's rolling green hills, sparkling lakes, 351-acre Zilker Park — including the iconic Barton Springs pool, Lady Bird Lake, and more than 50 miles of hike and bike trails are just minutes from campus. With an average daily temperature of about 70 degrees and more than 300 days of sunshine each year, many students find Austin the perfect place to learn, work, and play.
