Shaw During the last academic year, I wrote a series of BuzzWords, my personal newsletter, on the topic of diversity. In the series I commented on discrimination, institutional barriers, tolerance, and appreciation as part of our continuing effort to make Syracuse University a truly welcoming place for all. The last issue of the series was a call to action. It was based on a list of suggestions from a team of SU faculty and staff who gathered information about the best practices at other higher education institutions. These suggestions were discussed and revised by my cabinet. We identified six areas that I believe will permit us to respond with a targeted, meaningful, and achievable effort. Faculty recruitment: By linking national data on new minority Ph.D. graduates with our needs, we will target such areas as psychology, education, political science, and the disciplines represented in the College of Human Services and Health Professions. 2000 Link September 15 | BuzzWords: “Diversity: Next Steps” by former Chancellor Kenneth A.

March 15 | BuzzWords: “Discrimination” by former Chancellor Kenneth A. Shaw As promised in the December 1999 BuzzWords, I continue a five-part series on diversity on this campus with the March 2000 edition. I believe that beginning the 21st century with this topic is entirely appropriate. After all, now more than ever those who can work with and appreciate all kinds of people and cultures will succeed.

Along with other provisions, it offered a college education to millions of returning veterans, thus opening new opportunities for them and their families, changing the shape of American society and public life, and transforming the very nature of higher education.
