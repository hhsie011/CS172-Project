Dual income couples are expected to juggle meetings and the demands of their job while educating their children and completing housework. The home has traditionally been a space for relaxation and unwinding, but many have been forced to convert it into a workspace. This webinar will bring together a team of experts who will address issues that are being experienced in the home as a result of the pandemic and will provide helpful tips on how to deal with these challenges. The discussion will look at establishing the context and the problem and then how to address the problem.
