Applicants are encouraged to apply early to these programs. Brown University School of Public Health Application Fee Waivers As part of our commitment to making the Brown University School of Public Health accessible to students from all backgrounds, we are offering application fee waivers to individuals who have participated in specific programs/events/conferences designed to promote educational opportunities for low-income and diverse students, and to those who meet the U.S. federal guidelines for financial need. SPH Application Fee Waiver A limited number of fee waivers in the form of coupon codes are provided to qualified applicants on a first-come, first-served basis. Each coupon code covers only the initial application fee and must be used within 2 weeks from the date it is awarded. Those applying to additional programs are responsible for the remaining balance. SOPHAS Application Fee Waivers A limited number of fee waivers (financial-based, service organization participation-based, and international) are available through the SOPHAS’ Fee Assistance Program.
