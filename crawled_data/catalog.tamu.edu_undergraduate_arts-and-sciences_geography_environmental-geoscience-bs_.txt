Students have the option to pursue a thesis or non-thesis Master of Science degree. The program provides the students the necessary intellectual and technical foundation to solve geographical problems across multiple spatial scales. Skills obtained by graduates from this degree program will allow the graduate to obtain geographic data, use geospatial methods and technologies to analyze the data, synthesize information from multiple sources in geographic domain, communicate information effectively, apply critical thinking and demonstrate proficiency in using appropriate geographic geospatial methods and technologies, work collaboratively with colleagues, and choose ethical courses of action in research and practice.

A course satisfying a Core category, a college/department requirement, or a free elective can be used to satisfy this requirement. See academic advisor. 2 Choose one introductory College of Geosciences course in the first semester and an additional one in the second semester of the sophomore year. Seek guidance from the academic advisor for Environmental Programs in Geosciences (ENVP) or your faculty mentor. 3 STAT 211 is recommended for the Coastal and Marine Environment Theme. 4 PHYS 206 and PHYS 226 is recommended for the Coastal and Marine Environment Theme. 5 Choose 18 hours of theme courses in your junior and senior years in consultation with your academic advisor or faculty mentor from the list below. GEOS 484 can be taken for up to 6 credits and will normally be used as an adjustment to theme electives, but depending on the content of the internship credit, it can be applied as an adjustment to your technical electives or policy electives. Seek guidance from the ENVP academic advisor. 6 Other courses which match the Environmental Programs’ technical electives definition will be allowed by adjustment. Guidance about technical electives (including the definition used by the Environmental Programs in Geosciences) can be found on the programs’ website. Seek guidance about choices from the ENVP academic advisor or faculty mentor. 7 GEOG 390 is a required technical elective. 8 Seek guidance about choices from the ENVP academic advisor or faculty mentor. Two courses in the degree plan must be writing intensive courses designated by the Environmental Programs in the schedule of classes. Also, international and cultural diversity electives (3 hours) and cultural discourse electives (3 hours) must be incorporated into the degree.
