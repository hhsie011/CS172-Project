According to the Sierra Club, a minimum of 8 trees are required to produce 2,000 pounds/1 ton of paper. Lower Greenhouse Impact The change in print production has reduced HR's greenhouse gas emissions from 42,000 pounds in 2016 to 1,700 in 2020—a 96% reduction. Production of 1 ton of copy paper produces 5,690 pounds of greenhouse gases: the equivalent of 6 months of car exhaust.
