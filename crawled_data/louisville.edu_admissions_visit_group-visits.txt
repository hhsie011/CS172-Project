Please read the following information before making your visit request: Scheduling your visit: Group visits are available for high-school students only and group size can range from 10 to 40 guests (students and chaperones). Groups must include at least one chaperone for every 10 students. Chaperones are expected to remain with the group at all times. If the number of students changes after you have made your reservation please contact our office with an updated number at least three days prior to your visit. Visits are available Monday-Friday only and can begin at 9 a.m., 1 p.m. or 3 p.m. Louisville is in the Eastern Time Zone. Due to limited availability of staff and facilities, we cannot accommodate all requests. Groups are scheduled on a first-come first-served basis and require at least two weeks advance notice. If you are scheduling a group visit for an elementary or middle school, please e-mail Tammy Lawson. On-Campus Visit: Your visit will include a 90 minute tour of campus and a 30 minute admissions presentation. You may also select optional meetings with the Student Office of Financial Aid and/or the Cultural and Equity Center. We tour campus rain or shine. Please make sure your students are prepared to walk around campus, are wearing comfortable shoes, and are dressed appropriately for the weather. If anyone in your group has any special needs please let us know in advance of the visit. The group should also plan to follow COVID guidelines regarding mask wearing and social distancing. Please see more details here. When your visit is confirmed you will receive driving directions and parking information. Please be sure that the driver has these directions and follows the parking instructions provided. We will not provide parking vouchers for groups that don't follow parking instructions. Please leave early enough that if you encounter possible delays it will not impact your visit. Facilities and staff schedules are limited. In the event of a late arrival we will have to adjust your schedule and may have to cancel certain activities or significantly shorten your tour of campus. Louisville is in the Eastern Time Zone. Please plan your travel accordingly. If your group wants to arrive early, stay after the visit, or eat on campus, you are welcome to do so. We ask that you coordinate directly with our Dining Services office to arrange for this experience ahead of time. Our Dining Services office can assist you with deciding where to eat on campus and arranging payment. Unfortunately we are not able to provide vouchers for on-campus dining. Encourage your students to ask questions on the tour and during the presentation. View example questions. The best visits are the ones that are the most interactive. We want your students to get the most out of their time on our campus!
