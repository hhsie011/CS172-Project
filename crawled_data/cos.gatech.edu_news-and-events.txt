Build Your Own Biology Textbook For five years, the School of Biological Sciences at Georgia Tech has used open education resources (OER) to open the door to updated biology textbooks for introductory courses — that also save students money. Neutron Scattering Society Honors Martin Mourigal With 2022 Science Prize School of Physics associate professor Martin Mourigal is recognized by NSSA for "significant and insightful use of neutron inelastic scattering in the study of quantum materials."

AbSciCon 2022 featured guest lectures and workshops on the latest research in astrobiology, and was sponsored by the NASA Astrobiology Program and the American Geophysical Union (AGU). Johnson won first place for her poster, Bacterial Clathrate-Binding Proteins in the Deep Subsurface Biosphere: Implications for Gas Clathrate Stability and Habitability. (You can see the poster and hear Johnson's presentation here.) American Geophysical Union , May 31, 2022 Dolphin Skincare: How These Sea Mammals Seem to Self-Medicate Their Skin Dolphins may rub on specific corals and sponges to treat their skin, researchers reported Thursday in the journal iScience. These stationary sea creatures may serve as drive-by pharmacies, dispensing a chemical cocktail that could treat bacterial or fungal infections or support skin health. The scientists said that cetaceans have not been observed self-medicating before. Some of these molecules may serve as immune boosters or sunscreens, said Julia Kubanek, professor in the School of Biological Sciences and School of Chemistry and Biochemistry, and vice president of Interdisciplinary Research, who wasn’t part of the work. People have known about corals’ and sponges’ medicinal properties for around 50 years, Kubanek said. “But dolphins may have known about how to use marine organisms as medicines much longer than we have,” she added.
