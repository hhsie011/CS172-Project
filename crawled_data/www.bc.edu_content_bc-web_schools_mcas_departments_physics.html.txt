Devoted to our teaching, service and research missions, all of our 19 faculty teach lecture courses and actively involve students in their research. Our research program is “decidedly noncomprehensive,” with intentional foci on fundamental and applied condensed matter and nanoscale physics. Our campus home is Higgins Hall, at the heart of the BC Chestnut Hill campus at the western edge of Boston, and fully renovated in 2002 with state-of-the-art teaching and research laboratories.

Read More The surprising thermal properties of CM carbonaceous chondrites CM carbonaceous chondrites exhibit negative thermal expansion (NTE) behavior due to the presence of phyllosilicates in this class of meteorites. This is the first observation of NTE behavior in an extraterrestrial material. Read More Absence of local moments in the kagome metal KV3Sb5 as determined by muon spin spectroscopy We have carried out muon spin relaxation and rotation measurements on the newly discovered kagome metal KV3Sb5, and find a local field dominated by weak magnetic disorder. Read More Cascade of correlated electron states in a kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5 In a rare non-magnetic kagome material, a topological metal cools into a superconductor through a sequence of novel charge density waves Read More ac Susceptometry of 2D van der Waals Magnets Enabled by the Coherent Control of Quantum Sensors A novel function for quantum sensing is demonstrated, in which NV magnetometry is extended to the dynamic character of magnetism, enabling ac and dc study of spintronic materials at the nanoscale. Read More Non-Hermitian topology of one-dimensional spin-torque oscillator arrays Magnetic systems have been extensively studied from both a fundamental physics perspective and as technological building blocks. Read more Manipulating non-magnetic atoms in a chromium halide enables tuning of magnetic properties New approach creates synthetic layered magnets with unprecedented level of control over their magnetic properties. Read More Modulation Doping via a Two-Dimensional Atomic Crystalline Acceptor Two-dimensional nanoelectronics, plasmonics, and emergent phases require clean and local charge control, calling for layered, crystalline acceptors or donors. Read More Physics Department Undergraduate Research Opportunities The Department of Physics at Boston College offers a 100% guarantee that a research opportunity will be made available to all physics majors that seek one, providing they meet the required criteria. We go to great lengths to honor this commitment. Learn More Spotlight Resources Teaching Laboratories View experiments Integrated Sciences Cleanroom and Nanofabrication Facility Open to both Boston College and External Users, this laboratory is home to over 30 high-end micro and nanoscale instrumentation systems worth several million dollars. Learn more REU: Integrated Science For Society The Boston College Research Experience for Undergraduates (BC-REU) provided a unique opportunity for 10 undergraduates in 2017, 2018 and 2019 to work in teams across disciplines, focusing on scientific solutions to energy and biological problems.
