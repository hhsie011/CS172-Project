We select students who, we feel, will gain the most from the program and represent the School in a way that we can be proud. Over the years, the Mentor Program has produced long-lasting personal friendships, professional relationships, and even business partnerships. We invite you to keep that tradition alive with your own experience. By participating in the mentor program, you have the chance to: Enhance a student’s collegiate experience by helping to prepare students for careers through coaching from your own experiences and leading by example. Help students develop a professional network and other important relationships with individuals in the business community. Motivate students by providing another voice (in addition to parents, counselors, and professors) that speaks of the importance of a strong work ethic, a professional attitude, effective time management, and other successful work habits. Provide another perspective for students who need to ask questions and share experiences. Help prepare students for job interviews with advice, tips, and techniques. Use this program as a recruitment tool and a means of involving current and recent graduates. Give back to future generations of students to help them achieve their career goals, as you have.
