This means diverse classroom discussions, professional connections, and industry insights you wouldn’t have gained as part of your major’s course requirements. What’s more, basic business skills and foundational knowledge makes you a more marketable job or graduate school candidate. Who’s eligible for the business minor? All Cornell undergraduates except students enrolled in the Nolan School, Dyson, and ORIE. How many credits are required? 12 core credits across areas such as management, marketing, accounting, and finance.
