What unites the four programs is their shared commitment to providing students the opportunity to pursue the questions that often fall between the cracks of the specialized disciplines, by exploring the writings of scientists along with the writings of poets, historians, and philosophers. We thank you for your interest in the mission and vision of Baylor University and invite you to make a gift to support student scholarships, faculty research and needs and priorities within the Honors College today. Baylor Interdisciplinary Core Students in BIC engage a curriculum that integrates traditional education requirements. Gifts provide the BIC with classroom equipment, technology and research materials that help students explore the full spectrum of educational disciplines to prepare for the future on a global scale.
