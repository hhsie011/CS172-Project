Part of this effort includes sharing information regarding the safety and security of our campuses. UC provides email notifications to all students, faculty and staff when a Clery Crime occurs in the Clery Geography. These notifications are primarily sent if the incident poses an ongoing safety threat as determined by the Chief of Police or his/her designee. The act requires colleges and universities to make "timely warnings," known as "Safety Alerts" at UC, to campus community members about specific types of crime if an ongoing threat is believed to exist.
