Columbia’s action plan for campus energy will follow the carbon management hierarchy, address critical regulatory requirements for campus buildings (i.e. Local Law 97), and exploit clean energy options that emerge in response to New York’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA). The CLCPA has charted an aggressive course for the state to have a net zero economy by 2050, including an interim goal of 70% renewable energy by 2030, and decarbonization of the electric sector by 2040. Click here to read the full Overview. Expand all Collapse all Goal & Strategies Goal Columbia commits to electrification and 100% renewable electricity. Strategies Strategy 1: In the near- to mid-term, aggressively identify and implement opportunities to avoid and reduce emissions through traditional energy efficiency measures including new building and retro-commissioning standards, space use optimization, and both electricity- and fuel-related improvements in efficiency. Strategy 2: Transition as rapidly as is practical from brown power paired with national renewable energy credits (RECs) to zero-emission electricity sources on the New York grid that, where feasible, are Local Law 97 (LL97)-eligible or (ideally) are located on Columbia campuses. Strategy 3: Mid- to long-term, pair deep conservation with electrification to displace fossil fuels used for heating and cooling. As a first step, Columbia will undertake comprehensive engineering studies of strategic electrification of its campuses. Campus Energy Content Sections Breakdown of Emissions Sources Addresses the Scope 1 (stationary combustion of fuel) and Scope 2 (purchased utilities) components of campus energy emissions. GHG Goals & Science-Based Targets Sets forth the science-based targets and goals for the Scope 1 and 2 emissions sources related to campus energy. Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Hierarchy Addresses the order of operations (Avoid, Reduce, Replace, Offset, and Remove) Columbia will use to reach net zero emissions. Roadmap to Net Zero Shows how a suite of mitigation measures might be applied to meet Columbia’s science-based targets. Progress to Date Lays out the progress each of Columbia's campuses has made to reduce greenhouse gas emissions since the release of the first sustainability plan in 2017.
