In establishing the OID, the University signaled its commitment to redirect and strengthen its efforts in the area of diversity. Beginnings: 1968 to 2004 Affirmative action at Boston College began with the Black Talent Program (BTP). Administered by the University Committee on Black Students and Studies, the Negro Talent Search (whose name was soon changed to the BTP) began in the spring of 1968 with the establishment of the $100,000 Michael P. Walsh fund. It operated under the office of Charles Donovan, S.J., senior vice president and dean of faculties. Executive Vice President F. X. Shea once described it as a program "committed to the recruitment of the economically disadvantaged. Customarily it recruits students who are characterized as 'high risk.' Furthermore, its chief task is to recruit students from the greater Boston area." It was the ideal of the program to recruit enough black students so that they would constitute 10% of the student population. At the height of tensions in 1970, the administration recruited a black financial aid and a black admissions officer. At least since 1973, the Admissions Office had a special minorities committee that worked along with the BTP towards admitting black students, and they had a committee to increase the admission of Spanish-speaking students as well. In September of 1971, Boston College created an Office of Affirmative Action and "charged it with the development of a plan to provide equal opportunity in both employment and education." Dr. Alice Jeghelian was appointed director. Early in 1973, Jeghelian submitted the plan for an affirmative action program, which was approved by the Board of Trustees. Jeghelian later became the coordinator for Title IX implementation. In addition, the Affirmative Action Council was created to serve the Director in an advisory capacity. In 1985, the Office of Affirmative Action aligned with the Office of Human Resources, and shortly thereafter Richard Jefferson was named the new Director of Affirmative Action. This same year, the Affirmative Action Council began to focus on presenting convincing arguments for changes in policy, as opposed to focusing solely on hiring issues as it did in the seventies. In 1988, University President J. Donald Monan, S.J., appointed a 12-member action committee on the "recruitment of persons of color." Around this time, Fr. Monan noted that the "primary responsibility for ensuring that persons of color are represented in candidate pools rests with Human Resources and the hiring manager." Meanwhile the role of Affirmative Action Office was to suggest strategies for attracting persons of color and to offer consultation, training and orientation. In January of 1989, Barbara Marshall was named the new director of Affirmative Action. Following these developments and at least as early as 1991, the office developed Affirmative Action Plans for Persons with Disabilities and for Veterans with Disabilities and Vietnam-era Veterans. The Office for Institutional Diversity is grateful to the staff of the University Archives, especially Edward Copenhagen and John Atteberry, for making this history available and for assisting in our review of records of Fathers Joyce and Monan, former Boston College Presidents. For more information about this history, please contact the University Archives. Compliance and Policy The OID continues to be responsible for coordinating the University's other compliance efforts under various federal and state equal opportunity, affirmative action, and Title IX regulations governing employment and education. In these areas, our office develops policy statements, provides regular reports on the University's progress and performance, identifies problem areas, and offers problem-solving assistance. We also monitor affirmative action implementation, consult with enforcement agencies, and counsel employees. Inclusive Excellence In alignment with the institution's mission of inclusive excellence, the OID offers diversity education programming throughout the year designed to provide opportunities for open dialogue, self-reflection, and cross-cultural communication. For example, one of our programs is the Cultural Competence Engagement Modules (CCEM), which enable participants to acquire the knowledge, language, and behavioral and cultural skills needed to navigate within a diverse and inclusive community.
