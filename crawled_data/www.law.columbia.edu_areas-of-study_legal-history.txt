Scholars examine how legal ideas, doctrines, and institutions change over time, exploring how they shape and are shaped by social, cultural, political, and economic contexts. Legal historians are guided by figures like judges and legislators as well as ordinary people, who give voice to their own ideas of what the law is and should be. How do the history and evolution of the law shape modern systems of justice? Legal history occupies a central place in the intellectual life of the Law School.
