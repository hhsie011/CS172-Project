All undergraduate students must meet with an academic adviser prior to enrolling for a term for assistance in planning majors and minors and scheduling courses that will count towards their graduation requirements. Failure to meet with the academic adviser prior to enrolling for a term may result in sanctions. After the initial required advising session for the term, students are encouraged to seek assistance from their academic adviser when considering adding and dropping courses. Students have the final responsibility for the accuracy of their enrollment, the applicability of their courses towards their degree requirements, and their academic performance. Student-Athletes: Must complete a drop form from the athletic department prior to dropping a course. You may obtain a drop form from your athletic academic counselor. This is to review the effects the drop might have on your athletic participation and aid, and advise you on your athletic eligibility. After you complete a drop form, the Director of Admission and Eligibilty for Athletics will process the drop for you. The choice to drop a course is yours to make. International Students: If a drop will take you to fewer than 12 hours, you should consult with the International Center. After consultation, the International Office must modify the minimum hours in order for international UG students to drop below 12 hours for the spring or fall term. Failure to maintain full-time hours may result in deportation. Students on Merit or Need Based Financial Aid: If a drop will take you to fewer than 12 hours, you should consult with your financial aid adviser prior to attempting to drop a course. Your financial aid adviser will be able to tell you any effects the drop will have to your aid. After the consultation, you can process a drop through self-service in my.SMU should that be your decision. If you have any questions regarding this procedure or your financial aid, contact your financial aid advisor.
