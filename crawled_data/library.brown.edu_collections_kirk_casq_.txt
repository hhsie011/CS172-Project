The researchers were from the fields of literature, history, anthropology, social work, philosophy and editing, all dealing with the broad subject of alcoholism, and using the Brown Alcoholism and Addicition Studies Collections. The goals of the newsletter are to continue to carry out the interdisciplinary interactions that grow out of the meeting, to provide a tool for reasearchers to inform and receive feedback from their colleagues about their research, and for the university to promote the Alcoholism and Addiction Studies Collections.
