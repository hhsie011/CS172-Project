Employees with more than the maximum have their balances adjusted back, and in recent years the reset date has been October 15. Effective this year, and moving forward, the vacation maximum reset date will be December 31. This change applies to all regular full-time, regular part-time, and benefits-eligible temporary staff members who are eligible to accrue vacation time, including employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Full details including vacation accrual calculations and maximum accumulation tables for exempt and non-exempt staff are available in the policy or the applicable collective bargaining agreement. There will be no change to the maximum vacation payouts at retirement or termination under the policy or in the applicable collective bargaining agreement. Questions regarding individual balances should be directed to your local college or unit HR representative. Infographic image text: Take time for you! Is your paid time off approaching its maximum limit? Here's why it matters. Vacation time reset: December 31, 2021. To allow employees more flexibility for time away needs during the pandemic, the annual vacation time reset was paused for 2020. But your vacation time has kept accruing. So if you haven't taken time off, you may be approaching your maximum limit. And if you don't use the time over your maximum limit before 12/31/21, you'll lose it! Nobody wants that! Check Workday to see if your time off is maxing out. Login to Workday and click the "Time Off" icon on the homepage. Click View > Time Off Results by Period. Under "Time Off Plans" select All Time Off Plans > Vacation; for Periods, select 2021 and then the period ending with 12/31/21; then scroll down to the orange "OK" button. Check the Carryover Forfeited in Period" column: that shows any vacation time you may lose. Make plans now! Don't wait till the last minute! Work with your supervisor now to schedule time off between now and December 31, since they'll need to account for workloads and timing with the rest of your team. It's okay to make tentative plans that may change. Time off is important! Seriously - taking time off is vital for your wellbeing. You don't need to take an entire week off at a time to refresh and ease stress. How about three-day weekends? Or leaving work at lunchtime for a week or two? Taking "microcations" can be less stressful in the long run, and still give you the benefits of time for yourself and the things that matter to you. Questions?
