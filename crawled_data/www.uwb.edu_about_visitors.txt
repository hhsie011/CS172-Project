Downtown Seattle is approximately 30-45 minutes away by car or bus. The campus is also halfway between the cities of Bellevue and Everett, in what is known as the “tech corridor” given the many international and start-up technology and biomedical companies that make this region their home. UW Bothell is about a mile from downtown Bothell. The town is known for its historic Main Street, its recreational activities (including biking, hiking and kayaking), and a growing number of restaurants, breweries, coffee shops and boutique stores.
