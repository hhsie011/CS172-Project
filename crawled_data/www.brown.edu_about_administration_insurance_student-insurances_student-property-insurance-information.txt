It is recommended that students have personal property insurance as the University does not provide insurance coverage for these items. There are several options for obtaining personal property insurance. Some students may have coverage under their family's homeowner's or renter's insurance. This can be confirmed by contacting your family's insurance agent. It is also possible to purchase insurance for student owned property. Three companies that offer this type of insurance coverage are listed below. All of these companies offer coverage for students living on-campus and for those renting apartments off campus.

For computers, the best way to minimize the disruption is to maintain regular backups of critical data. These backups should not be kept in the same location as the computer. A loss due to a water leak, for example, could potentially damage both the computer and the backup. Students should keep an inventory of their property, complete with serial numbers, as a way to prove ownership in the event they need to file a claim with an insurance company.
