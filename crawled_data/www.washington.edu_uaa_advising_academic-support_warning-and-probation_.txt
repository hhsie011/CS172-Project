Students should schedule an appointment to see an academic adviser as soon as possible to discuss their academic standing. International students should also contact their ISS adviser to understand how their academic standing could affect their visa status. Students must complete the Academic Self-Assessment BEFORE their scheduled advising appointment.

You are also either on academic warning or academic probation. Academic Warning The first quarter at a new school - whether your previous school was a high school or another college or university - can be a significant change that can lead to poor academic performance. Very often we see students who do poorly in their first quarter, and then turn things completely around after that. Perhaps they just needed some time to figure out how everything works here. Or maybe they found the problem and addressed it. We recommend you address the issue right away, and we hope to be a great resource for you. Our office makes an extra effort to reach out to pre-major students on academic warning. A registration hold is put on so that you can come in and meet with your adviser. Academic Probation When you are on academic probation, you are close to losing your place as a student at the UW. During each quarter you are on probation, you have to earn a minimum 2.00 quarterly gpa for your regularly graded courses, or earn high enough quarterly grades to raise your cumulative gpa to 2.00 or higher. If you don't, you'll be dropped from the UW for low scholarship. If you have been dropped from the UW for low scholarship, view the Reinstatement page to learn more about possible next steps.
