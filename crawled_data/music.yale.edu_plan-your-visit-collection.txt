Gallery tours and class presentations are offered to University and non-University groups interested in the history, design, construction, and preservation of musical instruments. A typical tour visits the museum’s three galleries and focuses on select instruments. Staff members place the instruments in a historical context and discuss their roles in the cultural life of the period. Specialized tours that focus on distinct groups or families of instruments may be arranged. A fee is customarily charged for tours presented to non-Yale groups. More about the Collection Hours + Directions Toggle The Morris Steinert Collection of Musical Instruments is located on Yale's Central Campus at 15 Hillhouse Avenue in New Haven, Connecticut. It is within walking distance of libraries, galleries, and the University’s undergraduate admissions office.

It is closed on national holidays, during the month of August, and during Yale University recesses (Thanksgiving break, winter break, and spring break).
