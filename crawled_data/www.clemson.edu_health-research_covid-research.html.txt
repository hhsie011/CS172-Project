YONGJIA SONG yongjis@clemson.edu Industrial Engineering General research areas: Optimization, operations research, resource allocation, transportation and logistics, scheduling, emergency response Overview: Resource allocation decisions, such as transportation and logistics, staffing and scheduling, etc., play critical roles in combating COVID-19 pandemic, as they deal directly with the distribution of life-saving medical supplies and mobilization of medical workers to meet urgent patient needs. These operations planning decisions for relief efforts under COVID-19 pandemic face significant challenges due to the fast-evolving COVID-19 situations on patient needs, medical supply availabilities, as well as their evolving forecasts. These dynamically evolving uncertainties present significant challenges for dynamic resource allocation decision making by federal and state emergency management agents. We would like to apply optimization modeling and algorithmic framework to support life-saving medical resource allocation decision making by state emergency management departments and local health care providers amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Epidemiologists have made forecasting tools and data for COVID-19 widely available online, making it amenable for emergency managers and health care administrators to utilize the so-called look-ahead policies for prescribing resource allocation decisions over time. We aim to develop a decision-support tool for dynamic allocation of life-saving medical supplies (such as ventilators and PPEs) under various sources of uncertainty, to provide a timely decision support for state emergency management departments and health care providers in mobilizing and distributing of critical medical resources, utilizing available rolling forecasts on the COVID-19 situation.

ALEXEY VERTEGEL vertege@clemson.edu Bioengineering General research areas: Antiviral, environmental surfaces, disinfectant, chitosan Overview: Cleaning of visibly dirty surfaces followed by disinfection is a best practice measure for prevention of COVID-19 and other viral respiratory illnesses in community settings. Currently used surface disinfectants such as sodium hypochlorite, ethanol or hydrogen peroxide provide high level of activity for a limited period of time (typically, less than 4 hours). We developed a novel chitosan-based formulation that forms a protective biocidal film on treated surfaces. This film is resistant to rubbing by hand and shows biocidal activity on frequently touched surfaces for at least 48 hours. Such formulation could be used as a surface disinfectant either in the form of a spray or as disinfecting wipes. It is advantageous over currently available disinfectants because of its long-term antimicrobial action. In addition, chitosan is a naturally occurring antimicrobial, and its use will satisfy societal demand for greener alternatives to hazardous chemicals. NARENDRA R.

JEFFREY ANKER janker@clemson.edu Chemistry General research areas: Sensors, radiography, contrast agents Overview: My research interests related to COVID-19 are rapid diagnostics for serology, cytokine storm, or virus, as well as the development of contrast agents for lung inflammation. We are developing a new type of rapid, on-site, immunoassay that could be useful for COVID-19 detection (and other diseases). Remarkably, this highly sensitive assay can be performed with minimal training and equipment. SARS-CoV-2 proteins in saliva will bind to both buoyant and magnetic (BAM) microspheres, thus linking them together in a "sandwich complex" (a magnetic bead on one end of the protein and a buoyant bead on the other). This "two-factor identification" allows the complexes to be completely separated from unreacted magnetic and buoyant beads providing high specificity. The BAM assay is read by eye or using a cell phone video capture. We expect this will meet the World Health Organization's ASSURED criteria for diagnostics in resource limited setting (affordable, sensitive and specific, user-friendly, rapid (10 minutes), equipment-free and deliverable). The test would be especially useful in a variety of screening settings.
