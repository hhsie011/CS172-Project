We advocate for diversity, equity, and inclusion related to gender identity, sexual orientation, and gender expression. NOTE TO UC FACULTY AND STAFF: A more comprehensive look into the FSA as well as local resources, news, and upcoming events can be found on our Bearcats Landing intranet site (UC login required). Please visit us there! About The UC LGBTQ+ Faculty and Staff Association (FSA) was established in 2018 with the support of the Office of the Provost. As an Association that represents both faculty and staff, we aim to help create a more equitable environment in which LGBTQ members of the university community can flourish in their work environments and be productive researchers, teachers, and staff members. We aim to do this in the following ways: To advocate, provide support opportunities, and create a safe and secure professional environment for LGBTQ faculty and staff at the University of Cincinnati. This broad goal encompasses the following specific aims: to represent and advocate for LGBTQ faculty and staff visibility and concerns at the unit, college, divisional, administrative, shared governance, and university policy level. Encourage and promote research, teaching, and other educational activities that address questions relevant to LGBTQ individuals, allies of the LGBTQ community, and to all members of the university community concerned with understanding the experiences of LGBTQ people. In the spirit of President Pinto’s Next Lives Here direction and his administration’s commitment to diversity, this association shall seek to provide support and guidance for the University regarding issues that affect the well-being of LGBTQ faculty and staff members. Bearcats Outlist The OutList features openly LGBTQ+ faculty and staff at UC and is designed to promote visibility and pride to further foster a sense of belonging and inclusivity. There is power in representation and the hope is that the OutList will inspire current and future LGBTQ+ faculty and staff at UC to be their authentic selves at work and beyond. View the UC OutList.
