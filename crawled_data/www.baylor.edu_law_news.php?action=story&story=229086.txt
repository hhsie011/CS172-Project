The invitation-only tournament pits the best advocates from 16 trial advocacy schools against one another in a head-to-head, winner-take-all contest June 1-5 at Baylor Law. Unlike traditional mock trial competitions, participants do not get to prepare for the case before the competition begins. The 16 competitors receive the case file a mere 24 hours prior to the opening rounds. Given just one day, participants must review a myriad of documents, focus on the essential facts of the case, and prepare for trial. The advocates that will compete in the thirteenth annual Top Gun National Mock Trial Competition are: American University Washington College of Law - Demitri Dawson Campbell University Norman Adrian Wiggins School of Law - Miriam Sheppard Chicago-Kent College of Law - Cole Gunter Drexel University Thomas R. Kline School of Law - Grace Grimes Fordham University School of Law - Chehak Gogia Loyola Law School, Los Angeles - Ameen Hussaini Quinnipiac University School of Law - Emily Lanthier Samford University Cumberland School of Law - Ghada Abouhaidar Stetson University College of Law - Katherine Castaner South Texas College of Law Houston - Billy Robinett Temple University Beasley School of Law - Aaron Freedman UCLA School of Law - Regina Campbell University of California Berkeley School of Law - Jenna Forster University of Denver Sturm College of Law - Chasen Miller University of Georgia School of Law - Haley Kairab University of South Carolina School of Law - Molly Sue Harmon Sponsored by the MG+M The Law Firm, the competition begins in the evening on Wednesday, June 1, with competitors arriving for orientation and a welcome dinner. The following morning, competitors will receive their case files, and the preliminary rounds will be held June 3-4. The semifinal round will take place at 9 a.m. on Sunday, June 5. The final round will begin at 2 p.m. that day and will be streamed live at https://www.baylor.edu/law/live.
