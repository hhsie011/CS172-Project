A Reason to Remember: Roth, Germany 1933-1942 tells the personal story of the five Jewish families who lived in the small village of Roth. The exhibit introduces the families as they lived in 1933 and details what happened to them during the Nazi era. Visitors are engaged in a personal, intimate, and emotional way with the lives of Roth's former Jewish residents and become well acquainted with the men, women, and children of the village. Visitors are also challenged by what they see in this exhibit to think critically about the choices they make when they are called upon to respond to prejudice or any other type of injustice. "Why Cincinnati?"- Descendants of Roth live in the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky area. First, second, and third generation descendants have all returned to Roth to rededicate the cemetery and build new bonds with current residents. A group of current residents of Roth formed an "Arbeitskreis" (working group) 15 years ago to preserve in Roth the memory of those who perished, to rededicate the synagogue, and to educate the children of Roth and the surrounding area about the Holocaust, tolerance, and dialogue. Bringing the exhibit, as well as Dr. Annegret Wenz-Haubfliesh, the current leader of the Arbeitskreis and a noted historian of the Jews of Roth, will offer citizens of the tri-state area an opportunity to commemorate this history, and learn about the important work of dialogue, co-existence, and mutual understanding.
