Register for Part 1 here: https://reporter.ncsu.edu/link/courseview?courseID=LIB-PEERSC-OvrlfR1&deptName=LIB After we've got the "infrastructure" set up (from Part 1), we will work on modifying your Overleaf (LaTex) template of choice. You can select a template based on a pending journal article submission or a conference that you plan to attend. Attendees can also work with their own data, if desired, but example datasets will be provided to practice linking plots and data between Overleaf & RStudio. Attendees will leave the workshop with a better understanding of the advantages to alternative word processing resources, a working example integrating Overleaf and RStudio, and a compiled list of additional resources covered in the workshop. Speaker Bio: Kate is a PhD student in the Center for Geospatial Analytics. Her research focuses on socio-ecological dimensions of wildland fire, from managing wildfires to planning prescribed fires. Prior to returning for her PhD, she worked as a research scientist in a geospatial analysis and visualization lab. Her interests include data analysis and tool development to assist landscape-scale management decisions.
