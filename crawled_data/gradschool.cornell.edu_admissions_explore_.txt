More than 100 interdisciplinary research centers, institutes, and laboratories One of the 10 largest academic research libraries Research at Cornell Faculty Cornell’s nearly 1,800 graduate faculty represent the nation’s finest researchers, scholars, and teachers. Cross-disciplinary by design, our field structure encourages faculty to work in more than one field, ensuring that faculty and students across the university can share ideas and work together freely and without undue administrative barriers.
