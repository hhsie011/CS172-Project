Informally known as the “Red Books,” Class Reports are a long-standing Harvard tradition, dating back at least to the mid-1800s. They serve as historical chronicles of classes and encourage alumni to maintain connections with each other and the College through the sharing of current contact information, family and professional news, and in-depth life stories. Content is gathered for the Reports by means of a questionnaire provided to all class members and is ushered into print in advance of Reunion by a team of five professional editors. Read About Class Reports in Harvard Magazine This enduring and beloved tradition remains strong due to the high participation and generosity of class members in supporting the books. During this time of deep uncertainty as a consequence of the pandemic, all College alumni celebrating a reunion can count on the certainty of receiving their Red Books in the mail, regardless of participation. We ask for your continued support to help fund the production and shipping costs of your book by making a modest voluntary contribution at your Class’s website below.

However, please rest assured that they have been published and you will receive them! If you have not received a copy of your book by now, please email the editor through the corresponding link above. However, please note that staff members are all working remotely at present.
