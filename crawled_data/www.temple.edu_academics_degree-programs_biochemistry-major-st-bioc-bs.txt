Biochemical concepts and techniques have become the basis for research in environmental and health sciences, nutrition and physiology. The 123-credit-hour degree prepares graduates to pursue various careers in medicine, science and technology, or advanced study in biochemistry, bioengineering, biotechnology, cell biology and other related fields. The interdisciplinary biochemistry curriculum combines principles of biology and chemistry with fundamentals of mathematics and physics. Chemistry is a discipline of science that studies the structure and composition of atoms, whereas biology studies the science of life and living organisms. You’ll study how atoms and molecules form new chemical compounds through chemical bonds. From there, students will dig deeper into the chemical processes that are required for living organisms to exist, including their chemical composition, function and physical structure. Faculty members encourage firsthand experience with cutting-edge technology in the classroom. You'll also solve real-world problems in state-of-the-art laboratories while building practical research and teamwork skills. Biochemistry Majors take part in advanced research, scientific breakthroughs and new discoveries that benefit society. Classes & Curriculum In this degree program, courses will include Calculus or Honors Calculus I, II and III; Cell Structure and Function; General Biochemistry II; Genetics; and Techniques of Biochemistry Research.
