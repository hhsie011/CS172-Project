So are the dollars that you spend on tuition. Each semester, thousands of college students across the nation are unable to complete their classes due to unforeseen medical issues. At Baylor, the timing of a withdrawal determines the refund percentage for tuition and fees (see our withdrawal refund policy). We understand that medical hardships can quickly become financial hardships, and that is why we are pleased to bring your attention to an insurance product offered to Baylor students by GradGuard. Tuition Refund Insurance can help refund your tuition, fees, and other costs of attendance, up to the policy limits, if you are unable to complete the semester due to a covered medical reason such as an illness, accident, or mental health issue. Tuition Refund Insurance complements and enhances Baylor’s refund policy and helps protect your educational investment. Purchasing tuition insurance is entirely optional. Whether you choose to purchase coverage (and at what level) will depend on your individual net cost and your personal risk appetite. Please visit GradGuard.com/Tuition/Baylor for more information. To enroll, log in to the E-Bill System and follow the prompts.
