Led by a faculty of practicing artists in state-of-the-art facilities, Ceramics majors work in a close-knit environment, side-by-side with graduate students, as they explore traditional and experimental clay techniques. The program draws on the energy and resources of the urban landscape of Philadelphia—a city with a longstanding clay culture and vibrant visual art scene—to forge community partnerships that lead to broader, inclusive perspectives, conversations and exchanges of ideas. Students learn product design and production, studio management and gallery installation, as well as critical thinking and problem solving—transferable skills that help prepare them for success in any artistic discipline or profession, including as educators, gallery operators, architectural designers, curators and more. Students also have opportunities for internships in Philadelphia's densely networked clay community. Designed to complement the studio experience with tools to support a studio practice or pursue graduate studies, the Entrepreneurship coursework enhances students' career options. Graduates of this degree program will possess requisite business skills to support themselves as visual artists or entrepreneurs in art and related fields. Degree Requirements The Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Ceramics with Entrepreneurial Studies may be conferred upon a student by recommendation of the faculty and upon the satisfactory completion of a minimum of 126 semester hours of credit with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.00. All Ceramics with Entrepreneurial Studies majors must complete the General Education requirements. Students must earn a C- or better in ART 2101 and ART 2102 to enter the Ceramics with Entrepreneurial Studies major. The eight required Junior/Senior studio courses and ART 4096 (capstone) must be completed with a C- or better to fulfill major requirements.

Please Note: An approved study abroad program waives the GenEd Global/World Society (GG) requirement; however, these credits must be made up with academic coursework taken outside of Tyler departments to be in compliance with BFA accreditation. Ceramics majors interested in studying abroad should consult with an academic advisor to determine if a semester (generally spring semester of second year) or a summer program would be the best option to remain on track for graduation. If a student is spending a traditional semester abroad, ART 2101 must be completed prior to studying abroad. To remain on track for graduation, permission may be granted to substitute an additional specialized ceramics course in lieu of an advanced ceramics course. Temple University 1801 N.
