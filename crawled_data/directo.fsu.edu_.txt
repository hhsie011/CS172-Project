Thank you to everyone who submitted ideas and expressed support for these events. Unfortunately, this fall's symposium and the annual book club is being postponed due to the spread of COVID-19 and organizational restructuring of the DIRECTO initiative. The DIRECTO team came to this difficult decision while working hard to remain flexible and responsive about the fluid COVID-19 situation and speaking with the Provost and other campus collaborators about the best way to move forward. We are very disappointed that we are unable to hold our symposium this year, but we are also very grateful for the time each of you has taken to craft unique, thoughtful, and inspiring sessions that will surely stimulate some deep learning and discussion should you want to present at our 2022 event. Thank you so much for your patience, understanding, and cooperation in prioritizing the health and safety of the FSU campus and broader Tallahassee community. If you have any questions or need additional information, please do not hesitate to reach out to us via email at directo@fsu.edu.
