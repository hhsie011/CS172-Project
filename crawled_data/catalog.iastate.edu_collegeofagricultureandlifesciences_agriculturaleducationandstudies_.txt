Graduate Study The department offers the degrees of master of science and doctor of philosophy, with a major in agricultural education; a specialization in agricultural extension education; opportunities for emphasis in international agricultural education; and a minor for students majoring in other curricula. Graduate students who have earned a bachelor’s degree in an agricultural discipline may plan a course of study that leads to teacher certification. Candidates pursuing the master of science degree may do so by completing either a thesis or nonthesis program of study. Students have an opportunity to develop competence in disciplinary foundations and ethics, program planning, learning theory, instructional methods, program leadership and administration, program evaluation, research methodologies, data analysis and interpretation, writing for publication, and grant proposal writing. The department also cooperates in the international development studies option of the General Graduate Studies Program. Courses and workshops are offered, both on and off campus, for extension educators, teachers, and industry and government personnel.
