The office is responsible for the strategic vision for research, developing and executing initiatives to accomplish the vision, as well as the various compliance and support areas. VPR works to catalyze, support and safeguard UVA research. The VPR is seed funding research with a strategy of moving research from promising to preeminent and supporting UVA's Strategic Plan. PROMISING EMERGENT PROMINENT PREEMINENT Pathways to Research Preeminence Collectively, UVA's research productivity, quality, and impact are strong but could be even stronger. To help us move from prominent to preeminent in research, we will focus on a discrete set of pressing challenges and opportunities that require collaboration across disciplines and schools and where UVA can be an international leader in important fields of research. We have identified five priority areas that represent major societal challenges and opportunities and draw on our existing strengths: Democracy, Environmental Resilience and Sustainability, Precision Medicine, the Brain and Neuroscience, and Digital Technology and Society. In each area, we will take a coordinated approach through institutes, centers, and labs to amplify the impact of our faculty’s work. 5 Strategic Research Themes Democracy Environmental Resilience & Sustainability Precision Medicine Brain & Neuroscience Digital Technology & Society By the Numbers 2.02 B in Research Proposal Activity Annually $436 M in Sponsored Research Awards in 2021 172 Invention Disclosures Research by the Numbers In the News Image Kimberly Mayer Named Associate Vice President for Research Development at UVA The Office of the Vice President for Research announced that Kimberly Mayer, PhD, MBA, will be UVA’s next Associate Vice President for Research Development.
