In the 3-D areas, students discover the broad scope of form in space. They explore a variety of means through which ideas and inspiration are conceptualized in sculpture and ceramics. Contemporary trends and evaluations of artistic development are woven into class projects. Assignments challenge creativity as well as provide a basic understanding of the different tools, materials, and techniques which are used to communicate through three-dimensional form. Undergraduates share and interact with graduate students in large studios which are equipped for welding metals, modeling and firing works in clay, casting in permanent materials, and constructing in wood. The horizons of sculpture have grown to include different kinds of art production, resulting in a broadening of aesthetic concepts. In response to contemporary trends, sculpture as an art form is redefining itself to include environments, installations, and new media. Our graduate and undergraduate sculpture programs are designed to encourage the exploration of the broadest possibilities of individual expression as well as the investigation and understanding of contemporary art issues. Students are challenged to excel in their production and in the articulation of concepts and concerns that affect and form their work.
