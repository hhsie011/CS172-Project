At the SJSU Lurie College of Education, we prepare transformative educators, counselors, therapists, school and community leaders. We do this through an emancipatory approach across our teaching, scholarship, and service. View our degrees and programs Statement in Support of Culturally Sustaining, Equity Driven, and Justice Focused Pedagogies The SJSU Lurie College of Education is committed to taking action to advance racial justice and educational equity. As deans, we are in solidarity with our faculty, students, staff, alumni, and community partners whose work confronts structural racism, inequity, and oppression in our educational systems and society at large. At a time when there is tremendous pressure and scrutiny on educators, we want to make clear our responsibility and commitment to support our colleagues and community to speak truth, advance our collective understanding through research and teaching, and advocate for justice. Education Deans and Leaders from campuses across the California State University system are similarly allied with educators who advance culturally sustaining, equity driven, and justice focused pedagogies and have issued a statement to voice their support. - Dean Heather Lattimer and Associate Dean Marcos Pizarro Read the statement Recent News Join the Lurie College Discord Join our new Lurie College Discord to chat with current, former, and future students of SJSU's Lurie College of Education!
