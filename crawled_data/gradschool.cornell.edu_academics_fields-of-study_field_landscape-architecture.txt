Master of Professional Studies in Landscape Architecture The Master of Professional Studies (M.P.S.) in Landscape Architecture was created for individuals with an interest in advancing their career options by pursuing timely and innovative issues related to planning, designing, and/or managing natural and built environments. The program investigates areas of Landscape Architecture through a year-long program of coursework, involvement in department faculty/project based problem solving and independent studies. The program requires 30 hours of course work. This must include 20 hours within the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, including 6 credits of project-based work. Interested prospective students should submit applications based on their area of interest and compatibility with Cornell's resources and the expertise of current faculty members in the Department of Landscape Architecture.
