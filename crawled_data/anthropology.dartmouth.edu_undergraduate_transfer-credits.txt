Transfer Credits First, please read the guidelines available on the Registrar's website. Read this document carefully and fill out the required application, including the statement as to how a particular course contributes to your intended studies. Second, you must obtain advance approval from the Department of Anthropology in order to get credit for courses in Anthropology that you plan to take elsewhere even if you aren't majoring or minoring in Anthropology and do not plan to do so. Applications must be submitted to the Chair of the Department of Anthropology at least a week prior to the Registrar's deadline. The Department of Anthropology normally approves transfer credit only for courses not offered on a regular basis. Thus the equivalents of our introductory courses, including ANTH 01, 03, 05, 06, and 09, will not be approved for transfer credit, nor will other courses that are regularly offered by the department. Please see the Courses Listing Schedule. If the course that you propose for transfer credit meets the above criteria, then submit the registrar's application plus a complete syllabus for the course that you intend to take, including the name of the instructor. You may have to obtain this information in advance from the host institution. This syllabus must show all assigned readings and exercises (exams, papers, quizzes, and other requirements) on a weekly basis. If the syllabus you need is not yet ready, submit one for the same course by the same professor when they last taught it; or if that too is impossible, submit one from the same course's most recent offering regardless of who taught it. Courses taught only by graduate students or by adjuncts hired solely to offer courses for foreign students are generally not approved for credit by this department. Transfer courses may never be used to replace seminars or to fulfill the Culminating Experience. Only courses from accredited four-year degree-granting institutions may be considered for transfer credit, and no credit is given for internship programs. Normally, not more than two transfer courses from other institutions will count toward a major or minor in Anthropology.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Anthropology Undergraduate Overview Major Modified Major Minor Global Health Minor How to Declare an Anthropology Major or Minor Courses Introductory Courses Archaeology Biological Anthropology Cultural Anthropology Independent Study Culminating Seminars Past Teaching Schedules Honors Program Honors Proposal Submission Form Transfer Credits Careers Alumni: Where Are They Now?
