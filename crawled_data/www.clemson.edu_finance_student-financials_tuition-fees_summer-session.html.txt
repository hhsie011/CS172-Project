Colleges and departments may cancel course offerings with low course enrollments. Summer bills will be available to view online on April 25. Summer 2022 Fees Summer 2022 Lab Fees A student's summer bill reflects registration for all courses taken during any 2022 Summer session (i.e., First Summer, Second Summer, etc.) Payment for all summer classes is due May 11. This bill includes courses taken during First Summer, Second Summer, Minimester A, B, C, and D. Adding classes or changing the number of credit hours after the initial due date will affect students' bills. Payments for those changes are due immediately. If you registered for a summer class but no longer plan to attend, be sure to drop the course to avoid being billed. Students are responsible for all associated fees for courses they are registered in, regardless of attendance.
