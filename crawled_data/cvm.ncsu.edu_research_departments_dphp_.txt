About Programs Epidemiology Microbiology Parasitology Pathology Poultry Health Ruminant Health Swine Health Research Faculty & Staff Emeritus Understanding and Reducing Disease in Animal Populations The Department of Population Health and Pathobiology trains doctors of veterinary medicine who will specialize in understanding and reducing disease in animal populations, particularly food animals. Disease in these populations poses serious risks to food safety, has economic implications, and, in cases where the disease is communicable to humans, is a significant public health hazard. Our faculty are recognized experts in the fields of epidemiology and public health, microbiology and immunology, parasitology, pathology, poultry, ruminant, and swine health management, as well as pharmacology and risk assessment. Our goals are to advance veterinary medical science through innovative basic and applied research, and by mentoring and inspiring students, providing world-class clinical and diagnostic services, and offering the public the latest knowledge through innovative extension and engagement activities. The department is also responsible for the Teaching Animal Unit, a unique real-farm environment in which Veterinary Medicine students learn husbandry, production management, and routine procedures used in livestock production.
