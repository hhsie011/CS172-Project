Einhorn Center for Community Engagement Find Student Opportunities Find Faculty and Staff Opportunities Engaged College Initiative Meet Our Team Our Supporters Contact Us The David M. Einhorn Center for Community Engagement launched on July 1, 2021, as a new integration of the Office of Engagement Initiatives (OEI) and Public Service Center (PSC). The Einhorn Center is the hub of community engagement at Cornell, supporting a university culture where students, faculty, staff and partners work together to create a better world. The Einhorn Center offers programs, workshops, consultations and funding, and we can help connect you with other community-engaged opportunities, resources and peers. While we work on a new website for the center: see our lists of programs and grants for students and for faculty and staff, meet our team, and find full information about our programs, grants and more on the former OEI and PSC websites. Incoming students: Register for Pre-Orientation Service Trips (POST) by June 17!
