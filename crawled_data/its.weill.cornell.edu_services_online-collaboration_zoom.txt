The host can share hosting responsibilities with other participants. All WCM Zoom accounts can create meetings with up to 300 participants. A webinar is a specialized meeting meant more for lectures or town halls. While there is no minimum size for a webinar, many more people can attend (up to 500 under special circumstances). You can designate up to 25 video presenters. The rest of the participants can submit questions through the Q&A function, or participate in polls. Webinar meetings need to be specially requested (see below). Larger Meeting and Webinar Licenses All WCM faculty, staff, students, and affiliates will be provisioned with Zoom licenses that allow them to conduct meetings with up to 300 participants. Three specialized license types are available for larger meetings and webinars: Larger Meeting - allows you to host a meeting with up to 500 participants. Webinar100 - allows you to host a webinar with up to 100 attendees. Webinar500 - allows you to host a webinar with up to 500 attendees. Requests for Webinar100 and Webinar500 Licenses upgrades will be granted for individual events upon request. Once the event has ended, your license will return to its previous state. License upgrades for Larger Meeting can be assigned upon request. ITS conducts an annual review of usage and reclaims Larger Meeting licenses that are not being used, returning those users to regular meeting capacity. To request a Larger Meeting, Webinar100 or Webinar500 license, please see this myHelpdesk article.

Is Zoom HIPAA compliant? Yes, Zoom signs the HIPAA Business Associate Agreement (BAA) for healthcare customers like WCM, meaning that Zoom is responsible for keeping patient information secure and reporting security breaches involving personal healthcare information. Zoom protects and encrypts all audio, video, and screen sharing data. You can use Zoom’s screen sharing, and video and audio conferencing to meet with patients and other healthcare professionals. Even with these security measures in place, ITS strongly advises that you do not share PHI or PII-related information via screen sharing, recording, and file sharing to protect confidential data at the college. For more information on Zoom and HIPAA, click here. To ensure that your Zoom meeting meets HIPAA security standards: Do not list your meeting publicly Require a meeting password: Log into your Zoom account and click “Schedule” When the “Schedule a Meeting” window appears, under Meeting Options select “Require meeting password” and input your desired password. Participants must input the password in order to join the meeting. The password can be included in the Meeting invitation.
