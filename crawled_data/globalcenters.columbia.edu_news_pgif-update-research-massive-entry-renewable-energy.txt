Entry of Renewable Energy Santiago PGIF Update: Research on Massive Entry of Renewable Energy February 03, 2020 In early January 2020, Dylan Possamaï, Assistant Professor of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research at Columbia University, visited Chile to work on the PGIF project entitled “Massive entry of renewable energy: Operation, storage and intermittency.” During the visit, together with co-Principal Investigator Alejandro Jofré (from Universidad de Chile’s Center for Mathematical Modeling) and associated postdoctoral student Nicolás Hernández, Possamai reviewed the jointly developed models on auction energy system optimization in aiming to solve the problem facing independent system operators (ISOs) “in which the amount of power qi is decided that each producer has to provide, giving incentives to the producers to reduce their pollutant emission,” explained Possamai. The investigators also discussed PGIF-related finalized work on optimization of demand-response programs for electricity providers and retailers, which consider consumer behavior aggregate statistics and include them in the contract itself. They further reviewed details on the joint conference to be held March 17-21 in Puerto Natales, in the south of Chile. The conference’s confirmed speakers include Possamai and Jofré themselves as well as Beatrice Acciaio from the London School of Economics, Jakša Cvitanić from the California Institute of Technology, Camilo Hernández from Columbia University, and Mathieu Rosenbaum from École Polytechnique, among several other experts.
