An undergraduate major in psychology provides a liberal arts and science education, which also can serve as preparation for graduate study in psychology, law, or the health professions. The undergraduate major in psychology enables graduates to understand and apply the scientific principles, facts, and basic methods of psychology to their personal and professional activities. Students with a bachelor’s degree (B.A./B.S.) in psychology may qualify for a variety of positions including those in social sciences, mental health, corrections, rehabilitation, developmental disability centers, and business (management, insurance, opinion polls). Professional work as a psychologist in academic, business, clinical, government, and school settings requires graduate degrees. Depending on professional goals, a minor in another discipline may be desirable.

Accordingly, graduates have an extensive knowledge of psychological principles and the conceptual and quantitative skills to conduct psychological research and to communicate the results to the scientific community, students in the classroom, and the general public. Graduates in counseling psychology are skilled in delivering services to diverse clientele in a variety of settings. The department also participates in the interdepartmental programs in human computer interaction (http://www.vrac.iastate.edu/hci/), neuroscience (http://www.neuroscience.iastate.edu/) and in the interdepartmental minor in gerontology (http://www.gerontology.iastate.edu/programs/). A formal class and a supervised practicum in the teaching of psychology is recommended for all doctoral students whose future plans may include teaching at the college level. A 12-month internship in a training site or agency approved by the faculty is required of all doctoral students in counseling psychology.
