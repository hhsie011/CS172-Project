Register PLANTING & PROVIDING A NATIVE HABITAT FOR BEES & BUTTERFLIES Tue., May 31, 6-8 pm / $39 / One Class Instructor: Carrie Driehaus In-person at VPC Campus Honeybees get all the glory, but did you know that Ohio has 400 native bee species? And one mason bee can pollinate as much as 100 honeybees combined? Native bee populations are declining, but each of us can help by planting and providing a habitat for them. In this two-hour course, learn how to choose the right plants and help support these amazing pollinators, whether you have a large garden space or just a small corner of a balcony. There are more than 130 butterfly and skipper species living in Ohio. Many of these species rely on a specific host plant where they lay their eggs so caterpillars have an abundant source of food as they grow. Butterfly populations are declining, but each of us can help them by planting and providing habitat for them. In this two-hour course, learn how you can plant and help support these amazing pollinators, whether you have a large garden space or just enough space for one flower pot. You'll learn which plants some of the most common butterflies need for survival and what some of their favorite flowers are for sipping nectar!
