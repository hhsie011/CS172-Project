This annual training is required of all personnel, including faculty, staff, researchers, librarians, contractors, and student workers. If you were assigned the course on or after June 15th, 2021, please click here to access the 2021-2022 version of the course. While the Faculty and Researcher Briefing that launched two years ago addresses a wide variety of topics, including academic integrity and managing student mental health issues, the anti-sexual harassment training focuses specifically on what sexual harassment is, including definitions, and who has a duty to report and how reports can be made. Both the existing Faculty and Researcher Briefing, required of all incoming faculty and researchers, and Columbia’s Anti-Harassment, Discrimination and Title IX Training, required of all incoming officers of the library and administrative officers and staff will still be required as they cover a broader range of topics. We do recognize the time obligation on faculty and staff and are focused on ways to moderate this burden. Columbia University is committed to providing a learning, living, and working environment free from unlawful discrimination and harassment, and to fostering a nurturing and vibrant community founded upon the fundamental dignity of all its members. In addition to being required by law, the training importantly serves the University’s goals of fostering a safe, inclusive, and supportive campus environment, and ensuring that Columbia is a community where all of us meet our shared responsibility to prevent gender-based misconduct in any form. The training itself should take between 45-60 minutes to complete. Current Employees Current employees will be assigned on their NYASH anniversary month and will have 30 days to complete the training. New hires will be assigned on a rolling basis and will have 30 days to complete the training.
