The IE Brown Executive MBA is different because of its unique focus on business paired with the humanities and social sciences. What did you enjoy most about your program? I really enjoyed the blended nature of the program between IE in Spain and Brown in Rhode Island, in addition to the immersion experience abroad. What was your primary academic area of interest? Entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship. My role during the program as well as my current position has a focus on running a businesses within a business. What were your postgraduate goals? To both elevate my position within my current corporate employer as well as to start a series of entrepreneurial ventures. What advice would you give to prospective applicants? While there may be EMBA programs with a longer lineage and larger alumni base, you will not find more genuinely good business people than in the IE Brown EMBA program. I would choose this program 100 out of 100 times when compared to any other top-ranked MBA program.
