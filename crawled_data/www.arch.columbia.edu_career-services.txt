INTERNSHIPS Elective Internship Course This elective credit-based internship course (1.5 credits) provides students with the opportunity to apply their expertise and skills in a real world setting. Students work with practitioners and industry experts to explore their interests in more depth and to expand their knowledge of working environments and career paths. Additionally, internships provide students with an inside view of their industry and the chance to develop connections in their professional network. Only students who have completed two semesters of graduate level work are eligible for the internship course. Contact careers@arch.columbia.edu for more information. International Students International students interested in working off-campus in a paid position while studying at GSAPP have 2 options: Elective Internship Course + CPT GSAPP offers a 1.5 elective internship course (ARCHA4050, PLANA4050, etc) to allow students to fulfill the academic requirements of CPT, since Internship is not a degree requirement at GSAPP. International students who enroll in the elective internship during fall or spring may not pay extra, as GSAPP’s tuition is a flat fee for fulltime enrollment between 12 and 19 pts. If a student enrolls in summer and is not registered full-time, they are charged for the 1.5 pt course. The class is 1.5 pts since the CPT rules state “students must earn credit commensurate with other elective courses that count toward the degree”. Pre-Completion OPT If an international student prefers not to enroll in the elective internship course and apply for CPT, they may apply for pre-completion OPT. OPT does not have the same academic CPT requirement of “an elective course that counts toward fulfilling your degree requirements". Students have a maximum of OPT time for each degree level. OPT time used during your program is deducted from post-graduation OPT. Elective CPT and OPT requires that students first be in the US in F-1 status for two consecutive full-time semesters. You must enter the US within 30 days of the start of the semester in order for your first semester to count towards the requirement. For more comprehensive information regarding important eligibility requirements, please visit Columbia ISSO.

LISCENSURE (ARCHITECTURE) The Architect Registration Examination (ARE), developed by the National Council of Architectural Registration Boards (NCARB), is the national architectural licensing examination. For more information about licensure requirements in New York, visit New York State’s Office of Professionals. Architectural Experience Program (AXP) The Architectural Experience Program (AXP) is a system designed by the National Council of Architectural Registration Boards (NCARB) to help aspiring architects track the hours and tasks completed during the internship years. Completion of the program is required by almost all American states before sitting for licensure exams. If you want to be a licensed architect in America, we highly recommend you learn more about AXP, and register as early as possible if appropriate, since it is a time-sensitive process. To learn more please visit the NCARB website. Architecture Registration Examination (ARE) The Architecture Registration Examination (ARE) is a series of 6 exams that allow an individual to get licensed in a given state in America. The exam is a national standard, but licensure is tied to individual states. Therefore you must decide in which state you would like to be a registered architect, and then apply to take the exam in that state. Eligibility to take the exam varies from state to state. The National Council of Architectural Registration Boards (NCARB) will release ARE 5.0 in November. To learn more about the transition and how to prepare for the tests, please visit NCARB’s website. To see the pass rates for Columbia GSAPP, please visit NCARB’s Pass Rates By School. National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB) The Master of Architecture program is accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB) and as per NAAB thereby does meet the academic requirements for licensure in all 50 states. Please note: states may have additional requirements to sit for the Architecture Registration Exam (ARE). Date of Last Revision: June 2020 PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATION (URBAN PLANNING) American Institute of Certified Planners (AICP) provides the only nationwide, independent verification of planners’ qualifications. The AICP Candidate Pilot Program enables students and recent graduates to demonstrate to potential employers a commitment to mastering planning skills and maintaining the highest standard of ethical practice.
