Transcripts Before applying For processing purposes, you may attach scanned versions of official transcripts to your application, as well as a copy of your degree certificate and/or diploma if the degree has been earned outside the U.S. A printout from a student portal is not considered an official copy. Some departments require official transcripts at the time of application. Check your program’s admissions requirements. Transcripts that are in a language other than English must be accompanied with English translations. After enrollment If you are admitted to a program, and accept the admissions offer, you will be required to submit an official, final transcript before your second semester of enrollment at KU. Otherwise, you will not be permitted to enroll for your second semester. For those with degree conferral pending, we recommend you wait until your institution has posted degree conferral to your official transcripts before initiating the process of providing the document to Graduate Admissions.
