Having an AED close by can mean the difference between life and death when every second counts. The University of Kansas maintains more than 105 AEDs in 89 different buildings. See the list below or click the map link to find the AED closest to you. AED Map Each AED performs daily self checks on its components, including the pads and batteries. The AED is still operational and ready for use as long as the status indicator light on the front of the AED flashes green. If the status indicator light flashes red or orange, or the machine starts beeping, notify KU Public Safety immediately so that the AED can be serviced.
