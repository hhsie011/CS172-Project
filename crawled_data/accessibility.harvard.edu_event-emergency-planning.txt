If elevators will not be available during an evacuation and any participants are unable to exit the building, an area of refuge should be identified. A staff person should be identified who will inform first responders of the location of any participants who remain in the building. Inform all on-site event staff of emergency evacuation procedures. Announce pertinent safety information at the start of the event. Never assume that all individuals with disabilities need special help in an emergency and always ask before providing assistance.
