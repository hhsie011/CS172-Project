Air pollution. According to global health experts, poor air quality causes premature mortality in up to nine million people every year. One third of deaths from stroke, lung cancer, and heart disease are caused by microscopic pollutants in the air that can infiltrate our respiratory and circulatory system, damaging our lungs, heart, and brain. On Wednesday January 26, join us online for the first Columbia Climate School Earth Series of the year, as two of the school’s world-renowned atmospheric scientists discuss an exciting interdisciplinary project aimed to better understand this threat and help move global policies to clear the air and protect public health.
