Whether you are researching for program notes, a traditional publication, new digital humanities projects, or need inspiration; the Center is ready to help. Contact us anytime! Researchers, classes, and community members are encouraged and welcome to visit and use these unique materials housed here at Baylor University. In addition to providing extensive collections, the libraries also provide support throughout the research life cycle: partner as idea generators assist in locating appropriate materials matching your research needs support throughout the proposal, writing, and publishing processes Find & Access A great place to start your research is on our main library page with OneSearch. OneSearch is the place to discover physical items in the Baylor Libraries, as well as most of the online content that we provide for your use. It is designed primarily for keyword searching, but also provides the ability to search by title, author, or subject. If you are looking for something specific, you can use OneSearch for that too--see the Advanced Search page. If you need an introduction or refresher in basic searching or using the website, please check out this tutorial. Research Tools Journal articles and databases are key resources for you as you build knowledge in your discipline. Journal articles are accessed through OneSearch or in specific databases. Databases include a wide range of sources including e-journals, e-books, primary source materials, and streaming audio and video. Click here for an A-Z list of databases. You can limit this search by using the subject pull down menu and picking ‘music’ or ‘art’, etc. Research guides are available to help locate resources and offer instruction for arts subjects, and other tools including using Zotero for citation management, basic searching, and aid in writing papers. The research guide subject list is located here. Borrow, Request, Renew You can locate loan periods, how to renew online, course reserve links, and other information on this webpage.
