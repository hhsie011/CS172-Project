Learn more Speakers All affiliates are welcome to propose speakers for the CCMB/DSI seminar series, and the Center has resources to support travel and incidentals for such speakers and also welcomes opportunities to cosponsor speakers with departments and centers on campus. Trainers All affiliates are potential trainers in the Computational Biology graduate program. We encourage affiliates to consider serving on the Computational Biology graduate admissions committee, both to help select excellent trainees for our community and to identify potential new lab members or rotation advisees. Our graduate program has a large and supportive mentoring community with an active annual review process, cross-listing of graduate courses, student-led journal clubs, and Center affiliates often serve as thesis committee members for our doctoral program. Funding There are opportunities for funding graduate students of affiliates through the NIH-funded T32 in Biological Data Science and through the Center. The Center also has some resources to support student travel to present at conferences and we encourage lab members of Center affiliates to also see opportunities for conference travel funding from the Brown Graduate Student Council as well as the BioMed Department and the Medical School depending on the student’s home department affiliation. Computational Biology graduate students have opportunities to gain priority access to Oscar’s high-performance computing environment at Brown, attend professional development roundtables with CCMB and DSI, and to enroll in methods-development focused grant writing course and modules. Faculty Meetings All affiliated faculty are welcome at CCMB’s monthly faculty meetings regarding the Center's activities.
