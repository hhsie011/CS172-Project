His teaching ranges from Boccaccio's Decameron to modern and contemporary literature, film, media and the digital humanities. He has held visiting positions at the University of Bologna, the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, the University of London, the École des Hautes Études in Paris, and the University of Sydney, Australia. In recognition of his research-based teaching, he was nominated Royce Family Professor of Teaching Excellence. His awards and honors also include the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (with the rank of Ufficiale) for his contribution to the dissemination of Italian culture in North America. He has published several books on literary maladies and national identity, post-humanism and the hyper-novel, and literature in the digital age. He is the editor of the Yale anthology Italian Tales and the co-editor of the Cambridge edition of Pico della Mirandola's Oration On Human Dignity. He was the recipient of three major grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities and a Digital Innovation Fellowship from the American Council of Learned Society, in support of various digital projects, now part of the Virtual Humanities Lab. Among his recent collaborative initiatives, a series of interactive installations of the Garibaldi moving panorama were featured in library and museums in Brazil, Italy and the U.K. His digital monograph entitled: Shadow Plays. Virtual Realities in an Analogue World, will be published by Stanford University Press in 2022.

Proceedings of the sixteenth ACM conference on Hypertext and hypermedia - HYPERTEXT '05, 2005. Full Text Research Research Overview Project in progress: a digital monograph entitled Shadow Plays. Virtual Realities in an Analogue World to be published by Stanford University Press in 2022. Since the mid-1990s, Prof. Riva's research has mainly focused on the role of emerging technologies in the humanities. Among his award winning online projects: the Decameron Web, the Pico Project and the Garibaldi and the Risorgimento project, centered on the Garibaldi panorama, a unique survival of a form of public art that was prevalent throughout the nineteenth century. Currently he is at work on a media archaeological study tracing a genealogy of Virtual Reality in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century optical spectacles (cosmorama, magic lantern, phantasmagoria, panorama, stereoscopic photography). Research Statement Some of the questions I address in my research: do digital media promote a new type of "encyclopedic" learning, based on learning communities sharing common cognitive "values"? Or do they foster, instead, new forms of fragmentary knowledge, thinking and "values"? How can electronic media enhance our historical understanding of documents (texts, images and other cultural products) belonging to a distant cultural past? More specifically: how can classic literary and philosophical works of the Italian humanist tradition, as diverse as Giovanni Boccaccio's Decameron (a narrative encyclopedia of the late Middle Ages), G. Pico della Mirandola's Oration On Human Dignity (a "manifesto" of Renaissance humanism) or Italo Calvino's combinatorial "hypernovels" (the imaginative expression of our contemporary cybernetic society) inform new modes of thought for 21st-century (post)humanism? I see the main challenge of my work as translating into critical discourse the new cognitive values emerging from my experimentation with digital technology, for the benefit of scholars, teachers and students engaged in these practices, as well as all those readers interested in the future (the present) of the humanities.
