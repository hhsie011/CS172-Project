Many expect this contest between Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen to be closer than the last, noting the continued trend toward the extremes in French domestic politics and in Europe more generally. As France prepares to vote on April 24, this panel will bring together experts on French society and the electoral process in order to analyze democratic transformations, electoral participation, the evolution of public opinion, the role of electoral promises and political polarization in France. This discussion will take place in English. This event is jointly presented by Columbia Global Centers | Paris, the Alliance Program, the European Institute, the Maison Française, and the Sciences Po American Foundation.
