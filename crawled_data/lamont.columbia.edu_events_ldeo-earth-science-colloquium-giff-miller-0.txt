Giff is a Quaternary geologist and paleoclimatologist who focuses on reconstructing past environmental change and improving Quaternary dating methods, particularly in Arctic landscapes. Giff’s current research projects include 1) the timing, mechanism and impacts of ice growth and decay in Arctic Canada, 2) developing new or improved applications of protein diagenesis to date geological and archaeological events, 3) the role of humans in late Quaternary environmental change in Australia and Madagascar, 4) high resolution records of North Atlantic climate variability derived from lake sediment, and 5) placing 20th century Arctic warming in a longer-term Additional information to follow.
