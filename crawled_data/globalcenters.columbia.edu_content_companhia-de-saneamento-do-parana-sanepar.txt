The company provides treated water supply, sewage collection and treatment and solid waste management services. Responsible for the provision of sanitation services in 345 cities in Paraná and another 291 smaller areas, in addition to the Santa Catarina municipality of Porto União, it has an 84,600 kilometer network for the withdrawal and distribution of drinking water, for sewage collection and for the discharge of treated sewage. Regarding solid waste, it operates landfills in Apucarana, Cornélio Procópio and Cianorte – the latter also serving the municipalities of São Tomé, Terra Boa, Guaporema and Indianópolis. Headquartered in Curitiba with a work force numbering over seven thousand, Sanepar is a reference in sanitation in Brazil. It provides a universal water supply network in all the municipalities it serves. 99.84% of the sewage it collects is treated before discharge into water bodies. The company invests constantly to maintain service excellence. In 2016 alone, R$ 742.4 million was invested in technological updating, improvement and expansion works for the Sanepar operating complex – comprising water treatment plants (WTP), wells, water reservoirs, wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) and other assets –, that drive financial gains for the company and society as a whole. During the year, Sanepar implanted 46,000 new water connections and 94,000 new sewage connections. The company posted net earnings of R$ 626.8 million in 2016, up 43% on the previous year, a demonstration of its robustness and capacity to create value. Sanepar also has a 40% stake in CS Bioenergia S.A., a special purpose enterprise incorporated in partnership with Cattalini Bioenergia to exploit sewage-based energy generation at the biodigestion unit implanted next to the Belém wastewater treatment plant in Curitiba. The activities of CS Bioenergia will comply with Brazil's national solid waste policy governing the non-generation/reduction, reuse, treatment and disposal of waste.
