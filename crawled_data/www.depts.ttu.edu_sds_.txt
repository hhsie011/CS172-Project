Twitter Facebook Instagram Tweets by @TTUSDS Student Disability Services Student Disability Services is more than accommodations. Texas Tech University has one of the most comprehensive departments for students with disabilities in the state of Texas. Student Disability Services (SDS) staff provide a variety of accommodations and services for individuals with disabilities. Accommodations are tailored to the individual and the disability. With approximately 2,000 students registered for services, we encourage students to overcome challenges and attain personal and academic success while the SDS staff functions as a student advocate. Through active involvement with all areas of the University, SDS is able to monitor conditions relevant to students with disabilities and offer support in decisions affecting their quality of life. In addition to the services offered by our main Student Disability Services office, SDS also offers a supplemental academic enhancement program for students with Learning Disabilities and Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorders, the TECHniques Center. The TECHniques Center is a fee-for-service program that provides one-on-one, regularly scheduled content and study skills tutoring, as well as weekly meetings with an academic counselor. Mission Student Disability Services promotes each student's learning experience by providing programs and services for students with disabilities and education of the campus community on issues related to students' disabilities. Vision The Department of Student Disability Services will become nationally recognized as the leader in enhancing student learning and development for students with disabilities through the provision of direct academic services such as classroom accommodations, tutoring, training, academic counseling, and ongoing campus training and education. Important Information ADA Syllabus Statement Faculty, is the ADA statement on your syllabi up to date? A standard and mandatory syllabus statement has been published for you to use (O.P. 34.22 and O.P. 10.08). View the mandatory Americans with Disabilities Act Syllabus Statement. Veterans with Disabilities Because we know the transition from active duty to a college classroom can be challenging, SDS would like to make this transition as smooth as possible. Resources to accommodate a disability can open up educational opportunities.
