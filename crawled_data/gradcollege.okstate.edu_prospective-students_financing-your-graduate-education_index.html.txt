Fellowships A fellowship provides financial support to graduate students to pursue graduate studies. Fellowships are generally merit-based or project-based and may be internal or external awards to support full-time students in their course of study. The link above provides information on just some of the fellowships available to graduate students. Grants Grants are a source of federal, state or private funding designated for costs associated with research or other approved activities. The grant may include funds for an assistantship, research materials and supplies, tuition, or other related costs. Eligibility for grants is stipulated by the funding source. Working on Campus The student worker is an employed student who is not on an assistantship. This constitutes an employer-employee status within the Oklahoma State University system and workers are compensated based on time worked. Student worker positions are available in a wide range of areas across campus. Open positions can often be found in the Hire OSU Grads system and accessed by current students. Loans Loans are funds that are borrowed to help pay for educational expenses. They may originate from federal or private sources. Federal law sets the maximum interest rates and fees can be charged for a federally-guaranteed education loan. Private loans (sometimes called alternative loans) are not part of the federal government guaranteed student loan program, and can be more costly. To learn more about loans follow this link. Awards Awards and other forms of recognition are given across campus. The Graduate College sponsors several awards each year, and these awards are given in conjunction with a monetary prize.
