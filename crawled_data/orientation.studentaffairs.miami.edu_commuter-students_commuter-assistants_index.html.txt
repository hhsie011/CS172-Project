Commuter Assistants specialize in helping off-campus students transition to collegiate academics and find a niche on campus, as well as creating a welcoming, inclusive environment for all commuters. Commuter Assistants are experienced students who work with commuters in individual and group settings to connect them to other students, the campus, and any needed resources. All first-year students who live off campus are assigned to a Commuter Assistant. COMMUTER ASSISTANT STAFF MISSION STATEMENT The Commuter Assistants will facilitate the transition of first-year commuter students into college by providing steady guidance and engaging programs. We aim to build bridges between diverse students in the melting pot that is the University of Miami in order to help them discover their passions and themselves.
