The Cherokee Nation is a sovereign tribal government. Today, the Cherokee Nation is one of the largest tribes in the United States with more than 413,000 tribal citizens worldwide. With 140,000 Cherokee Nation citizens residing within the tribe’s reservation in northeastern Oklahoma, it’s more important than ever to educate future doctors in the area. The importance of education has been a guiding philosophy of the Cherokees in Tahlequah since the establishment of the Cherokee Male and Female Seminaries in 1851. Since that time, the Cherokee Nation has made a deep investment in educating the next generation of educators and is now furthering that investment to better the health of all on the Cherokee Reservation. Rural, Tribal, Ready Training in Tahlequah provides the perfect incubator for primary care physicians to practice in rural Oklahoma. With a significant rural and tribal population in the state, understanding the unique social determinants of health that exist in Tahlequah translates into better care for all Oklahomans and members of all Oklahoma tribal members. Tribal Medical Track The Tribal Medical Track prepares medical students for a primary care residency at tribal facilities and a successful practice in tribal, rural and underserved Oklahoma. The tribal medical track offers unique learning opportunities for motivated students to fully develop their skills, knowledge and abilities to succeed in a challenging practice environment while learning about the rich cultures of American Indians.
