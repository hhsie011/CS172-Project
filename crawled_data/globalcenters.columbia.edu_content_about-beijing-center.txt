It helps provide our faculty, students, and alumni with a broader global view and international experience by forging connections with local intelligence. Facing unprecedented challenges in 2020-2021, the Center created an on-campus atmosphere that supported the remote learning of more than 2,500 international students, enabling them to continue their study, research, and networking in China. The Beijing Center designed and hosted 76 programs and activities that provided unique opportunities for knowledge exchange and skill development across multiple disciplines, including medicine and public health, environment and sustainability, business, innovation and entrepreneurship, engineering and applied science, women in leadership, arts, culture and history, education and others. More than 100 Columbia and regional scholars, researchers, and leaders joined our thought-provoking conversations during which they shared and discovered ideas that spawned new initiatives. Throughout this tumultuous year, the Beijing Center maintained an active regional community, provided crucial services, and inspired broad social influence with timely and critical expertise and resource sharing. The Center’s work and efforts culminated in 5 million social media views, email exchanges, and online participation, garnering praise and plaudits from our stakeholders.
