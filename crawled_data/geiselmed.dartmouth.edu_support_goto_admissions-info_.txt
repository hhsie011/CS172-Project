Students start learning about clinical care in On Doctoring week one, Year One, and gain hands-on clinical experience in a program uniquely designed to expose them to a broad array of patient populations and training sites, from Dartmouth's affiliated state-of-the-art medical center, to urban hospitals to health clinics in Africa. Geisel School of Medicine students have the flexibility to explore their calling, whether they are headed for a career in medical research and teaching, subspecialty practice, primary care, or healthcare policy. Our students—having studied both the science and the art of medicine at a school with a 200-year history of innovation—can go anywhere and often become the leaders of innovation and change in health care. Because at the Geisel School of Medicine, there are no barriers to becoming the physician, the scientist, and the person you want to be. There are only opportunities. Diversity Mission and Vision The Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth (Geisel) believes that a diverse and inclusive community of students, residents, fellows, staff, and faculty enhances our mission to address the world's health problems through research and discovery, the evaluation and improvement of systems of healthcare, and the education of the best future physicians and scientists. Geisel (and Dartmouth, writ large) recognizes diversity in all of its forms relating to race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, disability, veteran status, marital status, or any other legally protected status. Furthermore, Geisel recognizes that diversity includes differences in socioeconomic background and other less easily defined measures that comprise the rich breadth of human experiences, talents, and attributes. Research demonstrates that working and learning in an environment that is diverse in thought and perspective results in improvement in the educational quality and organizational outcomes at all levels and for people of all backgrounds. Therefore, we commit resources to initiatives that will recruit, support, and retain students, trainees, faculty, and staff that encompass the full diversity of our population. Within this broad scope, we emphasize the recruitment and retention of Black/African Americans, Indigenous Peoples of North America, Hispanic/Latinx, as well as active and former members of the U.S. military service to reach our vision to: educate students on best practices within a complex society; seek innovative solutions in research and clinical care; build bridges to the communities we serve both locally and globally; and, provide role models and mentors to future generations.
