Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate in economics and University Professor at Columbia University, writes in his newly published article Plagued by Trumpism, "there is nothing like a pandemic to focus attention on what really matters." As the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases continues to climb around the world, the consequent uncertainty, anxiety, and other feelings and reactions have been affecting our daily life. How to take care of our beloved ones and ourselves? How can we better prepare for the hardship it brings and even worse aftermath in economic and societal areas? Are we able to learn our lessons from a pandemic? Over the past two months, Columbia Global Centers | Beijing has been working closely with experts and scholars from Columbia University, Peking University, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and other institutions to help our audience understand the unknown virus and the mental health conditions of frontline medical staff and people affected by the virus outbreak, as well as to provide solutions and suggestions for improvement. All the valuable information will be consolidated, edited, and shared through Beijing Center's webinar series in the following weeks. Joining us at the first webinar are experts in psychology and education to discuss the keys to self-care and stress management when facing a healthcare crisis.
