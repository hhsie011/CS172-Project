U.S. Citizens and permanent residents, who decide to defer their acceptance beginning with the Class of 2007, can apply for scholarship assistance in a future academic year even if they do not apply at the time of application for admission. However, students must submit an application for any given year prior to being considered for scholarship assistance for that year. Deferred international students, who do not receive scholarship assistance at the time of admission, will not be considered for scholarship assistance during their time at Brown.
