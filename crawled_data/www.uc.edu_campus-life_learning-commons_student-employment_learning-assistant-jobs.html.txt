Outside of class, LAs host an office hour each week. As a Learning Assistant, you will coordinate your office hour time, day, and location with your faculty member and supervisor. Students acting as Learning Assistants work in a small teaching team with faculty members who are invested in implementing hands on, application-based learning in and outside the classroom. From an LA’s perspective, that might include facilitating group discussion, guiding student groups through problem sets, or meeting with students outside of class to discuss key concepts. Qualifications Competitive Learning Assistant applicants will have: At least one full year of college (by the start of employment) 3.0 GPA or above is required (and must maintain a 3.0 University GPA and a 3.0 Term GPA in order to remain eligibly employed) B+ or above in the select courses connected to the position Strong interpersonal and communication skills Reference Requirements Applicants are required to submit at least 1 reference and preferably 2 references. References from faculty, especially those who teach in the subjects applicants are looking to support, are welcome. For example, if you are applying to be a Supplemental Instruction Leader for CHEM 1030 and MATH 1062, at least one of your references should be from a faculty member who teaches one of those courses. Other professional recommendations should be solicited from former employers for relevant positions, or individuals who have overseen the applicant during ongoing and substantive community service or other projects. Recommendations from personal or family friends or other UC students will not be accepted. How to Apply Once you have reviewed the position responsibilities and qualifications, go back to the Student Employment main page and apply. You are able to select more than one position you want to apply for within the application, but you should not select all positions. Questions?
