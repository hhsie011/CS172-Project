When you consider the number of Syracuse University students who live in the Boston area, the number of graduates who have found success here, and the number of Boston alumni who support SU both financially and with their time and energy, it’s clear that Boston bleeds Orange. What is it that’s ingrained SU into the very fabric of Boston? A vast network of SU alumni. More than 13,000 Boston-area alumni open doors for SU grads in the worlds of management, finance, the arts and sciences, and many others. A large home base of over 1,100 SU students who hail from the Boston area. A wide range of events. Alumni networking events, industry panel discussions, new student send-offs—all these and more give alumni and students the opportunity to engage with SU in Boston, creating a lively exchange of ideas. See upcoming events. A strong presence of Boston-area alumni, parents, and friends who volunteer in SU leadership positions. Four serve on the Board of Trustees, three are members of school and college advisory boards, and 14 serve on the Boston Regional Council.
