MCZ collections are comprised of approximately 21-million extant and fossil invertebrate and vertebrate specimens, which continue to be a focus of research and teaching for MCZ, Harvard and outside students and researchers. News Lunchtime Seminars Contact Affiliates & Facilities Collections Operations Annual Reports The MCZ is comprised of 10 departments, 9 of which contain research collections (Entomology, Herpetology, Ichthyology, Invertebrate Paleontology, Invertebrate Zoology, Malacology, Mammalogy, Ornithology and Vertebrate Paleontology), in addition to the Ernst Mayr Library and the Concord Field Station. The MCZ is led by current Faculty Director Professor Gonzalo Giribet, with oversight from the MCZ Faculty, the museum's governing body. Eleven faculty-curators and 4 emeriti provide additional vision and leadership to the museum's collections. MCZ faculty-curators are Harvard faculty members within the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology (OEB), leading active research areas that include Biodiversity and Systematics, Biology of Marine Systems, Biomechanics and Physiology, Ecology, Evolutionary Developmental Biology, Mathematical and Computational Biology, Neuroethnology and Behavioral Ecology, Paleobiology, and Population and Evolutionary Genetics. The MCZ also has a productive associates roster. These affiliated researchers are hosted by individual departments and are reviewed and approved by the MCZ Faculty Board. MCZ Faculty Governing Board The MCZ's charter, signed in 1859, mandates that the Museum's activities will be overseen by a governing board, the Faculty of the Museum of Comparative Zoology.
