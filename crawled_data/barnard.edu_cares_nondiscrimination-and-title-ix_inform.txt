Definitions Definitions Harassment and discrimination are complex issues, and in order to address and prevent all forms of harassment and discrimination within and around the Barnard College community, a number of definitions and policies exist at the university level as well as Manhattan (jurisdiction of the college), state, and federal levels of governments. This page is intended to consolidate an array of definitions that exist. Barnard Policy Definitions Affirmative Consent Definition Criminal Definitions Policy Against Discrimination and Harassment Policy Against Discrimination and Harassment Clear behavioral standards, important definitions, and descriptions of prohibited conduct are included in this policy. This policy is intended to further the goal that faculty, staff and students are to be able to work and study free from harassment. Rules of Decorum Rules of Decorum The College’s resolution processes are designed to be an educational disciplinary experience. Hearing Participants are expected to act in accordance with their role as it is described above. The Decision-maker is responsible for conducting the hearing and maintaining decorum such that the hearing is executed fairly and effectively. If the Decision-maker determines that decorum is broken and the hearing has become disorderly the Decision-maker may recess or pause proceedings to address the behavior. Misconduct during the hearing can take many forms, both minor and egregious. It is within the Decision-maker’s discretion to discourage or penalize Parties, Witnesses or Advisors who demonstrate a lack of the decorum. Informal Resolution Policy Informal Resolution Policy Parties who do not wish to proceed with an investigation and live hearing, and instead seek Barnard’s assistance to resolve allegations of Title IX-covered misconduct, may elect to enter the informal resolution process. Generally speaking, these resolution options are less time intensive than an investigation and live hearing, while still affording students an opportunity to actively participate in a process led by Barnard for resolution of their complaints. New York Students' Bill of Rights New York Students' Bill of Rights The following is a list of rights outlined by New York State, and included in Barnard College Title IX Procedures. Barnard Student Campus Climate Survey Reports Barnard Student Campus Climate Survey Reports The Barnard Student Campus Climate Survey is designed to gather information about student knowledge and experience related to discrimination and harassment, to raise awareness about student experiences and campus resources, and to expand the conversation and engagement opportunities related to these important issues. Nondiscrimination & Title IX Team Training Materials Section 106.45(b) of the 2020 Final Title IX Rules require the sharing of "[a]ll materials used to train Title IX Coordinators, investigators, decision-makers, and any person who facilitates an informal resolution process. A recipient must make these training materials publicly available on its website" For the purposes of compliance with section 106.45 of the Title IX Final Rules, this page includes all training materials utilized by Barnard College for the purposes of ongoing education and training individuals involved with the Nondiscrimination and Title IX Grievance Resolution Procedures.
