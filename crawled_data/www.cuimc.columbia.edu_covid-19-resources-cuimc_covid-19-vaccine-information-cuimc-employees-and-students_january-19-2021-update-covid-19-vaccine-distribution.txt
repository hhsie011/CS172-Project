Below is the Question of the Day: Can I choose to receive either Moderna or Pfizer vaccine? Health care personnel will not be able to choose the type of COVID-19 vaccine they receive. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are both mRNA vaccines and have extremely similar efficacy and safety. NYP is receiving both the Pfizer and the Moderna vaccine. There are no recommendations for specific individuals who should get the Pfizer vs. the Moderna vaccine. Thank you and hope you continue to stay safe!
