Commercial materials are not routinely digitized. Email rbml@columbia.edu for more information. This series includes audio cassettes, film reel, DVD, CD, and other AV formats both made by Baraka and by others. The series is arranged by medium, with each medium grouping given its own particular arrangement. The A/V materials contain VHS, Beta, 16mm and 35mm film reel, and DVD. The 174 numbered video reels are helical scan open reel film. The bulk of these materials contain footage of Baraka's various political activities throughout the seventies, including his involvement with the Kawaida Towers, the African Women's Conference, Black Women's United Front, and the Congress of African Peoples. A/V materials are arranged in the order in which they were given by Baraka. Finally, the audio group consists primarily of materials not created by Baraka, and previously released. However, of particular interest is a 1994 recording of a Baraka poetry reading, and a number of copies of a vinyl recording of songs written by Baraka, performed by The Advanced Workers with the Anti-Imperialist Singers. The audio materials are arranged by medium. External users and Columbia affiliates may view materials on-site at RBML. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, only Columbia affiliates may view materials on-site at Avery, Starr, and Burke. After clicking 'Submit Request', users will login with their UNI and password (Columbia affiliates) or their special collections account (external users).
