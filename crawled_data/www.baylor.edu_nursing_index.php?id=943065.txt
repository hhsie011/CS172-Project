The University provides a vibrant campus community for more than 19,000 students by blending interdisciplinary research with an international reputation for educational excellence and a faculty commitment to teaching and scholarship. Chartered in 1845 by the Republic of Texas through the efforts of Baptist pioneers, Baylor is the oldest continually operating University in Texas. Located in Waco, Baylor welcomes students from all 50 states and more than 90 countries to study a broad range of degrees among its 12 nationally recognized academic divisions. Baylor is actively recruiting new faculty with a strong commitment to the classroom and an equally strong commitment to building on our legacy of integrating faith and academic excellence in education. The LHSON supports Baylor University’s Academic Strategic Plan Illuminate. The nursing school serves as one of the pivotal anchors in the plan’s interdisciplinary areas of focus: Health, Data Sciences, Materials Science, Human Flourishing, Leadership & Ethics and Baylor in Latin America. Through impactful research and scholarship, the LHSON is giving light to new possibilities in nursing and other significant areas. Ultimately, Baylor aspires to become America's preeminent Christian research university. The Baylor University Louise Herrington School of Nursing (LHSON) located in Dallas, Texas, was established in 1909 as a diploma program within Baylor Hospital in Dallas, which is now Baylor Scott & White Health’s Baylor University Medical Center, and in 1950 became one of the six degree-granting schools of Baylor University. The first Baccalaureate degrees were granted in 1952, establishing the School among the earliest baccalaureate nursing programs in Texas. In 1999, the School was renamed the Baylor University Louise Herrington School of Nursing after Louise Herrington Ornelas, a 1992 Baylor Alumna Honoris Causa, who made an endowment gift to the School. Exemplifying the nursing school motto, Learn.Lead.Serve.® it is the steadfast mission of the LHSON to educate and prepare both Baccalaureate and Graduate-level nurses within a Christian community for professional practice, healthcare leadership, and worldwide service. Nurses have been called to make a difference and being a Baylor nurse means being the hands and feet of Christ for those who are hurting or in need of comfort. Today, the LHSON is comprised of a 100,000-square-feet, contemporary four-story Academic Building that includes active learning classrooms for professors to deliver state-of-the-art instruction through innovative active learning methodologies, plus much more. We also have a four-story Clinical Simulation Building houses clinical practice laboratories. The LHSON offers Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degrees through Traditional, FastBacc® (one-year accelerated) and Distance Accelerated BSN programs. Plus, the LHSON offers an online Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) program with tracks that include Family Nurse Practitioner, Nurse-Midwifery, Neonatal Nurse Practitioner, Pediatric Nurse Practitioner, Executive Nurse Leadership, Adult Gerontology Acute Care Nurse Practitioner and U.S. Army Anesthesia Nursing (USAGPAN). The U.S. News & World Report 2022 Best Graduate Schools rankings include several LHSON programs, including the DNP program at No. 60 nationally and “Best Nursing” specialty rankings for LHSON’s USAGPAN, which operates at the U.S. Army Medical Center of Excellence at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, at No. 8 nationally, and Baylor’s Nurse-Midwifery program, which is No. 21 in the nation.  We invite you to come discover the vision and excitement at Baylor as we seek to fill the following positions in the Louise Herrington School of Nursing.
