You are here: GT Home Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering (BS/MS) Degree Level: Master's Many schools at Georgia Tech offer BS/MS degree programs that, like the Graduate Course Option, allow eligible students to use up to 6 credit hours of graduate-level coursework in the major discipline for both degrees. The BS/MS programs typically include research and mentoring components and have their own GPA requirements. Chemical and biomolecular engineering principles are taught as the foundation of the BS degree; however, students are also expected to solve all kinds of problems, to view systems in their entirety, and to formulate and test solutions irrespective of the framework of the problem. The five year BS/MS option is for undergraduate students who are interested in additional education beyond the BS degree. Students are eligible to apply for the program if they have a Georgia Tech GPA of 3.5 or higher and have completed ChBE 3200.
