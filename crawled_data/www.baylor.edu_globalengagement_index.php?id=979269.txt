More Baylor students are choosing to complete some type of experiential learning program during their study at Baylor. These experiences can better prepare students for their future careers and help them gain a global lens to approach their field of interest. Internships or research programs abroad can also help students gain a competitive edge in the job market or graduate school application process after graduation. Study Abroad Internships The information below is focused on academic internships. When considering an internship or research opportunity, it is important to take into consideration major and minor academic requirements, as opposed to a preferred program location. Students should make sure the experience aligns with their professional goals, allowing them to be exposed to diverse cultural surroundings for global and intercultural learning. The question to ask is: What do I want to do? rather than: Where do I want to do it? FIE London: Students do an internship in the heart of London, England alongside their coursework. Internships are available in most disciplines. Click here to apply. CEA Prague: Students can select an internship alongside coursework in beautiful Prague. This is one of CEA’s original sites and a reputable internship program. Click here to apply. All Baylor students should work with the Center for Global Engagement for international internship placements. Advising appointments can be made with Bo White, Director of Study Abroad, Bo_White@baylor.edu Research Opportunities The Office of Engaged Learning does considerable work to help students discover opportunities to live, work, travel, research, and study abroad. Sometimes this is through efforts in major fellowships and awards, where the OEL supports scores of students each year in their pursuit of the Rhodes, Fulbright, Marshall, Gates Cambridge, Mitchell, or Schwarzman awards. In other instances, they work with students to discover study abroad opportunities and to take advantage of our relationships with global partners that align with their goals and interests. Useful On-Campus Offices To prepare for internships and research programs abroad, students should explore offices and programs at Baylor that will enable them to set their professional and personal goals, to potentially find funding, or to obtain the necessary skills to get the most out of these experiences.
