Texas Tech University Directory Raiderlink A-Z Index Undergraduate Admissions Menu Search TTU Undergraduate Admissions Undergraduate Residency Determination Residency Determination Residency for admission and tuition purposes at a public college or university in Texas is not the same as residency for voting or tax purposes. The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board and the Texas Legislature establishes the rules that govern Texas residency for tuition purposes. Students and applicants are assigned a residency status based upon the answers provided on the admissions application. If you are unsure whether to submit a domestic or international application, you can utilize the Domestic or International Determination tool for guidance. Classifications will be either Texas resident (in-state), nonresident (out-of-state), or foreign (international). A United States citizen or permanent resident who does not meet the required criteria will be classified as a nonresident for tuition purposes. A non-citizen who is not a permanent resident of the United States and has not been permitted by U.S. Congress to adopt the United States as their domicile while in this country will be classified as a foreign (international) student. As required by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, all returning Former Tech students who have not been enrolled with Texas Tech University for two or more regular semesters will be required to submit the Core Residency Questionnaire for verification of their residency status. Follow these steps to submit the Core Residency Questionnaire: Log into RaiderConnect Navigate to Resources & Forms tab Complete and submit the Residency Form You will be contacted via email regarding next steps Former Tech may be required to complete a residency questionnaire once their application has been reviewed. Any time a student or applicant who believes they may qualify for Texas residency wishes to change their status must complete the questionnaire as the first step Out-of-State Residency Change If a student is classified as a nonresident and wishes to be considered for reclassification as a resident, they must complete the Core Residency Questionnaire. Current students should email admissions.residency@ttu.edu to be provided with the questionnaire. Once received, a staff member will contact the student via email with a list of the required supplemental items and documentation. If you live in Texas solely to attend school and reside out-of-state the rest of the year, you are a resident of that state and are not eligible to Texas residency for tuition purposes. Individuals or parent/court-appointed legal guardians attempting to establish their residency in Texas must physically reside in the state and establish domicile in Texas, by one of the four factors listed below, at least 12 months prior to the semester requested. It is the student's responsibility to provide documentation in support of their claim of domicile. Criteria for Establishing Domicile The following factors occurring throughout at least 12 consecutive months immediately preceding your term of enrollment may lend support to your claim of establishing and maintaining a domicile: Sole or joint marital ownership of residential real property in Texas; having established and maintained principle, permanent residence at that address Ownership and customary management of a business while residing in Texas which is regularly operated without the intent of liquidation in the foreseeable future Gainful employment that provides for at least one-half of the individual's expenses or employment of at least twenty hours per week. Employment conditioned upon your status as a student such as work study, student assistant employment, receipt of stipends, financial aid refunds, fellowships, teaching assistantships, etc. does not qualify as gainful employment. Marriage to a person who has established and maintained a domicile by one of the above three methods. The marriage must have taken place at least 12 months prior to the term of enrollment. The cost of attendance benchmark for gainful employment is based on the Financial Aid Cost to Attend. We take the total undergraduate Texas Resident tuition and divide in half. Refer to the Rules and Regulations on the College for All Texans website for additional information.
