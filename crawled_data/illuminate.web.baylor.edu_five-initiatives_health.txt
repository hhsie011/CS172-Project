Explore Health Environmental Determinants The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that 23% of global deaths and 26% of deaths in children under five years of age are due to modifiable environmental factors. Developing innovative tools, products, and systems to prevent, diagnose, and manage diseases at the interface of environment and health is critically necessary. Baylor is poised to become an international leader in these areas by investing additional resources in academic programs that already house prominent and distinguished researchers. Family and Community Determinants Baylor’s transdisciplinary, integrated approach to health is unique in addressing a wide range of health issues relevant to families and communities and, alongside a distinctive focus on spiritual well-being, will position the University as a leading force in this arena nationally. Baylor is uniquely equipped to address the impact of health-related matters on our families and communities by building on existing strengths across campus, offering meaningful expressions of health-related services, and responding to the immense needs facing families and communities. Biomedical Research Biomedical research encompasses a wide array of activities that span fundamental "bench science" in STEM disciplines to clinical research on human subjects. Investments in this area will establish Baylor as a leader in understanding, preventing, diagnosing, and furthering new treatments of human disease, as well as position the University to form strategic research partnerships with medical institutions. Health Policy, Law, Leadership and Ethics The healthcare industry, as we know and understand it today, is expected to change across numerous dimensions in the near and long term. Even the very definition of what is included in the "industry" is open to debate, as companies not traditionally in the healthcare arena see opportunities to enter into and disrupt the space. Baylor is uniquely positioned to inform state-of-the-art thinking on leadership issues and to equip our students for future challenges. Undergraduate Health and Medical Education Health and medical education is undergoing significant shifts. Driving these shifts are changes in education and research, such as digital-based and team-based learning approaches, and a greater sensitivity to local and regional contexts. There is a significant need and opportunity for new experiments to address a broader understanding of health and its improved practice so that we may better prepare students for emerging trends in professional medicine. Baylor’s unique opportunity is the preparation of the next generation of Christian physicians and physician leaders at a time when a Christian voice can provide profound guidance.
