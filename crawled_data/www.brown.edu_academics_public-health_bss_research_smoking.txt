BSS faculty conduct laboratory-based studies to investigate the reinforcing properties of nicotine, the effects of smoking abstinence, and the effects of pharmacotherapies on smoking, mood, and behavior. They also conduct randomized controlled trials to test novel behavioral and pharmacological methods of helping smokers quit, including studies using motivational interviewing, positive psychology, physical activity promotion, and contingency management to improve smoking outcomes. Smoking cessation interventions employ in-person counseling, text messaging, video, and web-based programs. A particular focus of tobacco research in BSS is on smoking cessation and the impact of tobacco regulatory policies in underserved and high-risk groups including: smokers with substance use disorders; smokers who drink alcohol heavily; pregnant women; people living with HIV; sedentary smokers; racial, ethnic, and sexual minorities; and people living with mental illness.
