Non-degree students receive a transcript and many of the benefits of being a Yale student, but do not earn a degree upon completion of their enrollment. We offer three types of non-degree programs: Exchange Scholars - to be eligible, you must be enrolled at an institution that has a formal exchange program with Yale. Exchange Scholars may enroll in courses or participate in research at Yale. Visiting Assistants in Research (VAR) - if you are an advanced graduate student currently enrolled at another institution and wish to pursue full-time dissertation research at Yale, you may qualify for the VAR program. VARs are not eligible to enroll in courses. Visiting Students - if you have a bachelor's degree, you may apply to take courses at Yale, with the permission of the program. Questions?
