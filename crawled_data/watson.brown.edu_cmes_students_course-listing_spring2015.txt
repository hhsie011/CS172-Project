This course moves beyond simplistic concerns of compatibility or conflict, and delves into the diverse ways by which Muslims from around the globe have devised a range of social, cultural, religious, legal and fiscal strategies that enable them to both remain true to their faith and live in today’s swiftly-evolving economic context. MES 1995 Critics of Zionism: Political, Philosophical, and Theological Perspectives Adi Ophir M 3:00 – 5:30 p.m. “Zionism is an idea, an ideology, a national movement that sought to solve “”the Jewish question”” in Europe, a political project that morphed into a political regime, a mighty colonial force, a form of Jewish secularization and an engine for religious revival. As such Zionism has always been accompanied with criticism. The seminar studies four critics, three Jews and one Palestinian, who questioned Zionism as a practice, not only an ideology. It examines the theoretical arguments and presuppositions of Marin Buber, Hannah Arendt, Edward Said, and Judith Butler, with special attention to the philosophical and theological framing of their critique.” MES 1997C Ethnographic Perspectives of Islam: Tradition, Religiosity and Modernity Amal Sachedina T R 9:00 – 10:20 a.m. Media coverage presents two ways of thinking and approaching modern Islam. One assumes Islam to be an entire way of life and single set of religious beliefs with compulsive adherence to the Quran and the Prophetic Sunna. The other reduces Islam to a set of essentialist principles, rules and spiritual values that even many Muslims have trouble grasping. Recent anthropological scholarship makes every-day practical interpretations, practices and living social relationships central towards understanding Islam. This class will explore socio-historical and cultural specificities by which Muslims grapple with their faith, and how they shape these resources into every-day beliefs and practices. MES 1997D The Politics of Heritage, Tradition and Culture in the Middle East Amal Sachedina T R 1:00 – 2:20 p.m. Western media has pervasively portrayed the Middle East as “a-historical”, “timeless”, an “Other” that is beyond the logic of modern time. Simultaneously, it is also considered the cradle of “Western Civilization” where vital elements of “world” patrimony may be traced. But how do those who inhabit the region relate to their past and what are the various ways by which its discourses are drawn upon to embody different socio-political and ethical life-worlds? This course explores recent texts on heritage and memory while offering insights of ways in which modalities of history and memory have shaped the postcolonial dynamics of this region. MES 1999D Anthropology/Sociology of Development in the Arab World Mayssun Succarie T 4:00 – 6:30 p.m. After the Second World War, questions of economic growth, poverty, and inequality were internationalized, leading to the rise of national and international agencies which aimed to promote development in the “Third World.” This course examines the anthropological study of development. Touching on development theory (and the political context of each model), we examine connections to anthropological models of socio-cultural change, and consider the relationship between anthropology and the development industry. How can cultural relativist and applied anthropology approaches be reconciled? Can anthropologists and anthropological knowledge contribute to improving development interventions and outcomes, or are they merely critical of such interventions?
