Find out how the reciprocal internships that AUK and Dartmouth alumni experienced as undergraduates influenced what they are doing now. Dartmouth and the American University of Kuwait (AUK) have worked together since 2003, one year before AUK welcomed its first class of students. Since then, the collaboration has continued to deepen and expand, enhancing the liberal arts learning experience on both campuses. Faculty and staff from the two schools collaborate on academic and administrative advisory projects. Individuals and teams work together on site as well as via web-based videoconferencing, sharing expertise in communications, governance, library sciences, information technology, engineering, and a variety of other areas. One component of the project is a summer term-long fellowship that brings a promising AUK faculty member to Dartmouth each year to engage in research and establish connections with other scholars. Additionally, students from both schools have the opportunity to participate in a cross-cultural internship program. As of Fall 2017, 34 Dartmouth students have interned at AUK and 39 AUK students have interned at Dartmouth.
