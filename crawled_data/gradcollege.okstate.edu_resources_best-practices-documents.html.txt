Best Practices for Enhancing Academic Integrity in Written Works As stated in Oklahoma State University (OSU) Policy and Procedure 2-20822 Academic Integrity, “an institution’s reputation and intellectual freedom depend on its uncompromising commitment to the ideal of academic integrity.” As the body of disciplinary and interdisciplinary literature grows at record pace and the time demands on faculty and students increases, it is imperative to continue to ensure proper attribution of the work of others through attention to detail as sources are developed. Irrespective of intentionality, plagiarism, the taking of work or ideas of another and representing it as one’s own, is a concern of everyone in the higher education community.
