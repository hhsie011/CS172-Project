As admissions committees review applications in future admissions cycles, we will respect decisions made by individual students and/or by their academic institutions with regard to the enrollment in or adoption of Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory, Pass/No Record, Credit/No Credit, Pass/Fail and similar grading options during the COVID-19 disruptions. Applicants are invited to describe their individual experiences during the pandemic to provide context that informs the application review process. We strive to create future graduate student cohorts composed of intellectually strong, diverse, and resilient individuals who will make the most of their graduate education opportunities at Brown University.
