Together with academic deans and peer advisors, faculty advisors help students to see their time at Brown as an intellectual exploration in and out of the classroom. Opportunities for advising occur almost any time faculty and students come together—in class, in the lab, during office hours, at departmental events or other extracurricular activities. Brown’s formal advising program provides the most structured forms of support for our students. Faculty serving as first-year, sophomore, and concentration advisors may find useful resources on this webpage and also on our advising tools ASK and Focal Point. If you are interested in serving as a first-year or second-year advisor, please contact Yolanda Rome, the Dean for Class Year Advising. For information about concentration advising, please click here or contact Besenia Rodriguez, the Deputy Dean of the College for Curriculum and Co-Curriculum.
