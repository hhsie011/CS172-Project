Learn more about the HSCS Fellowship Program The David and Mimi Aloian Memorial Scholarship The David and Mimi Aloian Memorial Scholarship is an award given to current juniors, with scholarships to be used during senior year, who have made significant contributions that have positively changed the quality of life for House members. The criteria for the awards reflect the traits valued and embodied by the late David and Mimi Aloian: thoughtful leadership that makes the College an exciting place in which to live and study, with special contributions to the quality of life in the Houses. David Aloian, Class of 1949, worked tirelessly for Harvard and the Alumni Association. As executive director of the HAA from 1978 until his death in 1986, he made the HAA more open and inclusive. In addition, David and his wife, Mary "Mimi" Aloian, guided Quincy House with grace and inspiration as deans from 1981 to 1986. While a student at Harvard, David experienced firsthand what the Houses could do to expand the horizons of College students. Later, as faculty dean, he dedicated himself to the ideal that the Houses should not only be homes but communities for intellectual and social growth. To honor David and Mimi Aloian's achievements and memory and to recognize the importance of House life at Harvard College, the HAA established the Aloian Memorial Scholarships in 1987. Each year, the HAA selects two current juniors to receive an Aloian Memorial Scholarship for use in their senior year. Learn about the 2022 nomination and selection process View past scholarship recipients The Richard Glover Ames and Henry Russell Ames Award The Ames Award is given to seniors who have shown heroic character and energy with helping others and whose substantial contributions may not have been acknowledged. This prestigious honor is granted to two members of the senior class during the Class Day Exercises on the day before Commencement. The goal of this award is to honor two unsung heroes of the class. On June 19, 1935, Richard Glover Ames and Henry Russell Ames, brothers and Harvard students, gave their lives to save their father, who was washed overboard during a storm off the coast of Newfoundland. Every year since, the Ames Award has been given in their memory to recognize two seniors who have shown energy in helping others and who exhibit the same heroic character and inspiring leadership of the Ames brothers.
