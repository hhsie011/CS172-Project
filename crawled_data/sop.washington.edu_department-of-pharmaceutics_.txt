This goal is achieved by understanding the processes, including drug delivery, that determine the exposure and pharmacological response to drugs. Our areas of focus include genetic, environmental, physiological and disease processes that can alter metabolism, transport, distribution and absorption of drugs. The highly collegial Department faculty, students, post-doctoral fellows and staff pursue these multidisciplinary and translational goals through collaboration within the school, University of Washington campus and national and international institutions. Our research and training programs involve biochemical and pharmacological laboratory techniques that span from molecular, cell- and organ-based studies to studies in humans and animals. Then, mathematical modeling and simulation techniques are applied to the data to individualize the right dose and drug delivery system for the patient.
