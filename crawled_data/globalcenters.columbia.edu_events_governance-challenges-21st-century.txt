The 21st century has brought new governance challenges that are often summarized by reference to the term 'globalization'. Closer inspection suggests that globalization entails multiple trajectories of change within states, among actors inside and outside nation states, as well as new forms of resource mobilization and risk allocation. Within states depoliticization can be observed in the form of delegating decisions to independent regulators and experts, central banks, or judiciaries. A second trajectory is the rescaling of economic and social relations well beyond the territorial boundaries of nation states, facilitated by transnational legal arrangements that have their roots in national law. Law is also a critical ingredient for transforming real assets into commodities and ultimately financial assets, that is, the capitalization of assets. These trajectories have differential effects on different constituencies within and across domestic polities: some benefit from direct participation or inclusion in these processes, while others face exclusion. Recognizing these trajectories and their potentially destabilizing effects for polities is of critical importance for effective governance. Katharina Pistor is the Michael I. Sovern Professor of Law at Columbia Law School and the Director of the School’s Center on Global Legal Transformation, and has served as a member of Columbia University’s Committee on Global Thought since its inception. She previously taught at the Kennedy School of Government, and worked at the Max Planck Institute for Foreign and International Private Law in Hamburg, Germany and the Harvard Institute for International Development. In the 1990s she worked predominantly on transition economies in Central and Eastern Europe and Russia, where she conducted extensive field research. Since then, her research has expanded to other emerging markets (in East Asia) and the impact of globalization on the transformation of law and legal institutions in the areas of finance, property rights and transnational regulation. She is Principal Investigator of the “Global Finance and Law Initiative,” a collaborative research project aimed at re-conceptualizing the relation between finance and law, funded by INET. She is a member of the Board of Directors of the European Corporate Governance Institute, a Research Associate of the Center for Economic Policy Research and an Editor of “Economics of Transition." In 2012 she received the Max Planck Research Award for her contributions to international financial regulation. Fikret Adaman is currently professor of economics at Boğaziçi University. His articles appeared in, among others, Antipode, Cambridge Journal of Economics, Development and Change, Ecological Economics, Energy Policy, Environment and Behavior, Environment and Planning C, Environmental Politics, European Journal of History of Economic Thought, Journal of Economic Issues, Journal of European Social Policy, New Left Review. He is currently acting (with Burcay Erus) as an expert on social inclusion to the European Commission. He co-edited Rethinking Structural Reform in Turkish Agriculture (Nova, 2010, with B. Karapınar and G. Özertan), Environmentalism in Turkey (Ashgate, 2005, with M. Arsel), and Integrating and Articulating Environments (Swets & Zeitlinger, 2003, with O. Seippel, F. Göksen, M. O'Brien, Ü. Zenginobuz and J. Grolin). He focuses on the political economy of the environment. He received his BA and MA in Economics at Bogazici University; Ph.D. in Economics at Manchester University.
