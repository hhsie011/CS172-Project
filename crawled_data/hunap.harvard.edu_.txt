Although painful to read, the report recounts how Harvard University—including its leaders, faculty, staff, and students—benefited from the enslavement of people of African and Indigenous descent, as well as from promotion of racist ideologies, projects, and practices that endured long after the abolishment of slavery. Not only did unfree individuals toil on Harvard’s grounds, but fortunes made from the traffic and trade in enslaved persons (and the fruits of their labor) enabled Harvard to become a world-class university. Inasmuch as the first enslaved people in New England were Indigenous individuals, the recommendations for remedy and repair with respect to this legacy include a fresh recommitment to Indigenous partnership and inclusion by Harvard on campus and beyond. We at HUNAP look forward to future consultation and engagement concerning the development of tangible expressions of this long-awaited institutional reckoning.
