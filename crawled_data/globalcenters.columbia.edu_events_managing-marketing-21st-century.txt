Marketing provides the focus for interacting with customers, but also the source of insight about the market, customers, competitors, partners and the business environment in general. Managing Marketing in the 21st Century is a lecture by Noel Capon about understanding how to develop a market strategy and manage the marketing process focused on the manager, not just the marketer.* The event will be chaired by Enrique Manzur, associate professor at the Management Departmen of Universidad de Chile's School of Economics and Business (FEN). His areas of expertise are: Market Research, Marketing Competitiveness, Survey and Styles of Opinion, Consumer Behavior, Advertising and Regulation. Professor Capon teaches on Columbia’s Full-time MBA and Executive MBA (EMBA) programs, and partner programs with London Business School and Hong Kong University. More recent publications include the textbooks -- Managing Marketing in the 21st Century, 4th ed. (Wessex 2017); Capon’s Marketing Framework, 4th ed. (Wessex 2017); Capon’s Marketing Essentials, 1st ed. (Wessex 2017); The Virgin Marketer, 4th ed. (marketing planning workbook) (Wessex 2017), plus several student study guides.
