We explored having the impulse to avoid these conversations and what it might look like if we chose to engage in them, instead. We practiced ways of listening deeply, without implying agreement. We explored avenues for sharing our own beliefs, based on core values and possible common ground, rather than on attacking the other’s position. And we looked at the “mindful inner world” that is necessary to ground this practice and find our balance when we hear painful, triggering statements. This series incorporates feedback received in the first series about considerations of power dynamics and the variety of challenging situations participants encounter. The class will be based on situations and scenarios brought by participants and will center on role plays and active practice. Kathy and Itzel will guide participants in finding satisfying and effective ways to bring up or to respond to topics around race. Meeting details: May 4, 11, 18, and 25 from 12pm-1:30pm via zoom Contact us for registration or questions! Past Events Lessons Learned: A Before and After Look at the Disillusion of a Pride Center This workshop will share the findings of an action-research project. We explored the scope of mental health, significant risks, and protective factors among a specified group within the gender sexual minority (GSM) community identified as Caucasian gay males, between the ages of 18-69. These men were residents of a local community who were directly impacted by the dissolution of their community Pride Center. Presented by: Dr. Rachael D. Nolan (she/her), a highly trained mixed-methodologist, population science researcher, and acclaimed public health professional. She has served as an advocate for the needs of persons affected by chronic and/or terminal illness and their families. Dr. Nolan’s research specializes in understanding the unique social determinants of well-being experienced by underserved and medically disadvantaged communities, older adults, LGBTQ* folk, and the differently-abled. Meeting Details: March 31st, 2022 at 12pm-1pm via zoom Teaching for Equity: Enacting Agency through Collaborative Faculty Leadership Presented by: Annie Bauer, Connie Kendall Theado, Stephen Kroeger, Miriam Raider-Roth, Mark Sulzer, and Susan Watts-Taffe Six UC School of Education faculty will share our Critical Friends process for examining our teaching through a culturally relevant pedagogy (CRP) lens.
