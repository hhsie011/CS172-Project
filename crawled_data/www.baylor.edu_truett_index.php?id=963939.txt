Name: Email Address: Submit Advisory Team Spotlights Meet Our Team Tracy Hanson Retired LPGA Professional "I have joined the Faith & Sports Institute Team of Advocates because they are intentionally working to integrate faith and sport at a holistic level for athletes and sports leaders. FSI is on the cutting edge of creating space and resources that will change the landscape in providing spiritual training, along with emotional and mental care in the sports world where athletes and leaders are anemic and in crisis." Rev. John H. Vaugn Executive Pastor, Ebenezer Baptist Church "[Through the FSI] I was excited to find others who are on a similar journey of exploration, learning, and teaching. For those who have been and/or are engaged as a player, administrator, or fan, we understand the ways that our connection to sports touches and moves us at some deep levels. There is a spiritual dimension to sports, and I am eager to join FSI on the journey to uncover the transformational possibilities it provides us." Lisa Fenn Author, Speaker, and Former ESPN Producer "Sports ministers deeply and lovingly invested in my spiritual growth and their discipleship thereby enabled me to live and work in sports in a manner worthy of the gospel. Working with FSI is an exciting opportunity to pay that gift forward and equip more individuals for this vital work." Continuing Education. Cultural Literacy. Leadership Development. The FSI Online Certificate Program is a non-credit professional development and continuing education program designed to help you process and explore critical issues from an informed Christian perspective. Learn More What Our Sports Ministry Graduates Say "The sports ministry program gave me a lens through which I could see sports, zoomed out with a clearer perspective, filtered through scripture and theology. It has impacted the way I build relationships in sports, view competitors/competition, and value the responsibility of coaching. Every day, through word and action, I notice that I have the chance to empower image bearers of God to authentically grow into who they were created to be." - Dani Price, MDiv '17, Assistant Softball Coach for Georgia Southern Learn More Greatness Redefined The world puts so much pressure on youth to become great.
