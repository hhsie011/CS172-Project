For detailed information about the terms and times that courses will be offered, the most reliable source is the Timetables page on the Registrar's site. The Physics Major Tentative Courses document is a concise listing. Term Summer 2021 Fall 2021 Winter 2022 Spring 2022 Multiyear Planning Chart 2021-22 Teaching Schedule 2022-23 Teaching Schedule Class Time Grid Summer 2021 Summer 2021 Astro 1 (Chaboyer) Time Block: None for lectures; 'OT' for tutorials Delivery Method Choice: Choice 2 for lectures, 1 for tutorials Tentative Plan: Remote with asynchronous lectures and synchronous recitation sections conducted virtually. Recitation sections will be offered multiple times per week. Students must register for the course, and for a single tutorial section. Labs will be asynchronous and remote. Text book: Astronomy by Fraknoi, Morrison and Wolff, published by OpenStax and available for free: https://openstax.org/details/books/astronomy Final Exam: NO Xhour use: NO Students MUST sign up for Section 1, and then they sign up for ONE of the tutorial sections 2,3, 4, or 5. ASTR 1, Section 1: Solar System and Exoplanets (remote, entirely asynchronous) Period code: AS Period: Asynchronous ASTR 1, Section 2: Solar System and Exoplanets Tutorial (remote, with synchronous) Period code: OT Period: Wednesday 4-5pm. ASTR 1, Section 3: Solar System and Exoplanets Tutorial (remote, with synchronous) Period code: OT Period: Thursday 12:30-1:30pm ASTR 1, Section 4: Solar System and Exoplanets Tutorial (remote, with synchronous) Period code: OT Period: Thursday 3-4pm ASTR 1, Section 5: Solar System and Exoplanets Tutorial (remote, with synchronous) Period code: OT Period: Thursday 7-8pm Astro 2 (Hickox) Time Block: 10 maps to C Delivery Method Choice: Section 1- 1 (Remote with Synchronous Components); Section 2- 4 (On-Campus) Tentative Plan: My preference is to do one section with on-campus classes. I would like to explore doing the course outside in large areas with a big screen. If on-campus classes are not viable, I would run it as a synchronous remote course. In either case, if some students are not able to be on campus, lectures and activities will be recorded and made available for asynchronous learning, as I've done for A2 last summer and P13 this winter. Final Exam (Yes or No): No X hour Use: Yes Multiple Sections: Yes, both block C Textbook: Astronomy by Andrew Fraknoi, David Morrison and Sidney Wolff. OpenStax Phys 3 (Dotter) Time Block: 12 maps to E Delivery Method Choice: 1 Tentative Plan: Remote, synchronous. Remote labs. Lectures will be prerecorded, while there will be twice-weekly scheduled class office hours (one given by lecturer, other by learning fellow) for discussing homework problems, class material etc. Final Exam (Yes or No): Yes. Given as a "take-home" with original problems that integrate the material presented throughout the course. X hour Use: Some. Used for one of the two weekly class office hours (see above); other office hour held during one of the course scheduled hours. Multiple Sections: No Textbook: Vol.1 Physics for Scientists and Engineers with Modern Physics, 4th Edition, by Giancoli. An electronic version will be provided via the Canvas site, in case students are unable to purchase their own copy. Phys 44 (Millan) Time Block: 11 (maps to D) Delivery Method Choice: Section 1- 1 (Remote with Synchronous Components); Section 2- 3 (Remote with On-Campus Components) Tentative Plan: Remote synchronous class discussion/group work and asynchronous pre-lecture content. Resident students will have on-campus classroom options with section 2.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Physics and Astronomy Undergraduate Overview Information for New Students Physics Major Astronomy Major Engineering Physics Major Undergraduate Awards Honors Recent Senior Theses Undergraduate Requirements Physics and Astronomy Course Offerings Physics Society Student Research Opportunities Careers in Physics and Astronomy Astronomy and Your Career Undergraduate Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Graduate Overview Graduate Awards Apply Financial Aid Degree Requirements Courses Recent PhD Graduates Graduate Alumni Stories Tell Us Your Story Foreign Study Overview Astronomy FSP in South Africa Research Overview All Projects Astrophysics Current Projects Particles, Fields, Gravitation, and Cosmology Current Projects Gravitational Quantum Physics Quantum and Condensed Matter Current Projects Plasma and Space Physics Current Projects Resources Overview Weather Archive News & Events News & Events Colloquia Physics and Astronomy Colloquia Colloquium Archives (before 2017) Symposiums Symposium on Charles Young's 1869 Discovery of Coronium Jay Lawrence Symposium Archive Pressure of Light Symposium Public Lecture Archives Public Observing People Faculty & Staff Students Alumni Advisory Board Membership Directory Committee Assignments Department Chair Diversity Statement Graduate Advisor Undergraduate Advisor My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
