Students explore the expressive potential and social meaning of fiber materials as they learn technical skills that prepare them for focused, graduate-level study and a variety of careers. Tyler Fibers & Material Studies majors join a close-knit, inclusive community led by a strong, diverse faculty that pushes students to experiment and collaborate. Students learn traditional skills and activate them in a contemporary context, contributing to vital discussions on history, identity, current social issues and more. Through dynamic events and projects such as the annual Wearable Art Show and the Natural Dye Garden, Fibers & Material Studies majors create exciting conversations with artists and students throughout Tyler. Students take full advantage of Philadelphia's vibrant fibers community and DIY scene and opportunities to engage global social challenges, working closely with professors to engage in community-based projects that challenge them as critical, reflective participants in a broader creative culture. These experiences prepare Fibers & Material Studies majors to flourish in top graduate programs and production design careers. Designed to complement the studio experience with tools to support a studio practice or pursue graduate studies, the Entrepreneurship coursework enhances students' career options. Graduates of this degree program will possess requisite business skills to support themselves as visual artists or entrepreneurs in art and related fields. Degree Requirements The Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Fibers & Material Studies with Entrepreneurial Studies may be conferred upon a student by recommendation of the faculty and upon the satisfactory completion of a minimum of 126 semester hours of credit with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.00.

Please Note: An approved study abroad program waives the GenEd Global/World Society (GG) requirement; however, these credits must be made up with academic coursework taken outside of Tyler departments to be in compliance with BFA accreditation. BFA majors interested in studying abroad should consult with an academic advisor to determine if a semester (generally spring semester of second year) or a summer program would be the best option to remain on track for graduation.
