Internships provide a great opportunity for students to gain work experience and make connections with professionals in their field prior to graduating. Employers are discovering that bringing an intern into your organization can be a very rewarding experience and many companies are beginning to recognize the value of adding an intern program to their human resources pool. The The Career Center aims to facilitate internships for students with industry professionals to provide real-world experience and on-the-job training. We look forward to working with both the employer and the student to develop a meaningful and mutually beneficial internship opportunity.
