At Georgia Tech, our group spans several schools on campus to reflect this crucial diversity of expertise. You’ll find planetary scientists housed in Earth & Atmospheric Sciences, in Chemistry, in Physics, and in Electrical Engineering, with research that truly spans from planetary interiors all the way out to the ‘edge’ of a planet’s near space environment. In addition to the range of planetary topics studied at GT (interiors, surfaces, magnetospheres, etc.), we also use an impressive range of methods, from modeling to spacecraft data analysis to laboratory and field work. See below for faculty in EAS, and see here for further information.
