The process puts a particular focus on a forward-looking vision for excellence in graduate education, faculty support and development, and the organization of academic communities. The FAS strategic planning process benefits from insights achieved through a number of distinct review and planning efforts across the Academic Divisions. It draws particular inspiration from the FAS Study Group, a faculty group convened in November 2020 by Edgerley Family Dean Claudine Gay, to define a vision for how to position the FAS for broad-based academic excellence, innovation and sustainability. From November 2021 through February 2022, the FAS convened nearly 200 faculty members for small group conversations to create a shared vision for the future of the FAS. The resulting vision statement for the FAS Strategic Planning Process is as follows: Vision Statement A strong, intellectually vibrant, creative FAS ready to steward the future of the liberal arts and sciences through cutting edge research and teaching. An FAS that can: Attract and retain the world's most original and compelling scholars Support faculty to achieve excellence in their teaching and research and to contribute at a high level to the University through their citizenship Attract and prepare the next generation of leaders and support them in a transformative educational experience Foster an environment of ambition, curiosity, and shared commitment to our academic mission that elicits excellence from all members of our community Simultaneously cultivate deep disciplinary expertise while promoting meaningful and novel collaboration across disciplines, departments and Schools Act quickly and efficiently to advance emerging academic directions and opportunities Ensure that individual faculty and academic units have the information they need to make well-considered choices about how to advance our academic mission Intentionally structure graduate programs around a shared understanding of student success Academic Communities Division of Arts & Humanities Steering Committee & Charge The Division of Arts & Humanities is assessing the structure of the division to ensure that the departmental organization is best equipped to support the intellectual interests and administrative needs of the community.

Division of Science Charge The Division of Science is charged with determining how to identify, promote and nurture scholarship, teaching and hiring in areas that cut across the existing departmental structure, beyond current centers and initiatives. Considerations include evaluation and selection, allocation of space and resources, and administrative support. These conversations are happening within existing faculty structures including meetings of department chairs and divisional committees. For more information please reach out to Sarah Elwell, Senior Director of Administration and Operations for Science, at sarah_elwell@harvard.edu. Faculty Support and Development Steering Committee & Charge The Faculty Workload Committee is evaluating workload expectations and distribution within and across FAS departments/areas and making recommendations to ensure greater transparency, equity, and recognition for exceptional contributions. Other areas of focus that will be part of the strategic planning process in faculty support and development include supporting faculty with families and increasing the diversity of the faculty. The Office of Faculty Affairs will support further study on those topics in the form of surveys and focus groups, as well as working directly with departments and faculty, to make recommendations.

Alongside the above academic strategic planning efforts, there are a number of allied administrative efforts under way to ensure that our operations are effectively supporting the core teaching and research mission of the FAS. This includes efforts to reimagine budgeting led by Scott Jordan, FAS Dean for Administration and Finance. That work is structured into five working groups that will tackle (1) workforce planning, (2) space and capital planning, (3) multi-year planning, (4) the annual budget process, and (5) reporting and accountability to make recommendations that will be implemented for the FY24 budget process. For more information on this effort please contact Katherine Gates at kgates@fas.harvard.edu. A comprehensive technology landscape study is being led by Vice President and University Chief Information Officer Klara Jelinkova, who also serves as FAS Chief Information Officer. Overseen by an FAS Steering Committee, the study will produce an in-depth mapping of technology usage and needs across the FAS community, as well as strategic recommendations for a cohesive, future-facing technology ecosystem that enables the FAS's teaching and research mission. The Steering Committee, which reviews study design and data analysis, includes Professor Deidre Lynch, Dr. Chase Harrison, Professor Amanda Pallais, Professor James Waldo, Mike Holmes, Dean Mary Ann Bradley, and Dean Russ Porter.
