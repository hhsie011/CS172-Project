For his dark moody prints, Mapplethorpe photographed erotic images from SCREW magazine transfered to Silly Putty, a moldable silicone-based substance popular among kids. Each of the photogravures was printed on Japanese Gampi chine collé. The warmth and delicacy of the paper subtly references the newsprint from which the original images in the magazine were printed. Born and raised in New York, Edward Mapplethorpe began his solo career under the pseudonym Edward Maxey and was quickly acclaimed for his luminous nudes, portraits, and still lives that were evocative of his older brother, Robert Mapplethorpe (1946 - 1989). However, it was his innovative work beyond the controlled environment of the studio that first distinguished him as a unique talent in bridging the gap between photography and abstract painting.
