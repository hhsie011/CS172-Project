Why did you get involved in your local chapter?: I think there is a deep connection with BC and there was not a chapter here in Buffalo, but over 300 alumni, so I wanted to connect with this community locally - hence why we started the chapter. Fun Fact: I played pick-up basketball with Doug Flutie in the plex :) What are your local favorites?: (Restaurants, running routes, activities, etc. Feel free to get creative.)The food - great restaurants in Buffalo including Hutch's and Tempo.
