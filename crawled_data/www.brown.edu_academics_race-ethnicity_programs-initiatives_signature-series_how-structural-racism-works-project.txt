In fall 2015, the Office of the Provost in collaboration with the Center for the Study of Race and Ethnicity in America (CSREA) launched a series of academic lectures and workshops designed to undertake an extended campus-wide examination of structural racism in the United States — its origins and manifestations. Tricia Rose, professor of Africana studies and director of CSREA, will direct the project titled "How Structural Racism Works," which is built around her new research project of the same name that embraces video material and public engagement as integral parts of the research design.
