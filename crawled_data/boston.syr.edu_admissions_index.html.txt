But if you’re not able to travel to Syracuse, Boston is surrounded by a community that bleeds Orange—and we invite you to attend an admitted student program in your area. It’s your chance to learn all about the Syracuse University family from local alumni, parents, and friends. Admitted student events are hosted by a senior Office of Admissions staff member, offering admitted students and their families an opportunity to learn more about academic and student life at Syracuse University.
