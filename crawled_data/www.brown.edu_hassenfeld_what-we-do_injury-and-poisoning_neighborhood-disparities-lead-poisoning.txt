We undertook a statewide spatial analysis to assess the extent to which neighborhood-level disparities in lead poisoning persist in Rhode Island. Approximately 15% of children had a blood lead level of 5 µg/dL or higher. A significant decline over the study period was observed: in 2006, 20.6% of the children tested had an elevated blood lead level; by 2016, only 6.2% did. While there has been tremendous progress in reducing lead poisoning, substantial neighborhood disparities persist.
