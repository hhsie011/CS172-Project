Many Biology students become clinical workers, dentists, educators, nurses, optometrists, physical therapists, physician assistants, physicians, podiatrists and veterinarians. You can work in the biotechnology, environmental or pharmaceutical fields, or choose to pursue a master’s or doctoral degree in Biology or a related field. Coursework for the Biology BA and BS emphasizes bioinformatics, cell biology, genetics, ecology and neuroscience; critical evaluation of experimental data; expertise in laboratory procedures; and identification of the biochemical and biophysical principles of living organisms. The Biology Department is a hub for leading research centers, institutes and facilities, including the Center for Biodiversity, the Center for Biophysics and Computational Biology, and the Biology Imaging Facility. Department faculty members encourage firsthand experiences with cutting-edge technology in the classroom. You’ll have opportunities to take part in advanced research, scientific breakthroughs and new discoveries that benefit society. Choosing between a BA and a BS The Bachelor of Arts in Biology requires between 60 and 63 credit hours with three electives versus six. You’ll have the flexibility to take courses in the College of Liberal Arts while gaining the necessary background in biology for your chosen career path or graduate degree. The Bachelor of Science in Biology is recommended for those who know they want to pursue a career in science upon completion of the program. It requires between 69 and 75 credit hours, including six advanced electives.
