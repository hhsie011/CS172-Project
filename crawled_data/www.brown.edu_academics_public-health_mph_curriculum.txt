The curriculum is comprised of core, concentration, and elective coursework. Core Courses All MPH students take core courses designed to develop analytical skills and knowledge in key areas of public health. MPH Core Courses *Students must complete one of the following course sequences: Sequence 1: PHP2507, Biostatistics & Applied Data Analysis I (Fall) PHP2508, Biostatistics & Applied Data Analysis II (Spring) Sequence 2: PHP2510, Principles of Biostatistics & Data Analysis (Fall) PHP2511, Applied Regression Analysis (Spring) Students must complete one of the following courses: PHP2120, Introduction to Methods in Epidemiologic Research ( Fall and Spring) PHP2150, Foundations in Epidemiologic Research Methods (Fall) Students must complete both of the following half credit courses: PHP2071, Applied Public Health: Systems and Practice (Spring) PHP2072, Applied Public Health: Policy, Leadership and Communication (Fall) Students must complete one of the following courses: PHP2355, Designing and Evaluating Public Health Interventions (Fall and Spring) PHP2720, Implementing Public Health Programs and Interventions in the Global South (For students in the Global Health Concentration) (Fall) *Students who matriculated prior to Fall 2018 should click here Required Non-Credit Activities The following are prerequisite for entering PHP2071, and must be completed in the summer or first semester of enrollment: PHP1001, Foundations in Public Health CITI Training IRB Basics Semester One Core Advisor Small Group Sessions Concentrations The Brown MPH empowers students to engage in the design and implementation of their educational experience. Students concentrate in one of the public health areas below: Interdisciplinary A great emphasis of the Brown MPH Program is to empower students to engage in the design and implementation of their educational experience. Students in the Interdisciplinary Concentration work with advisors to develop their individual path within public health. Students in the Interdisciplinary Concentration will develop an individualized educational plan to gain the competencies required for their path in public health. This will include identifying the focus of the Interdisciplinary studies for that student, be that a content area (for example Maternal and Children Health, Aging, Mental Health, HIV, etc.) or methodologic focus (advanced methods in public health research/evaluation, etc.). Find out more about the Interdisciplinary Concentration Addictions The Addictions Concentration provides an interdisciplinary foundation to understand substance use, misuse, and addiction and to address the social and health-related costs of addiction. This concentration is designed to prepare MPH students for careers in addiction prevention, program evaluation, and research. Find out more about the Addictions Concentration Epidemiology Epidemiology Concentration Specific Competencies Formulate an epidemiologic research question to help fill the gaps in a given substantive area. Explain the strengths and limitations of the most common epidemiologic study designs. Use causal diagrams to identify threats to study validity and approaches to minimize such threats. Select the appropriate epidemiologic study design that can be used to answer a specific epidemiologic research question. Choose the most appropriate analysis plan to analyze data to answer a specific epidemiologic research question. Evaluate scientific evidence regarding a specific epidemiologic research question. Justify the design and analysis for their own epidemiologic study. Describe the findings from and implications of their own epidemiologic study. Find out more about the Epidemiology Concentration Global Health The mission of the Global Health Concentration is to develop public health professionals who are experts in issues related to global health. Global health research and training focus on health inequalities within communities and populations and across populations throughout the world. Global health thus focuses on domestic and international health inequalities, and is not about crossing borders but bridging health inequalities with scientific evidence of etiology and prevention. Find out more about the Global Health Concentration Health Behavior The Health Behavior Concentration prepares students to understand and apply theories of health behavior and health promotion to improve population health. Students in the Health Behavior Concentration will gain experience in behavioral-social science frameworks and methodologies for designing, implementing, and evaluating interventions, and in disseminating and translating findings for diverse communities. The Health Behavior Concentration also emphasizes the roles of cultural competence, ethical practice, professionalism, and community collaboration as vital to the design and delivery of public health interventions. Find out more about the Health Behavior Concentration Health Services The Health Services Concentration seeks to develop scientists experienced in the use of state of the art experimental and non-experimental research methods for the purpose of advancing fundamental knowledge of issues central to the improvement of population health by focusing on organizational characteristics of health care delivery systems, providers, and economic forces that shape consumer and provider behavior, as well as the policy environment in which these relationships exist. The concentration explicitly seeks to train scientists to optimally contribute as part of multidisciplinary teams in academic posts, government agencies at the state, national and international levels, and in research arms of private sectors of health services delivery organizations. The concentration explicitly seeks to develop scientists skilled in the communication of scientific knowledge, equipped with leadership skills for the purpose of improving services and influencing health policy at the organizational, state, national, and international levels such that those policies lead to more equitable use of resources thus improving health outcomes. The competency-based curriculum provides students with a strong analytic foundation and general health services research orientation. Find out more about the Health Services Concentration Maternal and Child Health The Brown University School of Public Health has substantial strengths in Maternal and Child Health (MCH). This includes a vibrant core of interdisciplinary faculty focused on MCH issues from the prenatal period through adolescents. The Hassenfeld Child Health Innovation Institute was launched in 2016, presenting new opportunities for expanding MCH research and education programs at Brown. This is in addition to the existing School of Public Health research centers that include a focus on MCH issues. Beyond the strengths within the School of Public Health, active MCH collaborations extend to the Brown University affiliated hospitals, state government, local government, community organizations and industry. Find out more about the Maternal and Child Health Concentration Mindfulness The Brown University School of Public Health has developed substantial strengths in Mindfulness. This includes a vibrant core of interdisciplinary faculty focused on the full spectrum of mindfulness ranging from theory to measurement to treatment delivery to teacher training. The establishment and expansion of a world-leading Mindfulness Center at Brown ([email protected]) under the leadership of Eric Loucks, PhD, presents new opportunities for expanding mindfulness research and education programs at Brown. With the expanded faculty, critically important mindfulness courses have been implemented, and the MPH Concentration in Mindfulness is being launched starting with the class entering Fall 2020. Find out more about the Mindfulness concentration Elective Courses All students are encouraged to explore their diverse academic interests at Brown. In addition to the core and concentration courses, every student will take 2 general elective courses-approved courses are detailed below. Other graduate-level courses at Brown may be taken, as an elective, with approval. If you are interested in taking an elective course that is not currently on the MPH approved elective list, you must complete the MPH Elective Course Approval Request form.
