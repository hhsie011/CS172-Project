About the Program Studio Lab: in a Nutshell Formerly known as PlaySpace, Studio Lab is designed to provide Theater students with a production opportunity for the development of new work, and/or for the exploration of work that is unconventional or experimental in nature. Studio Lab projects focus on the work and the process rather than on production; projects do not need to culminate in a public performance.The Studio Lab program is available to theater majors, minors, and other students with a demonstrated track record of experience within the department. Project parameters are as follows: Studio Lab projects rehearse over 2-3 weeks, totalling a maximum of 30 hours of rehearsal in all Access to the Bentley Theater for one week, for rehearsing and tech in the space Up to 4 hours of technical rehearsal, with a student technician providing limited lighting and sound support Limited use of the scenic and costume stock available for use, as approved by the Technical Director or Costume Shop Manager One performance only, which may be followed by Q&A with the audience, if desired Total available budget of $100.00 to support the work The Studio Lab program is best suited for work that is new, unconventional, or experimental in nature; works that "take a leap" or explore theatrical boundaries. Site-specific work can be proposed as part of a Studio Lab presentation, and experimental design-based work will be considered (with faculty approval) on a case-by-case basis. Proposals are reviewed carefully by the Department of Theater faculty, who will make the final project selection. Proposals are accepted at the start of each term; A Studio Lab production slot is typically available every term except summer. The Production Manager will be available to each Studio Lab project, to act as liaison between the individual/group and the Theater Department, answer questions, and facilitate logistics. For more information, please contact Production Manager Brianna Parry. Students may also access the Department of Theater's Student Production Manual for details and information.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Theater Undergraduate Overview Equity and Inclusivity Peer Advisors and Student Representatives The Major Major Requirements Honors Thesis The Modified Major Modified Major Requirements Modifying another Major with Theater The Minor Minor Requirements Courses: offerings by term Course Descriptions Instructor Permission Courses Independent Study Off-Campus Exchange National Theater Institute For Prospective Students Onstage Overview Get Involved Performing and Auditions Directing and Designing Playwriting Stage Managing The Scene Shop The Costume Shop Now Onstage: Upcoming Productions Season Archives: Past Productions Production Photos About Student Productions Workshops and Full Productions Studio Lab: Exploring Theatrical Boundaries YourSpace: Performance Spaces for Creative Minds Student Work in the time of COVID About MainStage Productions Opportunities Overview Summer Theater Lab: Cultivating New Work VoxLab Frost and Dodd Play Festival New York Theatre Workshop Residency The VOICES Program Experiential Learning with Northern Stage Testimonials Student Funding Opportunities Kingsdale Fund Need-Based Funding Goldner Mini-Fellowship Other funding opportunities Funding for Graduate Studies Internships, Fellowships, and Graduate Programs The Neukom Institute Literary Arts Award in Playwriting Foreign Study News & Events All News and Events MainStage Production News Student Production News Honors Thesis Productions Summer Theater Lab News Faculty News Student News Visiting Artist News Alumni News People Faculty and Staff Visiting Artists Alumni Tell Us Your Story Theater and Performance Studies My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
