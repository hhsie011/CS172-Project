These Protected Characteristics are interpreted consistently with relevant and applicable law. Baylor University admits students of any Protected Characteristic to all the rights, privileges, programs, and activities generally accorded or made available to students at the school. It does not unlawfully discriminate on the basis of any Protected Characteristic in employment or in the administration of its educational policies, admissions policies, scholarship and loan programs, and athletic and other school-administered programs. The University is controlled by a predominantly Baptist Board of Regents and is operated within the Christian-oriented aims and ideals of Baptists. Baylor is also affiliated with the Baptist General Convention of Texas, a cooperative association of autonomous Texas Baptist churches. Baylor’s commitment to equal opportunity and respect of others does not undermine the validity and effect of the constitutional and statutory protections for its religious liberty, including, without limitation, the religious organization exemption under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the religious exemption to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, and the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, among others. As a religiously controlled institution of higher education, the University prescribes standards of personal conduct. While the University does not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, per se, it does regulate conduct that is inconsistent with the religious values and beliefs that are integral to its Christian faith mission. See the Baylor Statement on Human Sexuality at https://www.baylor.edu/risk/doc.php/343044.pdf. This policy statement is neither intended to discourage, nor is it in fact applicable to, any analytical discussion of law and policy issues involved, or to discussions of any recommendations for changes in existing law. Discussions of these matters are both practiced and are welcomed within our curriculum. For additional information, visit the Baylor University Notice of Non-Discrimination webpage.
