Both Programs are approved by the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP), and the doctoral program is accredited by the American Psychological Association (APA). Graduate Programs The Specialist-level (EdS) Program includes 2 years of full-time study followed by a 10-month full-time, supervised internship in a school setting. Students complete a master’s degree in the course of this 3-year Program. The Doctoral-level (PhD) Program is based on a comprehensive 5-year program of study, including 3 full years of coursework and integrative field experiences, a 10 month full-time internship consistent with APA doctoral internship requirements, and research and dissertation requirements.

School Psychology Program Diversity Statement Consistent with the School of Human Services, the College of Education, Criminal Justice, and Human Services, and the University of Cincinnati, the School Psychology Program strives to provide a positive, safe, supportive, affirming, and welcoming program climate for all students, where everyone’s identities are seen, valued, and respected. We recognize that students with various minoritized and marginalized identities have been excluded from graduate programs and the field of school psychology. As such, we actively recruit and retain students from racially/ethnically minoritized backgrounds and with other minoritized identities. We assert that social justice advocacy is a requirement of all school psychologists, so we prepare our graduate students to demonstrate cultural humility, intentional advocacy around dismantling systems of oppression and marginalization, and critical reflection on their own identities, values, and biases. We enact our commitment to social justice, diversity, equity, and inclusion in various ways, including but not limited to: Recruitment and retention of racially and ethnically minoritized students to reflect the populations of children and families we serve, resulting in students of color currently representing 33% of our students overall and 45% of students in our doctoral program; Holistic review of admissions materials without requiring the GRE, limiting barriers to applications to our program; Student-centered advising and mentoring; Conducting research in schools to support the outcomes of racially/ethnically minoritized children and children with disabilities; Integration of topics related to social justice, diversity, equity, and inclusion throughout our program curriculum, including an emphasis on promoting systems-level change; Regular curriculum audits to ensure that traditionally underrepresented voices are centered in our course readings, materials, and guest speakers; Providing students field-based opportunities in urban, rural, and suburban settings, and with children and families with a variety of identities; Implementing evidence-based teaching practices that ensure all students’ access to the curriculum; Regular program social events for all students, as well as events specifically for students of color to build community and systems of support; and Seeking regular feedback from students and other stakeholders about ways that we can ensure a positive and affirming climate for all students, and racially/ethnically minoritized students in particular.
