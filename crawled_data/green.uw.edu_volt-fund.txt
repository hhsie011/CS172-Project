Donate VOLT Fund VOLT Fund Close Menu Home Donate Donate to the Husky Green Fund Donate to the VOLT Fund Alumni for Climate Action Thank you for your interest in donating to the Voluntary Offsets/Local Technologies (VOLT) Fund to support UW's Another Solar Array Please (ASAP) Program to expand solar and other renewable energy on our UW Campuses. Current Project: Mercer Court Addition (Array 001) Using the form below, you can: make a general donation to the Fund in amount of your choice, or make a donation to the Fund in an amount that offsets your carbon emissions for a specific activity, commute to/from work, air travel for a year, etc. As an example, offsetting carbon emission for one round-trip US domestic flight is often approximately $5, an international round-trip flight is often approximately $20. If you want to be more precise, many carbon offset calculators can be found online that can help you calculate a donation amount appropriate to your offset goals. You will receive notification of your donation from the UW Foundation immediately after making the donation. The UW Sustainability office will also send a recognition of the donation once we are notified of the transaction. Thank you for supporting solar and other renewable energy on our UW campuses!
