Maintaining a GPA of 2.0 or higher.

UofL and JCTC have awarded over 700 students over 1000 reverse degrees (some students were eligible for multiple degrees) since fall 2013. 85% of student who participate in the reverse degree initiative have been retained and/or persisted to graduation. 62% of participants have graduated with a bachelor's degree There is nothing that you need to do to initiate the process for applying for a Reverse Degree at this time.
