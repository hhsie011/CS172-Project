Don’t click directly on the course title or CRN if you want to access the roster. Click directly on the CRN to access the class section details, including instructional method, meeting days/times and location. Click directly on the course catalog details. Click anywhere else in the row (other than on the course title or CRN) to access the roster. The Class List defaults to the Summary view (see example below). From within the class list, you can: Toggle from the Summary View to the Detail View (and back). View the Wait List. Export the Class list. Note that this version of your roster is not immediately compatible for importing grades in Faculty Grade Entry. If exporting the roster for grade entry purposes, we recommend exporting the roster directly from Faculty Grade Entry. Bring up a printer-friendly view of the roster (may require adjustment to your browser’s pop-up settings). Email all or selected students in the class. For a student in your class, access the Student Profile. Find another class and view its roster. By default, instructors can view rosters for their own classes. Classes will not display in the Class List/Roster until at least one student is enrolled. The ability to view rosters for any class is limited to individuals who have been granted the Department Head Query security group.
