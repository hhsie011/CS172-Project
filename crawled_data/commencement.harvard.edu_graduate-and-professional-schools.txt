Some families and guests may prefer to avoid the large crowds and view the ceremony on television monitors located at most of the undergraduate Houses and Graduate and Professional Schools. During the Morning Exercises, the three Commencement student speakers, representing each of the following categories (Undergraduate English, Undergraduate Latin, and Graduate English) deliver their speeches. The Deans of each school introduce their respective degree candidates for their specific degrees, which the president then confers. Towards the conclusion of the ceremony the graduating Seniors are asked to rise, and their degrees are conferred on them as a group by the president. Honorary Degrees are then conferred. Academic regalia (cap and gown) is required for all graduating degree candidates. Admission to the Morning Exercises is by ticket only. The sale of Commencement tickets is prohibited. Diploma-Awarding Ceremonies at the Graduate and Professional Schools (Noon) At the conclusion of the Morning Exercises, the President’s Division will process from the platform and down the center aisle of Tercentenary Theatre. Degree candidates and their guests return to their respective Schools for luncheons and individual diploma-awarding ceremonies. For additional information please contact the respective Graduate/Professional school.
