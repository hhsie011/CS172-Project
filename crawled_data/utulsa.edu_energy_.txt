This institute is operated from the physics department at TU. The primary mission of the Institute is to design, model, and fabricate new generation of cost-effective solar cells. The secondary mission of the institute is to foster interdisciplinary research between faculty and students in Physics, Chemistry, and Engineering disciplines at TU. In addition, through the institute projects we will share resources between three major Oklahoma research universities on PV research. Solar energy research at TU has attracted funds more than $5 million in the past 5 years. We have three ongoing projects supported by OK-NASA EPSCoR for over $2.25 million Currently, 6 TU faculty (physics, chemistry, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering and electrical engineering), 6 graduate students (3 in physics) and 2 undergraduate (physics) students are engaged in solar energy related research projects. We have two dedicated labs in the physics department with 21 instruments utilized in solar energy projects. PV institute annual symposium in 2018 had 42 participants, 6 students’ talks and 16 poster presentations. The higher operating efficiencies and longer lifetimes make light-emitting diodes (LEDs) highly competitive in the general illumination market. This technology is expected to reduce energy consumption by 40% in 2030, which corresponds to energy saving of 261 TWh and budget saving of $26 billion. Current generation white LEDs are realized by incorporating yellow phosphors into III-nitride based blue LEDs. The challenges of cool color and limited material availability of the rare-earth elements need to be solved to realize the widespread adoption of white LEDs in the general illumination market. Therefore, the utilization of cost-effective approaches to achieve high-efficiency LED with superior color quality is instrumental in the application of this technology in the general illumination market. The key for obtaining photo down conversion materials to acquire high quantum yield materials with emission in the blue, green, and red ranges. We are developing cost-effective approaches to achieve high-quality white LEDs using the earth-abundant elements with goal of widespread adoption of white LED in general illumination market. This will result in a significant reduction in energy consumption. Ferroelectric thin films and heterostructures are unique multifunctional nanomaterials for energy applications that include electromechanical and photovoltaic energy generation, ultrahigh density capacitive energy storage, and energy efficient electronic components such as non-volatile memories and ferroelectric field-effect transistors. Our research aims at the fundamental understanding of electrostatic and electromechanical interactions at ferroelectric interfaces in order to craft recipes for advanced energy materials with new and enhanced functionalities.
