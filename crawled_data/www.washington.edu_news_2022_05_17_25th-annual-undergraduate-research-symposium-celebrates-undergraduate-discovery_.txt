More than 700 undergraduates are expected to present their research during the day, including lightning talks online, in-person oral and poster presentations in Mary Gates Hall and visual arts and design exhibitions in Odegaard Library. More than 1,000 faculty, post-doctorate researchers, research staff and graduate student mentors will be supporting the student researchers. In 2020, in the midst of the COVID pandemic, 8,299 students worked with UW faculty research mentors devoting about 1.5 million hours, more than 6,000 years of research, across the university’s colleges, schools, departments and research centers. The event is scheduled from 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Taylor and UW Provost Mark Richards are scheduled to speak at an in-person welcome at 11:00 a.m. in Mary Gates Hall.
