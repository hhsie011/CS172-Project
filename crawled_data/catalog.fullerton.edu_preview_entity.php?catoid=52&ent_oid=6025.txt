Thus, there is a need for persons trained in the theory and practice of informing, instructing and persuading through communications media. Degree Descriptions The Bachelor of Arts in Communications is designed to provide students with training in the theory and practice of informing, instructing and persuading through communications media. Because effective ethical communications are essential for the well being of a democratic society, the curriculum ensures that: all majors are exposed to a broad liberal education; provides majors with a clear understanding and a global perspective of the role of communications media in society; and prepares majors desiring communications-related careers in the mass media, business, government and education by educating them in depth on one of the specialized concentrations within the department. The Master of Arts in Communications is designed to provide students with advanced study in communications theory and research, and offers an opportunity to integrate all aspects of the profession into a single degree. The program prepares the graduate to apply advanced communication concepts, research development skills and theories relevant to the use of communications media for a wide variety of purposes. Such study may serve those whose careers involve the use of print, electronic and online media to inform, instruct and persuade. Communications skills are highly applicable to a wide range of careers in business, industry, government, education and mass media.
