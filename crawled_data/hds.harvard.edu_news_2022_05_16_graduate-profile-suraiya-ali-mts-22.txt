How I've Changed HDS expanded my ability to contend with the world as a deeply connected, cosmopolitan place. My studies and relationships helped me augment my worldview and my conception of self. Memorable Moment Oftentimes, it was moments spent outside the classroom. Late-night study dates, walks around Cambridge, wine, and tapas after evening classes. All of these colored my graduate school experience and made me feel connected to my community. Favorite Class or Professor Modern Buddhism and Fiction was one of my first courses. It presented me with literary work and concepts that have stuck with me through the entirety of my time at HDS. Future Plans I hope to work for a year before beginning the PhD application process. I hope to spend my gap year diving into my art practice, resting and reflecting on the last two years at Harvard, and traveling with loved ones.
