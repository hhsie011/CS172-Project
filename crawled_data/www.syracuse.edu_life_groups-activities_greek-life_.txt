Joining a fraternity or sorority provides students with the following possible opportunities: develop leadership skills find opportunities for service enjoy the camaraderie of brotherhood, sisterhood, or siblinghood bond with others through shared interests, goals, or identities Our long history of Greek-lettered organizations began in 1871, when Delta Kappa Epsilon became Syracuse University’s first fraternity. Our first sorority, Alpha Phi followed in 1872, and our multicultural chapters are some of the oldest in New York State. Today, over 40 organizations make up the Greek community on our campus, and they are as diverse as its members.
