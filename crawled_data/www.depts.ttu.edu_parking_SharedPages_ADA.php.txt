Those who need to use ADA spaces on campus first need to register with Transportation and Parking Services using the following steps. Contact TPS. TPS helps you purchase the appropriate ePermit, which will be the same permit your peers have. Bring your ADA placard or a photo of your ADA plates to the TPS office. You may also coordinate with TPS to send images of your placard or plates without coming to the TPS office. TPS adds the ADA permission to your ePermit. You may now park in any ADA space on the Texas Tech University campus. Renew your ADA permission when your placard or plate expires and is renewed.
