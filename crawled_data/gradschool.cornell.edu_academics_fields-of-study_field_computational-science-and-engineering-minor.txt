The field is application-driven and involves a mix of applied mathematics, numerical analysis, and computer science. Ph.D. students at Cornell can minor in CSE. Requirements are flexible and there are dozens of faculty members [CSE Field ] who can serve as the CSE advisor. The Cornell Center for Advanced Computing (CAC) provides an essential resource for students. CIS has received an IGERT award from the National Science Foundation making it possible to support a large contingent of Ph.D. students who work on complex nonlinear systems. A priority concern of the CSE program is the development of a coordinated curriculum that serves computationally-oriented graduate students throughout science and engineering. This is a minor field. Application for admission is made only to the major fields. After matriculation, a student may select minor subjects from the major or minor fields.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
