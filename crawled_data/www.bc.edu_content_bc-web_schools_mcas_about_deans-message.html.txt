Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences. As the oldest and largest division of Boston College, enrolling more than 6,000 undergraduate and nearly 800 graduate students, Arts and Sciences embodies the Jesuit commitment to academic excellence in a liberal arts setting. We help our students to develop the critical and analytical skills, capacity to communicate effectively, and broad intellectual foundation that they will need for a lifetime of learning and growth in a rapidly changing world. In the Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences we strive to prepare our students for both the rigorous and dynamic search for truth, wherever that search may lead, and for the ongoing formation of their minds, hearts, and imaginations for lives of freedom and integrity oriented toward service of the common good. Our Jesuit tradition encourages us to judge our success as an institution by who our students become. At Boston College, we hope our students become women and men of depth of thought and creative imagination, who are ready to engage the needs of our world and well-prepared for meaningful lives of leadership, scholarship, and service. Gregory Kalscheur, S.J. Dean, Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences Play The Power of a Liberal Arts education At the Morrissey College, we educate students in a 500-year Jesuit tradition by combining intellectual rigor with a concern for the formation of character. Our graduates are people who are well-educated, well-prepared, men and women ready to make a difference in the world.
