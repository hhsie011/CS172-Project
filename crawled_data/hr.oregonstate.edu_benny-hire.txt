Benny Hire is the system that the university uses to process all student employment positions: hourly student hires, graduate assistant hires, graduate assistant rehires, and graduate assistant reappointments. Using a combination of technological tools and process efficiencies, this new solution significantly decreases the number of steps in the hiring process, creates a more transparent hiring process for departments and reduces the number of people involved in the overall hire. 20170617_commencement_2.jpg Log in to Benny Hire For Benny Hire licensed roles including HR/liaison, BC finance, ELR, Central Payroll and CHC/MVHC Request Hourly Student Job Posting For hiring supervisors Request a grad assistant hire For hiring supervisors Benny Hire Hourly Students Benny Hire Graduate Assistants Benny Hire Change Process Benny Hire Project Information Contact us Benny Hire Hourly Students › Benny Hire Benny Hire Benny Hire Hourly Students Benny Hire Graduate Assistants Benny Hire Change Process Benny Hire Project Information Contact us Contact Info University Human Resources, Oregon State University, 236 Kerr Administration Building, Corvallis, OR 97331-8578 Phone: 541-737-3103 Fax: 541-737-7771 or 541-737-0541 E-mail A division of Finance & Administration.
