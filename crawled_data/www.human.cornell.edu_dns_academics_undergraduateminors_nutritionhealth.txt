The minor requires completion of introductory nutrition plus nine additional credits from a closed list of NS courses. Students may choose from courses covering the topics of human health and nutrition, economic influences on human nutrition, epidemiology and public health, food quality and food service management, nutritional biochemistry, and the psychological and social influences on human nutrition. Several NS courses are excluded from use toward the minor. For advising questions about the Nutrition and Health minor, contact dnsstudentservices@cornell.edu.
