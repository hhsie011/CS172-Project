Key events include service projects, game watches, and more. Every other year, the chapter visits Clemson for a game, where they have enjoyed Southern hospitality at its finest, in every aspect but the gridiron. If you have any ideas you'd like to share for specific events or if you'd like to become more involved in the chapter, please reach out to us! 1,210 Alumni Parents & Friends social leaders contact us events Follow Us South Carolina Chapter Facebook Page Meet Your Chapter Leaders Neil McDevitt '93 Lives in: Charleston, South Carolina Major: Biochemistry Occupation: MD Favorite BC Memory: My brother, Chris '87, my late father and I all met up in Charlotte for the Continental Tire Bowl in 2004 for our first Boston College Bowl experience. Despite being in a sea of Tar Heel Blue, we had a rowdy collection of fans and watched a fake kick seal a BC victory. Why did you get involved in your local chapter?: After I left BC and sort of grew up, I realized how special the bonds of a Jesuit education were and how much it enabled me to connect with people who shared that philosophy. What are your local favorites?: Pretty much all restaurants in Charleston have to be good. I love/hate running, particularly on the Ravenel Bridge. I really enjoy the Triathlon Circuit and open water swims here. Fun Fact: When not at work, we (my wife Amy and our two young children) spend a lot of time kayaking and cleaning up the river we live on.
