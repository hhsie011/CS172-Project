Please see the following list of frequently asked questions, and please contact us if you have any more questions! Getting Started 1. How do I apply for financial aid? See our Financial Aid Step-by-Step. 2. When can I begin to apply for financial aid? Spring and Summer starters may fill out the FAFSA at any time. If you are a Fall starter, you may fill out the FAFSA after you have filed your electronic tax return. 3. What is Baylor's FAFSA School Code? Baylor's School Code is 003545. 4. If I am a Spring or a Summer Starter, which FAFSA application do I file? If you are a Spring or a Summer Starter, you file the current academic year's and next academic year's FAFSA (e.g., if you begin in Spring or Summer 2022, you will file the 2021-2022 FAFSA and the 2022-2023 FAFSA). 5. Are financial aid applications accepted after the February 1st recommended deadline? Yes. The deadline is just a preferred deadline. Please note that you will not receive your financial aid package until you file the FAFSA. 6. Is an academic year Fall through Summer or Summer through Spring? It depends. Baylor University views the academic year as Summer as a standalone quarter, followed by the Fall through Spring. For purposes of the FAFSA and your federal loans, though, you should view the academic year as Fall through Summer. Costs 1. What are the tuition and fees for Baylor Law School? For a list of tuition and fees, please click here. 2. How much can I borrow for law school? You may borrow up to the cost of attendance minus any other aid (i.e. institutional and external scholarships) you receive. To view the cost of attendance, please click here. 3. What is the cost of attendance? The Cost of Attendance is what the school estimates you will spend on tuition, fees, books, supplies, room, board, transportation, and personal expenses. It is the maximum amount of aid you may receive each quarter. Scholarships 1. When will I know if I have received a scholarship? You will receive information about merit-based scholarships during the application process. Most students will receive scholarship information in their admissions letters. If you are interested in the Jaworski scholarship, you must submit a separate application. Click here for an application. 2. If I don't receive a scholarship during my first year, will I have the opportunity to apply for any more scholarships? Yes. If you maintain a 3.6 GPA during your first three quarters of law school, you will be eligible for a merit-based scholarship. 3. Are there any other scholarships available for law students? A number of bar associations and private organizations offer scholarships and writing competitions. A list of current writing competitions can be found here. 4. If I receive a scholarship, may I get it for all four quarters? Your scholarship will be awarded quarterly, and, assuming you maintain the eligibility GPA, you may use it for whichever nine quarters you choose. 5. What are the chances that I will retain my scholarship? Most of our students retain their scholarships. See your scholarship award letter for details. You can see our scholarship retention data here. Loans 1. I've used all of my Federal Direct Loan eligibility. Which loan should I take? After you have used your Federal Direct Loan eligibility, you can take up to the cost of attendance, minus other aid, in Graduate PLUS Loans, in Texas College Access Loans, or in private alternative loans. 2. Which federal loans are available to me? There are two types of federal loans available to you. For more information on loans, please visit here. 3. Which Texas loans are available to me? If you are a Texas resident, you may also choose to secure the additional amount of aid for which you are eligible by applying for Texas College Access Loans, funded by the State of Texas. Click here to apply. Texas residency requirements can be found here. 4. Which private loans are available to me? Check with banks and other lending institutions. Additional loan sources are listed here. 5. What is adverse credit and favorable credit for purposes of the Graduate PLUS Loans and the CAL? For the government's definition of adverse credit, click here. For the State of Texas' definition of favorable credit, click here. 6. How do I apply for financial aid? See our Financial Aid Step-by-Step page for more information. 7. How do I make changes to my financial aid award? You may contact the Financial Aid Office at 254-710-2611 or may fill out their contact form here. 8. Are there any loans after law school to help with the costs associated with the state bar exam? Loan assistance from private lenders is available to you for purposes of assisting with bar exam expenses, bar application fees, and associated living expenses. Bar loans are made payable directly to you and, because they are not a component of your financial aid package from Baylor Law School. You may choose to borrow from $500 to $15,000. These loans are commercial loans and are based upon your credit worthiness and, as such, the interest rate/fees will vary from lender to lender based upon your credit. As always, we strongly encourage you to minimize borrowing. To this end, we encourage you to carefully think through the impact of borrowing additional money, because cumulative borrowing can significantly impact your post-graduation lifestyle for the ten or more years you will be in repayment. 9. I'm a Spring starter. Why am I receiving three financial aid packages during my first three quarters of law school? Because Baylor University sees the academic year as Fall-Spring together and Summer as a standalone term, your first three quarters are each in different academic terms and thus are packaged separately. You will receive a package for Spring, for Summer, and then for Fall-Spring. 10. Does Baylor Law offer any loan repayment assistance programs? Baylor Law will counsel students on federal and state loan repayment options. Additionally, Baylor Law partners with the Texas Access to Justice Foundation to provide loan repayment assistance to a select group of graduates. Click here for more information.
