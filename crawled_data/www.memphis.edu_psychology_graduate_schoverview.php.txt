Graduates obtain a credential to practice as a school psychologist from the Tennessee State Department of Education or similar agency in other states. More than 120 program graduates now serve as school psychologists in the Mid-South Region and across the United States. The program is approved by the National Association of School Psychologists and formally accredited as part of the education unit at the University of Memphis by the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation.
