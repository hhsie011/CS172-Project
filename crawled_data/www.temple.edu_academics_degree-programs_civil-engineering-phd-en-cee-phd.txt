Research interests can include bridge longevity, geotechnical engineering, infrastructure modernization, or many more. This doctoral degree program is fully customizable; you can design an individualized plan of study. Pursue your research interests with the guidance of our highly experienced faculty, whose research areas include construction management; earthquake engineering and evaluation of deep foundations; geophysical imaging and site characterization; infrastructure reconstruction; pavement construction, materials and rehabilitation; and transportation engineering. Temple’s doctoral program in Civil Engineering also encourages interdisciplinary collaboration with faculty in departments in and outside of the College of Engineering, including Chemistry, Geology and other sciences (in the College of Science and Technology), Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mathematics, and Mechanical Engineering. Completion Requirements Completion requirements depend on whether you enter the doctoral program with a master’s degree. If you have a master’s degree, you must complete 15 credits of PhD-level didactic coursework and 15 credits of PhD exams and dissertation research, for a total of 30 credits. If you only have a bachelor’s degree, you must complete 45 credits of master’s- and PhD-level coursework and 15 credits of PhD exams and dissertation research, for a total of 60 credits. See the Admissions section below for more information. Between didactic coursework, dissertation research and examinations, the PhD can take four or five years, depending on your trajectory and project interests. You have up to seven years to complete your degree. There are three major pieces of culminating work for the PhD. Preliminary examination: This exam evaluates your communication, information-synthesis and research skills. Dissertation proposal: Research and write your proposal, and present it at an open college seminar. Dissertation writing and defense: Present and defend your dissertation in front of a dissertation committee. Classes & Curriculum The coursework you complete will be selected in consultation with your research advisor and doctoral advisory committee and follow the outline of your plan of study. Some of the areas you might study include airport and transportation systems engineering, behavior of steel or concrete structures, bridge design, construction or engineering project management, geotechnical engineering and geosynthetics, and pavement design and management. You’ll enjoy small classes held in the evening. Course offerings are scheduled through 2020, allowing you to arrange an uninterrupted plan of study. You’ll leave the doctoral program steeped in diverse engineering approaches that will make you a well-rounded academic, researcher or engineer in industry. You’ll also form close relationships with your cohort: a dynamic student body representing a wide range of ethnic, national and racial identities.
