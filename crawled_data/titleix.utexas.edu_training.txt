Prevention & Education Training Opportunities Prevention Training Materials for Title IX Personnel Workshop Menu Title IX Basics Title IX Basics has been revised to incorporate new content! This course is a comprehensive overview of policies that include Title IX, Texas Education Code 51.252 (also known as SB 212), and UT Austin's Prohibition of Sexual Assault, Interpersonal Violence, Stalking, Sexual Harassment, and Sex Discrimination (HOP 3-3031) policy. We will discuss how these policies intersect, mandatory reporting duties for employees, intervention and support strategies, and resources and support available for Title IX related incidents. We will utilize scenario-based learning to apply workshop content to real world situations. This workshop can be tailored to fit the needs of a variety of audiences including students, employees, and student employees upon request. Are We Okay? Tools and Tips for Communicating our Boundaries This is an interactive workshop focused solely on setting and communicating boundaries and expectations.
