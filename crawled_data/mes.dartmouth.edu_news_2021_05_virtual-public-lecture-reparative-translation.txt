We will consider several critical convergences between Black Critical Race Theory and Arabic translation theory (Kilito, Benabdelali, Benmakhlouf), with reference to examples in poetics and fiction that qualify as reparative translation praxis. Emily Apter is a Silver Professor of French and Comparative Literature and Chair of Comparative Literature at New York University. Her books include: Unexceptional Politics: On Obstruction, Impasse and the Impolitic (Verso, 2018), Against World Literature: On the Politics of Untranslatability (2013), Dictionary of Un-translatables: A Philosophical Lexicon (co-edited with Barbara Cassin, Jacques Lezra and Michael Wood) (2014); and The Translation Zone: A New Comparative Literature (2006). The current project: What is Just Translation? takes up questions of translation and law, sexual safety, and transmediality.
