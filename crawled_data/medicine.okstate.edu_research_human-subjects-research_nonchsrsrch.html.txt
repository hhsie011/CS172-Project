Doing so will assist the IRB in ensuring that such research projects have received appropriate IRB reviews and approvals required by the Code of Federal Regulations (http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html). Following assessment of the documentation listed above, and confirmation that the research project has been approved by a federally assured IRB, the OSU CHS IRB Chair or IRB Administrator may issue a letter of permission to recruit on the OSU CHS campus. Permission may be granted for one year or for the period of time for which the home IRB granted approval to conduct the study, whichever is less. The researcher should note that permission to recruit is not an IRB review, and applying to recruit does not serve as or replace review of a research project by an IRB. The home IRB retains responsibility for conducting all required continuing reviews of the study (http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html#46.109), and all unanticipated problems or adverse events related to the study will be reported by the researcher to the home IRB. Should the study receive a continuing review or be submitted by the researcher to the home IRB for review and approval of study revisions, the researcher must reapply for permission to recruit research participants at OSU CHS. This is accomplished through submission of copies of revised documents, including the most recent IRB approval documents, to the OSU CHSIRB. Following assessment of these documents, a subsequent letter of permission to recruit may be issued. All questions regarding permission to recruit research participants at OSU CHS should be addressed to the IRB by email at chsirb@okstate.edu Office of Research & Sponsored Programs Office of Research & Sponsored Programs 1111 W. 17th St. Tulsa, OK 74107 (map) (918) 561-1400 | Back To Top Back To Top CampusesUniversity LinksResourcesStudentsDepartments A to ZmyOKSTATEDirectoryOSU Medical CenterRooms OSU Center for Health Sciences 1111 W. 17 Street Tulsa Campus Tulsa, OK 74107 (map) (918) 582-1972 | Contact Us OSU-COM at Cherokee Nation 19500 E Ross St Tahlequah Campus Tahlequah, OK 74464 (map) (918) 525-6191 | Contact Us Follow US NewsEventsPlan an Event Facebook Twitter Instagram Linkedin Oklahoma State University Campus & Parking MapsAll OSU InstitutionsCareers @ OSUHire OSU Grads© Oklahoma State University.
