How I've Changed I've deepened my love for the humanities and grown so much in my spirituality. I leave with a deeper connection to God; I praise Allah for keeping me awake. Favorite Class or Professor Richard Parker's "Religion, Politics, and Public Policy," and Catherine Brekus's "Cities on a Hill." They helped me discover my excitement for American religious history, especially the topic of religious and racial minorities thoughtfully critiquing American empire and driving progressive change. I have even come to understand my own story better—as a Muslim, a product of America's most recent migratory wave, someone who has faced before-seen xenophobia, and someone who strives to create for himself and his community a sense of belonging in this nation. Message of Thanks I thank my family—Mom, Dad, Kiren, Mariam, and Jawan. I thank all my HDS folks—Hector and Anna #WeightliftingAsMinistry as well as Ruth, Aidan, Sami, Yaseen, Amadou, Mafaz, and Naman. I thank the HDS Muslims and my closest Proctor friends, Anca, Jeff, and Hassan. Future Plans I'll intern with the UN this summer in Jerusalem and teach undergrads at Harvard next fall while continuing my work in race and equity activism!
