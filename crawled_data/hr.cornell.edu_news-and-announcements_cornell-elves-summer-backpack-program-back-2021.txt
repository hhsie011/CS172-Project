It appears that schools will reopen this fall and with that announcement comes the opportunity to provide many of the neediest kids in area schools, with a new backpack and supplies. The Backpack Program is back! We are excited to have the program back in action. We are welcoming volunteers who wish to participate to fill some gaps caused by changes in staffing over the past year. Contact info is below. The school supplies list, estimated to cost $20-$25 this year, is also below. Backpack donations are being accepted August 4, 5, 6, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20 in room 114 of the East Hill Office Building from 11am to 3pm. The room is on your left as you enter and a backpack program sign will be visible. Parking at the main entrance provides easy access to the building. ~Maureen Brull, Backpack Program Leader & Bill Alberta, CEO (Chief Elf Organizer) Assisting students with their back-to-school needs. In this Elf effort, we buy new backpacks and fill them with school supplies from The Summer Backpack Program school supplies shopping list. Shopping is done over the summer and the filled backpacks are delivered to schools shortly before the school year starts. Get Involved Contact one of the Summer Backpack Program Leaders to take part in this project. If you or your business has a surplus of new supplies, as outlined on our list, and you would like to donate them, contact Maureen Brull, mpb8@cornell.edu.
