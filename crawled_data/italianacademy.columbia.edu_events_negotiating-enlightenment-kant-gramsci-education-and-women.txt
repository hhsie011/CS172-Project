Antonio Gramsci took it out of the university and planned, in his prison notebooks, to bring the subaltern into the question. His planning was made possible by Tatiana Schucht and Giulia Schucht Gramsci. Our conference will enter this narrative of intellectual history, with equal focus on Kant, Gramsci, and the Schucht sisters.
