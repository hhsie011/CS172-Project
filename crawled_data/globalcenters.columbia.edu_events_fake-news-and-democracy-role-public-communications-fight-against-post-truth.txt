What would it look like? What role could public communications play in the fight against fake news, hate speech and political fiction? How might it help democracy? Starting from the creation of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro public radio in the context of the turbulent "Brazilian journeys of June" 2013, to the present day CPI (parliamentary committee of inquiry) of fake news at the National Congress, this presentation is the result of a process of intellectual dialogue and political partnership between federal deputy Jean Wyllys and UFRJ professor Fernando Salis on the influence of fake news on democratic processes and the centrality of moral agendas as a fascist electoral strategy. Focused on the common project of creating a public radio station, in which the federal deputy introduced parliamentary amendments for the development of the project at UFRJ, Wyllys and Salis reflect on the tortuous paths Brazilian democracy has taken since the “coup”/impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff through the presidential election of 2018. They will explore the moral agendas that took center stage and their implications both nationally and internationally, comparing them to the methods adopted to the Brexit and Trump elections, and the rise of the new international right wing sustained by fraudulent communicative actions in electoral processes, as well as the maintenance of administrations based on monitoring and the use of media and social networks. Their guiding hypothesis is that public communications with social participation is the best antidote to this hacking of democracy and liberal values by the production of fake news on a global scale. We will meet at 5:30PM in the bar at Faculty House (if it will be available) for drinks and our usual conviviality. At 6 PM we will go for dinner. If you are planning to join us for dinner, please inform our rapporteur, Tiago Amaral Ciarallo ([email protected]) by Friday, December 6, 2019 so that he may tell Faculty House the number of people to prepare for. The cost of dinner is $30.00 per person payable by check to Columbia University. After dinner we will move to the Garden Room where Mr. Wyllys and Prof Salis’ presentation will begin at 7:15 PM.
