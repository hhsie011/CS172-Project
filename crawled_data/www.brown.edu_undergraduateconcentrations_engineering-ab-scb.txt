The concentration in Engineering equips students with a solid foundation for careers in engineering, to advance the knowledge base for future technologies, and to merge teaching, scholarship, and practice in the pursuit of solutions to human needs. The concentration offers one standard Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) program and eight Bachelor of Science (Sc.B.) degree programs. Of these, the Sc.B. programs in biomedical, chemical, computer, electrical, materials, and mechanical engineering are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET. The Sc.B. degree program in environmental engineering is not currently accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, but will seek accreditation during the 2020-21 academic year. The engineering physics program is also offered, but is not accredited by ABET. Other programs leading to the Sc.B. or A.B. degrees in Engineering may be designed in consultation with a faculty advisor. These programs must meet the general requirements for concentration programs in the School of Engineering. Students interested in an individualized program should consult with an Engineering faculty member willing to serve as an advisor and obtain the approval of the Engineering Concentration Committee. Engineering students with a particular interest in using their technical skills for the public benefit might also consider the Engaged Scholars Program.
