The lab supports several pieces of equipment that enable us to measure both isotopic ratios and concentration. We perform high precision isotopic analyses on a Thermo Fisher Neptune Plus Multi Collector ICPMS and Nu Attom Magnetic Sector ICPMS. We perform both highly accurate quantitative and semi quantitative analyses of elemental concentrations with 1-2% precision on our VG Excell quadropole ICPMS as well as Nu Attom Magnetic Sector ICPMS. Highlighted below are elements we routinely measure on our ICPMS with concentrations in the ppb range. For measuring more abundant elements in the ppm concentration range we have a Agilent 720 Axial ICPOES. Although we primarily measure geologic, environmental and oceanographic materials, we are also able to analyze many other types of samples. We also have an ESI New Wave UP 193 FX excimer laser ablation system, enabling us to measure both in solution as well as a solid on all our ICPMS instruments.
