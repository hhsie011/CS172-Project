It is our hope that alumni, parents, and friends will take a leap with us and help move the arts even further forward on campus. With support for more programs, fellowships, and collaborations, the university has the capacity to define what it means to make, experience, and study art in the 21st century. An investment in the arts at Stanford is also an investment in the future of art—and in tomorrow’s leaders.
