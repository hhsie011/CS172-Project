The program recognizes and supports outstanding graduate students in NSF-supported science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines who are pursuing research-based master's and doctoral degrees at accredited United States institutions. NSF Fellows are anticipated to become knowledge experts who can contribute significantly to research, teaching, and innovations in science and engineering. These individuals are crucial to maintaining and advancing the nation's technological infrastructure and national security as well as contributing to the economic well-being of society at large. This award does not require university endorsement. At this time, NCA is able to provide only limited advising for this award. Deadlines National Deadline: October 2022 (determined by discipline) Award Details right arrow down arrow Fellows benefit from a three-year annual stipend of $34,000 along with a $12,000 cost of education allowance for tuition and fees (paid to the institution), opportunities for international research and professional development, and the freedom to conduct their own research at any accredited U.S. institution of graduate education they choose.

Pursue graduate training in an eligible field of study (fields like biomedical and health research are not eligible) Pursue an eligible degree type (most professional degree programs like MD, JD, and MPH are not eligible) at a U.S. institution Please refer to the NSF GRFP website for an eligibility tutorial video and the program solicitation, which offers a more detailed list of eligibility requirements, including a list of all eligible fields and subfields. Selection Criteria When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to evaluate all proposals against two criteria: Intellectual Merit: The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and Broader Impacts: The Broader Impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.

We recommend that you ask a faculty mentor in your field to review your materials and offer feedback. Information on this page is intended to supplement, not supplant, your own careful review of the official NSF GRFP website and program solicitation. If you find any discrepancy between the two, the NSF GRFP website takes precedence. Though you should seek out others’ advice and feedback on your application, the essays should be your original work (no one should be writing your essays for you). UC’s Student Code of Conduct applies.
