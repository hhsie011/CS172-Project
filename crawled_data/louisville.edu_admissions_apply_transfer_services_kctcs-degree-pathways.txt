A student who completes all the courses listed on a particular Transfer Pathway will earn an Associate of Art, Associate of Science, or Associate of Applied Science degree at Kentucky Community and Technical College Systems. When a student transfers to University of Louisville, the student’s official transcript will certify if the student is fully general education certified. If so, the student will not need to take any additional general education courses at UofL. The student is guaranteed that all the KCTCS courses indicated in the pathway will be accepted at UofL and that the courses will count toward completion of a particular major. If a KCTCS student transfers to another college, he or she is not guaranteed that all courses will transfer. Please note this site is being consistently updated as we work with our KCTCS partners to develop more degree pathways. Pathways with links are finalized, those in grey are currently under development.
