Beyond this, the major allows students not only to shape their own emphasis within it (for instance, history and criticism or screenwriting), but also to take at least one additional course relevant to their emphasis outside the department. Students may modify Film & Media Studies with another related discipline and it should be noted that Film & Media Studies can be either the major or the minor part of a modified major. The department also accommodates those students who would like to minor in Film & Media Studies. To modify another major with film, students will need to take four courses in F&MS plus one of our prereqs among Film 1/2/3. Otherwise we don't draw any parameters around what you can/can't/should/shouldn't take.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Film & Media Studies Undergraduate Overview Major, Minor, And Modified Major The Major Major Requirements Culminating Experience Culminating Exp.
