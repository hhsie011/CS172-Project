The Pembroke Center hosts editorial proctors via partnerships with the Brown Graduate School. Proctorships with differences: A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies enable students to learn about all aspects of journal operations in a hands-on way. Kristen Maye Proctors work closely with the editors to manage submissions, communicate with a broad array of feminist scholars, and acquire scholarly publishing skills and experience. Journal proctorships also allow graduate students to immerse themselves in theoretical debates that are germane to their own scholarship. From vetting submissions to proofreading typeset pages, proctors encounter new research and forge new academic and professional relationships. For the 2021-22 academic year, the Pembroke Center is delighted to welcome Kristen Maye, a PhD candidate in Africana studies at Brown, as the differences proctor. Kristen graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a B.A. in Afro-American Studies and History. Her research examines black studies as it exposes the limits and contradictions of disciplinarity. Kristen spent the time between her undergraduate studies and her doctoral program working in criminal justice and drug policy reform in New York City. She won a 2019-20 Steinhaus/Zisson grant from the Pembroke Center for her project "Black Studies Beyond the Knowledge of Man." Summer 2021 Graduate Proctors The journal was fortunate to host two outstanding scholars, Soomin Kim and Scott Jackshaw, both PhD candidates in Brown's Department of English, as proctors for differences over the summer of 2021. The proctorship allowed me to actively engage with new writings by scholars from various fields and pushed me to think in both critical and editorial terms about the best way to present arguments. …I formed new connections with scholars engaging in cutting-edge work across the country and with my fellow scholars at the Pembroke Center. I learned the intricate work that goes on behind the academic journal publishing scene, and I'm proud to have contributed to upcoming issues of differences. Suzy Kim Ph.D. candidate in English at Brown and Summer 2021 Graduate Proctor for differences I had a terrific experience as an editorial assistant at differences over the summer months, and I'm grateful to have had this opportunity to immerse myself in feminist scholarship and to demystify the world of academic publishing.
