Almost every area of modern biology, from molecular genetics to neuroscience, is being revolutionized by large scale, quantitative experiments and sophisticated theoretical analyses. From observing the dynamics of single biological molecules to building theories of neural networks, there are myriad challenges for physicists and biologists willing to explore the boundary between their disciplines. Our work is animated by the belief that, as in other areas of physics, the striking qualitative phenomena of life should have correspondingly deep theoretical explanations, and that this understanding ultimately will be tested only by a new generation of quantitative experiments. Why Biological Physics at Princeton? Princeton University offers a unique environment for research and education at the interface between physics and biology. More than 25 faculty and fellows are currently engaged in biological physics research across campus. Barriers between departments are low, and are reduced by multidisciplinary initiatives such as the Lewis-Sigler Institute, the Princeton Neuroscience Institute, graduate programs in Quantitative and Computational Biology and Neuroscience, and the Biophysics certificate program for undergraduates.] Our faculty are part of the newly-formed CUNY-Princeton Center for the Physics of Biological Function.
