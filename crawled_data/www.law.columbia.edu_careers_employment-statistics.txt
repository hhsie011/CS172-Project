To further assist our prospective students as they consider enrolling in law school, we have published Employment and Salary Information for the Classes of 2020, 2019 and 2018, and the 2020 NALP Summary Report. Information on employment outcomes for the class of 2021 may not reflect a particular law school’s typical results in this area. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, bar admission exams were canceled or delayed in many jurisdictions, thus making it more challenging for graduates to secure employment by the annual Graduate Employment Status Date of March 15.
