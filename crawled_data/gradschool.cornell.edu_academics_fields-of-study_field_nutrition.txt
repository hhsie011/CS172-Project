For those preparing for laboratory experimentation in nutrition, minors in biochemistry, molecular biology or genetics usually are recommended, although other minors may be chosen. Students interested in community and international nutrition have access to active programs that provide opportunity for field experience in the United States or abroad. Candidates for the Ph.D. degree select two minor concentrations, one of which is within the field. All degree programs require a thesis or dissertation; the specific requirements are determined by each candidate's Special Committee. Graduate students are generally required to assist in teaching as part of their training. Faculty members at Cornell who have expertise in nutrition and whose research is focused on questions in nutrition constitute the faculty in this field. The majority of the field’s faculty members are in the Division of Nutritional Sciences, but the Field also comprises faculty members in other departments within the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and the College of Veterinary Medicine.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
