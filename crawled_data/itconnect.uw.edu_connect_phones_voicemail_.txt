Press [#] to Send. Repeat steps 4 through 6 for each additional destination. Press [*] to return to the Main Menu. Changing Your Greetings The voicemail system provides three choices of greetings: personal, extended absence, and name. NOTE: If you are assigned an existing voice mailbox, you may need to change both the personal greeting and the name greeting. Personal Greeting This allows you to record an everyday greeting, such as “Hello. You’ve reached First Name, Last Name in the Department. Please leave a message after the tone and I will return your call.” While listening to your greeting, callers can press # to bypass your message. Your greeting will stop and the caller will hear a beep indicating they may begin recording their message. You can include this information in your greeting so they can skip through your recording every time they call. Change Your Personal Greeting StepsActions From the Main Menu, press [4][1][3][2] or [4][4] for quick access ([4][4] does not allow you to replay your greeting). Record your new personal greeting. Press: [5] to Store the new greeting, [6] to Replay, or [4] to Re-record. Extended Absence Greeting This allows you to record a temporary greeting. Common uses are for temporary absences, i. e. out-of-office for vacations, meetings, and other temporary circumstances. This greeting does not allow callers to bypass this greeting by pressing #. An extended absence greeting does not replace your personal greeting. When you check your messages, the system will ask if you wish to retain your extended absence greeting. You can choose to retain or delete it. Until you choose to delete it, you will be asked each time you check your messages if you wish to retain or delete it. Record an Extended Absence Greeting StepsActions From the Main Menu press [4][1][3][3] or [4][6] for quick access ([4][6] does not allow you to replay your greeting). Record your temporary greeting. Press: [5] to Save the new greeting, [6] to Replay, or [4] to Re-record. Recorded Name Greeting When you set up your mailbox, the system asks you to record your name. This is played to identify voice mail messages that you send to other voicemail subscribers (e.g. “this message was sent on [date], by “Recorded Name”). Change Your Recorded Name Greeting StepsActions From the Main Menu, press [4][1][5]. Listen to the prompts to record your name. Press: [5] to Save the new greeting [6] to Replay, or [4] to Re-record. Exiting the System After changing or recording your greeting, the system will return you to the Personal Options menu. Press [*] to exit to the Main Menu or Press [*][*] to exit your mailbox. Establishing or Changing Your Notification Telephone Number and Schedule The Notification Schedule feature allows you to instruct the system when and where to call you when there are waiting messages. You may change your schedule(s) at any time. To Establish or Change Your Notification Schedule StepsActions From the Main Menu, press [4][1][1]. The system will let you know if notification is on or off and will report your notification settings. To change your settings, listen carefully to the prompts.
