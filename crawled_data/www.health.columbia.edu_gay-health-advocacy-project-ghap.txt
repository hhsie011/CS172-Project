We keep the name Gay Health Advocacy Project to reach out to Columbia students who have been at highest risk for HIV and to honor those who started our group during the early years of the epidemic. Learn more about our history at ghaparchive.com. Contact us or walk in to learn more about Truvada and HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP). PrEP is a daily pill to prevent infection of HIV. Concerned you may have been exposed to HIV? Consult with us about Post-Exposure Prophylaxis, a course of antiretrovirals taken soon after exposure that helps to prevent HIV infection. GHAP Peer Advocates come from many different graduate, professional and undergraduate programs at Columbia. Students come to GHAP to talk about sex, pleasure, concerns about sexuality, identity, and relationships in a supportive and non-judgmental environment, and to learn about and get connected to other resources on campus. Meetings with Advocates are confidential, and Advocates are HIPAA-certified and closely supervised. A number of Advocates speak second languages, including Mandarin. VISITS WITH GHAP Connect with a GHAP advocate in person at John Jay Hall, 3rd floor or virtually in the GHAP Zoom Room. Can't make drop-in hours?
