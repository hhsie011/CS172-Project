At PC, students have the opportunity to work side-by-side with experts in everything from novelist Cormac McCarthy to stem cells. In the process, they gain hands-on experience, a deeper understanding of their academic discipline and sometimes a byline in an academic journal or a presentation at a professional conference. This gives our students the confidence, expertise, and résumé-building credentials that set them apart in the workplace, on a scholarship or post-baccalaureate fellowship application, and in graduate school.
