Starting in the summer before their first semester, students are paired with an academic adviser through the James H. and Christine Turk Berick Center for Student Advising; advisers help with everything from selecting classes, planning schedules, discussing academic needs, exploring research and internship opportunities, discussing studying abroad, and developing short and long term educational goals. Once students declare their majors in their sophomore years, they will also work with the faculty member who is designated as the Director of Undergraduate Studies in their particular department or program. In addition, students also have access to specialized career advising, global programs advising, fellowship advising and preprofessional advising.
