Learn More Getting into Your Major For All Majors In general, each major has prerequisite (major prep) coursework that you must take before transferring in order to get into your major. Take the recommended lower-division/general education/breadth classes for your major. Some programs recommend the Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC), which is a series of courses that California Community College students can complete to satisfy first- and second-year general education requirements before transferring. Some programs want you to focus on prerequisites instead of IGETC. Use ASSIST.org to see what your major program recommends or contact a UCR admissions counselor for help. View the Assist Brochure for more information. Each major has a minimum GPA requirement. Some majors require a GPA higher than that required for basic admission. Programs are selective. Strive to surpass your program’s minimum GPA. Remember: All transferable coursework will be taken into account. Marlan and Rosemary Bourns College of Engineering Requirements Breadth Requirements You are strongly encouraged to focus on preparatory course work (mathematics, science and technical work) for your desired major rather than on IGETC completion.

Additional breadth coursework may be required after enrollment at BCOE. Prerequisites Strong technical preparation is essential for success in the admissions process and, subsequently, in all coursework at BCOE. If you intend to transfer to an engineering major, you are expected to complete the equivalent of UCR coursework required in the first two years of the programs and apply for transfer starting your junior year.
