Many of our dancers come from other departments, while others come from any of our three concentration tracks within the Department. If you are interested in dance and want to concentrate in Theatre Arts and Performance Studies you can do this in any of the three concentration tracks. If you just want to dance or choreograph we have a place for you too! Although we are primarily a modern dance program, we also have a strong West African dance, music, and culture component. We utilize our flexible curriculum to offer courses in pedagogy, anatomy, and body therapies and are very supportive of students who wish to work independently on any of the numerous topics that can enrich one’s knowledge and appreciation of the art of dance. Performance opportunities for dancers are numerous. The department’s performance season always includes at least two dance concerts, which consist of works by students, faculty and guest choreographers. All students are encouraged to choreograph and/or audition for these shows and there are additional opportunities for dancers to choreograph and perform. Other involvement options include working with faculty-sponsored companies and projects, such as the Rhythm of Change initiative, and applying for academic or extra-curricular grants. For more detailed information or with specific questions about the dance curriculum, please email [email protected]. In addition to departmental course and performance opportunities, there are also many Brown-based performance companies that are open and available for student involvement: Body and Sole: a student-run umbrella organization that supports the activities of all the vibrant student dance groups and independent dancers at Brown. Please visit their page to learn more and get involved. Dance Extension: a modern repertory company created by the founding director of dance at Brown, Julie Strandberg. New Works/World Traditions: an international performance troupe founded by Michelle Bach-Coulibaly, dedicated to utilizing the power of performance to educate, deliberate and inspire social engagement. American Dance Legacy Institute: a network of dance professionals, aimed at transforming how people think about and experience dance through collaborative programming that connects American heritage and building a dance literate public.
