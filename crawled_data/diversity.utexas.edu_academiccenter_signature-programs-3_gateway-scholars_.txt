We support our students to complete college successfully and become top-notch competitors in the global job market upon graduation. We are your “Gateway” to success on campus and beyond! Target Audience We work closely with the Office of Freshman Admissions to identify freshmen across all colleges who have demonstrated exceptional motivation and potential in high school, with a focus on the following fields: fine arts, nursing, and social work. Academic goals, performance in academic courses, extracurricular involvement, leadership experiences, and demonstrated commitment to learning are all key factors in inviting a student to join Gateway Scholars. Impact For the past five years, the Gateway Scholars program has helped to ensure that our students have competitive GPAs and positive experiences that facilitate on-time graduation in four years. The 2017-2018 class had a retention rate of 98% with an average GPA of 3.1 at the end of the fall semester; 70 percent of the students completed their first semester with a GPA above 3.0.

Every student is connected to a program when they first enter college. Each program’s goal is to set students on a path to graduate in four years. Each program offers assistance and resources to help students achieve that goal. Participation in 360 Connections is mandatory. What is the Longhorn Center for Academic Excellence (LCAE)? The Longhorn Center for Academic Excellence is one of the 360 Connections. LCAE provides academic, personal, and professional supports to students from colleges and majors across campus. Each year, LCAE supports over two thousand students with over a dozen programs, including Gateway Scholars and Longhorn Link. LCAE is part of UT’s Division of Diversity and Community Engagement (DDCE), and is part of the DDCE’s PreK-to-PhD Pathways. For more, please visit diversity.utexas.edu/academiccenter. What are Gateway Scholars (GWS) and Longhorn Link (LLP)? Gateway Scholars is a student-success program that facilitates the transition to and through college, and into a career. GWS focuses on supporting first-year students, but offers four years of guidance and mentorship. Longhorn Link is also a student-success program that provides opportunities for academic development, assists with college requirements, and serves to motivate students toward the completion of their postsecondary education. LLP is part of the U.S. Department of Education’s TRIO Student Support Services, funded under Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965. Both GWS and LLP are effective programs. Over the last five years, the retention for students in these programs is 95% or higher. The average GPA of participants—3.0 or higher—matches or exceeds the University as a whole. How are students picked for Gateway and Longhorn Link? LLP follows federal regulations to select students who meet one or more criteria relating to low income, first-generation college status, and individual disability. Most LLP students are referred via their high school pre-college programs, including other TRIO programs like Upward Bound and Talent Search. GWS selects the majority of its students from Fine Arts, Nursing, and Social Work. Also, GWS often supports students who are part of the DDCE’s educational pathways, especially those who have been served by pre-college programs in the Longhorn Center for School Partnerships, including Advise Texas, Dual Enrollment Initiatives, Neighborhood Longhorns, and UT Outreach. Additionally, both GWS and LLP recruit students based on exceptional motivation and persistence in high school. Participating students have demonstrated strong academics, extracurricular accomplishment, career preparation, community leadership, etc. Is there a cost to participate in Gateway and Longhorn Link? No. Participating in GWS and LLP is entirely free for students the entire time they are enrolled. What is an academic advisor? Your academic advisor helps you stay on track toward graduation. Advisors are experts housed within the academic departments who guide you through your major’s expectations and degree plan. So, English majors are served by advisors who specialize in the requirements and courses found in the College of Liberal Arts, etc. Since LCAE is housed in the DDCE and not an academic department, it does not offer academic advising. GWS and LLP staff do advise students—think of it as success coaching—in all sorts of ways: building resumes and networking skills, developing professionally, finding mentorship and internship opportunities, studying abroad, gaining soft skills, etc. Additionally, GWS and LLP staff do help review guidance from academic advisors in ways that are complimentary. An academic advisor helps students select which classes are needed in a semester, for instance, and GWS/LLP help students design a calendar with those classes that work for them. LCAE stays in persistent contact with students in ways that are interactive, personalized, and hands-on. How do the UGS 303 and ALD 118C fit into my degree plan? Students participating in GWS and LLP are expected to take two courses: the three-hour UGS 303 in the fall, and the one-hour ALD 118C in the spring. Every student on campus is required to take a “signature course” during their first year, usually their first semester. UGS 303 is the signature course designated for GWS and LLP students. Because of their participation in GWS and LLP, students are guaranteed a spot in this popular course that builds students’ critical thinking skills and cultural intelligence. The course introduces students to the habits central to success in college and careers. Plus, UGS 303 counts toward the core class requirements that all students need to take to graduate. ALD 118C is an elective speaker series that does not interfere with students’ degree plans. It showcases how students can use their time in college to explore and prepare for their eventual careers. Each week students get the chance to learn from experts in their field, with expertise ranging from nonprofits to business, healthcare to law. Students discuss how to think entrepreneurially about their academic and professional development. Occasionally, unavoidable scheduling conflicts occur. When there is a conflict between UGS 303, ALD 118C, and a course required for their major, LCAE advises students to take the course within their academic department. We will work with them to find a suitable signature course replacement. Are students part of Gateway and Longhorn Link all four years? They don’t have to be, but it is highly encouraged. Again, students who remain engaged in learning communities and with student support services stay in college at a higher rate, typically earn a higher GPA, and are more likely to graduate on-time. Plus, they are connected to a wider, deeper set of resources and opportunities. Besides GWS and LLP, what resources and opportunities does LCAE provide? A partial list of resources and opportunities provided by LCAE include: STEM tutoring, writing consultations, research guidance, success coaching, interview practice, resume building, networking events, financial literacy lessons, paid internships, longterm mentorships, work-study positions, service leadership experiences, community service experiences, study abroad experiences and support, college-to-career experiences and support (law, healthcare, business), the Fearless Leaders Institute, the Heman Sweatt Center, Monarch Scholars, McNair Scholars (for students seeking Ph.D.’s), dedicated study space, scholarships, and much more. LCAE can also work with students to develop individualized supports as needed. Students just need to ask for help, and we will provide it. For more, visit diversity.utexas.edu/academiccenter.

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) is a federal law that pertains to the release of and access to educational records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education. FERPA applies to personally identifiable information in educational records. This includes items such as the student’s name, names of family members, addresses, personal identifiers such as social security numbers, and personal characteristics or other information that make the student’s identity easily traceable. At UT Austin, FERPA rights apply to students. A student is a person who is or has been in attendance at the institution, regardless of the person’s age. According to FERPA, nondirectory information may not be released without prior written consent from the student.
