Read Full Story Research: Continuous Manufacturing Could Lower Cost of Antibiotics Georgia Tech researchers received a grant from the Food and Drug Administration to develop a way to continuously manufacture common antibiotics like amoxicillin. This process could help reduce costs and avoid shortages. Read Full Story Research: Bacterial Litmus Test Measures Micronutrients A bacterium engineered to produce different pigments in response to varying levels of a micronutrient in blood samples could give health officials an inexpensive way to detect nutritional deficiencies in resource-limited areas of the world. This “bacterial litmus test,” which currently measures levels of zinc, requires no electrical equipment and the results are visible as simple color changes.
