Whether you’re picking up an old passion or finding a whole new one, Butler gives you endless opportunities to stay fulfilled outside of class. Getting involved with campus groups hones teamwork, communication skills, decision making, and problem solving. And it also turns leadership, service, and learning into a habit. Pause/Play Student Involvement Jump Right In It’s almost impossible to imagine the Butler experience without getting involved. When it comes to building the kind of leadership skills that will serve you long after you graduate, our clubs, organizations, and service groups play a huge role in that development. The Department of Student Involvement and Leadership is responsible for bringing these opportunities to you—but, really, the magic happens when you jump in. Getting Involved Civic Engagement Be A Good Neighbor The Indianapolis Community Requirement—part of the Core Curriculum—ensures that every Butler student gets a taste of what it means to give back to our city. Once you find out how meaningful that work is, you can find dozens of service projects, philanthropy events, and other volunteer activities through the Office of Civic Engagement. Get Involved Student Activities Find Your People There are more than 130 student groups at Butler. We’ve sorted them into 18 categories, including advocacy, culture, faith-based, health and well-being, service, and more.
