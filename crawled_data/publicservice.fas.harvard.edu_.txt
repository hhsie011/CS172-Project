About the Center for Public Service and Engaged Scholarship The Center for Public Service and Engaged Scholarship is the hub and department that provides support for all public service efforts at Harvard College. It is home to academic engagement through the Mindich Program in Engaged Scholarship, student leadership development programs, student professional development programs, and active citizenship efforts through volunteering in the Greater Boston community. The Center also provides resource management, guidance on residential advising, and strategic planning for college-wide civic engagement efforts, leading collaborative programs such as the Global Day of Service, Public Service Recruiting Day, the Scholarship and Social Justice Conference, and the Public Interested Conference.

Today, Phillips Brooks House is a vibrant and growing department offering curricular and co-curricular programs to prepare Harvard College students with the knowledge and tools needed to meet the challenges facing our society. Through coursework, volunteerism, community activism and pre-professional experiences, we offer multiple pathways for students to engage in public service. We work closely with a wide range of partners to ensure that our programs address critical community needs. By participating in our programs, Harvard students can make important contributions to social welfare and develop a strong sense of public purpose and commitment to civic good. We welcome you to the Phillips Brooks House. Please do not hesitate to contact us with ideas, questions and feedback at publicservice@fas.harvard.edu.
