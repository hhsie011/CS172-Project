(Photo by Molly Sharlach) AS AN UNDERGRADUATE, Angelina Sylvain was fascinated to learn that devastating declines in cognition and muscle coordination could be caused by changes in a single gene — the cause of Huntington’s disease. She was intrigued by the fact that brain surgery on an epileptic patient cured him of seizures, but wiped out his ability to form short-term memories. These remarkable discoveries first drew Sylvain to the field of neuroscience, though she never imagined that her own efforts to understand the human brain would involve training tiny worms. A fourth-year graduate student in the Princeton Neuroscience Institute, Sylvain seeks to understand how the activities of neurons in the brain lead to particular behaviors and memories. “The problem with studying the human brain is that we have 86 billion neurons,” she said. “But worms have only 302. And they’re transparent, so you can use imaging techniques to indirectly observe the activities of neurons.” The millimeter-long roundworms, known by the scientific name Caenorhabditis elegans, can be found squirming underfoot in temperate environments. In the lab, they swim in petri dishes and feast on E. coli bacteria. Working with Coleen Murphy, an associate professor of molecular biology and the Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics, Sylvain teaches the worms to associate food with the scent of butanone, a chemical that smells like butterscotch. During the training process, Sylvain tracks the activation of individual neurons as the worms learn to identify and move toward the alluring odor. She uses specially engineered worms in which specific neurons glow green in response to calcium ions, hallmarks of neuron activation. At first, only a sensory neuron lights up when the worms smell butanone. But after the worms learn to associate butanone with a meal, Sylvain can detect the activation of an entire neural circuit — a sensory neuron, an interneuron and a motor neuron. The motor neuron leads the worm to swim toward the scent. By training the worms, Sylvain hopes to answer basic questions about how long-term memories are formed. She plans to examine the numbers and combinations of neurons required to establish memories, as well as the adaptability of memory-forming pathways. By eliminating specific neurons, she can test whether the worms can still form memories, and how the circuits change. Sylvain relishes both the challenges and the rewards of academic research. “Academia offers a fantastic combination of the ability to teach and mentor, and also to ask awesome research questions,” she said. “It’s always a struggle when experiments fail. But when things finally work out, there’s a great sense of satisfaction that you’ve uncovered something nobody else knows.” Coleen Murphy’s research group is funded by the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health. –By Molly Sharlach Share this: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Reddit Print Email Posted in 2014-15, Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics, Molecular Biology, National Institutes of Health, News 2014, Princeton Neuroscience Institute | Tagged biology, C. elegans, learning, memory, molecular biology, neuroscience Post navigation ← Study casts doubt on fairness of U.S. democracy Emotional map illuminates an iconic rock song → Follow Us Most read Egyptian translation highlights the beauty of hieroglyphs How to train your worm to explore the circuits involved in learning Collective behavior could help animals survive a changing environment Let it flow: The ideas, the creativity, the findings, the impacts, the benefits to society Browse by category Humanities Natural Sciences Social Sciences Engineering Undergraduate Research Take our readership survey Discovery: Research at Princeton 2021-22 PDF version Tablet version Request a print copy Sign up for our monthly email newsletter Read more news Follow us Discovery: Research at Princeton is produced by the Office of the Dean for Research Office of the Dean for Research New South 5th Floor Princeton, New Jersey 08544 T 609-258-5500 F 609-258-5599 dfr@princeton.edu Browse by discipline, department, funding agency, student status, and other categories.
