Mason African American Studies is an interdisciplinary program that offers two major tracks and a minor. Located in the College of Social Sciences and Public Policy, the program utilizes faculty from several departments within and beyond the College. African American Studies offers students the opportunity to understand American society and the international arena from the unique vantage point of the African Diaspora, most especially Americans of African descent. Computer Skills Competency All undergraduates at Florida State University must demonstrate basic computer skills competency prior to graduation. As necessary computer competency skills vary from discipline to discipline, each major determines the courses needed to satisfy this requirement. Undergraduate majors in African American Studies satisfy this requirement by earning a grade of “C–” or higher in any course at FSU which meets the liberal studies computer competency designation, though it is strongly recommended that students take either CGS 2060 or CGS 2100 in order to satisfy this requirement. Requirements for a Minor in African American Studies A total of eighteen (18) credit hours are required for the minor, which consists of nine (9) credit hours from the African American Studies core courses, three (3) credit hours of African or African American history, and six (6) credit hours of supplementary courses. A 2.0 GPA average in African American Studies course requirements is required, and students will not receive credit toward the minor requirements for courses in which grades less than “C–” have been received. The nine hours of African American Studies core courses must include: 3 hours of AFA 2000 Introduction to the African-American Experience 3 hours of AFA 3101 Theories of African American Studies 3 hours of AFA 3330 Black Families in America or AFA 4240 African Diaspora Requirements for a Major in African-American Studies African American Studies Major: A minimum of thirty-six (36) hours of coursework is required within the major. Students may not overlap more than 6 hours of coursework used to satisfy General Education requirements with courses used to fulfill major requirements. Students pursuing a Double Major or a Dual Degree may overlap up to 6 hours with another major. Students must select one of three specialty areas: 1) Social Sciences, 2) Literature and Arts, or 3) History, Religion, and Philosophy. In each case, the student selects fifteen (15) hours from African American Studies core courses, six (6) hours of African and/or African American history, plus fifteen (15) hours of elective courses from a chosen specialty area and related supplemental courses. A 2.0 GPA average in African American Studies course requirements is required, and students will not receive credit toward the major requirements for courses in which grades less than “C–” have been received. A minimum of eighteen (18) semester hours in African American Studies major courses must be taken at Florida State University. With the director’s approval, courses offered at Florida A&M University that are not offered at FSU may be used to fulfill the requirements for the African American Studies major. Students may choose to obtain either a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree or a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree. Students choosing to complete a Bachelor of Arts degree are required to demonstrate proficiency in French, Spanish, Portuguese, or Arabic through the intermediate (2220) level, as well complete 9 hours of humanities or history courses beyond those used to satisfy general education requirements. 1.

Diversity and Justice (1). This course integrates African authors, pre- and post-Apartheid, to demonstrate the problems of living in a diverse world. It fosters awareness and acceptance of people different from students through the study of African-American culture, and stimulates an appreciation and respect for people of all cultures. AFA 2000. Introduction to the African-American Experience (3). This course is an interdisciplinary examination of African-American culture and socio-economic status. This course also explores elements of the African Diaspora. AFA 3101. Theories of African American Studies (3). This course engages theories of race discrimination and oppression as it relates to African Americans. Students systematically and objectively examine the sources of American oppression and explore how it shapes the life chances of African Americans from prior to the Reconstruction Era to the twenty-first century. The course explores the timing and manner of their entry into U.S. society, conflicts with other groups, encounters with prejudice and discrimination, as well as the extent to which they have secured access to cultural, economic, political, and social assimilation into U.S. society. AFA 3330. Black Families in America (3). This course explores the social, economic, and cultural forces that have shaped the development of African-American families. In examining historical and contemporary transitions in the structure and functioning of African-American families, special emphasis is given to the bifurcation in the distribution of wealth and power in American society, as well as the role of racial stratification. The course also seeks to empirically examine contemporary policy and political debates on crucial issues confronting African-American families. AFA 3930r. Special Topics (1–3). This course varies with instructor and semester. May be repeated to a maximum of nine semester hours. AFA 4007. Black Political Thought & Social Movement (3).

The course is a comprehensive exploration of Africana political history, ideology and political practice. AFA 4240. African Diaspora (3). This course examines the experiences of Afro-descendant populations around the world in the wake of the trans-Atlantic slave trade. The course focuses on the ways in which Afro-descendant peoples outside of Africa understand and negotiate the lives and the global effects of Blackness. AFA 4358. Culture, Land, and Ecology: A Seminar in Black Environmental History and Politics (3). This course explores the ways that communities of African descent have understood and related to the earth. Specific emphasis is placed on how this understanding and relationship has changed over time due to the socio-historical forces of westernization, capitalism, slavery, colonialism, industrialization, and urbanization. AFA 4905r. African American Studies Directed Individual Study (1–3). Course topics vary by each student. May be repeated to a maximum of nine (9) credit hours; repeatable within the same term. AFA 4940r. African American Studies Internship (3–6).

As students near the completion of formal course work, an internship in the field affords the opportunity to put what was learned to practical use in applied settings, and to develop professional skills and competencies. May be repeated to a maximum of six (6) credit hours.
