California State University (CSU) announced on July 27 that all CSU faculty, staff, and students at any university location must be immunized against the virus that causes COVID-19. The CSU's COVID-19 vaccination requirement allows students and employees to either upload their vaccine record or apply for medical/religious (or personal held beliefs) exemption. Failure to upload a vaccine record or obtain an exemption will result in a hold being placed on a student’s account preventing enrollment in Spring courses. Important: Cal State Fullerton does not defer admissions. If a student is unable to enroll for the admitted term, they will need to reapply for a future term. For more information about the vaccine requirement, please visit the Titans Return website. Save the date, the 2022-2023 Student Housing Application opens on Wednesday, April 6, 2022.
