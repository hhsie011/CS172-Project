The group includes 10 faculty (Steve Clemens, Baylor Fox-Kemper, Meredith Hastings, Tim Herbert, Yongsong Huang, Dan Ibarra, Jung-Eun Lee, Amanda Lynch, Jim Russell, and Larry Smith) and numerous graduate students and researchers, with research spread across the world's oceans and on six continents. A major theme in the group is paleoclimate and paleoenvironmental change. Faculty and students develop and apply sedimentological, geochemical, organic geochemical, and microfossil proxies to marine and terrestrial sediments, and evaluate climate model simulations of the Earth's past, to investigate Earth System History on time scales ranging from seasons to millions of years. Ongoing studies includes investigations of the El Niño Southern Oscillation, monsoon dynamics, orbital forcing of climate and ecosystems, lacustrine and marine biogeochemical cycles, sea surface temperature history, organic geochemical proxy development, continental paleohydrology and paleoecology, and paleobiology. Climate & Environment researchers routinely investigate a variety of modern environmental processes, both internally and through collaboration with the Institute at Brown for Environment & Society (IBES). DEEPS researchers investigate Arctic environmental change, ice sheets and hydrology, atmospheric chemistry and biogeochemistry, and a variety of oceanographic, atmospheric, and terrestrial processes that influence the Earth's climate.
