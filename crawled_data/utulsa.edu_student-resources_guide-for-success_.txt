Close Search / Student Success Resources / Commuter Students Commuter Students STUDENT SUCCESS RESOURCES Stress Relief Time Management Notetaking Goal Setting Test Preparation Academic Strategies Study Methods Study & Learning Apps Incoming Freshmen Transfer Students International Students Veterans Non-Traditional Students Commuter Students Current Students Parking on Campus Register for a parking permit at the Parking & Card Services Office in Fisher Hall. Be sure to bring your driver’s license and proof of vehicle insurance. Registration can also be done online: select “My Parking Account and Registration” on the TU Parking home page (www.utulsa.edu, select “offices & services,” select “Parking”). If you park on campus without a valid permit, you will very likely receive a parking ticket and risk getting your car towed! Organize Your Schedule with Commute Time in Mind Create a schedule with your class times and other campus activities. Be sure to factor in plenty of time for driving – including running into traffic and stopping for gas if necessary. Meeting Others Without the “traditional” college experience of living on campus, commuters may have to take extra initiative to meet and form relationships with others on campus. Making connections with peers may not be as easy as walking down the residence hall floor. Get involved! Get Involved Get involved with organizations on campus to enhance your college experience and create a sense of connectedness. Visit the Student Association website (orgs.utulsa.edu/sa) and the Student Activities website to learn about student groups, leadership opportunities, and local student discounts. Staying Safe on Campus Campus Security offers a free escort service for persons who must move around campus alone at night, such as commuters walking to their vehicles after dark. Call the Security Office at (918) 631-5555 for the escort service. Balancing Life at Home Some commuter students may live with their parents, spouses, or other family members. It may be a good idea to clarify what your expectations are at home (e.g., chores, others’ schedules), since you will be balancing these responsibilities with schoolwork. You may also need to make a point to find time and space at home to study effectively, without interruptions. Student Association Senate Commuters have dedicated representation in the Student Association Senate. The Senate represents the student voice on campus and helps fund student organizations. All students are welcome to attend an SA Senate meeting (Tuesday at 9:00 pm in the law school building John Rogers Hall). Let Senate know what you would like to see done on campus by email at sa@utulsa.edu. Commuter Advocacy and Resource Society (CARS) TU also has a student organization just for commuter/off campus students! Join CARS to get involved, network, and access resources and services specifically tailored for commuter students. The purpose of CARS is to: Promote off-campus student involvement at TU Raise awareness of matters and concerns of off-campus student commuters Provide members opportunities to meet other student commuters through luncheons, meetings, and other activities Build strong social, educational and academic values and promote high academic and professional achievements among its members Provide service to the community and be involved in other charitable activities Find TU CARS on Facebook to see upcoming events and interact with other members! Housing Requirements All first and second year students are required to live in University Residence Halls and participate in a dining program unless they live within a 20-mile radius of the campus and reside with their parent(s) or legal guardian(s). This policy applies to traditional first and second year students, international students, and transfer students. (The requirement is fulfilled by completing two (2) years of residency/dining post high school, not via earned credit hours.) It does not apply to married students, students over 21 years of age, and transfer students (post high school) who have earned more than 60 credit hours at another institution. Request for waiver of this exemption form is required and can be found at https://utulsa.edu/housing-dining/housing-dining-requirement/ (select “To download the exemption request form, please click here.” at the bottom of the page.) 800 S.
