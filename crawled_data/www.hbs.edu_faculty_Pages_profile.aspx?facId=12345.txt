Reimagining Capitalism gets to the heart of what’s wrong with modern capitalism and lays out a pragmatic roadmap for how business can help to catalyze the systemic change we need to build a capitalism that works for everyone. The Business Case for Saving Democracy, HBR, March 10, 2020 Democracy is under attack. Business has both a strong economic case and a strong moral case for coming to its rescue. “Tackling the Big Problems: Management Science, Innovation and Purpose,” Management Science, Forthcoming The Unlikely Environmentalists, Foreign Affairs, April 2020 The Private sector can combat climate change. Mobilizing so called “universal investors” will be key. “Climate in the Boardroom: Struggling to Reconcile Business as Usual and the End of the World as We Know It ,” Daedalus, September 2020 Tackling Climate Change requires Organizational Purpose Rebecca Henderson & George Serafeim - American Economic Review Papers & Proceedings, Forthcoming May 2020 The public debate about how to tackle climate change has been overwhelmingly dominated by the assumption that it can be solved through the adoption of an appropriate pricing regime. This paper argues that while the development of such a regime will be critical to slowing climate change, it is a necessary but not a sufficient condition. We argue that it will also be important to accelerate rates of innovation and cooperation across the economy, and that one important tool for doing this the active encouragement of the development of authentically “purpose driven” organizations. The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Innovation Artificial intelligence promises to greatly increase the efficiency of the economy. But it may have an even larger impact on the economy by serving as a new general-purpose “method of invention” that can reshape the nature of the innovation process and the organization of R&D. This exploratory essay considers this possibility in two interrelated ways. First, we review the history of artificial intelligence, focusing in particular on the potential for recent developments in “deep learning” to serve as a general-purpose method of invention. Second, we consider some of the implications of this possibility, with a focus on both likely changes in the organization of the innovation process as well as the policy and institutional responses that may be required. We suggest that policies which encourage transparency and sharing of core datasets across both public and private actors can stimulate a higher level of innovation-oriented competition and a higher level of research productivity going forward. HBX: Sustainable Business Strategy Climate change. Income inequality. Institutional collapse. Sustainable Business Strategy is a flexible, 3 week, highly-interactive online course designed to provide participants with the tools they need to build thriving businesses while simultaneously playing a major role in solving some of the big problems of our time. Sustainable Business Strategy is offered via HBX, the digital learning initiative from Harvard Business School. Climate Change in 2017: Implications for Business This note provides general information about climate change and its implications for business. Included is an overview of climate change science and a number of its impacts, including rising sea levels, changing weather patterns and extreme weather, pressure on water and food, political and security risks, human health risks, and impact on wildlife and ecosystems. Next, responses to climate change are outlined, including improvements in energy efficiency, moving away from fossil fuels, changes in land use and agriculture practices, and geoengineering. The note concludes with the debate over who should pay and how much should be spent to mitigate and adapt to climate change and the implications for the private sector. Do Managers Have a Role to Play in Sustaining the Institutions of Capitalism? In the latest paper for the Initiative on 21st Century Capitalism, Rebecca Henderson and Karthik Ramanna, professors at Harvard, look to business leaders to ask the important question: Do managers have a role to play in sustaining free and fair capitalism? The authors argue that corporations and their managers have a special duty to maintain the conditions that sustain capitalism when operating in sparsely attended political processes where competing voices are seldom heard. In such scenarios, managers have a responsibility to advance the interests of the capitalist system as a whole, even if this entails acting at the expense of corporate profits. Making the Business Case for Environmental Sustainability Can a business case be made for acting sustainably? This is a difficult question to answer precisely, largely because there is no generally accepted definition of the term “sustainability”. Is it acting sustainably to protect the human rights of the firm’s workforce? To invest in education in local communities? To switch to renewable power? All of these actions might improve social welfare, and some of them might improve profitability but they are very different, and the business case for each of them is similarly likely to look quite different. Here I begin to explore the issue by focusing on a more limited question, namely whether a business case be made for acting in an environmentally sustainable way, which I define as acting in any way that reduce a firm’s environmental footprint.

View Details Research Summary Overview My work focuses on two tightly related topics. I explore why purpose or mission driven firms might be significantly more productive and creative than their more conventional rivals, focusing particularly on the role of trust in building path dependent relational contracts. And I ask whether and how these kinds of firms might be able to help catalyze the systemic transformation of capitalism in ways that could solve the three big problems of our time: climate change and environmental degradation; inequality and exclusion, and political dysfunction. In both cases my work builds on a long standing interest in understanding the drivers of innovation in firms -- and in larger social and political systems. Energy, IT, real estate, and sustainability Professor Henderson’s current research focuses on the energy, information technology, and real estate sectors and the challenges firms encounter as they attempt to act in more sustainable ways. This work is an outgrowth of her decade-long examination of the organizational and strategic issues that well-established companies face in responding to significant technological and competitive shifts across a wide variety of industries, including semiconductor capital equipment, aerospace, branded consumer goods, automobiles, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, information technology, and telecommunications. Her latest work is motivated by the challenge of climate change. If, as current scientific research suggests, it would be prudent to remove 80 percent of the carbon from the economy by 2050, it is critical to find effective ways to support far-reaching change in both products and processes across the entire economy – and particularly in the energy, information technology, and real estate sectors. Increasing the use of carbon-free fuels is an undertaking of enormous magnitude to the energy industry; real estate is perhaps the largest single consumer of energy; and information technology is the most powerful enabler of change throughout the economy. In conducting this new research, Professor Henderson is attempting to leverage the insights she has gained in studying large firms that have been particularly successful in responding to major technological shifts. Her previous work highlighted the importance of simultaneously understanding the strategic barriers to change (“We won’t make any money.”) and the organizational barriers as well (“And we won’t be able to get it done anyway.”); of managing overload so that a firm does not become “stuck”; and of learning to communicate with courage and integrity in order to maintain and grow the “relational contracts” that are fundamental to success. Her current research, including work with two large oil companies interested in investing in alternative energy, suggests that these findings are highly relevant to building a low-carbon economy.
