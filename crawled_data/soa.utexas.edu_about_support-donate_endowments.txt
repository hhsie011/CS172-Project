Endowments are a permanent investment in the School of Architecture. Donated funds are deposited with The University of Texas Investment Management Company (UTIMCO) and the principal is never spent. Rather, annual distributions from the earned interest are allocated to the donor’s indicated area of financial support, while the remaining interest is reinvested, thereby growing the fund from year to year. Establishing a named endowment means your generosity will support the School of Architecture every year. Endowment size is unlimited, and different endowment types have different minimums. All endowment gifts may be paid either outright or pledged over 5 years. To further discuss options for creating a named endowment at the School of Architecture, please contact Luke Dunlap, Executive Director for Development, at 512.471.6114 or luked@austin.utexas.edu, or Garrett Loontjer, Associate Director for Development, at 512.471.8187 or garrett@austin.utexas.edu. The following list details the funding levels for endowment opportunities: Endowed Excellence Fund From $25,000 Unrestricted program endowments, either college-wide or for a certain program, are one of the most important sources of funding as they allow for maximum flexibility. Endowed Undergraduate Scholarship From $50,000 Our undergraduate students are among the best on campus, and scholarships are used to recruit and retain outstanding BArch, BSAS and BSID students. Undergraduate scholarships can benefit just one or all of these degree programs depending on the donor’s preference. Endowed Graduate Fellowship From $100,000 Attracting outstanding graduate students is critical to the success of the School of Architecture. Financial incentives are often the difference in persuading the best candidates to attend graduate school at UT Austin. Named endowed fellowships give the school the resources to attract and retain the best and brightest graduate students. Endowed Presidential Scholarship (undergraduate) From $250,000 The Endowed Presidential Scholarship and Felllowship (EPS/EPF) program was created to provide merit-based scholarship support to the most outstanding UT Austin students. Recipients are selected on the basis of the donor’s original guidelines, plus those of the EPS/EPF program standards. Recipients are awarded a minimum annual scholarship of $2,500. As a symbol of our gratitude, President Hartzell hosts a very special dinner each year for newly endowed presidential scholarship and fellowship donors. At the dinner, the University presents you with a beautiful plaque in honor of your donation. We also hang a copy of the plaque in the School of Architecture.

Endowed Faculty Fellowship From $250,000 These funds are used to support junior faculty members and provide a major incentive in attracting and retaining those who will become tomorrow’s leading teachers and scholars. Endowed Professorship From $500,000 These endowments support outstanding faculty members within the School of Architecture, ensuring that such individuals have the resources necessary to remain at the forefront of their field and to lead teaching and research efforts in areas important to the future of the school. Professorships can be designated for specific programs within the school, such as Community and Regional Planning, for example. Endowed Chair From $2 million Designed to provide resources to scholars of eminent stature and to key leaders of programs, a named faculty chair is the most prestigious endowment a professor can hold. The holder of a named chair holders represents excellence in his or her field and inevitably draws outstanding students to their program, stimulates innovative research, and mentors younger faculty.
