The previous app will be phased out over the course of the semester as UH Parking and Transportation’s shuttle provider, Groome Transportation, fully transitions to the DoubleMap system. To download the new application, visit either the Google play or Apple App store and search “DoubleMap.” University of Houston Houston, Texas 77204 (713) 743-2255 A–Z Index Academic Calendar Campus Carry Policy Campus Map Career Opportunities Directory Emergency Information Get Help Human Resources Library Mental Health Resources Fraud & Non-Compliance Hotline Office of the President Parking Report Copyright Infringement Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Reporting and Awareness Open Records/Public Information Act Texas Veterans Portal Tuition & Fees UH System Virtual Tour ©2022 University of Houston.
