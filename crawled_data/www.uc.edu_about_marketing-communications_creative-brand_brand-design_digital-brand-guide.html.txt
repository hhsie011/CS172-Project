Fonts, colors, etc. described within this document are maintained within the CSS code in AEM, and should never be manipulated or modified without the approval of the Digital Communications team. Digital Logo Usage The all-white, digital version of the logo on a red (or red gradient) field is the only logo permitted on UC's website. The correct logo is included at the top of each page within the content management system, and no other UC logo should appear on a page, per University of Cincinnati Brand Standards. Additionally, no College or Departmental lock-up will be used on the website. (NOTE: Sites or pages using the Legacy [Base Responsive] Template are permitted to continue using the full UC logo until the site has been migrated to the updated template.) On a scroll, the “CINCINNATI” text will be removed, leaving the UC symbol in the top left corner, to the left of College / Department name. Fonts The fonts used within the University of Cincinnati web environment are variations on Open Sans (sans serif font) and Gentium Basic (serif font). Only feature stories within the UC Magazine site and paid campaign landing pages are permitted to use other fonts (ex: for special title treatments, pull quote styles, etc.).
