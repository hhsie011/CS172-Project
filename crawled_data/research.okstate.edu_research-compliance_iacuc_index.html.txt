Every effort is made to adhere to all federal, state, and local laws and regulations that govern the care and use of animals. Specific guidance can be found in the The Public Health Service Policy, the Animal Welfare Act, the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the Guide for the Care and Use of Agricultural Animals in Research and Teaching. OSU has a general policy that applies to work involving live, vertebrate animals. You may wish to review it. We hope these Webpages assist those engaged in activities involving live, vertebrate animals comply with animal welfare laws and regulations. We also hope the information helps you navigate the processes required to meet these obligations. All research, teaching, and testing activities involving live, vertebrate animals must be approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Information provided on this site is designed to help you gain that approval. We look forward to working with you. If you have questions, please contact us at 405-744-3592 or via e-mail at iacuc@okstate.edu. Our office is located at 223 Scott Hall.
