Completing coursework that does not directly apply to the intended major may extend a student’s graduation plan once they transfer to Clemson. In addition to taking appropriate courses, what else should transfer students do to make sure the transfer process is a smooth transition? Students should schedule a meeting with a College of Education Academic Advisor to discuss their desired education program.

The Transfer Course Equivalency List (TCEL) is a tool on Clemson University’s website that contains course equivalencies for approximately 1,200 accredited colleges and universities nationwide. Courses that have previously transferred to Clemson University can be viewed in the TCEL. Students can follow the curriculum outline in Clemson’s Undergraduate Catalog for the degree program that they plan to pursue and take equivalent courses listed in the TCEL. https://www.clemson.edu/admissions/tcel/ Please be advised that the TCEL is only a history of how courses have transferred to Clemson and does not represent a comprehensive list of transferable courses for any school. If students have taken a course that is not showing a Clemson equivalency on the TCEL, it will be evaluated by the Office of Admissions upon acceptance.
