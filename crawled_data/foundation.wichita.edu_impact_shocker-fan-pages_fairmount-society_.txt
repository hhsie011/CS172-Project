Towering over the city, the iconic Fairmount Hall was erected as the main campus building and was a focal point for education in Wichita. Today, Fairmount Society represents our bond to those who give most generously to support Wichita State. Members are invited to the Fairmount Society dinner, the WSU Foundation’s most exclusive event. They are also included in the President’s Club.
