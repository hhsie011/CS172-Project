Outside of solo performances, he has performed with the Ictus Ensemble (Brussels), Ensemble L’Arsenale, zone Experimental, Basel Sinfonietta, New York City Ballet, Ensemble LPR and Orchestra of St. Luke’s. A fierce advocate for contemporary arts, he has collaborated and worked with a wide range of artists ranging from Louis Andriessen, Elliott Carter, Heinz Holliger, G.F. Haas, Helmut Lachenmann, Klaus Lang, and Peter Eotvos to Peter Gabriel, Sting, Lou Reed, Dame Shirley Bassey, Rachael Yamagata, as well as visual artists Vanessa Beecroft, Jack Early, Adam Pendleton and Aldo Tambellini. With a Ph.D. from the University of Huddersfield, his principal teachers were Thomas Demenga, Lucas Fels, Frederik Zlotkin, and Daniel Morganstern. His debut solo album, asinglewordisnotenough (Confront Recordings-London) has garnered great acclaim since its release in 2016, and he has been profiled in The Guardian, 5against4, I Care If You Listen, Musical America, and Strings Magazine among others. Passionate about contemporary music, Ashleigh Gordon performs regularly with the Callithumpian Consort, ECCE Ensemble and Boston Modern Orchestra Project, and has performed and recorded with Switzerland's Ensemble Proton and Germany's Ensemble Modern.
