Circulating and serials collections are available for in-room use to all Poetry Room visitors. Harvard ID holders may check out circulating materials at the Lamont Library circulation desk. Due to space constraints in the Poetry Room, books from the circulating collection are periodically transferred to Widener Library for long-term storage.
