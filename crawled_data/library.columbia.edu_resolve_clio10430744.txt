Columbia University Libraries (CUL) and the Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative (CDLI) are pleased to present in these pages the results of a cooperative effort to digitize and disseminate all available documentation on its extensive cuneiform collection. Jane Siegel, Rare Book Librarian at Columbia’s Rare Book & Manuscript Library, provided the CDLI with a full concordance of the inscriptions, and Los Angeles staff began in March of this year with preparations for its capture. In June, UCLA graduate student Jared Wolfe scanned the collection following procedures discussed in the methods pages of the CDLI. The raw images of that work were processed to CDLI “fatcrosses” and added to the project’s exsiting web content on the text artifacts, including catalogue data and in many cases transliterations. We are grateful to the Andrew W. Mellon foundation for funding that made this successful collaboration possible.
