The major emphasizes familiarity with the intellectual traditions and debates surrounding the concepts of indigeneity, ethnicity, nationality, and race; grounding in both the history of migration and its contemporary manifestations; and direct engagement with and knowledge of the culture, structures, and peoples formed by these migrations. Undergraduate majors in ER&M take courses and pursue research projects that focus on the United States, on other regions of the world, or on global comparisons; and they explore methodologies drawn from many different disciplines across the humanities and social sciences.
