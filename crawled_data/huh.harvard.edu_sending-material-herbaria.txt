Important Notice regarding shipments The shipment of certain chemical and biological materials may be subject to shipping regulations in accordance with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations. Even very small quantities of chemicals that are classified as flammable (such as ethanol), corrosive, or toxic could come under shipping regulations for hazardous materials. This also could apply to shipments of equipment that contain lithium batteries or shipments of common household items that contain hazardous materials (whiteout, nail polish remover, paint). If you are looking to ship a chemical and/or a biological material, or anything else that could be considered a hazardous material, check with our Environmental Health & Safety representative (Chris Caldwell, 617-495-7767, chris_caldwell@harvard.edu) for information and guidance.
