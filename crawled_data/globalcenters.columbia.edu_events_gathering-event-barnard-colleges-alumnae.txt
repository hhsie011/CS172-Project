We cordially invite all Barnard alumnae and current students to come join us, to recall the memories at Barnard, and to share your experiences in life and study. Since its founding in 1889, Barnard has been a distinguished leader in higher education, offering a rigorous liberal arts foundation to young women whose curiosity, drive, and exuberance set them apart. On its leafy four-acre campus on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, its world-class faculty of teacher-scholars educates more than 2,500 inspired and intrepid undergraduate women—women who, as a matter of course, have gone on to achieve great things. Throughout the history, Barnard graduates have made their mark as leaders in the arts, business, government, and science, and as activists for causes too numerous to name. Barnard women change the world and the way we think about it.
