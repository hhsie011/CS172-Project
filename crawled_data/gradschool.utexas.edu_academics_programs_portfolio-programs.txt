Portfolio programs are intended to promote cross-disciplinary scholarship and study by bringing together faculty and students from a variety of disciplines whose interests transcend boundaries of traditional academic disciplines. Graduate portfolio programs require completion of 9-15 credit hours of thematically related graduate coursework (typically 3-5 courses) selected from a variety of pre-determined disciplines/graduate programs. In addition, completion of the portfolio normally includes an independent paper or project related to the student’s work in a given area or a scholarly essay that is presented at a research colloquium attended by faculty and students from the academic disciplines included in the cross-disciplinary area of inquiry. The requirements of a portfolio program may not exceed 15 credit hours. To ensure the effective expansion of cross-disciplinary content expertise, each student’s portfolio must include a minimum of 9 credit hours of content coursework (typically 3 courses) and content courses offered by at least two graduate programs outside of the student's primary degree major. In addition to required content courses, portfolio programs may require one Independent Study Course and/or one Internship course. Master’s Reports, Master’s Theses, and Doctoral Dissertations may be used to satisfy the independent paper/project requirement of a portfolio program; however, these courses may not be used to satisfy the 9-15 credit-hour coursework requirement. Portfolio programs are not degree programs. To be eligible to participate in a portfolio program, students must be admitted into one of the university’s graduate degree programs. If a student’s graduate degree is conferred while their portfolio program is in progress, they may continue enrollment to complete the portfolio under the following circumstances: the student must enroll as a non-degree-seeking student in one of the graduate programs sponsoring the portfolio program, the student must have completed at least two of the courses required for the portfolio at the time that their degree is conferred (a student may not begin a portfolio program after their degree is conferred), the portfolio administrator must request permission from the Graduate School to allow the student to complete a post-graduation portfolio and provide confirmation that the student has completed at least two portfolio courses and, the student may not have a break in enrollment period. A student will not be re admitted for the purpose of completing a portfolio program. Current portfolio programs include: African and African Diaspora Studies Aging and Health Applied Statistical Modeling Arts and Cultural Management and Entrepreneurship Asian American Studies Communication, Information and Cultural Policy Computational Medicine Cultural Studies Digital Studies Disability Studies Dispute Resolution Energy Studies Food-Energy-Water Systems Health Communication Imaging Science Integrated Behavioral Health Interdisciplinary European Studies Language Teaching and Program Coordination Mexican American Studies Middle Eastern Studies Molecular Biophysics Museum Studies Nanomanufacturing Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Native American and Indigenous Studies Nonprofit Studies Robotics Romance Linguistics Russian, East European and Eurasian Studies (REES) Science & Engineering Professional Development Scientific Computation Security Studies Study of Religion Sustainability Women’s and Gender Studies Reporting Form When the portfolio program requirements are complete, the portfolio program coordinator should submit the Portfolio Completion Reporting form to the Graduate School, gradstudentsvcs@austin.utexas.edu.
