Retaliation can take many forms, including sustained abuse or violence, threats, coercion, intimidation and discrimination. Students who engage in retaliation or harassment by any means – including in person, through others or on social media – will be subject to disciplinary action. Retaliation is also a criminal offense under Texas law, and students may face criminal charges. Students who observe retaliation or who are threatened in any way should promptly notify SMU Police, 214-768-3333; the SMU Title IX Coordinator, 214-768-3601; or the Office of Student Conduct & Community Standards, 214-768-4563.
