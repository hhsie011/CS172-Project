The GWLA Reciprocal Circulation Agreement is a program allowing the faculty, staff and students of participating GWLA institutions to borrow library materials on site while visiting other, cooperating, member libraries. This service is especially useful for distance learning faculty and students who live outside the Lawrence area. Elgibility: KU faculty, staff and students in good standing with the KU Libraries (e.g. no lost or long overdue items) are eligible for this program by presenting “valid” identification at a cooperating host library. "Valid" identification will be defined by each individual host library. A small processing fee for a borrower card may apply. Most participating libraries DO NOT charge. Participating institutions are: Arizona State University Baylor University Brigham Young University Colorado State University Iowa State University Kansas State University Oklahoma State University Oregon State University, Corvallis Southern Illinois University Southern Methodist University Texas A&M University Texas Tech University University of Arizona University of Arkansas,Fayetteville University of Colorado at Boulder University of Hawaii University of Houston University of Illinois, Chicago University of Kansas University of Missouri-Columbia University of Nevada Las Vegas University of New Mexico University of Oklahoma University of Oregon University of Southern California University of Texas at Austin University of Utah University of Wyoming Utah State University Washington University, St. Louis GWLA Contacts Contact Acquisitions and Resource Sharing Watson Library Room 210 acqrs@ku.edu 785-864-3960 Services Request articles, books & more Document Delivery Interlibrary Loan (ILL) Retrieve from Shelf TripSaver Home Loan Delivery GWLA Reciprocal Circulation Info for other libraries Watson Library 1425 Jayhawk Blvd. Lawrence, KS 66045 libwebhelp@ku.edu 785-864-8983 facebook instagram twitter youtube Libraries website feedback KU Libraries Find & Access Borrow & Request Locations & Hours Research & Teaching Ask a Librarian Events & Exhibits About Give Nondiscrimination statement Accessibility| Website support| CMS login © 2022 The University of Kansas The University of Kansas is a public institution governed by the Kansas Board of Regents.
