The Hammer Museum is one of three public arts institutions of the School of the Arts and Architecture at UCLA. Originally founded by Dr. Armand Hammer, former Chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corporation, the museum opened in 1990 and featured works from Dr. Hammer’s collections that include old master paintings, drawings, and works on paper. In 1994, a partnership with UCLA was finalized and collections from the university merged with the museum. Today, The Hammer has a reputation for thematic contemporary exhibitions, scholarly historical exhibitions, and contemporary artists’ projects featuring contemporary installations from emerging artists. Participation is limited to 20 people and all participants must show proof of vaccination.
