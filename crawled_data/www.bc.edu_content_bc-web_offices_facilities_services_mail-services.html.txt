Use of a nickname may delay the delivery of their package. There is no need to include "Boston College" in the address, as carriers recognize the street addresses as BC locations. Improper addressing leads to delays in delivery from the carrier and sorting in the BC mail room.

Packages should be picked up in a timely fashion. Students should pick up packages as soon as they are notified that their package is ready for pickup. Students can look up tracking numbers at bc.edu/packages to check whether their package has been delivered to BC and, if it has, to see its current status and location. Mail Services can not accept deliveries of fresh food. Mail Services is unable to accept deliveries of fresh food or other items from sources such as Amazon Fresh, GrubHub, Instacart or any other company that delivers from a restaurant or market. Delivery emails from other companies are misleading Other companies can send notification of delivery while the package is still in transit to BC. Your package is ready for pick up when you receive an email notification from BC Campus Mail. Packages will be released only to the addressee or authorized representative. When packages arrive at Mail Services, an email is sent to the studentâ€™s BC email account informing them of the arrival. Packages will be released to the addressee upon the student presenting the email along with photo identification. If the addressee is unable to pick up their own package, the email and a photo of the ID may be forwarded to a fellow student as authorization to pick up. Packages are not accepted during the summer if the student is not living on campus. Due to space constraints, packages received for students not residing on campus during June and July will be returned to the sender. All student packages will be accepted starting the first week of August. Private couriers are not allowed in residence halls. Delivery agents such as UPS, Amazon and FedEx do not deliver directly to residence halls. All package deliveries for resident students will be routed to the appropriate mail room for processing. Never send cash through the mail. Neither Boston College nor any other courier such as the US Postal Service is responsible for cash sent through the mail. Items of value can be insured through the US Postal Service and others, but that insurance is for merchandise only. Proof of value and other documentation would be needed to make claims. Forwarding service is not available. Due to changes in US Postal Service's policy, forwarding service is not available. Please provide mailers with up-to-date address information when you move or change location so that you can receive your mail and packages. Be sure to include full location and room numbers on addresses. Notify outside contacts of proper mailing address format. In order to decrease the volume of insufficiently addressed and misdirected mail on campus, inform outside contacts to update their mailing information using the Universityâ€™s standard format. The mailroom receives over 100 pieces of mail per week addressed with incomplete mailing information, causing delays and costly inefficiencies. Improperly addressed mail will be returned to sender. All incoming mail and packages should be addressed in the format illustrated in the "Mailing Addresses" section of this page. If you move to a different location, please remember to update your address when you place orders that will be shipped to campus. There are two Amazon lockers on campus. Amazon maintains two pickup lockers on campus for the convenience of the Boston College community. The lockers may be selected as delivery points when placing orders through Amazon. The two locations are: "BENCH" is in the 90 St. Thomas More Dr. residence hall on the first floor "LOPEZ" is across from the Newton mailroom on the lower level of Kenny Cottle Library Mail Services By The Numbers 4 mail rooms on campus 240,000 packages delivered to students during the 2020-21 academic year 10% annual increase in package volume each academic year Back To Top Back To Top Mail Services 617-552-3993 mail.room@bc.edu About Services News & Updates Quick Links ðŸ”’ BIM 360 Ops CRE EagleSpace Facilities Data Hub Facilities Intranet FMApp How To Pages Mobile Contact List PMWeb Shutdown Requests Accessibility Emergency Contact Notice of Nondiscrimination Copyright Â© 2022 Trustees of Boston College
