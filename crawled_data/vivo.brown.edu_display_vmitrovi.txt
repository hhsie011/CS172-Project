Full Text Research Research Overview Professor Mitrovic's research is in the area of experimental condensed matter physics. Magnetic resonance techniques are used to study unconventional superconductivity, low-dimensional systems, quantum phase transitions, quantum magnetism, functional semiconductors, nanoparticles, and topological states of matter. Research Statement Her research interests include study of the quantum phenomena arising in strongly correlated electron systems at low temperatures and high magnetic fields using magnetic resonance techniques. Quantum Magnetism: Microscopic nature of exotic phases that arise in systems with strong spin orbit coupling, where spin is not a good quantum number, and nature of 2D spin-liquids. Superconductivity: What is the role of magnetism and nematicity in establishing unconventional superconductivity? What is the nature of superconducting states formed in fermionic systems with an equal number of two species distinguished by spin? Microscopic nature of superconducting phases in high magnetic fields? Topological States: Role of spin in transport properties of the topological surface states.
