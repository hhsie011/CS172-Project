Our goals revolve around timely sharing of information and a daily focus on service and follow-through. Cornell is proud that the greater Ithaca area is its home community. Community Relations staff works with community and campus leaders on quality-of-life issues including area infrastructure, sustainability, public schools, economic development, transportation, equity, and planning. We serve as coordinating staff for the Collegetown Neighborhood Council, Campus-Community Coalition, and smaller, frequent outreach sessions around Tompkins County -- informal meetings that give residents the chance to talk with Cornell representatives about community-campus topics. Each year through Community Relations’ Town-Gown Awards, we honor proactive campus-community partnerships and local leaders.
