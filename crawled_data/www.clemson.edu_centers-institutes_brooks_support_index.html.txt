Email for More Information Volunteer Do you love the performing arts and interacting with people? We have the volunteer opportunity for you! Our volunteer ushers ensure patrons feel welcome and comfortable at the Brooks Center. Ushers work with the House Manager to seat patrons, pass out programs and scan tickets. Once the audience is inside the theatre our ushers can enjoy the show as well! Opportunities to volunteer range from our morning Tri-ART performances for local K-12 audiences to our evening performances. Ushers must volunteer for at least four events each season and are required to arrive one hour before curtain. We have two training opportunities each August for new and returning ushers. All volunteers must attend one of these training sessions to participate. New volunteers must also complete a background check. If you are interested in becoming an usher, please complete the form below.
