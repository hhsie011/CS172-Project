The work should directly relate to your professional training and course of study within the School of Architecture. GRA APPLICATIONS GRA applications are accepted on a rolling basis. Interested applicants should inquire about available positions with their faculty mentors. Calls for GRA applications are also sent periodically via the School of Architecture student email lists. REQUIREMENTS A GRA must meet the following criteria, per the Graduate School's Conditions for Student Employment: Have a Social Security Number, be eligible to work in the U.S., and have an I-9 on file with HR. Be a degree-seeking graduate student who is making satisfactory progress toward a graduate degree without existing conditional admission requirements imposed by the Vice Provost and Dean of Graduate Studies. Remain registered for at least nine semester hours of course work in the long semesters or three semester hours in the summer. This does not include enrollment in University Extension courses. Maintain at least a 3.0 graduate grade-point average. Successfully pass a criminal background check. For information about how our office of Human Resources reviews criminal history background checks, please visit the Human Resources website. Also, a student must not have more than than two grades of X, I, NC, D, or F in any combination. International students A Social Security Number (SSN) is needed to facilitate employment in the U.S., including student employment, and to file a U.S. tax return. Please refer to the International Office to determine your SSN eligibility and for instructions on how to obtain one. Please note that it may take 4 - 6 weeks to receive your SSN. For more information please consult the Handbook of Operating Procedures 9-2030. DATES OF EMPLOYMENT GRA assignments are made on a per-semester basis. GRA appointment dates are typically September 1-January 15 for the fall, January 16 - May 31 for the spring and June 1 to August 31 for the summer. The appointment dates may vary based on funds availability and faculty need. Graduating international students may not work past the last class day of their final semester due to visa regulations unless they have obtained an extension of work authorization through the International Office. HOURS Graduate students may work no more than 20 hrs/wk in the first two long semesters of study at the university, and no more than 30 hrs/wk in any combination of assignments after the first year. Students may work up to 30 hours during the summer and intersession breaks. International students may work up to 20 hrs/wk during the fall and spring semesters, and up to 30 hrs/wk during the summer and intersession breaks. PAY The range of pay for GRAs may vary based on the duration of the position, student degree progress, and available funding. Students should consult their research supervisor for more information. BENEFITS AND RESIDENT TUITION Students assigned at least 20 hours per week to a single GRA assignment or to a combination of eligible titles (GRA, TA, AI, Assistant (Graduate), etc.) totaling 20 hours per week, and for at least 4.5 consecutive months (usually one long semester), are eligible for basic insurance benefits. Dental, vision, coverage of dependents, and other optional benefits are available at an additional cost to the student and must be signed up for within the first 31 days of employment. Out-of-state resident students appointed in benefits-eligible titles of 20 hours or more are eligible to be charged at the in-state tuition rate and should claim a non-resident tuition waiver online. A graduate student employee insurance orientation is available through UT Learn.
