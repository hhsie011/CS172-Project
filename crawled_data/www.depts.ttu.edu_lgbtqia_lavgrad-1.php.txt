We also have remarks from guest speakers, campus administrators, and others. Each year, the Office also selects two participating students based on their service to Tech's LGBTQIA community and their engaging and inspirational personal stories. These students are honored during the ceremony. The Office also recognizes the recipient of The Ted Jim Dotts, Jr. and Betty Shewbert Dotts Ally of the Year award. This award, selected by the campus community, is awarded to a member of the faculty and staff for demonstrating meritorious effort toward improving the climate, diversity, and inclusivity at Texas Tech University and the City of Lubbock. You can nominate an outstanding ally on TechConnect. Want to learn more about the history of Lavender Graduation? Check out this great resource.
