Motorcycles There is an annual $5 motorcycle registration and permit fee. Motorcycles must be registered with Transportation Services to park anywhere on Dartmouth property. New Employees Prior to the first day of work, new employees should contact Transportation Services via email or call (603) 646-2340 to arrange for temporary parking. Also on our webpage is information under the Green Commute tab about free commuter transit options. New employees who park on campus the first day and have not contacted Transportation Services in advance, should do so without delay to avoid receiving a parking citation. A representative is available by phone and email, 8am – 4pm, Monday through Friday. By the second day of work, new employees will be able to order a permanent parking permit from the online portal. New employees are assigned to the Dewey Lot, where there is a shuttle run by Advance Transit available for rides to and from the core campus and downtown Hanover. Channing Cox, Green, and Thompson parking permits are currently unavailable, but new employee can join a waitlist for each permit type, which is available using the online parking portal.
