In recognition of this ongoing journey, the indomitable spirit behind it, and the incredible contributions of the Black UC family over the past 150 years, the UC Alumni Association is proud to celebrate Black History Month. The UC Alumni Association plays an active role in helping to share and honor the Black UC story while connecting alumni to their alma mater. This work enriches their lives as Bearcats and helps foster an environment in which future generations of Black students and alumni might thrive. Each February, we gather to pay tribute to our past, salute excellence and achievement within the Black UC family, and rejoice in the progress yet to come. Below are some of the signature events and engagement opportunities throughout UC’s Black History Month celebration. Black History Month Events UC Events right arrow down arrow Each year, the University of Cincinnati curates a web page with many Black History Month events sponsored by campus organizations and departments. Many of the events have hybrid or all-virtual options for those who want to participate. View 2022 Event Listings Celebrating 30 Years of the AACRC In 2022, UC’s African American Cultural & Resource Center marked its 30th anniversary.
