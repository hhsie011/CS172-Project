The group largely consists of MCZ Associates and visiting scholars. While the group has no laboratory facilities of its own, arrangements are made with other laboratories in the MCZ and the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology to allow members of the group to carry out experimental work. Current projects include: experimental investigation of nucleotide and enzyme polymorphisms (Janet Collett) and history and analysis of eugenics (Diane Paul). people Questions?
