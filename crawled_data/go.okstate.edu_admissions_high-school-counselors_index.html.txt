Nonresident students have the opportunity to qualify for the Nonresident Achievement Scholarship, a non-competitive award based on GPA and ACT or SAT score. This scholarship is renewable for up to four years with a 3.0 cumulative graduation/retention GPA and at least 28 hours of college coursework earned each year. My students will receive many accolades this year. Should they wait to apply until they can put some of those on their applications? No, we recommend students apply as early as possible, using their current information. They can always update our office later with any additional honors or awards. Many of my students are trying to decide between community college and OSU for their first two years for financial reasons. What are some major benefits to starting at OSU as a freshman? Beginning your college experience at OSU is an excellent choice for several reasons. We require students to live on campus their freshman year, making it easier for students to meet other new students and become involved in OSU's 450+ campus organizations. Students can form strong networking relationships with their professors and others in the community. Statistics also show that most students who start college at OSU will complete their degree here. Please have your student contact their admission counselor for more information. My student wants to change his/her major. How does he/she do this? Students who want to change their major before enrolling at OSU can complete the Change of Major Form in their application portal. They can also email the admission office the following information: Full Name Campus-Wide ID Number Previously-Declared Major New Major Is there a way to waive a student's application fee? Yes.

Starting with the September 2020 national ACT, OSU will accept the official superscore provided by ACT for both admission and scholarship consideration. Do you accept the writing portion of the ACT or SAT tests? No, we do not consider the writing portion of either test. What are the requirements for Cowboy Covenant? Cowboy Covenant is a cash scholarship provided by OSU which is renewable up to four years. Students qualifying for Cowboy Covenant must be fully admitted recipients of Oklahoma's Promise who have filed their Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). This $1,000 award is in addition to any other OSU scholarships for which eligible students would normally qualify. What scholarship opportunities are available for my students? OSU offers both non-competitive and competitive scholarships. To qualify for one of our numerous non-competitive scholarships, a student must complete the joint admission/scholarship application and meet the criteria for the scholarship. Competitive scholarships are offered through our six academic colleges. Information is pulled from the joint admission/scholarship application to help college representatives award these scholarships. How do I get additional information about OSU for my office?
