What is 'enrollment status'? For undergraduate students, full-time enrollment status is defined as 12 or more credits in a regular fall or spring semester (6 or more in a summer term), and half-time status is 6 credits in a regular fall or spring semester (3 credit hours in a summer term). For graduate students, full-time status is defined as 9 or more credits in a regular fall or spring semester (4 or more credits in a summer term), and half-time status is 4 credits in a regular fall or spring semester (2 credits in a summer term). Credit hours related to audit enrollment and correspondence education courses are not counted for certification purposes. I have documents/requests that require the Registrar's signature.

If the National Student Clearinghouse does not have the student's updated enrollment information, the student should find out what information the lender/servicer requires. The lender/servicer may ask for an Enrollment Certification Letter. Often times, the student obtains in-school deferment forms from their lender/servicer to be completed by our office. In both cases, the student will need to complete an Enrollment Certification Request either in person or via email.
