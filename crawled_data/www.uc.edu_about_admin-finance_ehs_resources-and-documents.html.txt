Starting January 13, 2022, the University will use a new, more capable system from On Site Systems that can provide the information we need to manage our complex handling processes in a more improved fashion. This upgrade from the existing 20+ year old Chemical Inventory System is necessary to meet the regulatory and best practice challenges the University is facing and is more reliable and easier to use than the old management system, which is no longer supported by the vendor. Please note that as of Monday, January 10th, CISPro will be decommissioned and no longer accessible as we complete the conversion to the EHSA system. In addition, we will periodically send tips, shortcuts, and tutorials via email for using the On Site Management System that are designed to make the transition even easier. This information will also be available on the EH&S website and Bearcats Landing page. To assist in a smooth transition, we encourage you to view the short tutorials below.
