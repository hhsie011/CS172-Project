Dalton Institute on College Student Values As we navigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, continued racial injustice, and seemingly endless uncertainty, the landscape of higher education continues to shift. The 2021 Dalton Institute on College Student Values will seek to meet the moments in which we find ourselves by considering the role of values-based leadership in times of crisis. With that said, we are excited to announce this year's theme: Reevaluating Our Roots: Values-Based Leadership for Campuses in Crisis. While it will certainly look different from Daltons past, our 2021 Institute will still host a number of educational sessions relevant to the theme, as well as a keynote address and an awards luncheon. title-inside title-centered 2 Connect with Us: Â© Florida State University Tallahassee, FL 32306 FSU Directory Assistance Questions or Comments Privacy Policy Copyright Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube LinkedIn More FSU Social Media
