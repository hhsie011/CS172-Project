Please consult the Graduate Admissions section in this catalog for complete information. Graduate Standing - Classified Classified graduate standing requires a bachelor’s degree in Linguistics or a related field from an accredited institution with at least 3.0 GPA in the major courses provided that a minimum of 24 units of upper-division coursework is included. A student who has not completed the equivalent of one or more of the following courses, as determined by the Linguistics graduate adviser, must enroll in the respective prerequisite course(s). Such enrollment may be achieved concurrently with graduate course work in the program: LING 351 - Introduction to Linguistic Phonetics and Phonology (3) LING 406 - Descriptive Linguistics (3) LING 408 - Syntax (3) LING 412 - Sociolinguistics (3) LING 430 - Historical Linguistics (3) Additional Information These prerequisites must be made up with at least a 3.0 GPA in such makeup coursework. In the event that the student’s GPA in prerequisite Linguistics courses is less than 3.0, six to nine units of probationary, adviser-approved coursework may be assigned. If the GPA in these probationary courses is 3.0 or better, the student may be classified. Some courses taken to make up qualitative deficiencies may be credited toward the M.A. if completed with a “B” (3.0) or better, and if applicable to the student’s particular study plan. Courses taken to remove quantitative deficiencies may not be applied to the M.A. program. Knowledge of one foreign language is required (equivalent of a 300-level Modern Languages course). Students without coursework in a foreign language may demonstrate proficiency by a score of average or better on the MLA-ETS Proficiency Examination for Advanced Students. Work toward fulfillment of this requirement may be taken concurrently with graduate work in linguistics. Modifications of certain prerequisite requirements may be permitted in exceptional circumstances. A study plan must be developed and approved for admission to classified graduate standing.
