Athletic Training Students entering the undergraduate program will be required to complete a graduate professional athletic training program in order to become Board of Certification eligible. A major in athletic training is offered to students interested in working with injury prevention, recognition, immediate care, rehabilitation, health care management, and professional development in a sports medicine environment. Athletic training students have opportunities to gain clinical experience in a variety of sports settings, both on and off campus. Access to the athletic training program is limited by restricting the number of students admitted annually to match the available resources. The admission requirements and procedures for the athletic training program at Florida State University include common entry indicators. The common indicators included in each student’s portfolio will be ranked as follows: FSU cumulative grade point average of 2.5 or better based on at least fifteen hours of FSU coursework (weighted rank of GPA at 50%) SAT/ACT scores (weighted rank of SAT/ACT at 25%) Interview score (weighted rank of interview score at 25%). In order to be eligible for the interview, the student must complete an application portfolio that includes: completion of Technical Standards for Admission, clinical activity log sheets, a résumé, two letters of recommendation, official copies of all post-secondary transcripts, SAT scores, and current enrollment in or completion of ATR 1800. Composite applicant scores, based on the above indicators, are calculated and ranked. The number of athletic training applicants admitted is determined by available vacancies created by graduation. The top-ranking students are then admitted to fill the vacancies. The Athletic Training Program includes a strict didactic and clinical course progression. New student admission is completed by May 31 of each year. New athletic training students enroll in the first block of courses the following Fall semester. Community college students are required to complete the same application process as resident students. Please see the Athletic Training Education Program website for retention policies. Dietetics The purpose of the dietetics degree program is to provide the foundation knowledge and skills required for the didactic component of entry-level dietetics education. This Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND), 120 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 2000, Chicago, IL 60606-6995; (312) 899-0040 (ext. 5400). Graduates of the DPD program may earn a DPD verification statement and are eligible to apply to graduate school and/or post-baccalaureate, accredited dietetic internships. An accredited dietetic internship is required for eligibility to take the national Registration Examination for Dietitians. Careers are available for registered dietitians in clinical, research, community food service management, consulting, and educational settings. The dietetics degree program is a limited access program; students apply spring of their sophomore year. Admission requirements and procedures for the Dietetics degree at Florida State University include: minimum GPA of 2.75, a grade of “S” in DIE 3005, a résumé, and a personal statement. It is highly recommended that students earn a “B” or better in the following: Chemistry I, Chemistry II, Organic Chemistry, and corresponding labs. Once formally admitted, the program is two years. Please see the dietetics web page for more information regarding admission to the degree. The FSU post-baccalaureate dietetic internship (DI) program is the supervised practice component of dietetics education available only to graduate students in the department and is required for eligibility to take the national Registration Examination for Dietitians administered by the Commission for Dietetics Registration. The purpose of the internship is to provide students with supervised practice experiences that train interns for the competencies required by entry level positions in dietetics and nutrition practice. Careers are available for registered dieticians in clinical, research, community food service management, consulting, and educational settings. Fifteen graduate students are accepted annually to the graduate internship program through an internship application process. Exercise Physiology The exercise physiology major prepares students for graduate study in exercise physiology, physical therapy, and other health fields, including medical school, as well as positions as personal trainers and health fitness instructors with both hospital-based wellness programs and corporate fitness programs. Food and Nutrition Science The food and nutrition science major has a strong science base that prepares students for job opportunities in the food industry, government agencies, and careers in the medical field as well as graduate study in nutrition, food science, or agriculture. Computer Skills Competency All undergraduates at Florida State University must demonstrate basic computer skills competency prior to graduation. As necessary computer competency skills vary from discipline to discipline, each major determines the courses needed to satisfy this requirement. Undergraduate majors in athletic training, exercise science, and food and nutrition science satisfy this requirement by earning a grade of “C–” or higher in CGS 2060 or BSC 2010L. Undergraduate majors in dietetics satisfy this requirement by earning a grade of “C–” or higher in CGS 2060.
