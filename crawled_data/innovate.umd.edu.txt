New Technology New Technology UMD-Led Team Creates Novel Material That Potentially Offers an Efficient, Eco-Friendly Advance in Cooling Technology In a development that may open the door to the next big step in refrigeration and air-conditioning technology, scientists at UMD have developed a 3D-printed cooling material that is highly efficient and eco-friendly and sidesteps durability issues previous researchers have faced. Their study was published recently in Science. An international team of collaborators led by Ichiro Takeuchi, a professor of materials science and engineering at Maryland, has developed a more durable elastocaloric cooling material using a blend of nickel and titanium, forged using a 3D printer, that is potentially more efficient than current technology. It‚Äôs also completely ‚Äúgreen‚Äù and can be quickly scaled up for use in commercial devices. Read more about this innovation at "The Future of Cool" from Maryland Today.
