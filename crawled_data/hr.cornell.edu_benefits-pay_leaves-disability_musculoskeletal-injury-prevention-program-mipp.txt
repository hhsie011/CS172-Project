Eligible Employees Benefit Services is committed to employee health and offers ergonomics services at no charge to Cornell employees and departments. You do not have to be uncomfortable or injured to request or benefit from MIPP services. Ergonomics is most effective when services are utilized for prevention. MIPP Consultants The program is coordinated by Todd Baker, OTR/L, CEES, through his company Empowerment Ergonomics, an Ithaca-based team of Occupational Therapists and specialists in health and wellness. Since 2005 Empowerment’s consultants have improved work environments and delivered custom training for thousands of Cornell faculty and staff. Office Ergonomics Consultations An ergonomics consultation is an individual meeting with an expert to identify and remedy ergonomic risks. When needed, we can recommend furniture or equipment solutions and provide follow up assistance for education or adjustments. Your supervisor and/or HR representative will be notified of your request. To Request a Consultation: Simply visit our secure website, create a profile, and complete the brief request form. The MIPP program administrator will contact you promptly to schedule the assessment. COVID-era Virtual Consultations During this period of social distancing, MIPP consultants are also available for video-conference assessments. This can be particularly helpful if you are working from home and are without your usual office furniture and equipment. Don’t hesitate to take advantage of this service before your at-home setup becomes painful. In-person visits for campus workspaces are still available with prior authorization. Cornell’s COVID-19 guidelines are strictly observed for in-person visits. Furniture & Equipment Contact the ergonomics consultants before you buy a new chair or desk. Ergonomics equipment is only effective if it solves your specific problem. That is where the MIPP consultants come in; we help you invest wisely in the right solutions, the first time. Whether a sit/stand desk for a small space, a chair that fits your unique body or a more efficient layout for your department, the details make all the difference. Evaluating potential solutions prior to a purchase will maximize comfort and productivity. One way this is made possible is in partnership with our preferred office furniture suppliers. Contact us to schedule a time to meet in the showroom and try out the latest equipment and develop an ergonomics strategy, before you buy. Group Presentations A one-hour office ergonomics overview during a staff meeting is a fun, educational event that encourages a culture of health and safety. Promote a true wellbeing event for your team by adding individual workstation reviews. COVID-era Virtual Presentations Ergo Webinars are the new group events. Inviting a MIPP consultant to join your virtual staff meeting is a great way to introduce healthy work-from-home ergonomics practices to your employees. Customized Ergonomics Services Departments may request specialty training seminars, demonstrations, and consultations for work groups or for specific projects.
