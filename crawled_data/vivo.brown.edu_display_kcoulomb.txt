A major focus of her research is to re-engineer contractility in the heart after myocardial infarction (heart attack) using engineered human myocardium with cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells. Complex biology underlies the engineering of heart tissue so that it has electromechanical function for predicting toxicity or integrating with the heart electrically and via neovasculature. Dr. Coulombe earned a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Rochester summa cum laude in 2001 and was a Whitaker Predoctoral Fellow, earning a Ph.D. in Bioengineering at the University of Washington in 2007. She was an NIH Ruth L. Kirschstein post-doctoral fellow in Pathology at the University of Washington where she won an NIH Pathway to Independence K99/R00 award in 2012. She was recruited as an Assistant Professor of Engineering and Medical Science to Brown University and started her lab in January 2014.

Full Text PubMed Research Research Overview The focus of the Coulombe lab is to advance heart regeneration and health. We use technologies in tissue engineering, biomaterials, stem cell biology, mechanics, and imaging to understand growth and maturation of human pluripotent stem cell-derived heart muscle cells (cardiomyocytes), cell-matrix interactions in 3D heart tissue, and mechanical properties of engineered cardiac scaffolds and tissues. Leveraging systems engineering, we re-engineer contractility of the heart after heart attack in preclinical models to promote new vessel growth, electrical coupling, and whole heart contractility after engineered tissue implantation, and we advance cardiotoxicity testing in vitro with our engineered human cardiac microtissues. Our long-term goal is to develop functional human myocardium to evaluate toxicity of pharmaceutical drugs and environmental toxicants, to study human disease processes, and regenerate the injured heart.
