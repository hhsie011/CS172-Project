Supportive measures are non-disciplinary, non-punitive individualized services offered as appropriate and reasonably available, without fee or charge, to the complainant or respondent before, during, or after the filing of a Formal Complaint or where no Formal Complaint has been filed. Supportive Measures are designed to accomplish a number of goals: to restore or preserve equal access to the University’s educational program or activity; to support and protect the safety of the complainant, the respondent, the University’s educational environment, and the University community; to promote the goals of Policy 6.4; to deter retaliation; and to preserve the integrity of the investigation and resolution process pursuant to these procedures. Supportive Measures may be issued based upon a party’s request or at the University’s own initiative. In all instances, the University will, at its discretion, determine whether any given Interim Measure is reasonable and appropriate. Potential Supportive Measures include but are not limited to: assistance obtaining access to counseling, advocacy, or medical services; assistance obtaining access to academic support and requesting academic accommodations; assistance requesting changes in work schedules, job assignments, or other work accommodations; changes in campus housing; safety escorts; individualized prevention and awareness training; facilitated agreements to delete consensually-obtained nude or sensitive images; restrictive orders; and “No-contact” orders (curtailing or prohibiting contact or communications between or among individuals). Supportive Measures are available regardless of whether a Formal Complaint has been filed under these procedures. Temporary Suspensions, which may be imposed in extremely rare circumstances, can be imposed only if a Formal Complaint has been filed. Supportive Measures are available regardless of whether the complainant chooses to report the prohibited conduct to law enforcement.
