Located at 2115 Commonwealth Avenue on Boston College’s Brighton Campus, the Brighton Dance Studios are less than a ten-minute walk from the Robsham Theater Arts Center. Dedicated to providing a safe, suitable space for students to train in the art of dance and movement, the Brighton Dance Studios are composed of three rooms; the largest of which is a basketball court-sized dance space equipped with mirrors, a sound system, ballet barres and a coat room. The Brighton Dance Studios also support Boston College’s Theatre Department, hosting academic dance classes, dance rehearsals and movement-related programs.
