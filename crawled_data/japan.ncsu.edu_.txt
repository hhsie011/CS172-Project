Founded in July 1980 under Governor Jim Hunt, the NC Japan Center continues to strengthen the state’s academic, business, and cultural ties with Japan. Its Academic Advisory Board consists of faculty from colleges across the University, providing guidance and direction for academic exchange and development. An external Board of Advisors includes prominent citizens of North Carolina who have a strong interest in Japan and US-Japan relations. Take a Look at our Japanese Language Classes!
