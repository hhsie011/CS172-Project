To narrow down the values that display, start typing the description, then select the desired option from the smaller list that appears. (Note that adding multiple options in a single search criterion will connect those options with an “or” when applying your search criteria.) The % wildcard character can be used in the Course Number and Title fields. To return open sections only, use the Advanced Search and click the Open Sections Only box (at the very bottom). Note that full/closed sections with waitlists will display in the results. Click the Clear link at the bottom to clear out all previous search criteria and start fresh with a new search.
