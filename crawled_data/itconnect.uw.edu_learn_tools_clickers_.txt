Contact UW-IT About UW-IT Classroom Response Systems On This Page Overview Feature comparison: Poll Everywhere and Turning Technologies General FAQ Overview Classroom response systems (CRS) are used within a class to collect student questions and answers to polls and quizzes. The instructor can use this information to determine student understanding, lead discussions, and so on. A number of systems are in use at UW. UW-IT primarily supports Poll Everywhere, a BYOD CRS, but we are happy to provide best effort troubleshooting help for any system. To determine which solution is best for your particular use, review the feature comparison below. Please note: UW-IT does not support TurningPoint Cloud at this time. Please contact Learning Technologies (help@uw.edu or 206-221-5000) to discuss your options.

Is UW-IT still supporting Turning Technologies? Which system should I use? Will I be able to use Poll Everywhere with my Canvas course? How do I get started with Poll Everywhere? Why did UW-IT add a new classroom response system? Survey data from UW students, backed by a resolution from ASUW, indicates that students strongly prefer using personal mobile devices or laptops rather than clickers for in-class audience response activities. Why did UW-IT choose Poll Everywhere? UW-IT partnered with UW faculty and technologists to evaluate several options and selected Poll Everywhere for a pilot. After a successful pilot and in consultation with the Faculty Council on Teaching and Learning and the UW-IT’s Provost-chartered Teaching and Learning Technology Oversight Committee, UW-IT chose to offer Poll Everywhere to UW faculty and students. Is UW-IT still supporting Turning Technologies? UW-IT will continue to provide “best effort” support and troubleshooting for TurningPoint clickers and TurningPoint version 5.4 for faculty who choose to utilize that service. TurningPoint Cloud is not currently available at the University of Washington. Which system should I use? Your choice of tool depends on your particular needs and teaching context. See the feature comparison matrix above to determine which system is best suited to your needs. A number of Classroom Response Systems are in use at UW. UW-IT primarily supports Poll Everywhere, a BYOD CRS, but we are happy to provide best effort troubleshooting help for any system. Can I use Poll Everywhere with my Canvas course? Poll Everywhere supports basic integration features such as importing students from Canvas into Poll Everywhere and exporting grades from Poll Everywhere to Canvas. How do I get started with Poll Everywhere? If you have any questions about or would like access to the UW Poll Everywhere account, please email help@uw.edu with “Poll Everywhere” in the subject line. To get started with Poll Everywhere, go to https://polleverywhere.com and log in with your @uw.edu email address.
