Lawton Distinguished Professor Quicklinks Make a Report Strategic Plan Anti-Racism Resources D&I Student Ambassadors The Student Ambassador Program is dedicated to promoting and developing culturally competent students to serve as role models in support of diversity and inclusion efforts at Florida State University. The Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Office strive to raise awareness about the many ways in which campus residents can positively affect and contribute to the FSU community. Student Ambassadors gain valuable work experience by improving leadership and communication skills and by working with people from diverse backgrounds. The student ambassador program is designed to create opportunities for students to actively engage in activities to advance diversity and inclusion at FSU. The program provides avenues for students to facilitate discussions, provide peer diversity training, and host diversity-related programming. The program’s activities seek to promote understanding and respect among all students, leading to a more inclusive campus. The program will encourage higher education as an opportunity for all people and strive to strengthen the relationships among faculty, staff, students, and the community. It is the mission of the program to help students uphold FSU's commitment to respecting differences, celebrating diversity, and increasing levels of inclusiveness. Members of the Equity, Diversity & Inclusion Office collaborate with staff, student staff, and with diversity experts from across campus to support and improve all students’ sense of welcome, safety, involvement, and success at Florida State. title-inside title-centered 2 For questions or comments, please contact us at diversity@fsu.edu © Florida State University Tallahassee, FL 32306 FSU Directory Assistance Questions or Comments Privacy Policy Copyright Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube LinkedIn More FSU Social Media
