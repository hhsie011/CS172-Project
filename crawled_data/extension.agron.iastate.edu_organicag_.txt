Organic Agriculture involves a production management system based on the ecological principles of nutrient cycling, biotic regulation of pests and biodiversity. Synthetic fertilizers and pesticides are replaced by sunlight-based inputs, such as plant and animal residues. Premium prices for certified organic products drive the immediate economic benefits of Organic Agriculture. Long-term benefits to human and environmental health are also derived through these practices. We encourage you to explore this website and send us your comments or questions. ISU operates an Organic Agriculture Program to provide research information and extension presentations for Iowa citizens through Field Days, workshops and an Annual Iowa Organic Conference every November in Iowa City.
