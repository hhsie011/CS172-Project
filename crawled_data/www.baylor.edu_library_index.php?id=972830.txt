Since that time, founder and curator Sha Towers has grown this nationally recognized collection to nearly 2,000 works representing artists and presses from all over the world. The BBAC serves as a rich resource for all disciplines in addition to functioning as a teaching collection for studio artists and art history. Available for groups, class meetings, individual appointments and research consultations, the BBAC has also welcomed many arts organizations (local, regional, national and international) such as the Waco Calligraphy Guild, The Texas-Mexico Chapter of the Art Libraries Society of North America, the Southwest Calligraphy Conference, and the Lone Star Chapter of the Guild of Book Workers. The collection has also served as the source for campus artist talks from artists from across the country. Examples of disciplines and programs which have incorporated the collection into their curriculum and student engagement experiences include English, History, Museum Studies, Music, Medical Humanities, Graphic Design, Art History, and Studio Arts. The wide ranging collection includes limited edition works as well as many on-of-a-kind artists' books in areas including fine press, poetry, letterpress, photography, literature, handmade papers, textiles, sculpture, and many more expressions of art. See highlights of the collection on instagram @BaylorBookArts. For questions or to see selections from the collection, please contact Sha Towers, Curator of the Baylor Book Arts Collection or visit the Baylor Libraries Arts and Special Collections Research Center.
