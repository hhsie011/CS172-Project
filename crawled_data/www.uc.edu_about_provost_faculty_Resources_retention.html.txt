As important as it is to understand why UC faculty leave, we are also interested in understanding our strengths - why our faculty consider UC a better option when presented with alternatives. To achieve this goal, the Office of the Provost is working with the Harvard University's Collaborative on Academic Careers in Higher Education (COACHE) Retention Survey to contact UC faculty who were extended a job offer outside of UC and declined that offer, instead opting to stay at UC. Notice: Additional information regarding faculty retention, including the Faculty Retention Survey Form, have been moved to UC's faculty/staff intranet, Bearcats Landing. Current UC faculty and staff may log in to Bearcats Landing to view.
