Between July 2020 and January 2021, ground penetrating radar (GPR) revealed at least 667 unmarked burials in Woodland Cemetery on the Clemson University campus. We believe these burials belong to Africans and African Americans with long connections to Clemson's history, including those who were free and enslaved, sharecroppers, tenant farmers, domestic laborers, convicted laborers, and Clemson's early Black wage workers. Space is limited. Tours begin at 12:00pm and run on the hour. The last tour begins at 3:00pm. Register for a tour using this Google form: https://forms.gle/krpo7QxamEXgVaMM9.
