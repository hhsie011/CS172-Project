My expertise covers projects around the globe from the remote Polar region to the Neotropics with an emphasis on interdisciplinary collaborations to understand the complex interactions between ecosystems and climate over centennial to millennial timescales. I particularly enjoy the challenges to conducting research in biogeographical regions where paleodata is still scarce. I conduct optical microfossil analyses including pollen, spores, charcoal, and other non-pollen palynomorphs (NPP) in ice cores and lake sediments, and recently learned black carbon measurements from Lake sediments Short CV Postdoctoral resercher, Desert Research Institute, Reno (10/2019-to date) SNSF Postdoc.Mobility fellowship (SNSF grant P400P2-199285): “Reconstructing biomass burning and fossil fuel emissions from New Zealand lake sediments using established and novel fire proxies: Atmospheric effects of late 13th century Maori settlements.
