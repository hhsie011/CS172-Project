The new administration’s emerging policies are a threat to the rights of women, Afro-Brazilians, the LGBT community, indigenous peoples, and other vulnerable Brazilians and crucially to the very idea of rights-based rule of law democracy. On Friday, April 5 the Rio Global Center will host an event at Columbia to highlight Columbia faculty research and expertise on the state of human rights law, culture, and social policy in Brazil. Faculty from a variety of disciplines will present their research and engage in discussions with a Brazilian federal judge and a Brazilian activist. The event will feature: Mylene Ramos, Federal Labour Court Judge (Brazil) and Columbia Law School alum - speaking on "Representation of Race in Brazilian Culture: Inequality in Brazil from a Legal Perspective" Amy Chazkel, Associate Professor of History - speaking on "Brazilian Inequality Today in Historical Perspective" Valerie Purdie-Greenaway, Professor of Psychology - speaking on "Gender Bias and Inequality" Rodrigo Soares, Professor of Brazilian Public Policy - speaking on "Social Policy to Address Inequality in Brazil: What Lies Ahead?" Anderson França, noted Brazilian activist currently exiled in Portugal - speaking on "Resistance: Brazilian Human Rights Activists Under Threat" Mylene Ramos Mylene Pereira Ramos Seidl has been a Federal Labour Court Judge since 1994. During the last 3 years she was District Judge of the Labor Court of the South Zone of São Paulo, the first one with 20 completely electronic Divisions in the country, having 5000 users on average on a daily basis. Mylene also devotes time to causes such as civil and women rights, discrimination, diversity and corporate social responsibility. In 2016, she lectured on a TEDx section in São Paulo, called "Inspiring Women", on the lack of racial diversity in the Judiciary.
