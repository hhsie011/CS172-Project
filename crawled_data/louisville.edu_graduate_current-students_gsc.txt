The GSC is an organization made up of all nonprofessional graduate students. All students who are getting a graduate degree other than a MD, DMD, JD, MBA, or MEng are members of the GSC. The GSC is comprised of executive officers and representatives from each department in the Graduate School. GSC helps set policies and creates programming to support all graduate students at the University of Louisville. Get Involved with GSC GSC representatives are your fellow graduate students, both Master's and Doctoral. The responsibility of representatives from each department is to attend GSC meetings (held monthly) and communicate with fellow students within their respective departments. GSC meetings are held to update students on important information pertaining to them, to discuss graduate concerns, and to improve the graduate experience at UofL. The representatives and officers on the council allocate funds to best serve graduate student's needs at UofL by offering travel grants, research grants, and planning events for graduate students, like our annual Halloween Party. Talk to your department about becoming the GSC representative for your unit. Check out the current list of representatives here.
