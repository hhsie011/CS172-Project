SMU offers several programs aimed at promoting workplace flexibility. Available alternative work schedules may include flextime and/or flexspace (telecommuting) if the manager and employee agree on a schedule and monitor its effectiveness. For some employees and managers, jobsharing may also be a viable option to a traditional full-time job. The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) grants eligible employees the right to take 12 work weeks of job-protected leave over a rolling 12-month period for specific reasons. Follow the appropriate link to the right for more information about these programs. The University also offers several programs to support our staff and faculty with specific family needs as well as numerous cultural, educational, and recreational programs offered at a discount to employees and their families. Staff Bereavement Leave Benefits-eligible employees are eligible for up to three days of paid bereavement leave in the event of the death of a family member. A family member is defined as the employee’s spouse, certified domestic partner, mother, father, stepparent, son, daughter, stepchild, brother, sister, grandparents, grandchildren, in-laws, aunt, or uncle. For additional information please refer to 7.18 Staff Bereavement Policy.
