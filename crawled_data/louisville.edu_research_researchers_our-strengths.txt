What are "Grand Challenges?" To us, Grand Challenges are big, global problems we, the UofL community, can help solve through multi-disciplinary research, scholarship, innovation and partnerships. At UofL, our Grand Challenges are Empowering Our Communities, Advancing Our Health and Engineering Our Future Economy. These Grand Challenges: are broad areas with countless lines of inquiry; can be positively influenced through multidisciplinary solutions; build on UofL’s strong existing expertise and infrastructure; and will differentiate UofL as a leader in global innovation and change. UofL is ready to take on these challenges. We are equipped with a robust infrastructure – by way of equipment, facilities and capable, curious people passionate about solving these problems. We are ready to translate their research and its findings into solutions for public benefit. And we are ready to build strong, meaningful partnerships that cross disciplines, industry and communities in the name of making our world a better place to work and live.
