ICAP works with local community-based organizations, religious leaders, and advocates to promote community awareness of and engagement with the research studies. Led by Wafaa El-Sadr, MD, MPH, MPA and Jessica Justman, MD, this work is supported through the ICAP at Columbia University Clinical Trials Unit (CTU). The ICAP CTU aims to support the design and implementation of research to address gaps in the global HIV response, including through clinical research sites in the Harlem, Bronx, and Eswatini. The Community Advisory Board (CAB) for the ICAP Clinical Trials Unit (CTU) provides guidance and feedback on proposed studies, outreach strategies, feedback on study materials, and information regarding community perceptions of the potential or current research studies. Current studies include investigations of antibody-mediated prevention using broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) to prevent HIV or COVID-19, an injectable long-acting pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) option, mobile technologies to improve PrEP adherence, integrated care for people who inject opiates, HIV vaccine studies, and studies of COVID-19 immunity, vaccine efficacy, and treatment among others. Through Columbia University, ICAP also supports additional COVID-19 surveys and various student fellowship programs, engaging students to participate in the design, implementation, and evaluation of ICAP-supported programs while working side-by-side with its experts.
