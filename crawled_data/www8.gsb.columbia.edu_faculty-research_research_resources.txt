Detailed information about the Research Grid can be found at the ITG Research Computing website or by contacting Research Support. Databases The University, the School, the Libraries, and Centers have collected and purchased a wealth of data that can help faculty to address many research questions across disciplines. Issues pertinent to School databases are dealt with by the School's Databases Committee. The University’s Watson Library of Business and Economics provides access to nearly 100 electronic data sources for faculty and student use. See a listing of all data sources available through the libraries. The Wharton Research Data Service (WRDS), available through the Watson Library is comprised of more than two dozen data sets. See a detailed listing of these data sets including explanation of sources and field descriptions. The Centers and Programs at Columbia Business School often acquire data sets for faculty and student use. These data sources are often stored on restricted servers, but access for research purposes can be arranged by contacting the director of the Center or Program in question. Faculty members and doctoral students who would like to request access to a database not currently available at Columbia Business School should follow the procedure outlined in the Policy for Requesting New School-Funded Databases.
