We offer a creative outlet for students, faculty/staff, and community members via non-credit courses in the arts. Through our weekly classes and frequent workshops, we provide the opportunity to learn new skills, explore a topic, or pursue a creative passion. In addition, we serve as a creative partner for student groups, campus organizations, and departments by offering a physical space and environment for people to come together and create. We encourage people to engage individually and as a team with different modes of perception and expression. Our Sponsors Adele H.
