The list will be held static for at least three years, supports the current Collective Impact Strategic Plan, and serves as a primary resource during the development of the next UCF Strategic Plan. The selection process for new peers began by identifying a large pool of institutions using nationally published rankings and classification data. Next, the institutions were grouped using cluster analysis methods that considered factors including surrounding population, student body, faculty and financial characteristics, among others. This cluster analysis was performed as an iterative process, allowing for careful consideration at each step. Finally, administrative input was considered and the list was finalized. This list of peers is maintained by IKM and is submitted to IPEDS for use in the annual Data Feedback Report.
