This unique partnership between Texas Tech and South Plains College allows students to live and take classes on the Texas Tech campus. Participants co-enroll at Texas Tech University and South Plains College for their first semester. Upon successful completion of the program, students are then automatically transferred into Texas Tech University. Students will enroll in 13 credit hours (12 hours of South Plains credit and 1 hour of Texas Tech credit). Students receive additional support by attend advising appointments, study hall hours and seminars. Students who successfully complete all 13 credit hours with a 2.5 GPA or higher will be fully admitted into Texas Tech as transfer students for the spring semester.
