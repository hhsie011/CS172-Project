Breadcrumb Home AIISP A unique sense of community Akwe:kon (pronounced "ah-GWAY'-gohn") is the first university residence hall in the country purposely built to celebrate North American Indigenous heritage. In the Mohawk language, Akwe:kon means "all of us." The spirit of this Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) word is reflected in the inclusiveness that Akwe:kon offers to its residents and the wider community. Akwe:kon's presence on campus goes beyond the beauty of its architecture, acting as a center for activities and events that emphasize the philosophies, values and traditions of many Indigenous cultures. Explore Akwe:kon Programming & events At Akwe:kon, we host many programs and activities throughout the year. Most of our programs are student initiated and led, with planning assistance from faculty and staff. Akwe:kon offers off-campus programs and events, such as visits to Indigenous communities in the region to supplement our on-campus programming. Our programming is always evolving based on student interest. Explore the wide array of events offered each year at Akwe:kon! Engagement & community outreach We are committed to provide opportunities for our community members to display and gain leadership experience, as well as teach students the importance of reciprocity. House resources Along with community engagement and programming on campus, Akwe:kon offers a number of resources for live-in students as well as to its community of out-of-house members.
