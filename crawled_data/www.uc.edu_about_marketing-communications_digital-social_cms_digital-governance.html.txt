Digital Governance enables responsiveness by clarifying roles, responsibilites, and connections for a collaborative team. It is the basis of our distributed content and centralised support model. Our goal as a team is not to create a digital silo, but to empower users to take ownership and make responsible decisions regarding their own content. Why is Digital Governance important? Poor digital governance exposes the University of Cincinnati to risk and liability. Good digital governance will make us more effective in achieving our business objectives.
