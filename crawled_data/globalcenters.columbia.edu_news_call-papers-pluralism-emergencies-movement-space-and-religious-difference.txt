Thinking of pluralism as a technology of power that helps to organize people and their interactions, and often articulated with special attention to religious difference, this conference will address how pluralism becomes activated in emergency situations and is utilized in different ways and towards different ends. This conference series is a joint effort by the Columbia Global Centers in Amman, Istanbul, and Tunis, the Centre for Religion, Conflict and the Public Domain and the IRCPL in New York. The conference will take place in Amman on Wednesday, December 6 and Thursday, December 7, 2017. A full conference program and papers will be provided in advance of the conference. The organizers will cover the cost of airfare and hotel accommodation for all invited participants. The working language of the conference is English. Abstracts should be written in English and no longer than 250 words. They should be titled and have all requisite bibliographic citations. Along with the abstract, please include a detailed, recent Curriculum Vitae/resume (no longer than 3 pages). Abstracts will be evaluated according to the following categories: originality of theme, clear data and methodology, clarity and relevance of the proposal to the conference theme, and contribution to the conference theme. To submit your abstract, please send them to [email protected] with the subject line of the email titled “Religion and Pluralisms Amman,” by July 16, 2017.
