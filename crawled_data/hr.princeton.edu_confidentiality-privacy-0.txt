HR adheres to Princeton’s policies, guidelines, collective bargaining agreements, and state and federal regulations regarding confidentiality and privacy, including but not limited to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for medical information; Information Security Policy for all data; Rights, Rules, Responsibilities; Policy on Discrimination and/or Harassment; Policy on Disability and Accessibility, Reporting Potentially Illegal Activity; and others that may require disclosure of information under certain specific circumstances. HR believes that expectations regarding the confidentiality of conversations between HR staff members and employees should be discussed and clarified up front. All parties must realize that if anything is mentioned that would put the University or employees at risk or violates University policies or law, appropriate steps will need to be taken that might include divulging what was discussed between HR staff and employees. In such situation, this will be done with great care and respect for the individual and addressed on a case–by–case basis.
