Ewing Professor and Robert R. Berg Professor in Geology Texas A&M Presidential Impact Fellow rce@tamu.edu (979) 845-2089 Halbouty 261 Research Ryan’s research aims to understand the evolution of landscapes and the sedimentary record through physical processes operating at the surface-atmosphere interface of Earth, Mars and Titan (a moon of Saturn). His current research themes include (1) development of patterns in wind-blown landscapes and bedform self-organization in the rock record, (2) the role of wind-blown systems at critical climatic and biologic transitions in Earth’s history, (3) Biosignatures in eolian systems, (4) hydrodynamics for provenance studies, (5) science operations in fluvial-eolian planetary analog environments, (6) geotechnical site characterization for in-space construction and engineering. Ryan uses fieldwork, remote sensing, laboratory experiments, numerical modeling, and radiogenic and stable isotope geochemistry to explore his science goals. He has active field work in Texas, New Mexico, Utah, South Australia, and Iceland. Selected Publications *Swann, C., Sherman, D. J., & Ewing, R. C. (2019).
