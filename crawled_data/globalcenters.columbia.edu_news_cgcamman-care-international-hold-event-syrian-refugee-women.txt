By Jordan News Agency (Petra) March 29, 2022 Amman, Mar. 29 (Petra) -- The Columbia Global Centers in Amman (CGCAmman) and CARE Middle East and North Africa (MENA) on Monday co-organized a virtual panel discussion titled "Syrian Refugee Women Navigating Work in Protracted Crises" to mark both International Women’s Day and 11 years of the Syrian Crisis during the month of March. During the webinar, which was moderated by Professor Monette Zard, Associate Professor of Forced Migration and Health at Columbia University, experts from the humanitarian and academic sectors shared their insights and perspectives on women’s economic empowerment with calls to lifting barriers to their employment, increasing humanitarian funding for the Syria Crisis across the MENA region and including refugee women in the policymaking processes, according to a statement by Care International. The speakers examined the impact of policy decisions on Syrian refugee women’s livelihood opportunities, and the limited impact of job creation investments. They also explored how to include refugee women more actively in the policymaking processes and the ensuing necessary programs and policy shifts. "Since the beginning of the conflict many men have died, disappeared, been forced to migrate or have been injured during the war. 22% of Syrian households are now headed by women. Not only do women bear the burden of household responsibilities, but they also have an additional role to play: that of the ’provider’s’ for their family. CARE works on innovative solutions to help women overcome existing barriers to employment and livelihoods opportunities. With the right tools and knowledge, Syrian refugee women in Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey as well as inside Syria, can navigate various uncertainties and become more self-reliant." said Nirvana Shawky, CARE MENA Regional Director, during her intervention. "In addition to their roles as caregivers, Syrian women have entered the workforce in much greater numbers. Some Syrian women have been able to establish home-based businesses, while others (17,626 or 23.9% of total permits issued) have obtained flexible work permits. Others find employment in the informal sector, where they have fewer protections. Refugee women are increasingly becoming primarily responsible for the resilience of their families and communities in all aspects of their lives and have also gained new decision-making power, confidence, and independence along the way," emphasized Carolyn Ennis, Deputy Representative to the UNHCR in Jordan. Drawing on her personal experience, Dr. Lina Zoabi, Alumni Fellow at Columbia University’s Mellon Fellowship Program for Emerging Displaced Scholars, and PhD candidate of English Literature at Karabuk University, said: "As a Syrian refugee myself, I know that women refugees in Turkey often work in blue-collar jobs, but these job opportunities are irregular and limited. Proficiency in the Turkish language, a lack of technical and vocational skills, childbearing duties and cultural norms are additional barriers that humanitarian agencies need to address by adapting programming to enhance livelihoods capacities."
