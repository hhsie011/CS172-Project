He works at the Center for Evidence Synthesis in Health, where he is Assistant Director of the AHRQ-designated Brown University Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC). Before coming to Brown in January 2018, Ian was on the Faculty of the Department of Epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland, where he worked at Cochrane United States, the Cochrane Eyes and Vision US Satellite, and the Johns Hopkins Center for Clinical Trials and Evidence Synthesis. Ian is an elected member of the Society for Research Synthesis Methodology. His research focuses on the use of outcomes in comparative effectiveness research (clinical trials, systematic reviews, and other studies), methods and technology for research synthesis, and methods for research prioritization. Clinical area-wise, Ian's work has addressed ophthalmology (especially ocular surface disease), women's health, HIV/AIDS, and other areas. Ian also has experience teaching evidence synthesis- and epidemiology-related courses and workshops at graduate and udergraduate levels.
