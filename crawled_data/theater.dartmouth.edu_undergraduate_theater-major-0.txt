PreviousNext ABOUT THE MAJOR Theater Majors take a minimum of ten courses divided between theater practice (acting, directing, design, dance, stage management, technical production, and playwriting) and theater studies (the history, criticism, and theory of theater and performance). They are also required to fulfill five production requirements that reflect a variety of theatrical activity, demonstrating an active and sustained participation in theatrical production. One production credit must be fulfilled by serving as a stage manager or assistant stage manager for a mainstage production. Students interested in majoring should familiarize themselves with course and production requirements as well as the department's course offerings and descriptions. To help you with your planning, you may also wish to use our Theater Major Worksheet. Students intending to pursue a Theater major must meet with the Chair to discuss their planned course of study previous to submitting a plan in DartWorks .Upon declaring as a theater major, you will be assigned a faculty advisor who will work with you to determine how to best maximize your opportunities at Dartmouth and achieve your artistic and career goals. Students may also be double majors. In addition to theater, past students have majored in English, Neuroscience, Physics, Environmental Studies, or Linguistics. Although a double major calls for careful organization and planning, your advisor will serve as a helpful resource in this process. For more information on our major requirements, please contact our Academic Coordinator.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of Theater Undergraduate Overview Equity and Inclusivity Peer Advisors and Student Representatives The Major Major Requirements Honors Thesis The Modified Major Modified Major Requirements Modifying another Major with Theater The Minor Minor Requirements Courses: offerings by term Course Descriptions Instructor Permission Courses Independent Study Off-Campus Exchange National Theater Institute For Prospective Students Onstage Overview Get Involved Performing and Auditions Directing and Designing Playwriting Stage Managing The Scene Shop The Costume Shop Now Onstage: Upcoming Productions Season Archives: Past Productions Production Photos About Student Productions Workshops and Full Productions Studio Lab: Exploring Theatrical Boundaries YourSpace: Performance Spaces for Creative Minds Student Work in the time of COVID About MainStage Productions Opportunities Overview Summer Theater Lab: Cultivating New Work VoxLab Frost and Dodd Play Festival New York Theatre Workshop Residency The VOICES Program Experiential Learning with Northern Stage Testimonials Student Funding Opportunities Kingsdale Fund Need-Based Funding Goldner Mini-Fellowship Other funding opportunities Funding for Graduate Studies Internships, Fellowships, and Graduate Programs The Neukom Institute Literary Arts Award in Playwriting Foreign Study News & Events All News and Events MainStage Production News Student Production News Honors Thesis Productions Summer Theater Lab News Faculty News Student News Visiting Artist News Alumni News People Faculty and Staff Visiting Artists Alumni Tell Us Your Story Theater and Performance Studies My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
