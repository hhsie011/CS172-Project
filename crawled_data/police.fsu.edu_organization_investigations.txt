As part of a comprehensive law enforcement effort, the university has established a very effective investigations team to solve crimes, and prevent repeat offenses. The Investigations Section of the Florida State University Police Department conducts criminal and administrative investigations into alleged violations of law or the Student Conduct Code that occur on university property, or within it’s statutory jurisdiction. In cooperation with other local and state agencies, the FSUPD also has authority to conduct investigations in other areas of Leon County, and beyond, when the need arises. The Investigations Section routinely works with the Tallahassee Police Department, Leon County Sheriff’s Office, Florida Department of Law Enforcement, and various other state and federal agencies. The Section also works closely with the Office of the Victim Advocate, Office of Student Rights & Responsibilities, and the Office of Audit Services. Additionally, the Section conducts pre-employment background investigations on police officer candidates, and provides protection to visiting dignitaries and controversial public figures. The Investigations Section is currently staffed by six Investigators, and is supervised by: Lieutenant Gregory McSwain Phone: (850) 644-0722 Email: gmcswain@fsu.edu title-inside title-centered 2 FSUPD Headquarters Florida State University Police Department 830 West Jefferson Street PO Box 3064215 Tallahassee FL, 32306 Map Location P: (850) 644-1234 F: (850) 644-3205 FSUPD Panama City Florida State University Panama City 4750 Collegiate Drive Panama City FL, 32405 Map Location P: (850) 872-4250 F: (850) 770-2721 Transportation & Parking Services 104 N.
