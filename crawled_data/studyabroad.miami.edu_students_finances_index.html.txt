How Much Does It Cost to Study Abroad? The cost of studying abroad varies depending on the type, length, and location of the program. Each program page shows the estimated costs of the program and what is included in the program fee, if applicable. Below is a summary of the types of costs you can expect from each type of program. UPrograms Students participating in UPrograms pay regular UM tuition. In addition, students pay a program fee to cover housing and program activities. Students must also budget for passport, visa, transportation, books, personal expenses, and travel. Total program costs range from $3,000 less than a semester on campus at UM to $3,000 more than a semester on campus at UM, depending on the cost of living and the duration of the program. UM Partner Programs Students participating in semester or year exchange programs pay regular UM tuition. Housing is paid directly to the host university or housing provider, and meals are typically budgeted according to eating in cafeterias, cooking meals at home, or eating at restaurants. Therefore, the housing and meal costs vary depending on the location of the host university. Students must also budget for passport, visa, transportation, books, personal expenses, and travel. Total program costs range from $3,000 less than a semester on campus at UM to $6,000 more than a semester on campus at UM, depending on the cost of living and the duration of the program. Faculty-Led Programs Students on faculty-led programs pay regular, per credit UM tuition in addition to their regular spring and fall term charges.

Non-UM Programs Students who choose to study abroad on a non-UM program pay a $1,000 fee during each semester of the program. This charge will appear on the studentâ€™s account after the proper forms have been submitted. The Non-UM program form is found here. Students then pay their study abroad program costs directly to the organization or institution. Personal Expenses Personal expenses such as local transportation, entertainment, communication, and laundry depend on the program length and location. Student expenses will vary according to individual spending habits and travel. Expenses may also increase or decrease depending on the exchange rate at the time of study, and can dramatically affect the cost of studying abroad. For information on exchange rates, visit www.xe.com or www.oanda.com. Passport and visas fees should also be considered when planning your study abroad. For more information on passports and visas, please click here. Will I Be Able to Use My Financial Aid Abroad? Students participating in a UM study abroad program will be able to use their financial aid for the program. You will be charged full tuition on your tuition bill for the semester during which you will be abroad, so your aid package will not be affected. While overseas, if you have specific questions, you should contact the Office of Financial Assistance Services directly at ofas@miami.edu. The University of Miami does not offer financial aid for students attending institutions under a non-UM study abroad program. What if something changes after I am accepted and I do not study abroad? You may be financially responsible for the program; this depends on the type of program, and how far in advance of the program start date you withdraw. You can see the full withdrawal policy, timeline and fees here.
