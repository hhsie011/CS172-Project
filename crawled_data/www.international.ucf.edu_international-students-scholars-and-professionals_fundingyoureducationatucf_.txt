Please refer to the Scholarship page on their website to obtain more information. Within their website, you can also find Scholarship Resources and other important information for International Students. We also recommend checking with the government of your home country to see if they offer scholarships or other programs for aid in order to study abroad.

Unfortunately, the federal government does not have any specific financial aid programs for undergraduate international students.

Established under Florida Statute 288.8175, linkage programs are enabled to award out-of-state tuition waivers to citizens of qualified countries. The purpose of the tuition fee exemption program is to provide international students attending any institution of the State University System of Florida the opportunity to pay in-state tuition rates.

UCF GLOBAL HARDSHIP TUITION WAIVER UCF Global has a limited amount of funds available to assist undergraduate international students facing unexpected and temporary financial hardship. The UCF Global Hardship Tuition Waiver is applied toward the “out-of-state” portion of tuition. Undergraduate international students are notified of the application procedure to their Knights email account approximately one month prior to the fall and spring semesters. A committee reviews complete applications and awards funds on a case-by-case basis to undergraduate international students who can document the temporary hardship. Funds are limited and it is not possible to receive full tuition coverage. While the waiver can generally be received only one time during the student’s academic career, exceptions may be made due to extenuating circumstances. ABOUT UCF Global is on a quest to transform lives by providing access to high impact, international experiences across the UCF and global community with a commitment to excellence in partnership, innovation, and services.
