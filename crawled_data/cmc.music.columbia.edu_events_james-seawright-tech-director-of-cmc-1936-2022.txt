Alice Shields writes: In addition to being one of the foremost technological artists since the late 1960s with works in the permanent collections of MoMA, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum, and professor and director of visual arts at Princeton until his retirement in 2009, Jim was Technical Supervisor at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center from 1963 to 1969, which is where I met him. Through his creativity in both engineering and the arts, his intelligence, kindness, humor and imagination, Jim was an important influence on the technical and artistic quality of the Center under the direction of Vladimir Ussachevsky, in addition to the superb work of engineer Virgilio de Carvalho and founding engineer Peter Mauzey. I and Pril Smiley were instructors and associate directors of the Center. Jim was a delight to work with and is fondly remembered.
