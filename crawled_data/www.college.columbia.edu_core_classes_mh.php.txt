The specific goals of the course are to awaken and encourage active, critical, and comparative listening practices, to provide tools to respond verbally to a variety of musical idioms, and to create engagement with the debates about the character and purposes of music that have occupied composers and musical thinkers since ancient times. Like Art Humanities, Music Humanities evolved from the Humanities B optional music and fine arts requirement of 1937.
