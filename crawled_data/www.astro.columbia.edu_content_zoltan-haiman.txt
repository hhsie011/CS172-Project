He held postdoctoral positions at Fermilab and at Princeton University. His research interests are in topics in theoretical astrophysics and cosmology, including the formation of the first stars and black holes, the subsequent growth of black holes, mergers between black holes and corresponding electromagnetic and gravitational wave signatures, and determining the nature of dark energy and dark matter using large Astronomical surveys, especially through weak gravitational lensing. Prof. Haiman is a recipient of NASA’s Hubble Fellowship, a Gyorgy Bekesy Fellowship from the Hungarian Ministry of Education, a NYAS Blavatnik Award for Young Scientists (2010) and a Simons Fellowship in Theoretical Physics (2016). He was named in 2002 as one of the Brilliant 10 young scientists by Popular Science magazine. He is currently serving on the Science and Technology Deﬁnition Team (STDT) for NASA’s concept study for the X-ray satellite Lynx; he is an ESA-appointed member of the LISA Science Group, where he co-leads multi-messenger astrophysics efforts, and a NASA-appointed member of the NASA LISA Study Team. He has published over 250 peer-reviewed publications, and while on on the Columbia faculty, he has mentored 16 Astronomy and Physics PhD students, of whom 6 have gone on to faculty positions to date. Research Topics cosmology, galaxy formation, supermassive black holes, gravitational wave astronomy, weak gravitational lensing Grad Students Brian Lu, Luke Krauth (Physics), Chengcheng Xin, Matthew Scoggins Postdocs Jordy Davelaar, Kung-Yi Su Department of AstronomyColumbia University, Mail Code 5246, 538 West 120th Street, Pupin Hall, Rm 1328 · New York, NY 10027 Columbia Astrophysics LaboratoryColumbia University, Mail Code 5247, 538 West 120th Street, Pupin Hall, Rm 1027 · New York, NY 10027 Phone 212.854.3278 212.854.3257 Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
