All riders should be prepared to show their ID to the driver when boarding. Individuals without an ID will be allowed to ride, but will be provided information on how to obtain an ID. How to Ride Guide Do you have special break service routes for when school is not in session? Yes, as long as the University is open. Information on Break Service will be posted before the break begins. Can I bring my bike onto the bus? Full size bikes are not allowed on buses. For safety reasons and ensuring proper space onboard for passengers, below are guidelines for mobility devices brought on buses. Examples of mobility devices are electric scooters, folding bikes, skateboards, etc. Acceptable devices must be stowed under a passenger seat. As the bus fills to capacity with passengers, no additional devices may be brought onboard. The passenger with this device may wait for the next bus with ample room. Bikes must fold and be able to be stowed under a passenger seat. If I'm on campus late at night, how do I get around campus or back home?

You may also try several local taxi companies who can provide both in-town and out-of-town service. How is Transit funded? Transit services are funded by allocations from the University Advancement Fee. Knowing that unlimited service to all areas of College Station/Bryan is not economically practical, off-campus routes are designed to serve those areas where the highest concentrations of students live. A Park and Ride was also developed by having a route serve First Baptist Church of College Station, and many students who do not live directly on a route drive a short distance to an area where parking is allowed and catch the bus at the nearest stop. This allows access to all who choose not to purchase a parking permit. The on-campus service was designed to provide a transportation option to all areas of campus and is available to all. Even those students who choose the parking permit option and drive to campus benefit through reduced traffic and more parking availability. Why are IDs now required to board off-campus routes and why are Brazos Transit District customers now riding AggieSpirit buses? Brazos Transit District (The District) and Texas A&M University Transportation Services have a history of cooperation and partnership dating back to 2006. Recently the two entities jointly applied for and were awarded federal grant money. The District used this money to purchase 24 diesel and 3 electric buses for use by Transportation Services. Due to this agreement and to qualify again for federal grant money for future bus purchases, both The District and Transportation Services must honor IDs/passes from each other on both systems. Students, faculty, and staff possessing a Texas A&M University or Blinn College ID, and members of the general public possessing a Brazos Transit District ID, must be prepared to show their ID to the driver when boarding at off-campus stops.
