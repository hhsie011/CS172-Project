TiA has given over 700 seniors a forum to share their values and ideas as they ring in graduation. This year, we are expanding the formats in which seniors can present and reflect on their time at Brown. This year’s celebration of ideas showcases the prevalence of interdisciplinary studies and research that members of the Class of 2022 have conducted as Independent Concentrators or through student-designed independent studies projects during this academic year. Come learn about the theses and capstone projects of our graduating Independent Concentrators, learn about this year’s GISPs and Independent Studies, and have fun! Please visit the main Theories in Action website for more information about this year's presenters and the conference schedule.
