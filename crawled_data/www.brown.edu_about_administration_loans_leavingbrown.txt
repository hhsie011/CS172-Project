Online loan exits must be completed Whether you are graduating, dropping below half-time, or taking a leave, all loan borrowers are required to complete loan exit counseling. Exit counseling must be completed now, even if you plan to return to Brown to continue as a graduate or medical student or enroll at another school. If you are TAKING A LEAVE, you must complete exit counseling requirements. In addition, we strongly encourage you to contact our Loan Office with questions, and review Brown's Curricular Resource Center's CRC Pre-Leave Checklist and Returning from Leave information. If your leave of absence is longer than your loan's grace period, you will need to prepare for loan repayment (see more below). If you are RETURNING FROM LEAVE, any incomplete exit counseling requirements will prevent you from receiving clearance to return. Step 1: Visit Banner Self Service to view all of your exit counseling requirements. Select the CURRENT Aid Year; then look for Unsatisfied Requirements.

Contact us at [email protected] Learn about loan repayment Your loans will enter a grace period - a period of time when payments are not required. This will give you a few months to learn about your loans, determine your income & expenses, and develop a loan repayment strategy. Review our resources below & check out our Repay your Loans page for more info! If you return to school (at least half-time, in a degree granting program), you must notify each of your loan servicers. Your loan servicers will help you determine whether you've used all of your original grace period. You may be eligible to place your loans back into an in-school status or into an in-school deferment. You may be required to submit a completed deferment request to your servicer. See additional details regarding deferment. Contact us at [email protected], 401-863-3296, or visit our office in Page-Robinson Hall (2nd floor) for help.
