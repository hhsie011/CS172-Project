EVolve Houston is a coalition of sustainability-minded civic, business, and academic leaders who seek to accelerate clean transportation through electrification. Collaborating with government, academic, private industry, and community leaders, our goal is to improve regional air quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the Greater Houston area. "An initiative as transformative as EVolve requires great leadership and commitment from across our city and I am proud that Mayor Turner has included University of Houston in achieving this important public private partnership. We are committed to being the Energy University and a long-term partner and resource for industry and Houston in addressing society's greatest challenges. It's our responsibility to lead by example in shifting the energy landscape. That is why we are phasing out all of our gas-powered service carts for electric vehicles." University of Houston President, Renu Khator EV WEBINAR SERIES - UPCOMING MARCH 11th John Deere Vehicle Electrification This presentation will discuss public information related to John Deere project funded by the US DOE-PowerAmerica. Through PowerAmerica, John Deere has formed a collaboration with researchers from the US Department of Energy National Renewable Energy Laboratory to develop a 200 kW 1050 VDC silicon carbide (SiC) dual-inverter. The SiC inverter converts vehicle engine power into electrical power needed for the permanent-magnet-motor based powertrain used in heavy-duty construction and mining vehicles. The presentation will cover development and test verification of various technologies deployed in the successful realization of a power-dense high-temperature high-efficiency SiC dual-inverter. In April 2017, John Deere successfully demonstrated the SiC inverter in a JD 644K Hybrid Loader, using the engine radiator fluid to cool the SiC power electronics. The DOE-PowerAmerica funding has greatly supported John Deere’s aspirations to accelerate the development of SiC inverter technology including realization of key commercialization objectives.
