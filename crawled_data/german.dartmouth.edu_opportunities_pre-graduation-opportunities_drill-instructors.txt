PreviousNext The Role of Drill Instructors Drill instructors help students learning the German language hear and say German words and phrases so often that those words and phrases become automatic. Their duties involve preparing and practicing drills for morning or afternoon sessions (four 50-minute sessions a week). Their responsibilities also include meeting with the instructor of the course. Learn More about the Position We hold demonstrations of drill instructors’ methods at the beginning of every term, as well as workshops and tryouts. The number of drill instructors needed in a given term depends on the enrollments in German Studies language courses. Compensation This is a paid position. For details, please see the administrator or chair of the Department. As a drill instructor, I have just as much fun, if not more fun, engaging with my drillees, seeing their growth throughout the term, and just simply conversing in German for an hour of my day.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of German Studies Undergraduate Overview Why Study German?
