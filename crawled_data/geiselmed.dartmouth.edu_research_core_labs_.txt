We provide a variety of services, including mammalian cell culture, and are developing a robust pipeline for protein production in mammalian, insect, fungal and bacterial hosts. In addition, the MTC provides access to state-of-the-art equipment and facilitates technology transfer of developed processes and more generalized training to enable research projects across the Dartmouth scientific community. bioMT Molecular Interactions and Imaging Core (MIIC) The bioMT Molecular Interactions and Imaging Core (MIIC) offers expertise in numerous microscopy and imaging applications to characterize biological systems, including sample preparation, data collection, and analysis. The MIIC has equipment available for users for label-free analysis of biomolecular interactions, including drug target identification and validation, and numerous imaging applications. We provide support to the research community on a broad range of microscopes available at Dartmouth (either located in one of the imaging cores – Class of 1978 Life Sciences Center and Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, or in individual labs), including training individuals on how to design and implement methodologies to answer specific research questions. Biostatistics and Bioinformatics (BBISR) The Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Resource provides access to statistical expertise for all NCCC Programs. Services include research design and sample size calculations; research proposals and protocol development; randomization, interim analyses, and statistical data management; final data analyses, publication tables, statistical graphics, and manuscript development; and specialized analyses for geospatial and genomic studies. All initial consultations are free. More extensive efforts may require additional funding depending on how much time is required. Clinical Pharmacology (CP) The Clinical Pharmacology Resource supports investigators in the design, analysis, and interpretation of clinical pharmacology objectives in preclinical and clinical studies, including chemoprevention and epidemiological studies. In addition to the biorepository function of our resource, we also have bioanalytical hardware, computer hardware, and state-of-the-art commercial software programs for application to individual and population-based pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling, and modeling drug in vitro and in vivo combination drug effects. Genomics and Molecular Biology (GMBSR) The Genomics Section provides technologies that enable profiling of gene expression, miRNA, CpG Island, and CGH on a whole-genome scale, and provides high-quality genomics and microarray data. The Speed Congenics Service facilitates the development of congenic mice in support of pre-clinical projects. We provide expert advice on mouse speed congenic development, mouse genetic background analysis and mouse genetic mapping. The Molecular Biology Section provides DNA fragment analysis, qPCR, Sanger sequencing and NanoString Technology. Immune Monitoring and Flow Cytometry (DartLab) DartLab, the Immune Monitoring and Flow Cytometry Resource provides various services such as isolation and cryopreservation of PBMCs and plasma or serum for clinical trials, as well as carrying out a spectrum of immunoassays and developing customized immunoassays. It also provides dedicated equipment such as cell sorters, flow cytometers, ELISPOT reader, Bio-Plex array reader, and a Seahorse XFe96. We provide support for experimental design, analysis, and interpretation and offer instrument training and a biannual Flow Cytometry course. Irradiation, Pre-clinical Imaging, and Microscopy (IPIM) The Irradiation Resource assists investigators in radiation treatment planning and delivery of ionizing irradiation to cells, rodents, large animals and spontaneous animal tumors. Pre-clinical Imaging provides technologies for non-invasive, whole-animal imaging of rodents used in preclinical research studies. The Microscopy Section provides access to point scanning confocal microscopy, conventional bright field and flourescence light microscopy, and image analysis resources. The facility provides individual and group training for operation of the light microscopes. Mouse Modeling (MM) The Mouse Modeling Shared Resource supports the generation and utilization of mice for modeling human disease. The Transgenic Service supports the use of genetically modified mice by members of the Dartmouth research community. We offer a wide variety of services that assist researchers in construct design and creation of novel transgenic mice. We also offer mice with a humanized immune system that allows our investigators a better way to study viruses and other human infections. The PDX Mouse Service supports the development and utilization of patient-derived xenograft models of cancer research. Pathology Shared Resources (PSR) The Pathology Shared Resources facilitates project planning, clinical validation and implementation of novel translational technology and research in the fields of molecular diagnostics, molecular therapeutics, pharmacogenomics, quantitative morphologic image analysis and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in a CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited laboratory ensuring optimal clinical quality assurance. Trace Element Analysis (TEA) The Trace Element Analysis Resource specializes in low-level trace metal analysis and speciation in environmental and biological samples. We use inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for metals analysis and several "hyphenated" techniques that couple instruments together for speciation analyses of water, soil and biological tissue samples.
