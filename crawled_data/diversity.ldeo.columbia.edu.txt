Housed in the Lamont Directorate, this office was created in 2008 as a response to the recommendations of the National Science Foundation (NSF) ADVANCE program. Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are integral to our achievement of academic and scientific excellence, and this office has developed and implemented a wide range of initiatives impacting different groups across campus. Read about some of these Lamont Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Initiatives. As we commit to addressing systemic racism in our institutions, take a moment to read the Statement on Lamont's Commitment to Anti-Racism as well as Columbia's Commitment to Anti-Racism. We hope this website provides you with useful information about DEI work at Lamont.
