The Global Operations team actively partners with departments setting up projects, programs, or other activities and advises on factors to consider, including local employment laws, operation regulations, special licenses, and any necessary Cornell-specific pre-approvals. These in-house consulting services are available to the Cornell community free of charge (note: in the event outside legal or tax advice is required, the unit is responsible for relevant costs). Before budgeting for a project intending to operate abroad, reach out to Global Operations. Behind the scenes, our team may consult internally and with other central offices to ensure you receive a complete answer, even when tackling complex issues which may require input from more than one office.
