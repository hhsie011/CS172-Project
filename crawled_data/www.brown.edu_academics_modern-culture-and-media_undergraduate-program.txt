We stress creative thinking and critical production: comparative analysis and theoretical reflection, as well as work that integrates practice and theory. We thus bring together aspects of modern culture that are normally separated by university departmental structures such as film and media studies, fine art, literature, literary arts and philosophy. This concentration offers the student a wide range of possible specializations. A student might decide to focus on the critical study and production of a certain type or combination of media (print, photography, sound recording, cinema, video, television, and digital media); or they might focus on certain cultural, theoretical and/or social formations (for example, gender/sexuality in post-Cold war television, postcolonial theory and film, the changing form of the novel, theories of subjectivity and ideology, video games and theories of representation). These paths are united by a commitement to critical thinking/practice: rather than reproducing conventions, MCM concentrators learn how conventions emerge, what work they do, and explore ways to change them. College Writing Requirement MCM concentrators must complete the College Writing Requirement by taking two writing-intensive or WRIT courses. The MCM Concentration MCM supports two main undergraduate concentration tracks, Theory based (formally Track 1) and Practice based (formally Track 2). The Theory based track consists of 11 MCM courses. Courses from other departments may count toward the fulfillment of a focus area, and must be approved by an MCM concentration advisor as part of a coherent program of study. The Practice based track consists of 11 courses distributed as follows: two core courses, two additional courses below the 1000-level, three 1000-level courses, four production courses, and one senior seminar. Students are expected to meet regularly with their concentration advisors; they are required to meet at the beginning of their seventh semester to review their concentrations. Double Concentrations Students who declare a double concentration may count up to two courses for concentration credit in MCM that are also counted towards concentration credit in another department or program.
