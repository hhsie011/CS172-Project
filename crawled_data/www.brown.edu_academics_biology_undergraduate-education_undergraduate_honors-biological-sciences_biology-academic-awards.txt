The Biology Awards Committee selects the recipients who are honored at a luncheon and recognized at Commencement. Dean Marjorie Thompson Senior Prize in Biology With generous support from the community, the Division of Biology and Medicine established The Dean Thompson Prize in Biology, which was awarded for the first time in 2015. The Dean Thompson Prize recognizes a graduating senior who has proven to be an outstanding student and student-educator in biology. The recipient must also be highly accomplished in a second academic discipline and/or extracurricular endeavor. Recent recipients: Thedoe Nyunt '22, Savannah Lewis '21 & Jessica McDonald '21, Derek J. Xu '20, Brooke M. Spencer '19, Alexis H. Lerner '18, Jahnavi Rudrakshala '17, Beatrice L. Steinert '16 and Elena R. Suglia '15 Maria L. Caleel Memorial Award for Academic Excellence This is the highest award given to a senior biology student in each graduating class. This prize recognizes the student with the strongest qualities of scholarship, research, academic performance, and contributions to the undergraduate intellectual atmosphere. Maria Caleel was a dedicated and involved student who graduated from Brown University in 1987. Approximately one year later, she met a tragic and untimely death while studying for a career in equine medicine at the University of Illinois' College of Veterinary Medicine. At that time, Maria Caleel was ranked at the top of her first-year class. Her family, classmates, many friends and admirers worked together to establish an award to honor her memory - The Maria Caleel Memorial Award. The deans and faculty of Brown's Biology departments select recipients who have demonstrated dedication to the field, outstanding academic achievement, future promise, and exemplary achievement in keeping with the standards of Maria Caleel who was not able to realize her full potential. Therefore, it is the hope of all those who helped establish this award in her memory that the recognition it brings will encourage the recipient to continue excellence in the field and embody in all aspects of life the virtues of hard work, dedication and strength of character which Maria Caleel exemplified.
