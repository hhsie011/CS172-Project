Nurses are the frontline defense against the leading causes of mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, which means they often shoulder responsibility for the survival of communities. Despite their crucial role in healthcare, many countries face a nursing shortage, contributing directly to poor health outcomes. ICAP has supported the professional development of nurses and midwives in sub-Saharan Africa since 2006, including the Nurse Mentorship Training Program (NMTP) in Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. The program, eventually adopted in other countries, included a comprehensive curriculum to improve knowledge and skills nurses need to play a larger role in HIV care and created an effective, replicable model of nurse mentorship. NMTP’s success was inspiration, and helped to establish a strong foundation for ICAP’s regional Nurse Capacity Building Program.
