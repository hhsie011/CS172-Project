Columbia Engineering and Columbia Global Centers | Rio de Janeiro jointly launched a design challenge on February 15th focused around bringing innovative engineering, sensing technologies, Internet-of-Things, and big data analytics to the multi-faceted challenges of smart cities. We invite students, postdocs, faculty, and staff from all schools to participate. The goal of the design challenge is to produce a viable design-concept (could include a rough prototype, if possible) to win continued support toward development of an interdisciplinary technology-driven solution that could potentially be presented in Rio in April 2016. Rio de Janeiro, “the Marvelous City,” is a world-class metropolis, well-known for its beautiful beaches, annual Carnival celebration, and its upcoming role as host of the 2016 Summer Olympics.
