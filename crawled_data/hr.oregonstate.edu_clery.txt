The Clery Act requires institutions to provide the campus community with timely and accurate information about campus crimes and safety so they can make informed and reasoned decisions about their personal safety. The Clery Compliance Team at OSU works to compile a one-stop resource for information about crimes and fire safety at Oregon State University in the Annual Security and Fire Safety Report. We work with campus and community partners to provide information about Clery crime statistics, current university policies, helpful resources, and security awareness programs for students and employees at Oregon State University.
