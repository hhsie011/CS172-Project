Texas Tech University Directory Raiderlink A-Z Index Transportation & Parking Services Menu Search TTU Transportation & Parking Services Motorcycle Parking Motorcycle parking encompasses all two-wheel vehicles that must be registered with the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles. This includes motorcycles and scooters like Vespas. Parking for your motorcycle is available for both students and employees. See below for details on parking your motorcycle. Students and Employees Without Area Reserved or Reserved Space ePermits To bring a motorcycle or scooter and park on campus, you can purchase a two-wheel (motorcycle) permit. This allows you to park in any designated two-wheel parking area. For the safety of your motorcycle, it must be parked in a motorcycle area and not in a residence hall or commuter parking space. These motorcycle (two-wheel) parking areas are found in pockets within residence hall lots and are curbed off with parking bumpers (map here). Student motorcycles must abide by the same rules as student vehicles, including not driving beyond the entry stations weekdays from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Employees With Area Reserved or Reserved Space ePermits Add your motorcycle as an authorized vehicle on your account, and you may park it in your regular lot or space just as you would your car or truck.
