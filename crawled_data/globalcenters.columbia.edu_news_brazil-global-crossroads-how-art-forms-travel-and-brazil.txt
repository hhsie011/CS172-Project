This visit represents the first step in planning a conference and exhibit on the topic of “Brazil as Global Crossroads” to be mounted in Rio and in New York City. Professor Sharon Marcus, the Dean of Humanities at Columbia University, has assembled a group of eminent researchers with expertise in history, architecture, literature, photography, music, and performance. All the scholars who came to Rio de Janeiro undertook research duties and were granted access to archives at Instituto Moreira Salles, the Brazilian National Library and the National Museum of Fine Arts. Aside from their research developments, all the professors gave open lectures to the general public, counting with the support from Brazilian institutions such as Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Universidade Estadual do Rio de Janeiro (UERJ), Escola de Artes Visuais do Parque Lage (EAV), Instituto de Tecnologia e Sociedade (ITS) and Studio-X Rio. Dean Sharon Marcus, on her turn, had busy institutional agenda in Rio de Janeiro. She met with book editors and with the leadership of several research and educational institutions, such as the CEO of Instituto Moreira Salles and the Dean of PUC-Rio. Dr. Marcus also gave an interview to the column 'Tell me something I don't know', a cultural daily piece from O Globo newspaper. You can read it (in Portuguese) here.
