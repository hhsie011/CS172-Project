Our Objectives To provide the student with a well-balanced educational experience, integrating a strong foundation in the basic sciences and research with a diverse clinical experience. To graduate a specialist with highly refined analytical, clinical, critical thinking, and management skills that we believe are necessary to provide optimum orthodontic care for the public. Our Philosophy The philosophy of the Graduate Orthodontic Program at the College of Dentistry is to prepare students for clinical practice in the specialty of orthodontics. Critical thinking skills are developed through the intentional integration of mentored scientific research and extensive clinical training, culminating in both an MS in Oral Biology and a Specialty Certificate in Orthodontics. Our goal is to impart in-depth knowledge of the biological and mechanical principles governing the practice of orthodontics and to allow students to develop excellent proficiency in orthodontics while treating a wide variety of complex malocclusions using multiple techniques. This expertise will be accomplished utilizing a variety of philosophies of diagnosis and treatment from a diverse faculty of approximately 25 outstanding practitioners and educators.
