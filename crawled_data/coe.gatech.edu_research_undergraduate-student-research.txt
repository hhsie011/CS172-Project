Important discoveries often take place at the intersection of disciplines, and we encourage the kinds of multidisciplinary collaboration that makes these advances possible. And for undergrads, research opportunities are plentiful. Students can work in research labs for course credit or pay across all eight schools Undergraduate Student Research Opportunities Research Option The Research Option provides students a substantial, in-depth research experience. The culmination of the Research Option experience often results in a journal publication or conference presentation, and completion of the program is designated on your transcript.The Research Option (RO) is open to all undergraduate students, but it is tailor-made for future graduate school students and professional-track students who are planning a career in research and development after graduation. President's Undergraduate Research Awards President's Undergraduate Research Awards fund student salaries to conduct undergraduate research with Georgia Tech faculty and offset travel expenses for undergraduates to present their research at professional conferences. Between two hundred and three hundred competitive awards are offered each year. The Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) Program VIP unites undergraduate education and faculty research in a team-based context. Undergraduate VIP students earn academic credits, while faculty and graduate students benefit from the design/discovery efforts of their teams. The program extends the academic design experience beyond a single semester, with students participating for up to three years. It provides the time and context to learn and practice professional skills, to make substantial contributions, and experience different roles on large multidisciplinary design/discovery teams.
