K. Brown Military Gallery at the John Hay Library—on stamps. From now until July 31, 2015, you can see 18 pages of stamps that showcase the work of five artists: Peter Paul Rubens, Marc Chagall, Melozzo da Forli, Pietro Cavallini, and Charles M. Russell—an artist of the American West. Using great works of art in stamp design began in the 1930s, increasing in popularity to its height in the 1950s, spurring a movement to collect art stamps within the world of philately. (Collecting stamps within a specific genre is known as topical collecting.) The Brown University Library is home to several stamp collections, including the Knight Collection, the Peltz and Morriss Collections of Special Delivery stamps, the George S. Champlin Memorial Stamp Collection of international issues, and the Robert T. Galkin Collection of First Day Covers.

Brown Military Gallery, Third Floor, Room 303, John Hay Library, 20 Prospect Street, Providence This entry was posted in Uncategorized by Jennifer Braga. Bookmark the permalink.
