Skip to content Coulombe Lab for Heart Health and Regeneration Advancing heart health through research and mentorship Menu People Diversity & Inclusion Human Engineered Myocardium Heart Regeneration In Vitro Models Publications News Teaching Contact All Are Welcome Here! Ground-breaking, creative solutions are developed in an open, honest, and collaborative environment. We strive to create a group dynamic that supports the research, teaching, and outreach goals of each lab member through hard work, excellent utilization of resources, and compassion for each other, the University, and all of humanity. Our Research and Training Missions: To passionately pursue cardiac regenerative medicine — from fundamentals of tissue formation and contractility to integration with the host heart — to develop translational therapies for heart disease patients around the world. To empower the next generation of scientists and engineers to implement their ideas for improving health and society through attentive mentoring, engaged scholarship, and active inclusion.
