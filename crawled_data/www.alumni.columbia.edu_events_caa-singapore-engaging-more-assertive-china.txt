How can the rest of the world engage with a more confident China that’s less interested in global validation? Does the future hold opportunities for foreign companies, or will the costs be too high to do business in China? What will be the ripple effects of China’s super-strict zero-Covid policy? CAA Singapore is excited to bring you a lively conversation with Wall Street Journal journalists in the region, who will discuss their experience reporting on the world’s second-largest economy. If it is allowable by May 5, an in-person component for this event will also be considered. Registered attendees will be informed if this possibility occurs. This event is also open to Wall Street Journal subscribers.
