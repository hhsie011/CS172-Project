But it was the six months she spent in Ghana, her family’s ancestral home, as an undergraduate that ignited her interest in medicine. Through the Ghana Health Service, EB helped medical professionals with patient care and took part in outreach programs, weighing infants and providing families with low-cost formula. Since then, she says, “I have been drawn to projects that involve community outreach and education because I believe this is an important way to empower others.” After graduating from Northeastern University as a behavioral neuroscience major and international affairs minor, EB was a clinical research assistant for two years at the Bradley Hasbro Children’s Research Center, developing digital interventions to prevent risky adolescent behaviors while refining her community engagement skills with vulnerable populations. That experience has been key to her many leadership activities, which include teaching sex ed to seventh-graders, caring for uninsured patients at the Rhode Island Free Clinic, and mentoring high school and undergraduate students who identify as underrepresented in medicine. An aspiring pediatric dermatologist, she’s working to expand resources and reduce disparities in the field through the Skin of Color Community Series she helped create. While med school is as stressful as EB expected, she’s able to decompress by exploring Providence’s restaurant scene and taking long bike rides. Most importantly, she finds comfort in Brown’s “supportive environment,” she says. “I have met amazing mentors who remind me not to be afraid of failure, because it is part of the road to success.” Brown University Providence RI 02912 401-863-1000 Quick Navigation Division of Biology and Medicine Program in Biology Affiliated Hospitals Footer Navigation Events Maps and Directions Contact Us Accessibility The campaign for building on distinction Give To Brown © Brown University Brown University For You Search Menu Mobile Site Navigation Mobile Site Navigation Home About the Medical School Curriculum Degree Programs Student Stories After Alpert Frequently Asked Questions Virtual Tour Apply Application Process Tuition and Fees Financial Aid Routes of Admission AMCAS/MCAT Secondary Application Requirements Interview Decision Process Virtual Tour FAQ Life at Brown Student Life Life in Providence Class Profile Service Virtual Tour Diversity Mobile Secondary Navigation Navigation Give Now This Site Only All of Brown.edu People Search Search people Advanced Search Search Close Search EB Henebeng MD’21 Open details for EB Henebeng MD’21 Bookmark this Page
