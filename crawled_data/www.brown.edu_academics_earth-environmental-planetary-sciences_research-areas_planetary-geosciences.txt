This tradition continues today with involvement in a wide variety of research programs and continued participation in planetary missions. A major emphasis that links diverse approaches within the Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences is the study of surface processes and their role in the overall evolution of planetary geologic history and internal evolution. A variety of perspectives is provided by the Brown faculty: planetary processes, remote sensing, geophysics, petrology, and terrestrial analog studies. As a consequence, students involved in Planetary Geosciences at Brown commonly develop cross-disciplinary backgrounds with the graduate program tailored to emphasize the strengths of individual students while maintaining a solid foundation in the geological sciences.
