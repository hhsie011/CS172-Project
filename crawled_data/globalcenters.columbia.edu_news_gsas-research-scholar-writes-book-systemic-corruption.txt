Holder Jr. Initiative for Civil and Political Rights, has written the book República Plebeya. Guía Teórica y Práctica para Constituir el Poder Popular (“Plebeian Republic. Theoretical and Practical Guide to Constitute Popular Power”). In the book, “I explain the concept of systemic corruption, the oligarchization of power and the need to establish popular institutions where individuals can collectively curb abuse and oppression. I also work on the theoretical and historical difference between populism and fascism,” says Vergara, who specializes in republican theory and anti-oligarchic institutions, with an expertise on the constituent populist revolutions in Latin America during the first decade of the 21st century. Vergara is slated to launch her book mid-March in Santiago. Her research combines a critical interpretation of modern and contemporary political thought, grounded on the material organization of power, and a normative political theory guided by a radical republican critique of procedural theories of justice.
