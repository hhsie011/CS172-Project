We strongly believe that an effective general counsel's office does not merely respond when consulted. Rather, through close communication with faculty and staff, the Office seeks to keep abreast of the College's programmatic goals, and takes affirmative steps to help achieve those goals before legal issues become legal problems. The Office performs a wide variety of legal services. These include advising College officials on regulatory compliance and other legal aspects of their duties; representing the College in litigation before federal and state courts and administrative agencies; advising on issues involving risk management; preparing and negotiating contracts between the College and other entities; and representing the College in commercial transactions. The Office also supervises the activities of outside counsel who may be retained to assist with particular matters requiring specialized expertise. The General Counsel also oversees the operations of the College's Office of Visa and Immigration Services. Principal areas of the Office's practice include the following: Affirmative Action and Non-Discrimination Antitrust Athletics - Title IX Charitable Giving Commercial Transactions Construction Copyright and Publishing Law Corporate Governance Disability and Handicap Law Employment Environmental Law Insurance Intellectual Property Labor Law Litigation - Internal Investigations Museum Administration Personal Injury - Tort Defense Campus Security Real Estate and Land Use Records Access and Privacy Regulatory Compliance Scientific Misconduct Sponsored Research Student Affairs and Discipline Taxation Technology Transfer Please click here to view the Executive Summary of our 2018 Client Survey.
