Skip to Main Content Yale Center for RNA Science and Medicine Yale Center for RNA Science and Medicine Yale UniversityCenter for RNA Science and Medicine About the Center Faculty Annual Retreat RNA Club Publications News & Events Job Opportunities Welcome A revolution is underway in our understanding of the importance of RNA molecules to basic cell biology and for diagnosing and curing human disease. This revolution involves both the identification of new types of RNA molecules and the realization that alterations in RNA metabolism underlie a wide range of human diseases. The mission of the Yale Center for RNA Science and Medicine is to foster interactions between Yale's world-class RNA scientists and clinicians. Our goals are to support cutting-edge RNA science and to foster cross-disciplinary collaborations that increase knowledge of basic molecular mechanisms, elucidate human disease processes and advance disease treatments. Note to RNA Center faculty, post-docs, and graduate students: Please send any news-worthy items from your laboratory to Diana Martínez-Saucedo so that she can share them on our website. News-worthy items include, but are not limited to, honors, awards, grants, seminars, workshops, meetings, positions available, and special events.
