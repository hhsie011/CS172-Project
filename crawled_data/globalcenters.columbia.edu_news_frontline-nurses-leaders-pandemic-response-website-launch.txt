This event will launch frontlinenurses.columbia.edu, a new site that presents first- person accounts of nurses and midwives from Liberia and Sierra Leone who successfully led their communities through the 2014 Ebola outbreak. We invite you to meet and listen to these nurses and midwives via the links to their website below March 15, 2021 frontlines The 2014-16 Ebola outbreak in western African countries was a devastating epidemic in which healthcare workers confronted soaring contagion and mortality. In summer 2019, a team of nursing and midwifery leaders conducted oral history interviews with a group of frontline Ebola nurses and midwives in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Their stories and insights show the crucial role of nursing leadership in epidemic response and offer essential lessons for health care and policymaking today. Listen to the voices of the nurses and read excerpts from their oral histories here. As the Covid-19 pandemic has raced around the planet and overwhelmed health systems, nurses and midwives are on the frontlines of care. We asked nurses from New York City and around the world to share their experiences. We are currently conducting oral history interviews to gain an in-depth picture of nurses’ insights and personal stories about providing care during a pandemic. These interviews will be posted in spring 2021.
