When you're not in class, attending a club meeting or a networking event, there's still a lot for you to do as a student. The Business School is located on the University's Morningside Campus, an oasis amidst Manhattan's bustling Upper West Side. So when you're here, you get the best of both worlds: a beautiful college campus where you can spread out with a book, or talk over coffee with friends, with a diverse spread of bars and restaurants nearby where you can immerse yourself in the city. Thanks to the strength of our community, life on campus is never dull. The School calendar is packed with fun events year-round, from weekly Happy Hours to the Fall Ball for students and guests to the ever-popular Follies show put on by the students. When you do have a free minute, Dodge Gym—with workout space, squash courts, a pool—is adjacent to the Business School.
