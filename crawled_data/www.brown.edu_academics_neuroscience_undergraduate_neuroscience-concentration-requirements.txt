Acquaint yourself with the course requirements of the concentration and with other relevant courses offered at Brown that might form part of your program. You can also discuss the concentration at open houses in the Department of Neuroscience and with department representative at various informational sessions held during the year in Sayles. 2. Lay out a schedule, semester by semester, of the courses you will need to complete the concentration during your remaining years at Brown. Make sure that courses taken in the same semester are given at different times, paying close attention to laboratories. Make sure that you have arranged to complete the prerequisites for the courses you schedule. 3. Enter your proposed plan on a copy or printout of the form on the concentration handbook entitled Neuroscience Concentration: Student/Advisor Agreement. The form can be downloaded also from this site. 4. Go to the office of the Department of Neuroscience (Sidney Frank Hall 315) or email Elyse Netto ([email protected]) and ask to be assigned a concentration advisor. You and your new advisor will be sent an email as confirmation; in addition, you will be pre-assigned to your advisor on the ASK (Advising Sidekick) online concentration declaration system. 5. Make an appointment to see this advisor to discuss your plans and preferences. 6. After consulting with your advisor, draw up a final draft your proposal on the Student/Advisor Agreement form. This is a very important document because it functions as a contract between you and the Department of Neuroscience and becomes part of your permanent file in the department. Changes in your concentration courses can be made but this should never be done without first consulting your concentration advisor. You are responsible for the consequences of any changes made without departmental approval. 7. Using the ASK online forms, you should officially declare your concentration. Select the courses for your concentration using the Student/Advisor Agreement form as your guide. Once completed, your concentration declaration will automatically be sent to your concentration advisor for approval. 8. Return your signed Student/Advisor Agreement form and elective paragraphs to the Neuroscience Administrative Office (Room 315, Sidney Frank Hall) or e-mail it to [email protected]. The following courses are required for a Neuroscience concentration: Background Courses •MATH0090 and MATH0100 or equivalent •CHEM0330 and CHEM0350 (or higher) •PHYS0030 and PHYS0040 or equivalent •BIOL0200 or equivalent (For equivalents, see Frequently Asked Questions.) Basic Lecture Series •NEUR0010: The Brain: An Introduction to Neuroscience •NEUR1020: Principles of Neurobiology •NEUR1030: Neural Systems Research Methods •Statistics: 1 approved course •Laboratory methods: 1 approved course Critical Reading Course •1 approved course Four Thematic Electives In consultation with the concentration advisor, the student must select additional courses thematically related to his or her interest in neuroscience to make a total of 10 Neuroscience Core Courses. The student must write a short paragraph for each course justifying its inclusion in the concentration. (Organic chemistry does not satisfy this requirement). See FAQ for more guidance on electives. The following courses are approved for concentration credit in their respective categories (however other courses may also be suitable, check with your advisor): Statistics Courses PHP 0501, PHP1510, PHP2510, APMA0640, APMA0650, APMA1650, CLPS0900, SOC1100, EDUC1110, BIOL0495 Laboratory Methods Courses NEUR0680: Computational Neuroscience NEUR1440: Neural Dynamics (only some offerings of the course) NEUR1600: Experimental Neurobiology NEUR1630: Big Data Neuroscience Lab NEUR1650: Structure of the Nervous System NEUR1660: Neural Computation in L&D NEUR1970: Independent Laboratory Research (two semesters) CLPS1190: Techniques in Physiological Psychology CLPS1194: Sleep and Chronobiology Research CLPS1491: Neural Modeling Laboratory CLPS1492: Laboratory in Computational Cognitive Neuroscience BIOL0800: Principles of Physiology BIOL1170: Mammalian Physiology BIOL1880: Comparative Biology of the Vertebrates Critical Reading Courses (list is not limited to these courses) •NEUR1440: Neural Dynamics •NEUR1530: Communication In the Brain: What We Know and How We Know It •NEUR1560: Developmental Neurobiology •NEUR1930: Topics in Neuroscience •NEUR1940: Topics in Neuroscience •NEUR1970: Independent Laboratory Research (two semesters)* *Independent study can fulfill only one of the 10 core course requirements of the concentration. •BIOL1100: Cell Physiology and Biophysics •BIOL1110: Topics in Signal Transduction •BIOL1190: Synaptic Transmission and Plasticity •CLPS1180: Topics in Comparative Psychology •CLPS1400: The Neural Bases of Cognition Completing the Concentration Research Requirement As with other ScB concentrations, neuroscience concentrators are required (beginning with the class of 2023) to do the equivalent of one semester of independent study, research or design. This is a chance for the student to explore and apply the concepts that they have learned in their concentration courses. The following are ways in which this research requirement can be met. 1. Enrolling in independent study courses (NEUR 1970, CLPS 1970/80 or BIO 1950/60) for work in a lab. Keep in mind to count this towards your concentration two semesters or one semester and a summer are required. 2. Enrolling in independent study (NEUR 1970) to work with a faculty member to explore an integrative topic related to neuroscience. See our section on independent study for more information. 3. Enrolling in a course-based research experience, also known as a CURE course. Current related CURE courses are NEUR 1630, CLPS 1195, CLPS 1591, but there might be new ones coming down the pipeline. 4. Participating in a structured summer research program (eg. an UTRA or an REU) that is equivalent in scope and scale as would be pursued during a semester of independent research. 5. Pursue a design or independent research project related to neuroscience that could be associated with a different course. 6. Anyone writing an honors thesis automatically fulfils the research requirement, in order to document your research requirement, please describe your plan in your Concentration Agreement and in ASK, be sure to discuss it with your concentration advisor to make sure it is appropriate. Certain courses in other departments may satisfy this requirement with written approval of NUCC. Some Important Notes on Choosing Your Intro Courses: There are several possible ways to complete the introductory neuroscience sequence. One that works well is when students take Neuro 1, in the fall of their first year, Bio 20 later that spring, and then take Neur 103 and 102 their sophomore year. This gives them the best possible preparation for 103 and 102, which are a bit more demanding. Many other students opt to take Neur 102 the spring of their freshman year and then 103 next fall. While students who do this sequence typically do just as well, they sometimes lose some of the more complicated aspects of 102. It is also important to remind students that both 102 and 103 can count towards a biology concentration, so they are not committing to neuroscience by taking these classes. For both of these courses it is essential students go to all the lectures and complete the assignments.
