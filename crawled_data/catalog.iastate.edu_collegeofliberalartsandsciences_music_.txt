Two degrees are offered in music: a bachelor of music, which is more specialized and contains fewer general education requirements; and a bachelor of arts degree with a major in music. (The Department of Music and Theatre also administers the Theatre Program, see Theatre and Performing Arts.) The music curriculum provides: A comprehensive program of professional studies for students who wish to prepare for careers in music, including teaching, performance, and composition, and for students who plan to pursue graduate studies in music. Courses in music literature, theory and areas of performance for all students, regardless of major. The department embodies the land-grant philosophy of service to the people of the state with a faculty of active scholars, teachers, and artists committed to excellence in teaching, creative/scholarly work, and arts outreach. The department is an accredited institutional member of the National Association of Schools of Music (NASM). Student Learning Outcomes Music graduates will understand and demonstrate: Knowledge of music cultural heritage and history Appreciation for musical creativity, reasoning, and the aesthetic value of music Knowledge of organization and structures of music Analytical skills necessary for listening, performing, and teaching Skills necessary to perform music from a variety of periods, styles, and genres Necessary abilities to communicate ideas musically, verbally, and in writing Awareness of the diversity of musical ideas throughout the world’s cultures For Music Education students: success in meeting the ISU Teaching Standards as outlined by the University Teacher Education Program Assessment measures include the continuation examination, graduating senior surveys and exit interviews, public performances, senior projects, course grades, teacher certification (for music education students), and the National Association of Schools of Music accreditation review.

General Requirements Entrance Audition. In order to be accepted as a music major, a prospective student must pass an entrance audition for the applied faculty in his/her performance area (piano, organ, woodwinds, strings, percussion, brass, or voice). Passing the audition is dependent on the demonstration of performance skills appropriate for college level instruction and the potential to perform at a professional level. In addition, the number of students accepted must balance with the space available in the corresponding applied studios. Once accepted, a student must complete a placement examination in keyboard skills. This examination is normally given by members of the departmental faculty the week preceding the opening of classes for fall semester. Seminars and Recitals. All music majors enrolled for applied music courses will attend a weekly 1-hour seminar in their areas, departmental recitals, and 12 recitals of their choosing each semester. Ensemble Requirement. See the options above for additional ensemble requirements. All Bachelor of Music students: Enrollment in an ensemble course, chosen from the lists below, each semester of full-time enrollment (except during student teaching) is required. Students in a music education options: At least six semesters of large ensemble and one semester of chamber music ensemble, chosen from the lists below, are required. One semester of 114A may count as a large ensemble. Bachelor of Music students in options other than education: At least 2 semesters of large ensemble and one semester of chamber music ensemble, chosen from the lists below, are required. Large Ensembles: MUSIC 111 Wind Ensemble 1 MUSIC 115 Symphonic Band 1 MUSIC 141 Lyrica Women's Choir 1 MUSIC 151 Oratorio Chorus 1 MUSIC 161 Iowa State Singers 1 MUSIC 181 Symphony Orchestra 1 Chamber music ensembles: MUSIC 113 Jazz Ensemble 1 MUSIC 161 Iowa State Singers 1 MUSIC 301 Opera Studio 1-3 MUSIC 321 Advanced Ensemble 1 Continuation Examination To be approved for continuation as a music major on the junior level, and enroll in Music 319, a student must pass a continuation examination taken normally at the end of the fourth semester as a music major. Before taking this examination, the student must complete the requisite forms as well as write an essay including: his/her personal goals a self-assessment of his/her progress thus far an assessment of what he/she expects to accomplish before graduation The student taking the Continuation Examination performs for a Continuation Examination Committee. Requirements include the performance of three works representing different periods or styles selected by, and studied with, the applied teacher, a self-prepared piece, and sight reading. The student must display acceptable solo ability and performance techniques in at least one of the applied areas. A written evaluation will be given each student following his/her performance. This evaluation will include a candid assessment of the student’s potential to achieve his/her goals. In addition, the student may arrange to meet with members of the Continuation Examination Committee at a later date to discuss the results of his/her Continuation Examination. See Piano Proficiency below. For details and forms go to: http://www.music.iastate.edu Piano Proficiency Requirement All music majors must demonstrate proficiency in functional skills at the piano. Keyboard music majors (students whose primary instrument is piano or organ) accomplish this through courses in their curricula. All other students accomplish this by satisfactorily completing Music 228. All entering non-keyboard music majors with previous piano experience meet with the class piano instructor, usually the week before classes start in the fall semester, to determine the appropriate piano class (127, 128, 227, 228) for their initial piano enrollment. Some students are deemed to have met the piano proficiency at this time. Non-keyboard music majors with no previous piano experience should enroll in Music 127, Class Piano I. Continuous enrollment in piano classes is REQUIRED until successful completion of the piano proficiency requirement. Important: The piano proficiency must be met, either through completion of Music 228 or demonstration of proficiency, to pass the continuation examination. Failure to do so could delay a student's graduation. All students must fulfill the piano proficiency requirement in order to pass the continuation examination and enroll in Music 319. Graduation Proficiency To be recommended for graduation, a music student should demonstrate to the music faculty mature acquaintance with performance styles, technique, and repertoire. All music majors will participate in departmental recitals to the satisfaction of the department. Candidates for the bachelor of music degree will present a graduation recital. * According to the university-wide Communication Proficiency Grade Requirement, students must demonstrate their communication proficiency by earning a grade of C or better in ENGL 250 (or ENGL 250H). In addition the Communication Proficiency must be certified through one of the following options: 1. Certification of writing skills, by the instructor, after completion of one of the following: MUSIC 120 Introduction to Music Literature and Styles 3 MUSIC 383 History of Music I 3 MUSIC 384 History of Music II 3 MUSIC 472 History of American Music 3 MUSIC 473 Topics in Advanced Music History 3 MUSIC 475 Music of the Romantic Era 3 MUSIC 476 Music of the Twentieth Century 3 (Passing one of these courses does not automatically satisfy the requirements for Communication Proficiency.) 2.
