C. Lench Graduate Advisor: T. Yamauchi As a department, we seek to be a leader in psychological research and education. Our faculty members are engaged in innovative research programs focused on studying and intervening in behavior through diverse methods and approaches, from micro to macro, with an aim of improving human health and well-being. The Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences offers PhD training in Behavioral and Cellular Neuroscience, Clinical Psychology, Cognition and Cognitive Neuroscience, Industrial/Organizational Psychology, and Social and Personality Psychology. We also maintain research clusters focused on Diversity Science, Affective Science, and Personality Processes. Doctoral students in Clinical Psychology and Industrial/Organizational Psychology complete a Master's Degree as part of their progress toward the PhD. Our doctoral training is strongly research oriented; all students are expected to become involved with research beginning in their first year. We offer a Master of Science in Psychological Sciences degree with a concentration in Industrial/Organizational Psychology, which is intended for students who are interested in employment using psychological principles in the workplace and in organizations. Doctoral Programs The objectives of the PhD programs are: To prepare students to conduct high quality research, to direct research by others, and to communicate research findings through teaching and writing. To prepare students for careers in academic settings or organizations that involve practical solutions to personal, social, or organizational problems. We enroll approximately 120 doctoral students and offer numerous opportunities for student collaboration with faculty. The student-faculty ratio is roughly 2:1, which allows individualized attention to develop research and professional skills. Doctoral students admitted to the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences typically receive a competitive monthly salary for four or five years through external awards and fellowships, research assistantships, teaching assistantships, clinical placements, or university employment. Office space, computers, funds to travel to professional conventions, and funds to pursue professional development, are also typically provided by advisors. All of the programs within the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences support an active speaker series that involves students, faculty, and scientists from across the university and from other institutions. These series provide exposure to different perspectives on the field and the opportunity to network with scientists at other institutions. Master of Science in Psychological Sciences The Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences offers a Master of Science in Psychological Sciences with a concentration in Industrial/Organizational Psychology. This is the scientific study of human behavior at work and the application of that science to workplace issues facing individuals, teams, and organizations. The program prepares students for employment in consulting, private practice, government, and corporations. The program emphasizes the application of psychological principles to human resource decisions and organizational behavior challenges. Students benefit from training by faculty who are internationally recognized experts in the workplace and organizations.
