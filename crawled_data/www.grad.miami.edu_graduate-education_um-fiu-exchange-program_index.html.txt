Program Overview All UM Ph.D. and Ed.D. students, as well as UM masterâ€™s students admitted into the Latin American and Caribbean Center Program, have the opportunity to complete up to six graduate credits at FIU as members of an exchange program between the two institutions. The program gives students a larger selection of courses from which to choose and allows students at UM and FIU to take advantage of the educational and research opportunities at both institutions. Students can choose from any course at FIU provided the course is not already offered at UM and it is not a limited-access course or a course carrying additional fees. UM students participating in the program continue to pay UM tuition and fees for the courses they take at UM (i.e., they will only be assessed regular UM tuition and fees). Application Interested students should select the application link below to be directed to the FIU website to complete an application. Applications must be received by UM's Graduate School. Note: Students will not be recognized by the program without a completed and approved program application on file with the Graduate School. Click here to view the UM/FIU Exchange Application.
