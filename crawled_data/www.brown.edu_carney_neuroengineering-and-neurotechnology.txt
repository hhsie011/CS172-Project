The origins of neuroegineering at Brown University are in a project known as BrainGate. Building on early fundamental research in the laboratory of Carney’s Founding Director John Donoghue on how the brain controls movement, a team of researchers who transcend boundaries of fields of study has been building and testing a brain-computer interface system that promises to restore function and independence for individuals with paralysis.
