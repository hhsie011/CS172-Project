English Language Program The English Language Program, part of Yale’s commitment to internationalization, supports academic communication and the cultural and professional development of the Yale international community. Further information about this program can be found at: https://cls.yale.edu/programs/english-language-program. Visa and Immigration In order to receive a visa to study in the United States, an international student will need to show proof that he or she has sufficient funds to cover living expenses, travel expenses, tuition, and health fees for the duration of his or her academic program. While international applicants are eligible for scholarship assistance from YDS, that assistance by itself is seldom, if ever, sufficient to secure an I-20. An international student must be admitted by the Admissions Committee and must have accepted his or her admission before the application process for an I-20 can begin. Once all financial documents are received, the appropriate forms will be filled out and forwarded to Yale’s Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS), which will generate the I-20. The Financial Aid Office will forward the I-20 to the student by Federal Express, usually in May for a student to begin study in the fall term. More information about the process of applying for an I-20 and the necessary forms required may be obtained by exploring the OISS Web site at http://oiss.yale.edu/ . The Office of International Students and Scholars is located at 421 Temple Street, New Haven CT 06511; telephone 203.432.2305; e-mail oiss@yale.edu. Financial Aid Useful financial information for international student applicants. International Student Financial Aid FAQ Will I need to provide other documents? While international applicants are eligible for scholarship assistance, by itself this assistance is seldom, if ever sufficient to secure an I-20. For this reason you will need to provide documentation that you have enough funds to cover your educational and living expenses while at Yale. Documentation could be in the form of bank statements. If I am married is it possible to bring my spouse and family? Yes, if you can provide enough evidence of financial support for their well being we are able to request F-2 visas for them. You will need to provide the financial aid office with their names, dates of birth, country of birth and country of citizenship. Will I be able to work? Yes, you will be able to work on campus only by the terms of your visa. Will my spouse be able to work? No, by the terms of the F-2 visa spouses are not eligible to work on or off campus. How do I get my I-20? Once the Financial Aid Office receives all the necessary documentation, the I-20 will be requested from the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS). When the I-20 is ready, the financial aid office will send it to you via Federal Express. The I-20 is not issued more than 3 months prior to the start of the semester. What do I do when I receive my I-20? When you receive your I-20 you should make an appointment with the consulate in your country to request the visa. Canadian students may secure their visa at the boarder. Where can I get more information for International Students at Yale? The Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS) (link is external)has developed their website to include information about types of visa’s, Yale, New Haven and living in the United States.

 International Student Financial Aid FAQ 
 Will I need to provide other documents? 
 While international applicants are eligible for scholarship assistance, by itself this assistance is seldom, if ever sufficient to secure an I-20. For this reason you will need to provide documentation that you have enough funds to cover your educational and living expenses while at Yale. Documentation could be in the form of bank statements. 
 If I am married is it possible to bring my spouse and family? 
 Yes, if you can provide enough evidence of financial support for their well being we are able to request F-2 visas for them. You will need to provide the financial aid office with their names, dates of birth, country of birth and country of citizenship. 
 Will I be able to work? 
 Yes, you will be able to work on campus only by the terms of your visa. 
 Will my spouse be able to work? 
 No, by the terms of the F-2 visa spouses are not eligible to work on or off campus. 
 How do I get my I-20? 
 Once the Financial Aid Office receives all the necessary documentation, the I-20 will be requested from the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS). When the I-20 is ready, the financial aid office will send it to you via Federal Express. The I-20 is not issued more than 3 months prior to the start of the semester. 
 What do I do when I receive my I-20? 
 When you receive your I-20 you should make an appointment with the consulate in your country to request the visa. Canadian students may secure their visa at the boarder. 
 Where can I get more information for International Students at Yale? 
 The Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS) (link is external)has developed their website to include information about types of visa’s, Yale, New Haven and living in the United States.

 Non-Native English Speakers 
 All applicants who are not citizens of the United States and who are not native speakers of English must show evidence of proficiency in the English language either by attaining a satisfactory score (a minimum 7.0 band score in all areas) on the International English Language Testing System examination or by having received a degree from an accredited university or college (minimum of two full years of course work) where English is the language of instruction. For information about IELTS test dates and locations, contact IELTS International, 825 Colorado Boulevard, Suite 112, Los Angeles CA 90041; telephone 323.255.2771; fax 323.255.1261; e-mail ielts@ieltsintl.org; Web site www.ielts.org. 
 English Language Program 
 The English Language Program, part of Yale’s commitment to internationalization, supports academic communication and the cultural and professional development of the Yale international community. Further information about this program can be found at: https://cls.yale.edu/programs/english-language-program. 
 Visa and Immigration 
 In order to receive a visa to study in the United States, an international student will need to show proof that he or she has sufficient funds to cover living expenses, travel expenses, tuition, and health fees for the duration of his or her academic program. While international applicants are eligible for scholarship assistance from YDS, that assistance by itself is seldom, if ever, sufficient to secure an I-20. An international student must be admitted by the Admissions Committee and must have accepted his or her admission before the application process for an I-20 can begin. Once all financial documents are received, the appropriate forms will be filled out and forwarded to Yale’s Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS), which will generate the I-20. The Financial Aid Office will forward the I-20 to the student by Federal Express, usually in May for a student to begin study in the fall term. More information about the process of applying for an I-20 and the necessary forms required may be obtained by exploring the OISS Web site at http://oiss.yale.edu/ . 
 The Office of International Students and Scholars is located at 421 Temple Street, New Haven CT 06511; telephone 203.432.2305; e-mail oiss@yale.edu.

 International Student Financial Aid FAQ 
 Will I need to provide other documents? 
 While international applicants are eligible for scholarship assistance, by itself this assistance is seldom, if ever sufficient to secure an I-20. For this reason you will need to provide documentation that you have enough funds to cover your educational and living expenses while at Yale. Documentation could be in the form of bank statements. 
 If I am married is it possible to bring my spouse and family? 
 Yes, if you can provide enough evidence of financial support for their well being we are able to request F-2 visas for them. You will need to provide the financial aid office with their names, dates of birth, country of birth and country of citizenship. 
 Will I be able to work? 
 Yes, you will be able to work on campus only by the terms of your visa. 
 Will my spouse be able to work? 
 No, by the terms of the F-2 visa spouses are not eligible to work on or off campus. 
 How do I get my I-20? 
 Once the Financial Aid Office receives all the necessary documentation, the I-20 will be requested from the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS). When the I-20 is ready, the financial aid office will send it to you via Federal Express. The I-20 is not issued more than 3 months prior to the start of the semester. 
 What do I do when I receive my I-20? 
 When you receive your I-20 you should make an appointment with the consulate in your country to request the visa. Canadian students may secure their visa at the boarder. 
 Where can I get more information for International Students at Yale? 
 The Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS) (link is external)has developed their website to include information about types of visa’s, Yale, New Haven and living in the United States.

 Non-Native English Speakers 
 All applicants who are not citizens of the United States and who are not native speakers of English must show evidence of proficiency in the English language either by attaining a satisfactory score (a minimum 7.0 band score in all areas) on the International English Language Testing System examination or by having received a degree from an accredited university or college (minimum of two full years of course work) where English is the language of instruction. For information about IELTS test dates and locations, contact IELTS International, 825 Colorado Boulevard, Suite 112, Los Angeles CA 90041; telephone 323.255.2771; fax 323.255.1261; e-mail ielts@ieltsintl.org; Web site www.ielts.org. 
 English Language Program 
 The English Language Program, part of Yale’s commitment to internationalization, supports academic communication and the cultural and professional development of the Yale international community. Further information about this program can be found at: https://cls.yale.edu/programs/english-language-program. 
 Visa and Immigration 
 In order to receive a visa to study in the United States, an international student will need to show proof that he or she has sufficient funds to cover living expenses, travel expenses, tuition, and health fees for the duration of his or her academic program. While international applicants are eligible for scholarship assistance from YDS, that assistance by itself is seldom, if ever, sufficient to secure an I-20. An international student must be admitted by the Admissions Committee and must have accepted his or her admission before the application process for an I-20 can begin. Once all financial documents are received, the appropriate forms will be filled out and forwarded to Yale’s Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS), which will generate the I-20. The Financial Aid Office will forward the I-20 to the student by Federal Express, usually in May for a student to begin study in the fall term. More information about the process of applying for an I-20 and the necessary forms required may be obtained by exploring the OISS Web site at http://oiss.yale.edu/ . 
 The Office of International Students and Scholars is located at 421 Temple Street, New Haven CT 06511; telephone 203.432.2305; e-mail oiss@yale.edu.

 International Student Financial Aid FAQ 
 Will I need to provide other documents? 
 While international applicants are eligible for scholarship assistance, by itself this assistance is seldom, if ever sufficient to secure an I-20. For this reason you will need to provide documentation that you have enough funds to cover your educational and living expenses while at Yale. Documentation could be in the form of bank statements. 
 If I am married is it possible to bring my spouse and family? 
 Yes, if you can provide enough evidence of financial support for their well being we are able to request F-2 visas for them. You will need to provide the financial aid office with their names, dates of birth, country of birth and country of citizenship. 
 Will I be able to work? 
 Yes, you will be able to work on campus only by the terms of your visa. 
 Will my spouse be able to work? 
 No, by the terms of the F-2 visa spouses are not eligible to work on or off campus. 
 How do I get my I-20? 
 Once the Financial Aid Office receives all the necessary documentation, the I-20 will be requested from the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS).

 International Student Financial Aid FAQ 
 Will I need to provide other documents? 
 While international applicants are eligible for scholarship assistance, by itself this assistance is seldom, if ever sufficient to secure an I-20. For this reason you will need to provide documentation that you have enough funds to cover your educational and living expenses while at Yale. Documentation could be in the form of bank statements. 
 If I am married is it possible to bring my spouse and family? 
 Yes, if you can provide enough evidence of financial support for their well being we are able to request F-2 visas for them. You will need to provide the financial aid office with their names, dates of birth, country of birth and country of citizenship. 
 Will I be able to work? 
 Yes, you will be able to work on campus only by the terms of your visa. 
 Will my spouse be able to work? 
 No, by the terms of the F-2 visa spouses are not eligible to work on or off campus. 
 How do I get my I-20? 
 Once the Financial Aid Office receives all the necessary documentation, the I-20 will be requested from the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS). When the I-20 is ready, the financial aid office will send it to you via Federal Express. The I-20 is not issued more than 3 months prior to the start of the semester.

 International students are a vital part of Yale Divinity School's vibrant campus culture. The Office of Admissions and Financial Aid welcome applications from international students all around the globe. We are committed to offering support in any way we can for international students applying to the programs offered at Sterling Divinity Quadrangle.  
 See further information: Yale University Information for International Admissions Applicants 
 Non-Native English Speakers 
 All applicants who are not citizens of the United States and who are not native speakers of English must show evidence of proficiency in the English language either by attaining a satisfactory score (a minimum 7.0 band score in all areas) on the International English Language Testing System examination or by having received a degree from an accredited university or college (minimum of two full years of course work) where English is the language of instruction. For information about IELTS test dates and locations, contact IELTS International, 825 Colorado Boulevard, Suite 112, Los Angeles CA 90041; telephone 323.255.2771; fax 323.255.1261; e-mail ielts@ieltsintl.org; Web site www.ielts.org. 
 English Language Program 
 The English Language Program, part of Yale’s commitment to internationalization, supports academic communication and the cultural and professional development of the Yale international community. Further information about this program can be found at: https://cls.yale.edu/programs/english-language-program. 
 Visa and Immigration 
 In order to receive a visa to study in the United States, an international student will need to show proof that he or she has sufficient funds to cover living expenses, travel expenses, tuition, and health fees for the duration of his or her academic program. While international applicants are eligible for scholarship assistance from YDS, that assistance by itself is seldom, if ever, sufficient to secure an I-20. An international student must be admitted by the Admissions Committee and must have accepted his or her admission before the application process for an I-20 can begin. Once all financial documents are received, the appropriate forms will be filled out and forwarded to Yale’s Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS), which will generate the I-20. The Financial Aid Office will forward the I-20 to the student by Federal Express, usually in May for a student to begin study in the fall term. More information about the process of applying for an I-20 and the necessary forms required may be obtained by exploring the OISS Web site at http://oiss.yale.edu/ . 
 The Office of International Students and Scholars is located at 421 Temple Street, New Haven CT 06511; telephone 203.432.2305; e-mail oiss@yale.edu.

 International Student Financial Aid FAQ 
 Will I need to provide other documents? 
 While international applicants are eligible for scholarship assistance, by itself this assistance is seldom, if ever sufficient to secure an I-20. For this reason you will need to provide documentation that you have enough funds to cover your educational and living expenses while at Yale. Documentation could be in the form of bank statements. 
 If I am married is it possible to bring my spouse and family? 
 Yes, if you can provide enough evidence of financial support for their well being we are able to request F-2 visas for them. You will need to provide the financial aid office with their names, dates of birth, country of birth and country of citizenship. 
 Will I be able to work? 
 Yes, you will be able to work on campus only by the terms of your visa. 
 Will my spouse be able to work? 
 No, by the terms of the F-2 visa spouses are not eligible to work on or off campus. 
 How do I get my I-20? 
 Once the Financial Aid Office receives all the necessary documentation, the I-20 will be requested from the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS). When the I-20 is ready, the financial aid office will send it to you via Federal Express. The I-20 is not issued more than 3 months prior to the start of the semester. 
 What do I do when I receive my I-20? 
 When you receive your I-20 you should make an appointment with the consulate in your country to request the visa. Canadian students may secure their visa at the boarder. 
 Where can I get more information for International Students at Yale? 
 The Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS) (link is external)has developed their website to include information about types of visa’s, Yale, New Haven and living in the United States.

 See further information: Yale University Information for International Admissions Applicants 
 Non-Native English Speakers 
 All applicants who are not citizens of the United States and who are not native speakers of English must show evidence of proficiency in the English language either by attaining a satisfactory score (a minimum 7.0 band score in all areas) on the International English Language Testing System examination or by having received a degree from an accredited university or college (minimum of two full years of course work) where English is the language of instruction. For information about IELTS test dates and locations, contact IELTS International, 825 Colorado Boulevard, Suite 112, Los Angeles CA 90041; telephone 323.255.2771; fax 323.255.1261; e-mail ielts@ieltsintl.org; Web site www.ielts.org. 
 English Language Program 
 The English Language Program, part of Yale’s commitment to internationalization, supports academic communication and the cultural and professional development of the Yale international community. Further information about this program can be found at: https://cls.yale.edu/programs/english-language-program. 
 Visa and Immigration 
 In order to receive a visa to study in the United States, an international student will need to show proof that he or she has sufficient funds to cover living expenses, travel expenses, tuition, and health fees for the duration of his or her academic program. While international applicants are eligible for scholarship assistance from YDS, that assistance by itself is seldom, if ever, sufficient to secure an I-20. An international student must be admitted by the Admissions Committee and must have accepted his or her admission before the application process for an I-20 can begin. Once all financial documents are received, the appropriate forms will be filled out and forwarded to Yale’s Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS), which will generate the I-20. The Financial Aid Office will forward the I-20 to the student by Federal Express, usually in May for a student to begin study in the fall term. More information about the process of applying for an I-20 and the necessary forms required may be obtained by exploring the OISS Web site at http://oiss.yale.edu/ . 
 The Office of International Students and Scholars is located at 421 Temple Street, New Haven CT 06511; telephone 203.432.2305; e-mail oiss@yale.edu.

 International Student Financial Aid FAQ 
 Will I need to provide other documents? 
 While international applicants are eligible for scholarship assistance, by itself this assistance is seldom, if ever sufficient to secure an I-20. For this reason you will need to provide documentation that you have enough funds to cover your educational and living expenses while at Yale. Documentation could be in the form of bank statements. 
 If I am married is it possible to bring my spouse and family? 
 Yes, if you can provide enough evidence of financial support for their well being we are able to request F-2 visas for them. You will need to provide the financial aid office with their names, dates of birth, country of birth and country of citizenship. 
 Will I be able to work? 
 Yes, you will be able to work on campus only by the terms of your visa. 
 Will my spouse be able to work? 
 No, by the terms of the F-2 visa spouses are not eligible to work on or off campus. 
 How do I get my I-20? 
 Once the Financial Aid Office receives all the necessary documentation, the I-20 will be requested from the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS). When the I-20 is ready, the financial aid office will send it to you via Federal Express. The I-20 is not issued more than 3 months prior to the start of the semester. 
 What do I do when I receive my I-20? 
 When you receive your I-20 you should make an appointment with the consulate in your country to request the visa. Canadian students may secure their visa at the boarder. 
 Where can I get more information for International Students at Yale? 
 The Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS) (link is external)has developed their website to include information about types of visa’s, Yale, New Haven and living in the United States.

 Non-Native English Speakers 
 All applicants who are not citizens of the United States and who are not native speakers of English must show evidence of proficiency in the English language either by attaining a satisfactory score (a minimum 7.0 band score in all areas) on the International English Language Testing System examination or by having received a degree from an accredited university or college (minimum of two full years of course work) where English is the language of instruction. For information about IELTS test dates and locations, contact IELTS International, 825 Colorado Boulevard, Suite 112, Los Angeles CA 90041; telephone 323.255.2771; fax 323.255.1261; e-mail ielts@ieltsintl.org; Web site www.ielts.org. 
 English Language Program 
 The English Language Program, part of Yale’s commitment to internationalization, supports academic communication and the cultural and professional development of the Yale international community. Further information about this program can be found at: https://cls.yale.edu/programs/english-language-program. 
 Visa and Immigration 
 In order to receive a visa to study in the United States, an international student will need to show proof that he or she has sufficient funds to cover living expenses, travel expenses, tuition, and health fees for the duration of his or her academic program. While international applicants are eligible for scholarship assistance from YDS, that assistance by itself is seldom, if ever, sufficient to secure an I-20. An international student must be admitted by the Admissions Committee and must have accepted his or her admission before the application process for an I-20 can begin. Once all financial documents are received, the appropriate forms will be filled out and forwarded to Yale’s Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS), which will generate the I-20. The Financial Aid Office will forward the I-20 to the student by Federal Express, usually in May for a student to begin study in the fall term. More information about the process of applying for an I-20 and the necessary forms required may be obtained by exploring the OISS Web site at http://oiss.yale.edu/ . 
 The Office of International Students and Scholars is located at 421 Temple Street, New Haven CT 06511; telephone 203.432.2305; e-mail oiss@yale.edu.

 All applicants who are not citizens of the United States and who are not native speakers of English must show evidence of proficiency in the English language either by attaining a satisfactory score (a minimum 7.0 band score in all areas) on the International English Language Testing System examination or by having received a degree from an accredited university or college (minimum of two full years of course work) where English is the language of instruction. For information about IELTS test dates and locations, contact IELTS International, 825 Colorado Boulevard, Suite 112, Los Angeles CA 90041; telephone 323.255.2771; fax 323.255.1261; e-mail ielts@ieltsintl.org; Web site www.ielts.org. 
 English Language Program 
 The English Language Program, part of Yale’s commitment to internationalization, supports academic communication and the cultural and professional development of the Yale international community. Further information about this program can be found at: https://cls.yale.edu/programs/english-language-program. 
 Visa and Immigration 
 In order to receive a visa to study in the United States, an international student will need to show proof that he or she has sufficient funds to cover living expenses, travel expenses, tuition, and health fees for the duration of his or her academic program. While international applicants are eligible for scholarship assistance from YDS, that assistance by itself is seldom, if ever, sufficient to secure an I-20. An international student must be admitted by the Admissions Committee and must have accepted his or her admission before the application process for an I-20 can begin. Once all financial documents are received, the appropriate forms will be filled out and forwarded to Yale’s Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS), which will generate the I-20. The Financial Aid Office will forward the I-20 to the student by Federal Express, usually in May for a student to begin study in the fall term. More information about the process of applying for an I-20 and the necessary forms required may be obtained by exploring the OISS Web site at http://oiss.yale.edu/ . 
 The Office of International Students and Scholars is located at 421 Temple Street, New Haven CT 06511; telephone 203.432.2305; e-mail oiss@yale.edu.

 International Student Financial Aid FAQ 
 Will I need to provide other documents? 
 While international applicants are eligible for scholarship assistance, by itself this assistance is seldom, if ever sufficient to secure an I-20. For this reason you will need to provide documentation that you have enough funds to cover your educational and living expenses while at Yale. Documentation could be in the form of bank statements. 
 If I am married is it possible to bring my spouse and family? 
 Yes, if you can provide enough evidence of financial support for their well being we are able to request F-2 visas for them. You will need to provide the financial aid office with their names, dates of birth, country of birth and country of citizenship. 
 Will I be able to work? 
 Yes, you will be able to work on campus only by the terms of your visa. 
 Will my spouse be able to work? 
 No, by the terms of the F-2 visa spouses are not eligible to work on or off campus. 
 How do I get my I-20? 
 Once the Financial Aid Office receives all the necessary documentation, the I-20 will be requested from the Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS). When the I-20 is ready, the financial aid office will send it to you via Federal Express. The I-20 is not issued more than 3 months prior to the start of the semester. 
 What do I do when I receive my I-20? 
 When you receive your I-20 you should make an appointment with the consulate in your country to request the visa. Canadian students may secure their visa at the boarder. 
 Where can I get more information for International Students at Yale? 
 The Office of International Students and Scholars (OISS) (link is external)has developed their website to include information about types of visa’s, Yale, New Haven and living in the United States.
