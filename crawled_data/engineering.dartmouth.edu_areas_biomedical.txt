BME Program Area Lead: Ryan Halter On This Page The Student Experience Research Lab Spotlight Coursework Graduate Degrees Undergraduate Degrees The Student Experience We are committed to offering individualized mentoring of our student's professional development toward becoming enabled, independent professionals, and to maximizing the quality our student's experience through scholarship, coursework, and community. Students are expected to propose a plan of study that supports their interests, potentially including distinctive intellectual paths unconstrained by disciplinary boundaries and enriched by interdisciplinary synergies. Most graduate study is advanced through the research thesis and disseminated through contributions to the peer-reviewed literature, presentations at professional meetings, and in some cases patents and other forms. We seek to foster stimulating and accessible intellectual communities among students and faculty interested in BME within Thayer, across Dartmouth, and among researchers and practitioners from around the US and the world. Research BME research, carried out at both Thayer and the Williamson Translational Science Building at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, addresses key challenges in the following sub-areas supported by leading faculty in their fields. These fields include: Imaging and physics Biomaterials and biomechanics Devices and diagnostics Molecular engineering Learn more Lab Spotlight Dartmouth Team Invited to Share Promising Findings in Radiation Oncology at National Conference The American Society for Radiation Oncology invited a research team from NCCC that includes Dartmouth Engineering students and faculty to present their abstract "Imaging Radiotherapy-Induced Cherenkov Emission in Color." Learn more Coursework Individualized plans of study are developed by students with their faculty mentors pursuant to gaining both a broad understanding of science and engineering relevant to BME, and also depth in one or more technical areas within the student's focus area. Technical depth is addressed through courses often relevant to the research areas listed above. Graduate Degrees Students interested in obtaining a PhD, MS, or MEng focused on BME are encouraged to contact faculty lead Ryan Halter or other individual faculty in their areas of interest. Applicants are also invited to visit campus and meet with engineering students and faculty. PhD MS MEng Undergraduate Degrees Students interested in the AB/BE, or Dual-Degree program with a focus on BME are encouraged to contact Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education Doug Van Citters. Applicants are also invited to visit campus and meet with engineering students and faculty.
