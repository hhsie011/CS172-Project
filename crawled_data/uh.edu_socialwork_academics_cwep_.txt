CWEP provides MSW students who want to pursue a child welfare career a stipend so that their tuition, books, and some miscellaneous costs of studying in the Master of Social Work (MSW) program can be covered. Also included are child welfare-oriented classes and field internships, special seminars and workshops focused on child welfare issues to enhance the educational experience, staff assistance to give focused advising and field internship support, and employment in Children's Protective Services (CPS) after graduation with rewarding opportunities to improve the lives of children and families. In addition, we offer child welfare resources through the National Title IV-E Website and the Child and Family Journal of Innovative Practice and Research that is published once or twice a semester. Faculty with child welfare experiences are instructors of required courses that aim to prepare MSW students for obtaining successful skills working with children and their families.
