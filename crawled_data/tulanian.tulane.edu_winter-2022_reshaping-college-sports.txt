In August 2021, Dannen was one of four athletics directors named to the committee by the NCAA Board of Governors, along with 19 other college presidents, conference commissioners and student-athletes. The committee is being led by former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, also a former president of Texas A&M. The goal of the committee, according to the board, is to “propose dramatic changes to the NCAA constitution to reimagine aspects of college sports so the Association can more effectively meet the needs of current and future college athletes.” “The last time there was a constitution committee was in the 1980s,” Dannen said. “It’s a rare committee and, in some ways, it’s about as substantive as you’ll ever have in terms of involvement at the NCAA level. It’s reimagining and reinventing the entire intercollegiate athletic enterprise.” Topics expected to be addressed include regulation of the laws that now allow athletes to earn money from use of their “name, image and likeness” and the NCAA v Alston case in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that NCAA restrictions on the amount schools pay for education-related expenses of student-athletes violated antitrust laws. Other issues include budget inequities between small and large schools and a possible new governance model that would enable small universities and those without football programs to operate successfully. “Right now, we’re all under the same governance umbrella,” Dannen said. He began meeting with the committee in September, and a vote on the committee’s recommendations by the Board of Governors is expected in January. “I’m not at the table to solely rep–resent the interests of Tulane, but rather the greater interests of intercollegiate athletics as a whole. That said, I’m proud Tulane has a voice in how athletics will best function within higher education for years to come.” By: Barri Bronston Winter 2022 Tags athletics RECOMMENDED Dining with Healthy Gusto Adding Life to Years Impression: Debra Houry Visit Tulane.edu © 2021 Tulane University Current Issue Issue Archives About Staff & Contributors Subscribe to Tulanian Give to Tulane Contact Search Follow Tulane on Social #Tulanian Search Winter 2022 Fall 2021 Spring 2021 Fall 2020 December 2019 September 2019 March 2019 December 2018 September 2018 June 2018 March 2018 December 2017 September 2017 June 2017 March 2017 December 2016 September 2016 June 2016 March 2016 December 2015 September 2015 June 2015 March 2015 December 2014 September 2014 June 2014 March 2014 December 2013 September 2013 June 2013 Winter 2013 Fall 2012 Summer 2012 Spring 2012 Winter 2012 Fall 2011 Summer 2011 Spring 2011 Winter 2011 Fall 2010 Summer 2010 Spring 2010 Winter 2010 Fall 2009 Summer 2009 Spring 2009 Winter 2009 Fall 2008 Summer 2008
