República do Chile, 100 - Centro, Rio de Janeiro - RJ, 20031-917 +55 21 2052 7447 Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econômico e Social (BNDES) The Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econômico e Social (Brazilian Development Bank - BNDES) is the main financing agent for development in Brazil. Since its foundation, in 1952, the BNDES has played a fundamental role in stimulating the expansion of industry and infrastructure in the country. Over the course of the Bank’s history, its operations have evolved in accordance with the Brazilian socio-economic challenges, and now they include support for exports, technological innovation, sustainable socio-environmental development and the modernization of public administration. The Bank offers several financial support mechanisms to Brazilian companies of all sizes as well as public administration entities, enabling investments in all economic sectors. In any supported undertaking, from the analysis phase up to the monitoring, the BNDES emphasizes three factors it considers strategic: innovation, local development and socio-environmental development. In the 21st century, the BNDES aligns its operations with the reality of a globalized world, with economies deeply connected, and intensifies its efforts to take on roles and duties that surpass the borders of Brazil, in compliance with the increase of the international insertion of the country. Today, the Bank has an office in London, one of the most important financial centers on the planet. The BNDES also finances the expansion of national companies far beyond the borders of the country and seeks to diversify the sources of its resources on the international market. In addition, the BNDES has strengthened its efforts that are already traditionally conducted, such as financing exports of Brazilian goods and services in projects carried out overseas and institutional fundraising through multilateral organizations, sharing experiences and promotion opportunities. Therefore, with its extensive knowledge, stemming from its vast experience allied with the technical capacity of its workforce, the BNDES is an important partner for investors to be able to understand and access opportunities offered by the Brazilian economy. And, after intensively supporting Brazilian growth since it was created, financing important investments for the country, the BNDES reaches a new operational level, also on a world scale, where it consolidates its role as financing agent to the economic and social development of our country.
