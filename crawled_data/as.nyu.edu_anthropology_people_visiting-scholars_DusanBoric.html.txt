I received my Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge and was a Senior Lecturer at Cardiff University in the United Kingdom until 2017, before joining Columbia University's Italian Academy to work as the PI of the NOMIS Foundation Project on migrations and mobility. Since 2021, I am a RTD-B at the Department of Environmental Biology at Sapienza University of Rome in Italy. My primary foci have been foraging and the first farming societies in the Balkans and in the eastern Mediterranean. I have written about various aspects of mortuary and corporeal symbolism, including the study of personal adornments and representational imagery, mortuary practices, social memory, and household archaeology in prehistoric periods. I am also interested in the integration of science-based methodologies and archaeological interpretation, primarily in relation to bioarchaeology, archaeothanatology, palaeodietary studies, and radiocarbon dating in conjunction with Bayesian statistical modeling. My published volumes include Archaeology and Memory (2010) and Past Bodies: Body-Centred Research in Archaeology (2008), the latter co-edited with John Robb. My most recent monograph, Deathways at Lepenski Vir: Patterns in Mortuary Practice (2016), explores the role of mortuary data in reconstructing diverse practice-based rituals and perceptions of the living and dead body throughout the Mesolithic and Neolithic use of this iconic site of European Prehistory. Methodologically, the book provides a comprehensive case for the necessity of integrating archaeological and bioarchaeological data. Most recently I acted as the lead editor for two-volume Foraging Assemblages (2021), which represents the proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on the Mesolithic in Europe with over 120 contributions. I have conducted archaeological fieldwork at a number of Palaeolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic sites in Serbia, Montenegro, and Croatia, and participated in research projects in Italy, Hungary, Romania, Turkey, and Brazil.
