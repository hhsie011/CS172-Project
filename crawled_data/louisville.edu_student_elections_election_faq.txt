Dates and times are subject to change. All in-person campaigning must follow University health protocols per SGAGER 201.5.https://louisville.edu/coronavirus/health-protocols Can student senators give endorsements? A: Per chapter 203.4 (c.) in the 2022 SGA General Election Rules, no student associated with the university in an official capacity may endorse a candidate in their official capacity. This includes Student Government Association officers. However, students who serve the university can make endorsements in their personal capacity, but per chapter 203.4 (d.) 1, must make it clear when they are making a statement or post in their personal capacity as opposed to their official capacity. I know that e-mail listservs are prohibited but my understanding is that this would not be extended to other types of mass communication (ex. Mass Texting or Mass E-mail). Just wanted to clarify that that is the case. A: The 2022 SGA General Election Rules prohibit campaigning through electronic mail distribution through a “Listserv”, EngageUofL, or a university- hosted website. The Court cannot explicitly speak to mass communication such as mass texting or mass e-mails because the rules do not clearly define this type of campaigning behavior. Any campaigning done through means of mass communication should be done with great caution and candidates should always work to comply by what guidelines are provided in the 2022 SGA General Election Rules. Undefined behavior is subject to final determination, and potentially sanction, by the Supreme Court. Is any business in Cardinal Towne off-limits? Because it’s affiliation with the university? A: The Court cannot explicitly speak to this matter as the rules do not clearly define campaigning behavior in relationship to Cardinal Towne businesses. Any campaigning done off campus should be done with great caution and candidates should always work to comply by what guidelines are provided in the 2022 SGA General Election Rules. Undefined behavior is subject to final determination, and potentially sanction, by the Supreme Court. If I plan on passing out buttons, where is that allowed or not allowed? I know not a classroom, but where else is it restricted? A: Chapter 201.2 prohibits campaigning in university-owned or affiliated residence halls, Student Government Association meetings and events, university classrooms, university libraries, and designated study areas. On election days, campaigning is also prohibited within 25 feet of a university- owned computer lab and in the Student Activities Center (SAC). Also keep in mind that per 203.3, no university entity, department, or affiliate (this includes professors and any university workers) may endorse a candidate or slate, so please do not distribute campaign material to faculty or staff. Is the SRC deemed a University classroom since classes are taught there or it is free game for campaigning? A: Any space explicitly deemed a university classroom in the SRC would be a space a candidate is prohibited from doing any campaigning. Other spaces within the SRC that may or may not be used for class purposes are not defined by the 2022 SGA General Election Rules. Any campaigning done in such areas should be done with great caution and candidates should always work to comply by what guidelines are provided in the 2022 SGA General Election Rules. Undefined behavior is subject to final determination, and potentially sanction, by the Supreme Court. Can you elaborate on rules regarding poster boards? A: The 2022 SGA General Election Rules do not specifically treat posters, but the 2022 General Election Rules do specify where campaign material is acceptable and how campaign material may be presented on approved bulletin boards. This information can be found under Chapter 201. Campaign material should also follow university provisions found in the University of Louisville Student Handbook. Please note, any campaigning done through posters should be done with caution and candidates should always work to comply by what guidelines are provided in the 2022 SGA General Election Rules. Undefined behavior is subject to final determination, and potentially sanction, by the Supreme Court. Since I am running for the College of Business, am I allowed to pass out campaign materials anywhere in the College of Business (such as the Atrium, where there are no academic classrooms?). Further, would I be allowed to stand up in a meeting or event and discuss my campaign if a class is not in session? A: Per chapter 200.1, “campaigning” means any act or omission that promotes any candidate or slate of candidates or solicits votes for any candidate or slate of candidates. Chapter 201.2 Place Restrictions explicitly prohibits campaigning in university classrooms. 201.2 also explains other place restrictions that may apply to locations within the College of Business, such as computer labs and SGA-sanctioned polling places. 201.2 does not expressly prohibit campaigning in a location like the College of Business Atrium, but please review it to make sure you are following our guidelines. Further, the rules make no distinction between a university classroom when class is in session or when a class is not in session. The Supreme Court can only direct you to Chapter 201.2 that prohibits candidates from campaigning in university classrooms. The recommendation is that you comply by what guidelines are provided in the 2022 SGA General Election Rules. Undefined behavior is subject to final determination, and potentially sanction, by the Supreme Court. Just to clarify, am I not allowed to talk about elections in my dorm hall, even if I am asked? A: Per chapter 200.1, “campaigning” means any act or omission that promotes any candidate or slate of candidates or solicits votes for any candidate or slate of candidates. Chapter 201.2 Place Restrictions explicitly prohibits campaigning in university-owned or affiliated residence halls. The rules make no distinction about “generally talking about elections” in University-owned or affiliated residence. The Supreme Court can only direct you to Chapter 201.2 that prohibits candidates from campaigning in University- owned or affiliated residences. The recommendation is that you comply by what guidelines are provided in the 2022 SGA General Election Rules. Undefined behavior is subject to final determination, and potentially sanction, by the Supreme Court. © University of Louisville Contact Privacy Statement Apply Undergraduate Transfer Graduate Dentistry Law Medicine MBA International Online Learning Jobs Donate Emergency Login Email ULink PeopleSoft HR PeopleSoft Campus Solutions PeopleSoft Financials Blackboard Business Ops CardSmart CardBox Cards Career Connection Plone Contact Privacy Statement Apply Undergraduate Transfer Graduate Dentistry Law Medicine MBA International Online Learning Campuses Belknap HSC Online Jobs Donate Emergency Login Email ULink PeopleSoft HR PeopleSoft Campus Solutions PeopleSoft Financials Blackboard Business Ops CardSmart CardBox Cards Career Connection Plone © University of Louisville
