This new revolution begins here: at The University of Cincinnati 1819 Innovation Hub. 1819 is a place of thinking, making and doing, of discovery and delivery, for the University and its community, for the city and the world beyond. It is the one-stop destination where industry meets the University’s talent. The University of Cincinnati is where next lives.
