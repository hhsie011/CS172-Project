Link Syracuse University considers you a transfer student if you earned a high school diploma/GED, enrolled in a degree program at another college or university, and completed at least 12 credit hours. If you have taken college classes without enrolling in a degree program, or will have less than 12 credits when you plan to enroll at Syracuse, you should apply as a first-year student. If you’re unsure of your status, please email transfertosu@syr.edu. Can I still apply even though the deadline has passed? Link Yes. Transfer applications are reviewed on a space-available basis. Please email orange@syr.edu and specify what program(s) you are interested in to find out if space is still available. When will I receive my credit evaluation to see which credits will transfer? Link If you are admitted to Syracuse University you will receive your credit evaluation within 2 weeks of receiving your admissions decision. Do you accept credits from my college? Link Syracuse University grants credit for courses you successfully completed at other accredited institutions. Transfer credit policies vary, depending on the Syracuse school/college to which you apply. Please email your questions related to your individual circumstances to orange@syr.edu. Can I reapply to Syracuse University? Link Yes. You will need to submit a new application. Additionally, you will need to submit your recent college transcript, if applicable. Do you have partnerships with community colleges and other institutions? Link Syracuse University has partnerships with a select number of institutions. These partnerships, which include a number of “articulation agreements,” assist in transferring coursework to comparable Syracuse programs. Can I take courses on a part-time basis? Link Yes, through the College of Professional Studies. Learn more about studying part-time at Syracuse. How old can my transfer courses be? Link There is no predetermined time limit for credits to be eligible to transfer. Syracuse University will evaluate transfer credits on an individual basis. What is the maximum number of transfer credits SU will accept? Link Syracuse University will accept up to 66 credits from a two-year college and 90 credits from a four-year institution. How many credits and what GPA do I need to be admitted? Link Your admission to Syracuse is based on many factors, not only your GPA. Students can apply as transfers regardless of the number of college credits they have already completed. Do I need to submit high school information and standardized test scores? Link Transfer students are evaluated primarily on the basis of their college-level work. If you have completed fewer than 30 credits of college-level academic coursework, you must also submit an official copy of your high school transcript along with the results of your SAT or ACT examinations. When should I apply? Link Transfer students applying for the fall semester should submit their completed application by July 1. However, we encourage you to submit your application as soon as possible, as admission notification begins late February. Transfer students applying for the spring semester are encouraged to submit their completed application by November 15. Applications received after these dates will be considered on a space-available basis. Are there merit scholarships available for transfer students? Link Transfer students who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents are eligible for merit scholarships. Syracuse University offers merit scholarships up to $10,000 for transfer students. Students are automatically considered for these scholarships when their application is reviewed by the Admissions Selection Committee. Merit-based scholarships are available to all qualified applicants and members of Phi Beta Kappa. Does Syracuse University provide housing for transfer students? Link Housing is available, but not guaranteed for transfer students who submit their application in a timely manner. Transfer students also have the opportunity to live together in one of our residence halls as part of the Interest Housing Program, an option of the learning communities at Syracuse University. If you have completed fewer than 40 credits, you are welcome to apply to reside in University housing unless you have a family (spouse/children) or plan to commute from the permanent home of your immediate family (parents/guardians). Housing for transfer students is located within the South Campus Skyhalls and on a space-available basis. Can I earn a second bachelor's degree? Link On a case-by-case basis, students may be able to earn a second bachelor’s degree. Please email orange@syr.edu for more information. How can I submit additional forms/information separate from the Common Application? Link Additional materials can be sent to orange@syr.edu or mailed to our Undergraduate Admissions Processing Center.
