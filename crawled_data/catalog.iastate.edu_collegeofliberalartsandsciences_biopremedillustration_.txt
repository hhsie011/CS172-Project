Based on the theme of Communicating Science Through Art, the major prepares students for careers in biological visualization/illustration or for graduate education in medical visualization/illustration. Graduates enter fields such as biocommunications, environmental display design, freelance illustration, UX/UI and museum display design, creative technologies, instructional design, and various careers in the publishing, research and education, and visual communication industries. Student Learning Outcomes Throughout its over 35-year existence, the underlying philosophy of BPM I has been to emphasize both art and science; students take approximately equal credit hours in the two major areas. Another important guiding principle has been visual thinking and problem-solving, and a third is maintaining student proficiency in a wide range of visual communication methods and technologies so they have the skill to choose the most effective tools for a given communication objective. Upon completion of the BPM I Program, graduates will: implement effective academic research methods and concept development processes for producing meaningful educational visual solutions demonstrate advanced science knowledge in a science focus area of choice (for example, pre-medical, or non-medical areas of life and earth science) demonstrate the ability to deconstruct and visualize complex science in order to create accessible, accurate, aesthetic, and meaningful visual representations, including diagrammatic, realistic, and symbolic, for a range of outputs (print, modeled, online, mobile) implement interdisciplinary thinking in team-based and independent projects flexibly adapt to new technology and communication challenges showcase and analyze works by articulating key visual elements in formal presentations, in written and oral format, and during assessments and critiques demonstrate effective use of design principles, problem solving skills, and visual organization demonstrate career-readiness and professional practice competencies exhibit an academic trajectory for engaging in life-long learning Entrance Requirements Entrance into the BPM I program is by application to the BPM I Advisory Committee. Eligibility is based on an academic standard of at least 2.00 cumulative GPA on 30 credits of university level work and a consideration of artistic ability as demonstrated through submission of a portfolio of representative drawings or other art work. Freshman and transfer students usually declare pre-BPM I as their major while satisfying the conditions for entrance into the major, although other majors can be declared.
