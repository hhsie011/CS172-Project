Coronavírus no Rio de Janeiro Events Past Event Favela em quarentena? Coronavírus no Rio de Janeiro Share Add to Calendar: Google Yahoo April 29, 2020 6:00 PM O Coronavírus chegou nas favelas. E como será a quarentena para esses moradores? Além da preocupação com a saúde, a quarentena põe em risco a renda de moradores de favelas brasileiras. 72% dos moradores disseram não ter renda nenhuma caso percam a fonte de sustento (levantamento foi feito pelo Data Favela com 1.142 entrevistas em 262 favelas de todos os estados do Brasil). Para tratar desse assunto, o Columbia Global Centers está promovendo um webinar no dia 29 de abril às 18 horas (BRT). Essa é uma parceria entre o Museu Sankofa, o Observatório de Favelas e a Columbia University. Entre os palestrantes teremos Ana Paulina Lee, Assistant Professor of Latin American and Iberian Cultures, Aruan Braga do Observatório de Favelas e representantes do Museu Sankofa. Veja abaixo alguns dos pontos que serão abordados: O impacto do Coronavírus na Rocinha e no Complexo da Maré Impacto no dia a dia – a possibilidade de quarentena para os moradores Quando perceberem que o coronavirus ia causar uma crise global? Como ativaram suas redes para combater a propagação do vírus? Quais são algumas maneiras em que o Sankofa e Observatório tem se preparado para combater os efeitos do vírus? Há eventos comparáveis (no contexto da história da Rocinha/Maré) com o que está acontecendo nesse momento? > Esse webinar será em português sem tradução simultânea > Após o webinar, você poderá assistir a esse e outros webinars que já realizamos no nossa canal do YouTube. > Não esqueça de se registrar no botão abaixo!
