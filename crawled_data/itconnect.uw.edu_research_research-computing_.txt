Contact UW-IT About UW-IT Research Computing Accelerating your research at the UW UW Information Technology collaborates with partners across the University to support world-class research with up-to-date tools and resources capable of handling your research needs. We offer a wide array of research computing tools and solutions and provide consultation to help you choose a service tailored to your research needs. We offer: One-on-one consultation Whether you’re a faculty researcher or a student, we offer expert computing advice to keep your research computing work on track. We can help you find the best computing solution for your research needs, including supercomputers or volunteer or commercial cloud systems. Email us at help@uw.edu with “research computing” on the subject line. Hyak, the UW’s own Supercomputer UW-IT operates the on-site Hyak shared, high performance supercomputer cluster, capable of handling a broad range of workloads, from traditional high performance computing to emerging Big Data problems and everything in between. Cloud computing for research UW-IT works with several commercial vendors, including Microsoft, Amazon and Google, to match your research to the best cloud solution. In Partnership with the eScience Institute, UW-IT consultants can help you evaluate the cloud as a compute and storage platform, understand costs and learning curve, and help you integrate data science tools, technologies and methods into your research. GPUs for machine learning UW-IT offers multiple ways to leverage the power of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for research computing, and in particular machine learning. Research computing experts at UW-IT can help you determine if GPU computing would benefit your research needs, and help you navigate the options to choose an option that works for you. On-site large scale storage UW-IT offers high capacity, collaboration, and archive file services so researchers have convenient, cost-effective means to secure, long-term data storage and can share data sets with collaborators quickly, on and off campus. High Speed Research Network UW-IT offers a large-capacity high performance research network supporting fast data transfers within and outside of the UW network. Students Join the UW’s Research Computing Club, meet graduate and undergraduate students interested in high-performance computing and gain access to Hyak. If you have a unique research computing need, send us a note at help@uw.edu with “research computing” on the subject line. Additional resources Cloud computing is one of many important tools in the research computing toolbox. A fuller picture is represented by the collaborative efforts of UW-IT Research Computing and the UW eScience Institute, which are working together to build a supportive community that strives to help support your research. Get started by visiting the Data Science Studio on the 6th floor of the Physics-Astronomy Building (PAB) or the eScience Institute. You’ll find consulting office hours, incubator sessions, workshops, seminars, hackathons and helpful scientists with outstanding data science skills, plus plenty of coffee.
