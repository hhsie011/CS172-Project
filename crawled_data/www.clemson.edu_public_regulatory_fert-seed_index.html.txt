The Fertilizer Regulatory Program enforces Section 46-25-10 of the SC Code of Laws pertaining to the manufacturing and selling of all commercial fertilizers in South Carolina. The Seed Certification Program serves as a third-party inspection service for crop and turfgrass varieties in order to have the highest quality seed and turf available to the marketplace. The Solar Habitat Certification program is a joint program with Clemson Extension and the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources that provides a framework to encourage the planting and maintenance of pollinator habitats at solar farms. FRCS also houses the NAISMA Weed-Free Forage Inspection Program that inspects forages and certifies as noxious weed free. Please use the tabs at the left to navigate each program.
