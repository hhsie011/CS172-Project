Affectionately dubbed “StickNet” for its resemblance to a stick figure, the StickNets collect high-resolution meteorological data. The platforms are designed to be deployed in large numbers, in a short period of time (three minutes or less), and by a small number of people. The probes are extremely versatile and can be used for numerous field studies. The original project goal was to provide a large number of surface meteorological observations from the environment near supercell thunderstorms, however the probes can quickly be adapted to collect data in the hurricane environment as well. The StickNets can be used in more benign weather conditions for studies regarding: drylines, urban wind flows, density currents, synoptic wind events, terrain induced flows, etc… The StickNet project began in the summer of 2005 with the design of two prototype systems. The original design was developed entirely by graduate students during a summer field laboratory. The two completed prototypes were tested in the spring of 2006 and modifications were made to the original platform. Construction of the first 10 probes was completed in time for the 2006 Atlantic Hurricane Season, along with the completion of the first transport trailer. Funding has been provided through several public and private sector sources. The project has been designed and implemented entirely by students from Wind Engineering and the Atmospheric Science Group.
