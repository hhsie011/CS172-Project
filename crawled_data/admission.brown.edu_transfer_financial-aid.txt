Financial Aid for Transfer Applicants Brown’s transfer admission process is need-aware, meaning that an applicant’s ability to pay for tuition, room and board is factored in when we make an admission decision. Brown’s transfer admission process is need-aware, meaning that an applicant’s ability to pay for tuition, room and board is factored in when we make an admission decision. The one exception to this policy is for U.S. military service members or veterans, who are considered on a need-blind basis. Brown guarantees to meet the full-demonstrated need (as determined by the Office of Financial Aid) of all its admitted students. If you are a transfer applicant who may need financial aid at some point during your Brown career, you must submit a financial aid application when you first apply. Admitted transfer applicants who did not apply for aid in their original transfer application are not eligible to apply for financial aid at any point later in their time at Brown.
