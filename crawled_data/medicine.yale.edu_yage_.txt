In fact, the number of people that will surpass 80 years of age is expected to triple in coming decades. However, with aging comes an exceptionally heightened risk for disability and disease, often with multiple pathogenic or degenerative processes occurring simultaneously. Without large-scale planning and research-based interventions, our aging society will endure potentially intractable healthcare and socioeconomic challenges. This situation is often referred to as the “Silver Tsunami.” The Yale Center for Research on Aging (Y-Age) is a growing interdisciplinary research program in Geroscience and the Biology of Aging with significant opportunities for program growth in the stimulating and interactive Yale environment. The research activities of Y-Age are focused on increasing our scientific understand of the molecular mechanisms that control aging, and translating those discoveries into interventions to promote healthy aging and to combat common age-related diseases and pathology. The Center, housed primarily in the Department of Pathology, has strong ties with the Pathology Cancer Biology Program, the Pathology Center of Epigenetics and Biomarker, and other Yale School of Medicine Departments and Centers, including The Yale Pepper Older Americans Independence Center and the Yale Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center.
