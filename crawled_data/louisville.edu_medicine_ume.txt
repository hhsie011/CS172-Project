As Vice Dean of Undergraduate Medical Education, I oversee the medical student experience from application through graduation.

Our mission is to recruit, educate, and develop the physicians needed to improve the health of our community, and to serve our community as we train physicians for 21st century practice. Students come to UofL to experience diverse classroom, clinical, and community settings during their medical training, and gain an appreciation for the city and the region through involvement in our local and state community during their education. We welcome applicants, students, and visitors to learn more about our work to provide Kentucky with the talented, compassionate, and knowledgeable physicians needed to improve the health of our commonwealth now and in the future!
