The endowment provides financial support to the College, including The Geisel School of Medicine, the Thayer School of Engineering, the Tuck School of Business, and the Guarini School of Graduate and Advanced Studies. The investment and spending policies of the endowment are designed to balance the needs of current Dartmouth students with the needs of future generations of Dartmouth students. Earning long term returns that maintain the inflation adjusted purchasing power of the endowment underpins this concept of intergenerational equity. The Dartmouth Investment Office recommends policies, strategies and hires and monitors external managers. The asset allocation policy for the endowment is widely diversified across different asset classes to enhance total return while avoiding undue risk from concentration in any single asset class or investment style.
