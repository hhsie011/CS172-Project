We would never think that pouring any amount of water onto a human corpse would somehow cause it to spring back to life. But that is not the case for all living things, as Carl Zimmer told a captivated Zoom audience on March 30 during his talk, “Life’s Edge: The Search for What It Means to Be Alive.” Read more MAURICE PIALAT, FILM PRINTS, AND WATCHING FILMS TOGETHER Films at the Whitney hosted a double bill of Maurice Pialat’s feature début, L’enfance nue (1968, Naked Childhood), and his prize-winning short L’amour existe (1960, Love Exists) on April 2, 2022.

Read more WHY WE NEED MEDEA NOW MORE THAN EVER Feet planted in the middle of the road, a young Black woman in a sundress stands alone against a phalanx of police in Baton Rouge.

Read more MAKING SPACE FOR THE HUMANITIES Founded in 1981, the Whitney Humanities Center has long been represented by a single image that graced the second-floor lecture room at 53 Wall Street: a carving of a ship above the mantle. But that ship sailed when the Whitney moved out of 53 Wall Street and into HQ at 320 York Street, from the outskirts of campus to the center of humanities conversations and initiatives.

Read more THE STONE HEADS OF 320 YORK As you enter the new Humanities building at 320 York Street—the Humanities Quadrangle, or HQ—you might notice twelve stone heads looking down at you from the arched entrance.

Read more FROM THE QUADRANGLE I’m delighted to launch a new space on our website that we’ve named From the Quadrangle. We will be featuring interviews, unknown facts and stories about our history, and glimpses of future ventures. This space is not only about the Whitney Humanities Center—it’s about the larger comings and goings of the humanities at Yale writ large.
