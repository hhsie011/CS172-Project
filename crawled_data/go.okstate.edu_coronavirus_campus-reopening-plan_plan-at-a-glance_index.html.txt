More information Student Guidelines Faculty and Staff Guidelines Health Guidelines for the OSU Campus Community Personal Health Responsibility The following outlines expectations of all OSU students and employees while on campus. This is not only to protect your health, but the health of our entire community. Your continued support of these guidelines is appreciated. Personal Health Guidelines Face Coverings OSU encourages the use of masks indoors in public. Masks reduce the risk of being infected and possibly spreading it to others. Read the latest CDC guidelines. Under Oklahoma law (EO 2021-16 and 70 O.S. 1210.189), we are not permitted to require the use of masks in public spaces. These exceptions exist: Masks can be required in the classrooms — which are not considered public spaces while class is in session — for limited periods of time or following positive cases, on transit buses due to Department of Transportation requirements, and masks may be required in certain areas of University Health Services. COVID-19 Testing Oklahoma State University offers free COVID-19 nasal swab testing for students and employees at University Health Services (UHS) on the main Stillwater campus. The service is by appointment to OSU students and employees. The oral swab tests, which are less invasive than nasal swab tests, are administered by the OSU Center for Health Sciences under the covered driveway on the east side of UHS at 1202 W. Farm Road. To make an appointment, patients should call 405-744-7665 or login to the Patient Portal to schedule an appointment by 5 p.m. the day before they wish to be scheduled, making sure to note they are requesting testing on the Stillwater campus. Patients should bring their OSU Stillwater ID on testing day. Learn more Cleaning of University Facilities OSU Facilities Management provides touch-point cleaning and disinfecting daily in campus buildings and multiple times daily within areas of increased-use or higher risk. OSU maintains alcohol-based hand sanitizer and replacement wall-mount dispensers to refill the currently installed hand sanitizers located throughout campus. Facilities Management procures and distributes necessary cleaning supplies for individual departments. Learn more COVID-19 Dashboard OSU launched an online dashboard to track COVID-19 testing and vaccination data on the Stillwater campus during the height of the pandemic. Biweekly dashboard updates have resumed for the 2021-2022 academic year. View dashboard Campus Communications The OSU Department of Brand Management has developed a communication plan to educate and inform the campus with regards to new safety protocols in place.
