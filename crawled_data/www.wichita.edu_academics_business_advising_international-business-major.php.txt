You will take classes from various departments in the Barton School of Business as well as courses in political science, language, and culture. Part of your culture study requires you to participate in a study abroad experience in one of the three areas: Asia Pacific, Europe, or Latin America. You will also complete a minor in one or two specific business disciplines. When you graduate from this program, you might work in multinational corporations, joint venture operations, trading companies, import-export firms, banks, or a federal government.
