Members of the club are active researchers within the natural or physical sciences, and the club provides a forum for exchange of ideas across scientific disciplines. The club meets on the second Monday of each month from September through April. The program consists of a social period, dinner, and presentation of a research lecture. If you are interested in being nominated for membership of the club, you may seek nomination from current members (see Current Members, and Nomination for Membership). You may also attend meetings as the guest of a current member, or as a non-member. Copyright Information Copyright Â© Iowa State University of Science and Technology All rights reserved.
