Lindsey Tramuta is an American culture & travel journalist and podcaster based in Paris since 2006. She is a regular contributor to the New York Times, Fortune, Conde Nast Traveler, Eater, Food and Wine, Travel and Leisure, Glamour, and a host of other news and travel publications. Her first book, The New Paris: the People, Places & Ideas Fueling a Movement, was released in 2017 and was an Amazon bestseller and named one of Smithsonian Magazine's top 10 travel books of the year. Her second book, The New Parisienne: the Women & Ideas Shaping Paris, was released in summer 2020 and features more than 40 women challenging the "French Girl" trope and influencing culture, politics, and business in France and beyond. Lindsey's podcast, The New Paris podcast, continues the conversations and themes explored in both books. Lauren Collins has been a staff writer at The New Yorker since 2008. Her subjects have included Michelle Obama, Donatella Versace, Emmanuel Macron, the refugee crisis, and equal pay. Since 2015, she has been based in Paris, covering stories mainly from France. She is the author of When in French: Love in a Second Language, which the Times named as one of its 100 Notable Books of 2016. She is working on a second book, about a coup d’état perpetrated by white supremacists in Wilmington, North Carolina, in 1898, and its effects over the past hundred and twenty years. About The New Parisienne In a follow-up to the popular The New Paris, Lindsey Tramuta explores the impact that the women of Paris have had on the rapidly evolving culture of their city. The New Parisienne focuses on one of the city’s most dynamic features: its women. Lifting the veil on the mythologized Parisian woman—white, lithe, ever fashionable—Lindsey Tramuta demystifies this oversimplified archetype and recasts the women of Paris as they truly are, in all their complexity. Featuring more than 40 activists, creators, educators, visionaries, and disruptors—such as Leïla Slimani, Lauren Bastide, and Mayor Anne Hidalgo—the book reveals Paris as a blossoming cultural center of feminine power. Both the featured women and Tramuta herself offer up favorite destinations and women-owned businesses, including beloved shops, artistic venues, bistros, and more. The New Parisienne showcases “Parisianness” in all its multiplicity, highlighting those who are bucking tradition, making names for themselves, and transforming the city. Find out more. À propos de La Nouvelle Parisienne Le fantasme de la Parisienne, subtile mélange de beauté et d'élégance naturelle, captive notre imaginaire depuis des décennies, voire des siècles. Dans cet ouvrage, Lindsey Tramuta lève le voile sur ce mythe et déconstruit les stéréotypes pour nous présenter les Parisiennes telles qu'elles sont : multiples. À travers des portraits et conversations de 40 femmes dynamiques et inspirantes (Leïla Slimani, Lauren Bastide, Rokhaya Diallo, Victoire de Taillac, Anne Hidalgo, Delphine Horvilleur, Céline Pham...), elle nous révèle leurs combats et parcours de vie dans un Paris en pleine métamorphose. Si ces femmes nous font également découvrir leurs adresses favorites (boutiques, parcs, bistrots, bars à cocktails...), l'autrice s'attache à les montrer dans leur recherche d'épanouissement, leur résistance face à l'adversité, et surtout à analyser l'extraordinaire empreinte que les femmes de Paris laissent sur une ville en perpétuelle réinvention.
