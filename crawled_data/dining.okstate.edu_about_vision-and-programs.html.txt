Here's what we're already doing: Using biodegradable cups and straws Offering reusable shopping bags Implementing à la carte dining concepts to reduce waste Forecasting sales to order an appropriate amount of food OSU Sustainability Ensuring Access to Basic Needs We know having access to basic needs is crucial to our students' success while in college. That's why we partnered with the Department of Leadership and Campus Life to create Pete's Eats, an anonymous food recovery program where students can be notified of any leftover food after the close of business in three Student Union dining concepts. Pete's Eats Equipping You for the Future Our student employees get more than just a paycheck while working with us. They gain valuable work experience, knowledge and skill sets that they can use in their future careers. Want to see for yourself? We're always hiring! Employment Other Initiatives Choose Orange The Choose Orange icon identifies healthier food choices based on U.S. Dietary Guidelines. Items that qualify for this program can be found at almost every campus dining outlet. Healthy Dining Events Our Registered Dietitian offers nutrition education programming and other events to help students learn how to live a healthy, balanced lifestyle. Made In Oklahoma We partner with local vendors from the Made In Oklahoma Coalition to host free sampling events every year, and select items are available for purchase in our campus convenience stores. $skip Our People Our Vision Events Back To Top Back To Top University Dining Services Part of theDivision of Student Affairs University Dining Services 076 Student Union Oklahoma State University Stillwater, OK 74078 (map) (405) 744-4424 | dining@okstate.edu Follow US EventsWork for Us Instagram Facebook Twitter Oklahoma State University Campus & Parking MapsAll OSU InstitutionsCareers @ OSUHire OSU Grads© Oklahoma State University.
