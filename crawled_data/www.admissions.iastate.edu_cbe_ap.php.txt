Were you talented in your high school classes and believe your noggin has some college-level knowledge? Consider earning Iowa State credit by exam. Advantages of earning credit by exam: Fulfill basic education requirements with courses from a wider variety of academic areas than most students Gain an advance standing in introductory courses Accelerate your entire academic career and perhaps even graduate early Credit earned by examination is not used in figuring out grade point averages. However, it does become part of your official record and may be applied toward graduation requirements. Iowa State will allow a maximum of 60 credits of prior learning credit to satisfy a student's undergraduate degree requirements, of which no more than 32 credits may come from the credit by exam. Please note that you will at least need to have one year of residency for graduation. Transferring Credit By Exam If AP or CLEP credit is earned at any Iowa public college or university and is accompanied by at least 12 semester credits earned in residence at the sending institution, it may be transferred directly to Iowa State University. If your AP or CLEP credit is from any other college or university, your scores must be sent to the Office of Admissions, and credit will be awarded based on our requirements. Advanced Placement Exam (AP) The Advanced Placement program allows the College Board to offer national examinations for you to qualify for advanced placement or academic credit at Iowa State. These exams are administered each May. Official scores must be sent to Iowa State University directly from the College Board. For specific equivalencies, see the chart below.
