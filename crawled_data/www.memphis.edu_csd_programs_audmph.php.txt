The program is designed for students to graduate with both a Doctor of Audiology (AuD) and Master's in Public Health (MPH) within four years by choosing electives from the School of Public Health, coordinating a research project with researchers in public health, and taking some additional online courses. Public health offers a population-level perspective on healthcare issues which largely focus on promotion of health and wellness and the prevention of disease. While mainstream audiological care primarily uses a medical model approach of treating the present needs of the individual, public health approaches provide a holistic perspective that considers multiple levels of influence (individual, interpersonal, organizational, community, and policy). Incorporating public health into an audiology education provides a broader, more well-rounded approach to hearing healthcare. This program is of particular interest to highly motivated students who have interests in healthcare leadership, policy, healthcare access (including telehealth), clinical program development and evaluation, interprofessional practice, population health research, and humanitarian efforts. The School of Public Health offers a range of courses that can be selected based on each student's interest. While many MPH requirements overlap with the courses offered through the School of Communication Sciences and Disorders, some coursework is required in addition to AuD coursework. A customized degree plan will be designed to meet each enrolled students' interests and availability. Click here for more information about the dual AuD/MPH program. For additional questions, should contact Dr. Sarah Warren, Assistant Professor, School of Communication Sciences and Disorders at sarah.warren@memphis.edu or Dr. Marian Levy, Associate Dean, School of Public Health at mlevy@memphis.edu.
