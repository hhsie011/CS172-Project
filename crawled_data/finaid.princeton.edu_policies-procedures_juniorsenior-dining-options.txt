This increase of roughly $2,000 should reduce cost considerations when selecting dining options for junior and senior years. The amount of aid you receive as a junior or senior does not change, whether you choose to join an eating club, purchase a University meal plan, or eat independently. Your University bill, however, will be impacted by your dining choice. To get an idea of how your University bill will be impacted by your dining option, please use our Bill Estimator. Note that eating clubs bill independently, so club charges do not appear on the University bill.
