Additionally, the program provides learning opportunities for the campus community to elevate their knowledge on issues of migration. As a center, we understand that federal, state, and local policies magnify the roadblocks that may inhibit the ability of undocumented students to access and complete post-secondary education. Through the center’s equity and asset based approach, the Undocumented Student Program aims to cultivate an inclusive environment by validating the assets undocumented students bring with them to campus. Brief History The Undocumented Student Program, propelled by student advocacy and interest led by the Brown Immigrant Rights Coalition was created as an initiative of the U-FLi Center in the fall 2016. Activism by BIRC additionally led to a commitment from administrators to increase undocumented student support services in addition to Brown's decision to consider undocumented and DACA students as domestic applicants. Where to Start To connect with the USP, we recommend the following: Contact the staff of the U-FLi Center, Renata Mauriz or Julio Reyes, if you have any questions, are seeking additional support, or just want to connect.
