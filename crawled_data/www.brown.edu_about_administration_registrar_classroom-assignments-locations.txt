Classroom Assignments & Locations Banner Building Code Translations and Locations Classroom assignments are made based on a number of factors: Course Enrollment (actual and projected based on historical trends); physical attributes of spaces in relation to instructional requests; availability based on total number of offerings in a given time slot. While every attempt is made to match instructional requests with physical space features and layout there are often times where this cannot always occur due to enrollment demands at a given timeslot. Faculty and staff may request classroom features each fall and spring for the upcoming term. These requests are entered through the Classroom Request link on the Banner Web Menu for Faculty Services. Academic Department managers are notified when the link is available each term. Any questions about classroom assignments may be directed to the University Scheduling Office staff by emailing [email protected].
