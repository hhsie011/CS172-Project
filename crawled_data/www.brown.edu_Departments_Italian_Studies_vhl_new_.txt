See More Home: The Virtual Humanities Lab at Brown University (VHL) was created in 2004 thanks to a two-year grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The VHL builds on the work done by Brown scholars over the past 15 years in the Departments of Italian Studies, History and History of Art and Architecture, in collaboration with the Brown Scholarly Technology Group (now Center for Digital Scholarship) and scholars worldwide. Its goal is to develop digital resources for the study and teaching of Italian literature, history and culture, from the Middle Ages to the 21st-century.
