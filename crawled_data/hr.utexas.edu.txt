Contact us: 512-471-4647 or healthpoint.ohp@austin.utexas.edu to report the following: Tested positive for COVID-19 Symptoms of COVID-19 even if you have tested negative, or Been identified as a close contact of someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Faculty and staff who are asymptomatic and receive a negative test result through Proactive Community Testing (PCT) do not need to report to OHP. Reporting Process New Process for Verifications of Employment (VOE) The Work Number is live for Employment and Salary Verifications! The HRSC and Payroll no longer provide this service.
