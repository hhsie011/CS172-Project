Program Review Graduate Fellows Mentoring Award Award Winners Support for Editors Previous Recipients Responsible Conduct of Research Furthering of research is a major institutional goal of the University of Cincinnati. Research includes not only intellectual activity and exploration designed to expand knowledge and understanding, but also activities in the creative and performing arts designed to interpret and create. Such activities require responsibilities for the ethical and safe conduct of research. Individuals charged with supervision of research, as well as all individuals directly engaged in it, and collaborators of investigators outside their own units are responsible for the quality of the data generated in their own laboratories as well as the laboratories of their collaborators. Everyone shares responsibility for the physical safety and intellectual property of individuals in the responsible conduct of creative scholarship and research.
