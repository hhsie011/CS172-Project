Starting in 2002, ICAP’s global technical support work began through the University Technical Assistance Project (UTAP and UTAP-2) with funding from the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). This project provided technical and administrative assistance to the national HIV responses in Cote d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eswatini, Mozambique, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, and Zambia. The UTAP-2 project was further extended to help the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conduct HIV surveillance training more efficiently through distance education.

Furthering ICAP’s commitment to providing technical assistance, the Multicountry Columbia Antiretroviral Program (MCAP) was implemented from 2004-2012, This project rapidly expanded HIV programs by promoting early diagnosis of HIV infection, maintaining the health of people living with HIV, and preventing further transmission of HIV in the community in Kenya, Mozambique, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Cote D’Ivoire, Ethiopia, and Nigeria. To read the MCAP project reports, click here. From 2014-2020, ICAP implemented the Global Technical Assistance project – an ambitious, six-year project spanning across 24 PEPFAR and Global Fund-supported countries. Working closely with CDC, ICAP leveraged its experience as a capacity-building innovator to provide technical expertise across the spectrum of HIV technical domains and service areas. In 2020, ICAP is leading the five-year Programmatic Support Award (PSA) which is designed to provide comprehensive and cost-effective technical support that accelerates evidence-based HIV prevention and treatment program implementation and strengthens health systems in countries supported by PEPFAR. With CDC as a key technical partner, PSA is designed to fast-track local capacity to meet national HIV, PEPFAR, and UNAIDS goals. ICAP is also responding to rapidly changing efforts around COVID-19 across the world. As the pandemic evolves, ICAP is providing urgent and necessary support to our partners – including ministries of health, research organizations, large multilaterals, health care providers, and patients – in their responses to address the global health emergency and identify solutions to prevent new infections.

Building on more than 15 years of partnership between ICAP and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), PSA is designed to fast-track local capacity to meet national, PEPFAR, and UNAIDS goals. Specific approaches include designing and implementing: Innovative, effective, and comprehensive capacity-building strategies that strengthen service delivery and human resources for health High-quality and evidence-based HIV prevention, care, and treatment services for all populations (including priority and hard-to-reach groups) Customized strategic information approaches that generate data-driven evidence to improve HIV policies and programs The Global Technical Assistance Project (2014-2020) The Global Technical Assistance (GTA) Project, funded by the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) through the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), was an ambitious, six-year project comprising 62 individual projects across 24 PEPFAR and Global Fund-supported countries on four continents. Working in close collaboration with CDC, ICAP leveraged its deep expertise and experience as a technical assistance and capacity-building innovator across the spectrum of HIV technical domains and service areas, including: Pediatric and adult HIV care and treatment HIV testing HIV prevention Health systems strengthening Human resources for health Strategic information and surveillance Laboratory ICAP provided responsive and cost-effective technical assistance to ministries of health, implementing partners, and other stakeholders in partner countries to close gaps in HIV service delivery, strengthen the health workforce, and support ministries of health to collect and use strategic information to inform national policies and programs that drive progress toward HIV epidemic control.
