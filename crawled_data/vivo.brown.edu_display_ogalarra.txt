My interests are in the areas of applied health and behavioral economics, with a special focus on HIV treatment and prevention, and health systems. My research contributions have appeared in over 120 publications in health economics, public health and health services research journals. I am a tenured Associate Professor of Health Services Policy and Practice at the Brown University School of Public Health, where I also serve as Director for the Health Services Research doctoral program. I am a member of the Steering Committee for Brown University’s Population Studies and Training Center (PSTC), and an advisor to Brown University's Data Science Initiative.

Prior to Brown, I was a Researcher at the Institute for Business and Economics Research at the University of California at Berkeley, and at the Health Economics Division of the Mexican National Institute of Public Health (INSP), where I conducted research and taught for four years. I have also been a visiting professor at Boston University, Northeastern University, and at Harvard University. I worked at the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) in Ethiopia, as well as Mathematica Policy Research Inc., John Snow Inc., and Hellen Keller International; and have consulted for several international organizations including the World Bank, UNAIDS, World Health Organization, and the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. I have served as a scientific reviewer for over 30 journals; served as an Associate Editor for BMC Health Services Research; and currently I am the Health Economics Deputy Editor for the Journal of the International AIDS Society.

More Info Research Research Overview A large portion of my research uses field experiments to test the effects of conditional (and unconditional) economic incentives for health behavior change, including incentives to exercise as well as incentives to improve HIV prevention and treatment outcomes. A related area of research concerns computer-based survey experiments (including discrete choice experiments and contigent valuation methods) to inform program / intervention design and analyze participants' preferences. Another area of my research uses quasi-experimental approaches (including instrumental variables, differences-in-differences, regression discontinuity, inverse probability weighting, etc.) to analyze the impact of health systems reform and insurance expansion. My research on health systems reform has led to publications evaluating the impact of social health insurance programs (such as Seguro Popular in Mexico, the National Hospital Insurance Fund in Kenya, and Medicaid in the US) on various economic and health outcomes. Other papers have concerned modelling evaluations as well as economic efficiency research (such as cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit and cost-utility studies). Research Statement * Experimental approaches with health and behavioral economics applications (Conditional Economic Incentives) for health behavior change We are analyzing the effects of economic incentives for HIV prevention and treatment among populations at high risk. We continue exploring the potential effectiveness of economic incentives, and other behavioral economics innovations, to prevent and treat HIV and other chronic conditions in Kenya, Mexico, South Africa, Ghana and the USA. This work is funded by NIH (Fogarty International Center, NIMH, NCI, NIAID, and NICHD).

Emphasizes application of comparative models to the analysis of health and health-related systems among nations at varying levels of economic development and health care reform with particular emphasis on low- and middle-income countries. Addresses research questions related to population health and systems' performance. Case study for Fall 2020: Successful Covid-19 responses from health systems around the world. PHP 2480 Selected Topics in Global Health Economics Advanced seminar on theory and practice of health economics at the global level. Analyzes current research papers on econometric methods in the global health setting including: field experiments, instrumental variables, propensity score matching and regression discontinuity. Reviews current global health economics topics: economic incentives for providers and consumers, social health insurance, public goods and externalities. PHP2430 Analysis of Population-Based Datasets Epidemiologic, health services, and social research often conducts "secondary analysis" of existing population-based datasets. Benefits include their representative sampling frames allowing generalizability to larger populations, timeliness, and lower cost. In addition, computer technology makes it possible to link some databases providing richer sources of information. There are several technical and methodological concerns when conducting "secondary analysis." Students will download, link, and analyze several data sets to understand the advantages of these data for health policy analysis as well as understand and apply different analytic methods. Student supervision I usually supervise students with an interest in health systems research in low- and middle-income countries, strong quantitative skills and a background in economics and public health. I supervise several undergraduate, Master's, doctoral and post-doctoral students every year.
