Currently, Dr. Clair is undertaking a longitudinal study of the role of social identities (e.g., race and gender) in professional identity development processes of medical residents. She is also conducting research on identity change and career intentions of first-time pregnant professional women, as well as on how women “firsts” explain their advancement into top leadership positions. Dr. Clair has also written about and studied a number of other topics, including how individuals with invisible stigmatized identities manage those identities in the workplace, how individuals who lay off employees during downsizing events are impacted by their downsizing roles, and how organizations manage crises. Her publications have appeared in journals such as Academy of Management Journal, Academy of Management Review, Human Relations, Academy of Management Executive, and Academy of Management Learning and Education. Dr. Clair has consulted for organizations in the areas of crisis management, natural environmental management, fraud detection, and performance enhancement.
