In various regions rainfall patterns have change drastically resulting in unprecedented river flows. In the recent years many parts of Kenya have received above normal rainfall, this has resulted in flooding in various parts of the country. Some of the most affected regions are the lake basin region, Narok, lower Tana river basin and lower Nzoia river basin. In the past few months water level in Lake Vitoria have been rising submerging nearby shopping centers, homes and farm lands. In 2014 there was a rise in water level in Lake Baringo resulting in flooding in nearby homes, hotels and a school. In India, floods have become a recurrent phenomenon, causing huge loss of lives and damage to livelihood system, property, infrastructure and public utilities in several parts of the country. As the country receives 80 percent of its precipitation during monsoons (June to September), constraints like erosion of river-banks, drainage congestion, and indiscriminate encroachment of waterways lead to annual flooding in many parts To minimize the impacts of floods there is need for government to formulate and implement flood disaster risk strategic plans. The plan should identify projects and activities necessary in management of floods, it should also coordinate stakeholder activities. Mapping flood prone areas and use of satellite data in flood management is vital. To minimize impacts of floods it is also important to invest in flood early warning systems. Families living in flood prone areas are at risk of losing their livelihood, property and life. Poor families in these regions are some of the most vulnerable and require support when a flood disaster strike. To cushion victims’ governments should design and implement disaster risk financing strategies for flood risk.
