Architecture and Technology/ Fire and Emergency Management Program Fire and Emergency Management Program Overview Courses Graduate Programs Minors Faculty Oklahoma State University’s graduate program in Fire and Emergency Management Administration Program is one of the oldest programs in the nation. Students receive a superior academic experience in preparing leaders in the fire services, emergency management, emergency medical services, law enforcement, homeland security and related professions, as well as educators and researchers in these fields. Students can complete degree requirements either online as distance students or as a resident on campus. Online Graduate courses typically meet in real time. Distance students join on-campus students in lecture, discussion, and group work, utilizing state of the art classrooms designed for distance education. FEMP students are encouraged to complete at least one course on campus in Stillwater, Oklahoma. This can be accomplished during one-week courses in the summer or select traditional semesters when available. The program was established in 1996 as a Master of Arts specialization in Fire and Emergency Management within political science. In 1999, the degree changed to the Master of Science in Fire and Emergency Management Administration. The curriculum includes public policy, strategic administration and organizational management, human dimensions of disaster, leadership, and terrorism. In 2009, the Doctor of Philosophy in Fire and Emergency Management Administration was instituted. The PhD degree is designed to produce proficient and active research scholars. It emphasizes preparing talented individuals for faculty careers at major research-oriented academic institutions, but we also welcome applicants whose career interests may lean towards non-academic settings or academic institutions that stress teaching. Regardless of their post-graduation plans, all PhD students are given the same standard of preparation. After all, it takes a competent research scholar to maintain currency in the field and provide their students or employers the best, most contemporary information the discipline has to offer. Only July 1st, 2018 the Fire and Emergency Management Program moved to the College of Engineering Architecture and Technology as part of the Division of Engineering Technology. This move strengthened the relationship between the FEMP program and the other internationally known, fire-related programs at Oklahoma State University. A major component of Oklahoma State University’s land grant mission is service to community, state, and nation by preparing professionals for jobs in critical service sectors. The mission of the Fire and Emergency Management Administration Program is to prepare professionals for management positions in the critical service professions of fire and rescue, emergency management, emergency medical services, law enforcement, homeland security and related fields in both the public and private sectors. These professions are concerned with the mitigation of, preparedness for, response to, and recovery from the adverse effects of acute exposures to natural, technological, and social hazards.
