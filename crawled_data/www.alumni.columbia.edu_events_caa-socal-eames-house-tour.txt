The Eames House, also known as Case Study House No. 8, is a landmark of mid-20th century modern architecture located in Pacific Palisades. It was designed and constructed in 1949 by husband-and-wife Charles and Ray Eames to serve as their home and studio, where they lived until their deaths. Charles and Ray Eames are well-known for their contributions to furniture and industrial design, films, exhibitions, toys, and architecture. Among their most iconic pieces is the molded plywood chair, referred to as “the chair of the century”, which continues to be manufactured today. The Eames house is nestled into the hillside, driven by the Eameses’ decision to preserve the meadow and a row of eucalyptus trees. On this private exterior grounds tour, an Eames Foundation staff member will share information on the history of the Eameses, explain how the house exemplifies many of the themes of the Eameses’ work, the house's relation with nature, as well as free time to explore the grounds and ask questions.
