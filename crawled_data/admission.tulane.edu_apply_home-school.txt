Home / Apply / Home-schooled Students custom css-js - global Home-schooled Students Home-schooled students have the same application requirements as students from traditional schools. However, we do have some recommendations for the admission process based on successful home-schooled applicants who have been admitted in the past. Many admitted home-schooled students have taken advanced classes outside the homeschool environment such as dual enrollment courses at a local college. If dual enrollment college courses have been completed or are in progress, the college transcript should be sent to us along with the homeschool high school transcript. Additional letters of recommendation from one or two people who are not relatives and know the student in an academic or extracurricular capacity are strongly recommended. Admission interviews are strongly encouraged. We encourage you to contact Julie Brasseaux with any questions.
