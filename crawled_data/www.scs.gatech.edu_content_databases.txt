We are particularly known for our database-centric research and expertise at the interfaces of systems, software engineering, machine learning, security, and GIS. Our Ph.D. graduates have taken faculty positions at major universities, including Rice, Texas A&M, University of Texas-Dallas, LSU, and University of Illinois at Chicago, to name a few. Our alumni also populate research groups at Microsoft, LLNL, NCR, SAS, Rockwell Collins, Ask.com, Orbitz, IBM Brazil, and others. We enjoy close research relationships with IBM Almaden, IBM T.J. Watson Center, HP Labs, ATT and Wipro Technologies, and our major funders include NSF, NIH, CDC, IBM, Fujitsu Labs, Wipro Technologies, and Samsung.
