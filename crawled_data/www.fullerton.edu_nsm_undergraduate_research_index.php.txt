Start your exploration here and hear our students describe in their own words why Undergraduate Research has made such an impact on their time at CSUF. What is undergraduate research? Undergraduate research is a chance for you to work on an unsolved problem while developing a close mentoring relationship with a faculty member. Your project can involve working in a lab or in the field or in a classroom; it can involve computational or theoretical approaches; or it can involve a review of the literature. Why participate in undergraduate research? Undergraduate research complements your formal classroom education by providing you the opportunity to learn and practice transferable skills; find a campus home; and experience the joy of discovery. Learn transferable skills The skills you learn doing research will benefit you whether you enter the workforce or continue to an advanced degree. Investigating unsolved problems develops critical, creative, and, often, quantitative thinking. Employers seek people who can think independently, work as part of a team, and communicate complex ideas simply and clearly. Your research experience will give you a story to tell illustrating how you have learned and practiced these transferable skills. Find a campus home Cal State Fullerton has 40,000 students, many of your classes will have 50 or more students, but your research group will be smaller and feel like home. You will build a community with your peers and with your faculty mentor as you dive deeper into your subject. You will develop confidence in yourself as a scientist or mathematician by collaborating with your research group, sharing results, and listening closely to the shared experiences of those around you who are at different stages of this same journey. Experience the joy of discovery Unlike many of your other academic experiences, failure in research is expected and part of the process. We all must learn how to fail, recover, and use the lessons learned to refine the next iteration. Repeating this process changes your perspective on ignorance and failure. In research, no answer key exists; twists, turns, false starts, and unexpected findings are all part of the process. And, ultimately, will lead you to experience the joy of discovery as you contribute original knowledge to the greater mathematical and scientific communities.
