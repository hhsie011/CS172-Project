Many of these projects provide innovative solutions for our campus, as well as for our local communities and for the state, by linking the creative new ideas of students with the expertise of our faculty and staff. A living lab project may involve students, faculty, and staff working together on a research project, pilot, or campus-wide initiative on one of our campuses. Such projects work to provide information and solutions that help in achieving the UW's sustainability goals or that have value and meaning for our local community or State. Grand grant opportunities such as the Campus Sustainability Fund allow the UW community to propose and implement projects that lessen the university's environmental impact and further UW's sustainability goals. The criteria below are key considerations in developing a living lab project: Place: projects reflect a commitment to our campuses, the surrounding community, or our State Sustainability: projects strive to implement lasting change that incorporates the full spectrum of social, cultural, ecological, and economic dimensions of sustainability Real-world learning: projects link educational goals with real world needs and applications Fit: projects supports the campuses’ sustainability goals, as well as community and State interests Adaptive: projects provide information and data that serve to optimize future efforts Collaborative Action: projects engage students, faculty, and staff, as well as (when appropriate) constituents from local communities and the State Evaluation and continuous improvement: projects monitor progress and evaluate impacts Examples of living lab projects at UW: Field Projects School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences - Alaska Salmon Program - Be Boundless Feature UW Bothell North Creek Wetlands UW Seattle Campus Sustainability Fund projects Sustainability Studio course UW Farm UW Tower projects Kincade Ravine Bioswale Assessment Sustainable Stormwater Gould Hall Green Wall UW Farm Greenhouse UW Tacoma Prairie Line Trail Home Student Experience Campus Sustainability Fund Sustainability Classes EcoReps Green Seed Fund UW as Living Laboratory Living Lab Exhibit Student Groups Connect with us: TwitterFacebookInstagramYoutubeFlickr Sustainability Action Plan Newsletter Signup University of Washington Be boundless UW Facilities Jobs Accessibility Privacy Terms Employee Portal © 2022 University of Washington | Seattle, WA
