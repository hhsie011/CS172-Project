Recognized Student Groups Every Recognized Student Group must have a registered account with EMS in order to submit requests to our team. A group email address is required for a registered account. If you do not yet have a registered account or need to reset your password, a designated executive board member should come in person to the Event Management office in Lerner Hall room 704 and speak with our Student Events team who can help you arrange for an account. If you have any questions, please contact us at [email protected]. Faculty & Staff We encourage all faculty and staff who plan multiple events per year to obtain an EMS account. Having an EMS account will provide you greater visibility into the event planning process, space availability, and more. If you would like to request an EMS account, please email our team at [email protected]. Tutorials EMS offers several tutorials to help use the system: Making Reservations (complete with screenshots) Booking a Meeting (video tutorial) Help topics We Look Forward to Working With You Columbia University Event Management 2920 Broadway Lerner Hall 7th floor New York, NY, 10027 Phone: 212-854-5800 Fax: 212-854-5840 Student Events: [email protected] General Event Services: [email protected] AV/Technical Services: [email protected] Columbia University Event Management2920 Broadway, Lerner Hall 7th floor · New York, NY 10027 Phone 212-854-5800 Contact Us [email protected] Follow Us Facebook Instagram Youtube Columbia University ©2022 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close
