Overview Ph.D. Programs Masters Programs Graduate Certificates Graduate Minors Catalog Home > Graduate Programs The Graduate College Handbook outlines the general requirements for completion of a graduate degree or credential at ISU. Faculty in a major field have the responsibility for establishing educational objectives for their graduate program, including specific course requirements and research requirements appropriate to the doctoral, master's, and certificate programs in the major. These requirements may place additional responsibilities on the student, the major professor, or the student’s program of study (POS) committee beyond those listed in the Graduate College Handbook as deemed appropriate to the goals of the major program. Faculty and graduate students are active participants in the academic programs of Iowa State University. As active participants, they have a collective impact on the success of those programs and of the university in fulfilling its mission. Each graduate program is encouraged to implement a mechanism for responding to feedback from graduate students as a valuable resource for continuing improvement. Academic Program definitions Program - administrative infrastructure supporting the curriculum. Curriculum - the requirements for a major, certificate, or minor.

Some programs offer only a minor. In other programs, students may declare either a major or a minor. Programs offering a major are not required to offer a minor. A student may not major and minor in the same discipline for a single degree or across multiple degrees. To illustrate, a student earning a Ph.D. in computer science may not minor in statistics for their Ph.D. program if they are also pursuing an MS in statistics.
