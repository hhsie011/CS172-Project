View programs » Print Home  ›  Student Success  ›  Tuition & Financial Aid  ›  Financial Hardship Grant Ecampus Financial Hardship Grant Oregon State Ecampus has set aside limited funding to assist online students who are experiencing unexpected financial hardship that interferes with academic progress. This funding is being provided to help ensure that Ecampus students with demonstrated financial need are able to continue their education at OSU. While funds are available, considerations may be made for students who were previously awarded the cap for this academic year, due to additional hardship experienced by COVID-19. If you have been impacted by COVID-19 through loss of wages or caring for yourself or others, you may be eligible for this hardship grant. In your application, please describe your current financial emergency and clearly address the academic impact you are experiencing. Exceptions to eligibility criteria may be considered. If you have questions about your eligibility and would like to discuss with someone, please reach out to ecampus.assist@oregonstate.edu. Note for applicants: If you are currently eligible for Financial Aid assistance, the amount you request will be reviewed by the Office of Financial Aid to evaluate financial impact. An approved amount will be rewarded. For all students, this award must first be applied to any outstanding student account balance you may have. This aids your financial status with the university and may help avoid interruption to your ability to register in a future term. If funding from your award exceeds an amount owed, the remaining amount will be issued to you directly in the form of a check or direct deposit if you have already established this process with the university. Examples of financial hardship with an academic impact: Financial Aid has been awarded but not received and student must purchase books for upcoming term that begins soon. Extreme and unusual expenses or an event has interfered with the student earning or using regular income as planned which prevents the student from paying their student account balance and results in a registration hold that impedes the student from registering for classes in their final terms. This grant is not intended to pay off student account balances in other circumstances. Unexpected medical expenses prevent student from addressing registration holds related to an account balance and/or from purchasing materials needed to continue classes. Loss of income due to COVID-19 that prevents your ability to afford academic-related expenses. For more information, including eligibility requirements, please follow the link to the undergraduate or graduate versions of the application.
