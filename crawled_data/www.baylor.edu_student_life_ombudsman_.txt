Assistance is provided for interpersonal misunderstandings or disputes as well as to those with concerns about academic or administrative issues. Every attempt will be made to help individuals resolve concerns fairly and, if possible, informally. Services are offered independently as a supplement to existing administrative or formal grievance procedures and have no formal decision-making authority. All parties involved will be treated fairly; neither side of a dispute will be advocated. In order to assure privacy, no acknowledgement of who has used the ombuds office will be given without permission of the student. The Ombuds' Office deals with a wide range of conflicts, complaints, and disputes.
