We oversee admissions and enrollment management for our graduate programs, provide professional development opportunities for students, recognize outstanding graduate student research and teaching, and confer nearly a thousand graduate degrees per year. Roughly 80% of students study full-time, and more than 40% are pursuing doctoral degrees. Graduate students play a key role in Baylor’s research and scholarship, producing roughly 800 professional presentations and over 600 research articles per year. Over 100 research doctorates are awarded each year. More than 95% of doctoral graduates work full-time in an array of academic, research, and professional settings. Since 1951, Baylor has proudly partnered with the U.S. Military to offer graduate degrees in the health science fields. Today Baylor is home to eight “Army-Baylor” programs, including Health and Business Administration, Nursing Anesthesia, Nutrition, Occupational Therapy, Orthopaedic Physical Therapy, Physical Therapy, and Physician Assistant Studies.
