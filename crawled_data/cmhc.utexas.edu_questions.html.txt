About Individual Counseling Can I request a particular counselor based on gender identity, cultural identity/background, sexual identity, specialty area, etc.? Yes, please let the counselor know if you have particular counselor preferences when you call or come by CMHC to make an appointment. We have counselors from many different backgrounds, cultures, identities and specialty areas. Students are free to request individuals that they might be more comfortable meeting with.

The total time period required for the initial consultation or intake appointment is approximately 90 minutes, so be sure to keep this in mind when scheduling your appointment. Psychiatric Appointments are usually one hour for the first appointment (more time might be needed if additional paperwork is required) and 30 minutes for follow-up appointments.

Crisis Services - I Need to Talk to Someone Now What if I'm concerned about another person's behavior? Call the Behavioral Concerns Advice Line (BCAL) at 512-232-5050 if you are concerned about the behavior of a UT student, faculty, or staff member. Trained staff will assist you in exploring available strategies, and will also provide appropriate guidance and resource referrals. Behavior Concerns Advice Line If you have concerns regarding an individual's behavior who is not at UT, or even your own behavior, call our CMHC Crisis Line at 512-471-CALL (2255) (UT Students Only). Do many students use CMHC? Yes. In fact, it is quite common for students to come for a talk with a counselor. Being in college or graduate school entails many changes and challenges: leaving home, choosing majors, negotiating intimate relationships, and moving on when graduation approaches. It is natural for people to want to talk with someone about these complex developmental issues. And, of course, other students may have additional concerns such as depression, anxiety, eating concerns, self-esteem issues, sexuality, family illnesses, and so on. The CMHC staff is sensitive to the broad range of concerns that students have. What if I can't make a scheduled appointment? Call the front desk at 512-471-3515 as soon as possible after you become aware that you cannot come to your appointment. You can leave a message on the voicemail if you are calling outside of business hours. Please try to call at least 24 hours before your scheduled meeting. There is a $25 fee for appointments that are not cancelled by noon the day before the appointment. Will my privacy be protected? CMHC takes student privacy and confidentiality very seriously. Our records are separate from your academic records and cannot be released without your permission. See our confidentiality policy for more detailed information.

The Counseling and Mental Health Center and University Health Services do not make recommendations or offer letters of support for Emotional Support Animals (ESAs). Research regarding the use of ESAs remains inconclusive; however, if a student is interested in an ESA, we recommend seeking a mental health provider who has an interest in this field. CMHC is committed to providing UT students with excellent services, so any feedback is always welcomed.
