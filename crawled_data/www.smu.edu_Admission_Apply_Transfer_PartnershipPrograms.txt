How Credits Transfer Partnership Programs We're glad you're interested in joining our community. As part of SMU's commitment to recruiting transfer students to the University, we have established articulation agreements, a pre-admission agreement, and a reverse transfer credit agreement with several local community college districts, including Dallas College and Collin College. Equivalencies for most Texas Common Course Numbering System courses are found on the Transfer Equivalency Tool, which also allows students to build their own transfer evaluation report using completed courses and grades. Additionally, Transfer Pathway Guides for the University Curriculum and many SMU majors include TCCNS course numbers to help you choose classes that fill specific SMU degree requirements. Applying for Pre-Admission to SMU Students may apply for pre-admission status once they complete 12 hours at their community college by sending this form to the SMU Office of Admission. The form must be signed by an appropriate official (such as the Registrar or Academic Advisor) to confirm that the student meets the qualifications. See the links below to learn about these pre-admission programs.
