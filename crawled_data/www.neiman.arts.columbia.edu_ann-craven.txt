The collaboration resulted in four vibrant editions. One of the most challenging relief processes, a reduction woodcut employs a single block rather than multiple blocks to print a variety of colors. The color is printed, wood is carved away, and then the next color is printed - a process that is repeated until the edition is complete. In these prints Craven draws from her interest in nature and references imagery from earlier paintings such as Pink Miracle and Red Miracle from 2004. Craven (b. 1968) is a painter living and working in New York and Maine. She earned her BFA at the Massachusetts College of Art and her MFA at Columbia University. Craven has served as a mentor for the MFA program at Columbia’s School of the Arts. Her work has been shown in solo exhibitions in the United States and abroad since 1995.
