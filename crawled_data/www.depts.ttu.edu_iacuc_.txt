AAALAC Accreditation Texas Tech's Animal Program Receives Full Accreditation again in 2020!!! The Texas Tech Animal Program has been accredited for over two decades, but why?

Enhances scientific validity: Reliable results in scientific research involving animals depend on consistent standards and superior animal care. Accreditation engages scientists, managers, and administrators in a rigorous assessment of the animal program, ultimately resulting in better research practices and outcomes. Demonstrates accountability: Accreditation demonstrates a willingness to go above and beyond what is required by law to conduct animal research in a humane manner. It states to the university research community that we are committed to responsible animal research. Provides assurances to funding sources: Many funding sources view AAALAC accreditation as a commitment to program excellence, and as an assurance that animal use will be justified and humane and regulations will be followed.
