Students experiencing disability-related barriers they believe are preventing them from attending class in person and engaging in a meaningful learning experience during the Summer 2022 or Fall 2022 semester may contact OASID at oasid@tc.columbia.edu to discuss whether they may be eligible to receive disability-related accommodations.
