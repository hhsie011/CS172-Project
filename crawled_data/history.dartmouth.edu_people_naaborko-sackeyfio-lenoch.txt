Her first book, The Politics of Chieftaincy: Authority and Property in Colonial Ghana, 1920-1950 examines critical junctures and transformations in the history of local Ghanaian institutions during the first half of the twentieth century. The study explores larger questions of power, authority and conflict by tracing the ways in which Africans reworked local epistemologies and practices to engage with and resist powerful internal and external influences in a growing urban setting. As colonial rule intersected with grassroots politics in the colonial capital, Accra, the removal of chiefs, succession disputes, and litigation became powerful sites of conflict and disruption. Sackeyfio-Lenoch demonstrates that these sites of conflict were also innovative spaces for Accra’s residents to negotiate the sociopolitical and economic changes of the period. Disputes opened new arenas to engage in dialogue and debates around the efficacy of chieftaincy and the meaning of property and its alienation during colonial rule. Questions of decolonization, African internationalism, post-independence nationhood, and transnational/global cultural projects animate her current work. The genesis and evolution of cultural policies/projects in Ghana and across the globe during the post-independence era are central to her book manuscript in progress. The study examines the efforts of Ghanaians at home and abroad by tracing the international/transnational/ global projects of Ghanaian artists, writers/intellectuals, and cultural institutions--against the framework of failed nation building--that has figured so prominently in studies of this era. The book reframes our understanding of post-independence African nationhood by identifying spheres of generative cultural and intellectual projects tied to the colonial era but with afterlives that were far-reaching in the 1970s, 80s and early 90s within Ghana and beyond. + View more Contact Naaborko.Sackeyfio-Lenoch@Dartmouth.edu 603-646-2365 406 Carson Hall HB 6107 Department(s) Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, African and African American Studies, History Education Ph.D. University of Wisconsin-Madison M.A. University of Wisconsin-Madison B.A. Winston Salem State University Areas of Expertise 20th Century African history /Modern African history /Ghana, West Africa /Social and Political History /African Diaspora Selected Publications “Family and History Mix during a Fulbright Year: A personal and intellectual Journey in Ghana,” Perspectives Daily, (September 2021) in Perspectives on History, Newsmagazine of the American Historical Association “Connecting decolonization in Africa and the US Civil Rights Movement,” World History Project, Bill Gates Foundation, (Summer 2020) “Reframing Yaa Asantewaa through the Shifting Paradigms of African Historiography,” in The Routledge Companion to Black Women’s Cultural Histories, ed.

Without inclusivity, the benefits of diversity— an increase in understanding, improvement in performance, enhanced innovation, and heightened levels of satisfaction—will not be realized. We commit to investments in both, to create a community in which difference is valued, where each individual’s identity and contributions are treated with respect, and where differences lead to a strengthened identity for all." – Dartmouth College Inclusive Excellence Action Plan; see also Arts and Sciences Inclusive Excellence Reports Main menu Dartmouth College Department of History Undergraduate Overview History FAQs for First Year and Transfer Students How to Declare a Major or Minor in History Major Modified Major Minor Transfer Credit Policy Course Descriptions First-Year Seminars Introductory Africa, Asia, Latin America & The Caribbean (AALAC) Europe (EUR) Interregional & Comparative (INTER) United States (US) Seminars & Colloquia Independent Study & Honors Course Schedule 2021-2022 Schedule 2022-2023 Schedule 2023-2024 Schedule Course Syllabi Honors Thesis Program General Timeline Guidelines for the Class of 2022 Guidelines for the Class of 2023 Honors Theses By Year Phi Alpha Theta Honors Society Prizes After Graduation Alumni Update Research Overview Faculty Research Initiatives Dartmouth History Institute Student Research Initiatives and Resources The Dartmouth Vietnam Project History Librarian Research Funding Resources Undergraduate Research Database Student Class Projects Foreign Study News & Events People My Dartmouth Students Faculty Staff Alumni Families Find it Fast A-Z Index Campus Map Directory Events News Visit Resources Dartmouth at a Glance Accessibility Administrative Offices Emergency Preparedness Careers Sexual Respect & Title IX Connect With Us Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Copyright © 2022 Trustees of Dartmouth College • Privacy • Policies • Contact • Site or Accessibility Feedback
