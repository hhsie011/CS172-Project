Throughout the years, the Academy has broadened its focus to explore groups that were targeted in the racism and xenophobia of the Nazi and Fascist regimes, and that suffered and died along with the millions of Jews. Last year, the Academy's Holocaust Remembrance topic was “Antisemitism, Hate Speech, and Social Media.” Although we don’t usually repeat a theme, we are very concerned by what’s happening now, especially antisemitism, historical negationism, and online extremism; misinformation; and the manipulation of social media to pursue neo-Nazi and neo-Fascist ideas. Thus we are expanding this crucial discussion, this year, by presenting leaders on these issues.
