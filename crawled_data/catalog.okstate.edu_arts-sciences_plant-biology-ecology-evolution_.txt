Courses Undergraduate Programs Graduate Programs Minors Faculty The field of plant biology ranges from molecules to ecosystems. The importance of plants to the ecosystem and to humanity cannot be underestimated. They regulate global processes and form complex relationships with other organisms, and have intriguing patterns of development and diversity. Plants provide medicinal compounds, shelter, fuel, food and oxygen, and support the existence of life on Earth. As human population size increases, the need for more and better supplies of food, fiber and biofuels also increases. The study of plant biology underlies the applied sciences such as agronomy, forestry, natural resource management, horticulture and plant pathology. To major in plant biology a student should have a strong interest in life sciences with a good background in chemistry and mathematics. Majors with a BS degree may choose to specialize by taking Degree Options in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics, Pre-Pharmacy, Pre-Law and Environmental Policy, and Pre-Forensics. Graduates with an option in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology are qualified to hold positions in federal and state agencies in areas such as conservation biology, habitat restoration, environmental biology and plant inspection. Graduates with an option in Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics are qualified for various research positions in private industry, such as plant biotechnology and drug development. Graduates with an option in Pre-Pharmacy will be well-prepared with all the courses required for Pharmacy School. Graduates with an option in Pre-Law and Environmental Policy will have completed the required courses for Law School. Graduates with an option in Pre-Forensics will be well-placed for further study and employment in the field of biological forensics. All majors are required to do at least one credit hour of research and faculty actively encourage undergraduate research in their labs. Several of the undergraduate courses, including Introduction to Plant Biology (PBIO 1404) have extensive in-class student-led research projects and presentation opportunities. Facilities used in undergraduate teaching include well-equipped plant physiology and ecology laboratories, environmental chambers, the 160-acre McPherson Preserve and a herbarium with over 150,000 plant specimens. Faculty members teach and do research in their specialty areas of plant biology including ecology, population biology, biodiversity, climate change, evolution, physiology, biochemistry, biophysics, taxonomy and systematics, genetics and development, genomics, and cell and molecular biology.

Prerequisites Applicants for admission must have received a baccalaureate degree from an accredited college and should have had 40 semester hours (or equivalent) in upper-division courses in the biological and physical sciences. A grade-point average of 3.00 (on a 4.00 scale) or above is required for unconditional admission. Prerequisites for graduate degrees include successful completion of courses in the two broad areas of: ecology and evolution, and cell and molecular biology. Students with an undergraduate major in biology or plant science will have completed a substantial portion of these courses; those with a less closely related major may be required to take some background courses. Final authority for each student’s plan of study resides with the student’s advisory committee. Degree Requirements Demonstrated research competence through submission and acceptance of a thesis or dissertation is required for all plant biology graduate degrees. A minimum of one semester teaching experience is required of all MS and PhD candidates. This requirement may also be satisfied by enrollment in a college teaching practicum course (GRAD 5990 Special Problems in Graduate Education). All graduate students are expected to attend and participate in all departmental seminars. The Master of Science Degree in Plant Biology Plans of study must include 30 graduate credit hours (as indicated in the Graduate Catalog). Exactly six credit hours of thesis (PBIO 5000) and two credit hours of seminar (PBIO 5850). At least 24 semester credit hours numbered 5000 or above are required. A minimum of three graduate courses must be taken. The Doctor of Philosophy Degree in Plant Biology The Department of Plant Biology, Ecology, and Evolution offers a PhD in Plant Biology. To receive the PhD in Plant Biology, students must enroll in a minimum of 70 or a total of 90 credit hours beyond the BS or 60 credit hours beyond the MS. No fewer than 36 or more than 60 hours of PBIO 6000-level are allowed in the plan of study. Two hours of seminar (PBIO 5850) must also be included in the plan of study. After a PhD candidate has completed most of the coursework, qualifying examinations are scheduled that cover major areas of the student’s plan of study and relevant subdisciplines of plant science.
