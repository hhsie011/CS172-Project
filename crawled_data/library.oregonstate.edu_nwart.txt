This law sets aside 1% of construction funds for new or remodeled state facilities for the commissioning and acquisition of public art and is aimed at improving the character and quality of state buildings in order to create an environment of distinction, enjoyment and pride for all Oregonians and visitors. With that in mind, the art selection committee invited artists to submit examples of their work. Then they worked with the Oregon Arts Commission to select pieces that would add to this uniqueness and inspire, challenge and intrigue the viewers.
