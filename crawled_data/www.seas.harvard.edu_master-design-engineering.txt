Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences that leverages the combined power of design and engineering to address the world’s toughest challenges and develop solutions that improve society. Our world faces increasingly complex, often unpredictable dilemmas of consequence to human lives and living environments, including rapid urbanization, climate change, and resource scarcity. These and other problems demand a deep and systems-level understanding of the underlying problem architecture, which in turn enables innovative, multi-faceted solutions that transcend disciplines and scales. The MDE program prepares innovators who operate both creatively and analytically, think strategically, and collaborate broadly. MDE graduates lead change and advance novel, real-world solutions.
