The Center for Relativistic Astrophysics (CRA) is part of the Georgia Tech’s School of Physics and the College of Sciences. Our mission is to provide students with an outstanding education and training and to foster a vibrant and diverse environment for transformative research and innovative thinking. CRA researchers are engaged in investigations ranging from the large scale structure in the early universe to particle interactions. In between these extremes are black holes, and mergers of compact objects. Closer to our home in the Milky Way are exoplanets and stars. Our particular strengths are multi-messenger astrophysics with neutrinos, photons and gravitational waves, and computational astrophysics. CRA researchers are active participants in major international collaborations, involved in operations and development of existing and future detectors, including the IceCube neutrino observatory, the LIGO and LISA gravitational wave observatories, X-ray observatories NuSTAR and Athena, and gamma-ray detectors VERITAS and CTA.
