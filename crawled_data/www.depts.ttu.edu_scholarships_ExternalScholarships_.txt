External Scholarship Tips A great deal of time can be spent researching external scholarships, and we encourage students to develop a focused plan to best utilize their time. Students should visit with their academic advisor regarding organizations relevant to their major focus (i.e. national organizations based on discipline) so they can develop a smart search plan. Narrowing the external scholarship search to a specific field and organization will enable students to focus on the most applicable opportunities. Most external organizations want to identify students with specific skill sets. In turn, their marketing is focused on organizations that these students would most likely be involved with.
