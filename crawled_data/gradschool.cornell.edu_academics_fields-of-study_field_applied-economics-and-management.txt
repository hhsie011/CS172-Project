Students are normally expected to obtain the M.S. or equivalent degree before entering the Ph.D. program. The Ph.D. student must take at least one minor in another field, such as Economics. The Master of Professional Studies (Agriculture) is a terminal degree for persons with experience who want additional training pertinent to their profession. If you are applying for the MPS program, your application will be reviewed on a rolling basis. Please see the program website for more information on the admissions rounds. Those interested in this field may also want to investigate the related fields listed under Economics in "Opportunities for Study" in the Graduate School Catalog.

The Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' are members of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, an alliance of six sovereign Nations with a historic and contemporary presence on this land. The Confederacy precedes the establishment of Cornell University, New York state, and the United States of America. We acknowledge the painful history of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' dispossession, and honor the ongoing connection of Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' people, past and present, to these lands and waters. This land acknowledgment has been reviewed and approved by the traditional Gayogo̱hó꞉nǫ' leadership.
