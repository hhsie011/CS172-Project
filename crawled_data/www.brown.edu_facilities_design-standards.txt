Architects, engineers, and designers are encouraged to propose innovative and cost-effective variations that meet or exceed the standards. Any deviations during design or construction must be brought to the attention of the Brown project manager for review and written approval prior to incorporation into the project. Consultant/Contractor Compliance Instructions All design consultants and contractors are expected to fully review these standards as part of their services to Brown University. At each specific applicable stage of the project (SD, DD, CD, submittal, change request, other), please print and complete the Compliance Form. For any specific sections of drawings and specifications, submittals or change requests that do NOT comply with the standards, the Waiver Request Form must be completed.
