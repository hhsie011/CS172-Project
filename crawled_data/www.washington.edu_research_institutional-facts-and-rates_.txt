Employee Fringe Benefit Rates For each dollar paid as salary or wage to an employee, the UW incurs associated costs for fringe benefits. These benefits include F.I.C.A., worker’s compensation, unemployment compensation, retirement, and health insurance. These rates change and are updated on an annual basis.

F&A costs are those costs incurred for a common or joint purpose benefiting more than one cost objective that cannot be readily assigned to a particular sponsored project. F&A costs are also referred to as “indirect costs.” Examples include: electricity, IT, depreciation on buildings, and general departmental administrative costs. The UW establishes F&A rates to be used for sponsored program activity in proposal budget preparation. These F&A rates account for the F&A costs that will be incurred to carry out the project. Review F&A Rate Agreement How to Determine the Correct F&A Rate: Follow these steps for New & Competing Supplements to determine correct F&A rate: Understand when GIM 13: Policy Circumstances determine the F&A rate and/or base. Otherwise, identify: The appropriate Activity Type. Note: When the project’s organized research activity also has a component of instruction or other sponsored activity, apply the organized research rate to the entire project. Activity Location where work will be performed If Multiple Locations exist, understand when and how to split the F&A rate Proposal Budget Periods. The correct F&A rate from the F&A Rate Table(s) based on the activity type, location(s), and budget period(s). Costs that make up the F&A Base. F&A Rate Table Use these rates for proposal preparation. The F&A rate is applied to the base amount of the project. Review GIM 13 F&A Rate guidance for information on: base calculations, activity types, locations, activity at multiple locations and more. On-Campus F&A Rates On-Campus locations budget calculations use base type Modified Total Direct Cost (MTDC) unless program announcement states otherwise.
