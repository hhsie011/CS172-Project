Learn more about our team (and find our contact information) on our ECS Student Services webpage. A-C - Ida Jamshidi D-K - Sarah Mosley L-Q - Megan Glover R-Z - John Hewitt Scheduling Students pursuing an ECS degree must be advised every semester before gaining access to register for the following term. Advising typically begins the third week of the semester and will last through the early registration period (mid-April in the spring; mid-November in the fall). When your ECS advisor is prepared to schedule your advising appointment, you will receive a link to your advisor's Navigate scheduling calendar via e-mail. The scheduling link is made available to students in order of classification (i.e. Seniors will be advised first, then juniors, sophomores, and freshmen.) All students will be given an opportunity to make an appointment before their registration date, but students are encouraged to act quickly upon receiving their link since preferred time slots may fill up fast. Advisors will have appointments available to schedule up to 2-3 weeks in advance, and more appointments will be added weekly. If you are unable to find an appointment that fits your schedule, please continue to check weekly for additional times. When scheduling, please note any questions/issues you would like to discuss with your advisor (potential major change, interest in study abroad, academic support needs, summer school plans, etc.). This will help your advisor be as prepared as possible for your advising appointment. Preparing Beginning Fall 2021, the ECS Undergraduate Programs Office will return to conducting in-person advising appointments. If you are unable to meet in person due to illness, you may contact your assigned advisor to ask if a virtual appointment will be possible. All students will be required to submit a Pre-Advising Form at least 24 hours in advance of their scheduled appointment. A link to this form will be included in the appointment confirmation e-mail. Advising appointments will take place in Cashion 307. Please check in at least 5 minutes before your scheduled appointment time, as there may be additional paperwork for you to complete before seeing your advisor. Students who arrive more than 5 minutes late may be asked to reschedule. Students who are late or a no-show for more than one appointment may not be able to schedule another advising appointment before the Early Registration Period begins. ADDITIONAL APPOINTMENTS If after meeting for academic advising, you are in need of an additional appointment, please e-mail your assigned advisor directly with a detailed description of what you would like to discuss. Due to heavy advising loads, availability for additional appointments is extremely limited. Every effort will be made to accommodate your appointment request, but students are encouraged to visit Walk-In Hours for quicker assistance. CHANGING TO AN ECS MAJOR If you are interested in declaring an ECS major, please submit a Change of Major Request Form through Bearweb (Student Academic Services > Students Records). After submitting this form, you will be contacted by the Director of Advising to discuss eligibility for your desired major. Roles and Responsibilities of Students and Advisors Effective advising in the School of Engineering & Computer Science requires a partnership between students and advisors. Role of ECS Academic Advisors Ensure that students are progressing through a fairly inflexible degree plan in a timely manner Discuss students' academic progress Encourage students to think about how their calling shapes their educational plans and career goals Assist students with planning programs and experiences consistent with their abilities and interests Discuss the relationship between academic preparation and life goals Answer questions about academic policies, procedures, and degree requirements Connect students with other areas of campus that can contribute resources and support toward student success Encourage students to make their own decisions responsibly Role of ECS Students Prepare for academic advising appointments by: Reviewing your progress on your degree plan Reviewing classes offered for the next semester Developing an initial schedule to bring to your advising appointment Check with your advisor if you stray from the courses recommended for you to ensure you are staying on track with your degree plan Becoming knowledgeable about University programs, policies, and procedures Accept final responsibility for decisions Notify advisor of any changes in academic plans (for example: pending transfer credit, credit by exam, summer school plans, change of major, pre-professional plans) Follow through on actions identified during each advising visit Participate proactively in the decision-making process Notify your advisor if it becomes necessary to cancel or reschedule advising appointments Students & Academics Student Services Career Center Student Leadership Learning Resource Center Scholarships List of ECS Scholarships Student Organizations Incoming Students Summer Accelerate Program Summer of Discovery Freshmen Fall Incoming Freshmen Equipment Requirements and Computer Recommendations Transfer Course Recommendations Entrance and Progression Standards ECS Scholars Program Academic Advising Meet with an ECS Advisor Advising Walk-in Hours Course Drops Academic Actions Certification for Graduation ECS Summer Courses Advising Resources Pre-Engineering Requirements ECS Course Repeat Policy Final Exam Policy Teal Residential College ECS ID Management ECS Scholars Program Degree Programs Flow Charts Capstone Meet Our Alumni ECS Digital Brochure ECS Student Organization Fair School of Engineering & Computer Science School of Engineering & Computer Science One Bear Place #97356 Waco, TX 76798-7356 Computer Science One Bear Place #97141 Waco, TX 76798-7141 (254) 710-3890 ECS_Student_Services@baylor.edu Apply Give Questions for Undergraduate Programs Questions for Graduate Programs General Information Colleges, Schools, Libraries & Research Admissions Administration Gateways For...
